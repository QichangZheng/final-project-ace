Fearless: Black national anthem signals NFL permanently joining BLM-LGBTQIA+ ‘Alphabet Mafia’,"Upon releasing Richard Sherman from custody Thursday evening, the presiding judge hailed the football star as a ""pillar of the community.""

Police arrested Sherman after the free agent cornerback violently tried to break into the home of his in-laws, threatened to kill himself and harm his wife, and drunkenly wrecked his Mercedes at a construction site.

Something is clearly wrong with one of Seattle's pillars. Fortunately for Sherman, he plays for the right political team. That team is going to protect Sherman at all costs.

That team is what I call the Alphabet Mafia — BLMLGBTQIA+.

The Alphabet Mafia is the new Dallas Cowboys, ""America's Team,"" the team every kid dreams about making.

If you're wondering why the NFL will play the black national anthem — ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" — before games in the coming season, it's an initiation ritual placed on the league for Alphabet Mafia membership.

As the Sherman case demonstrates, membership in the mob has its privileges. You can show early signs of O.J. Simpson disease and still be stamped as a pillar of your community. An uncle can call 911 and tell police that you threatened violence against your wife and corporate media will pretend the call never took place.



Let's say Patriots coach Bill Belichick, a friend of Donald Trump, had been accused of the actions attributed to Richard Sherman, would a judge label Belichick a pillar of the Boston community? Would the judge be skewered for giving Belichick ""white privilege""?

Yesterday, it was reported the NFL will make the black national anthem standard procedure at its pregame activities. It was also reported that social justice messages will return on the backs of helmets and throughout the stadiums.

The news surprised some sports fans. Even the super-woke NBA backed away from its social justice messaging this season. The words Black Lives Matter were stripped from the court. This past NBA season felt halfway normal. The games no longer felt like ESPN's Maria Taylor was wagging a finger of blame as you watched.

Sports fans wrongly assumed the NFL would make the same pivot to normalcy that the NBA did.

Nope. Not true. Different men have different standards to achieve made status in the Alphabet Mafia. The NFL has more hoops to jump through. It's a process.

Third-string Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib being celebrated for coming out as gay was part of the process. The NFL's social media campaign promoting the league as gay, transgender, non-binary, and Winnie the Pooh was part of the process. So was pretending that women's soccer player Carli Lloyd could kick in the NFL. And so was the Super Bowl commercial based on the fallacy that a little black girl received a football scholarship to play cornerback.

Embracing the black national anthem is part of the process. Continuing the pagan worship of the good Dr. Rev. George Floyd Luther III is part of the process.

At some point, the Alphabet Mafia will demand — and the league will acquiesce — that Meghan Markle be named head coach of the Los Angeles Rams.

Why does the NFL so desperately want to join the Alphabet Mafia?

Because the league has been promised, if it promotes the appropriate narrative, that corporate media will quit terrorizing its brand with false and exaggerated accusations of racism and a lack of safety. The NFL's public relations problems regarding black head coaches and head trauma will disappear.

The league has been bullied into submission. The poor and weak leadership of commissioner Roger Goodell and executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent has made pop culture's strongest force — the NFL — vulnerable.



Football is being brought into the secret society, the fraternal satanic organizations reshaping global society. Global elites cannot socially engineer the changes they want without controlling the number 1 American TV show on five different networks — CBS, Fox, ESPN, NBC, and the NFL Network.

The NFL wants to be treated like Richard Sherman, so it's going to lift its voice and sing, until China's cash registers ring.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/fearless-black-national-anthem-signals-nfl-permanently-joining-blm-lgbtqia-alphabet-mafia,2021-07-16
Fearless: Scottie Pippen’s racial assault on Phil Jackson shows we need a war on Twitter crack,"Twitter is cocaine. Silicon Valley-manufactured ""Black Twitter"" is crack cocaine.

Professional sports are experiencing a crack epidemic. The athletes, executives, and leagues are addicted to or live in fear of ""Black Twitter,"" the allegedly informal community of Twitter users and bots who portray themselves as black.

Crack Twitter, my name for Black Twitter, is the online gatekeeper of the degenerate culture Hollywood and music industry executives have defined for black people.

Cocaine damages the brain. The drug, in the worst-case scenario, causes an insatiable dopamine addiction. Lucky cocaine users can handle an occasional powder ""bump"" at parties. Unlucky users, particularly those who freebase cocaine (crack), develop schizophrenia and paranoia and fall into prolonged depression.

The clearest sign of social media crack addiction is the paranoid user who constantly rants, raves, and tweaks about racism terrorizing every aspect of his life.

Olympic hammer thrower Gwen Berry heard the national anthem playing and screamed that it was a disrespectful, racist setup. ESPN basketball analyst Jay Williams greeted the news of the Celtics hiring their sixth black head coach by hailing it as a historic first for black people.



Not to be outdone, on Monday, Williams' ESPN colleague Jalen Rose taped a rambling, do-rag-wearing, hair-greasing, hair-combing non-apology for racially smearing Kevin Love's selection to the Olympic basketball team. You should hunt down Rose's Instagram live video. It's 45 minutes of unintentional comedy. It's like watching Pookie from the movie ""New Jack City"" explain quantum physics.

But NBA legend Scottie Pippen was Monday's biggest tweaker. Pip appeared on ""The Dan Patrick Radio Show."" He accused his former coach, Phil Jackson, of racism for drawing up a game-winning shot for Toni Kukoc in a 1994 playoff game against the Knicks.

That game and that moment form the lone stain on Pippen's exemplary playing career. Pippen refused to re-enter the game because of Jackson's play call. Kukoc sank the shot with Pippen sulking on the bench. Pippen should quit drawing attention to the infamous moment he quit on his teammates.

His social media addiction won't allow it. He's now resorted to racially smearing the coach who helped him win six NBA titles.

I blame Twitter and social media. I'm not joking. Social media apps are driving the racial hysteria plaguing the country. From actor Jussie Smollett's hoax to NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace's garage-door noose to basketball star LeBron James' paranoid tweet about being afraid to walk outside, Crack Twitter is responsible for the race-bait pandemic. Twitter algorithms are constructed to release massive numbers of dopamine likes, retweets, and follows for racial accusations.

Pippen has 660,000 Twitter followers and 1.7 million Instagram followers. He feels pressure to deliver dopamine-friendly content to his 2.3 million social media followers. There's no better product than race bait. It's the coca leaf of cocaine.

Pippen, Rose, and Williams are all good dudes. They're not ill-intentioned. They don't have a legit problem with white people. They certainly don't have a problem with the fruit (women) of the white tree.

Social media hacked their brains.

Twenty years from now, America will be flooded with documentaries explaining how Silicon Valley algorithms promoted and rewarded racial conflict.

I feel sorry for these guys. They're unaware they have an addiction. I have the same addiction. Most public figures suffer from Twitter addiction, and the Crack Twitter addiction is most pronounced among black public figures. The first and most important step toward recovery is admitting you have the problem.

Once you admit the problem, then you can see how it perverts your thoughts and causes you to see every human interaction through the lens of racism. Once you admit the problem, then you can take steps to combat the problem.

Back to Pippen.

Phil Jackson likely drew up the game's final play for Kukoc because he assumed Anthony Mason, arguably the league's top defensive player at the time, would be defending Pippen. Or maybe Jackson had a gut feeling Kukoc would make the shot. Great coaches have great instincts.

I understand Pippen's frustration. The Chicago Bulls took advantage of him in contract negotiations. Pippen was having the best season of his career. It was his first time playing outside Michael Jordan's shadow. Jordan had retired to pursue baseball. And Pippen saw Kukoc as a possible down-the-road threat to his ascension as Chicago's top player.

I get it.

Phil Jackson is as flawed as every other human being. I'm sure he has his biases. But a racist? That allegation is way too damaging to just toss out willy-nilly. What baits us to do that?

Twitter. Racial demonization is the app's lifeblood.



For far too long, we've tolerated a media ecosystem that demands we all snort or freebase Twitter's cocaine. Google, the all-powerful Silicon Valley search engine, defines public figures by their Twitter feeds. Punch a public figure's name into Google, and the first or second thing that pops up is usually his or her Twitter feed.

Researchers say 20 percent of Americans use Twitter. I bet at least 95 percent of the American media use Twitter. The app has an outsized impact on defining public figures and shaping how the media present reality. The app distorts reality. Nothing has done more to create the false reality that police are executing a genocidal plot against black men than Twitter's algorithms.

Cocaine is an auditory hallucinogen. Modern athletes are high on social media. This second-wave crack epidemic is worse than the first.

We need a war on Crack Twitter.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/fearless-scottie-pippens-racial-assault-on-phil-jackson-shows-we-need-a-war-on-twitter-crack,2021-06-29
"Sha-Maria Law: ESPN sacrificed Rachel Nichols to honor George Floyd, the Alphabet Mafia, and America’s cultural insurrectionists","ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro is engaged in a prolonged war with the Taliban, commonly referred to in sports media circles as the ""BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.""

Wednesday, under the tenets of Sha-Maria Law, the Alphabet Mafia beheaded NBA broadcaster Rachel Nichols for private disobedience of identity politics guidelines. ESPN removed Nichols from its NBA coverage and canceled her show, ""The Jump."" With a year left on her contract, according to reports, Nichols will no longer appear on the Worldwide Leader in Sports.

A year ago, Nichols, a white Jewish woman, gossiped with a male member of her tribe about ESPN management handing black colleague Maria Taylor a job that had been contractually promised to Nichols. Unbeknownst to Nichols, her comments were accidently recorded by a camera in her Orlando hotel room and subsequently shared with leadership of a Taliban cell headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut.

Because Nichols made these inconsequential comments during the summer of 2020, the first holy holiday celebrating the death of career criminal St. George Floyd, the Alphabet Mafia placed a bounty on Nichols' career at ESPN. Working with Taylor, the Alphabet Mafia newspaper of record, the New York Times, smeared Nichols as a bigot, forcing Pitaro to execute Nichols.

Some critics are comparing Pitaro to U.S. President Joe Biden, saying Pitaro's submission to the sports media Taliban is analogous to Biden's catastrophic Afghanistan exit. The New York Post's influential media critic Andrew Marchand published a column Wednesday night blaming Pitaro for fumbling the Nichols-Taylor dispute.



""In the history of sports media mismanagement, the way ESPN handled Rachel Nichols' situation may not be the worst, but it can make a case,"" Marchand wrote. ""The fiasco was the result of embarrassing, indecisive management from ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro on down. More than a year ago, ESPN did not do anything of substance about Nichols' comments when they first found out about them. Nothing. Nada.""

It's a fair take. However, I disagree. I am far more sympathetic to Pitaro's plight.

Full disclosure, ESPN rehired me in 2013 to found a website dedicated to covering the intersection of sports, race, and culture. Unfortunately, my black skin did not compensate for my woke shortcomings, my faith-based conservative values, and my toxic masculinity. I was a frequent target of Deadspin's attack. ESPN fired me in 2015. Six years ago, I was Rachel Nichols, a sacrifice to the Alphabet Mafia.

Pitaro inherited the Alphabet War from his predecessor, former ESPN president John Skipper. From 2012 through 2017, Skipper surrendered complete control of the network to the terror group Deadspin and its infamous warlord Nick Denton, the Osama bin Laden of the Alphabet Mafia. In mid-2017, I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal explaining the successful insurrection Deadspin pulled off in the Disney capital of Kabul, Connecticut. Deadspin's insurrection was quite similar to the events on January 6 at the Capitol. ESPN security opened doors and welcomed insurrectionists onto its campus. Many ESPN employees worked in a clandestine manner with Deadspin Proud Boys Tommy Craggs, Tim Marchman, A.J. Daulerio, and single token Alphabet nationalist Greg Howard.

Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, used Deadspin to bully ESPN into adopting the identity politics agenda. For years, Deadspin attacked ESPN executives relentlessly, exposing embarrassing details about the sexual malfeasance of the network's executives and personalities. Fear of being a target of a Deadspin ""investigative"" story terrified ESPN leadership, especially Skipper. In 2018, Skipper was forced to resign when it became public that someone was using his cocaine addiction in an alleged extortion plot.

Skipper and ESPN's longtime head of human resources and Alphabet Mafia soldier Paul Richardson negotiated a secret peace agreement with Deadspin. The network agreed to prioritize identity above talent and merit in its on- and off-air decision-making.

In front of the camera, sexual identity, skin color, and gender drove ESPN to form the worst Monday Night Football booth in the history of the iconic show, pairing legendary NFL coach Jon Gruden with solid baseball play-by-play man Sean McDonough and talented sideline reporter Lisa Salters. During the broadcast of FOOTBALL games, Gruden and McDonough routinely expressed horror at the level of violence displayed.

Behind the camera, sexual identity, skin color, and gender led the network to elevate female executives to supervising positions over studio shows, which led to no-impact, mostly attractive female broadcasters landing high-priced hosting jobs on nearly every studio show. Skipper gave huge contracts to Michelle Beadle, Cari Champion, Jemele Hill, Katie Nolan, Samantha Ponder, etc.

If you want to understand why Maria Taylor balked at a raise from $1 million to $5 million and left for NBC, you have to understand the culture Skipper, Richardson, and Deadspin created at ESPN. Taylor was radicalized by Taliban culture early in her career. She is quite talented. But ESPN raised her to feel entitled. Her black skin qualified her for reparations.

Nichols is talented, too. She's also accomplished as a journalist. She worked as a legit journalist at the Washington Post for eight years. Not Jeff Bezos' Washington Post. Nichols worked for the Graham family's Washington Post. Nichols fought her way to the top of sports media with hard work and cunning politics. She earned it. Yes, Nichols played woke to survive and thrive within corporate media. But she did not deserve this embarrassing public execution. She did not deserve the New York Times hit piece insinuating racism, nor the savage and irresponsible tweets about her personal life.

She whined to a friend that identity politics stole an opportunity she earned. Who wouldn't do that? Who hasn't done that?

Nichols and Pitaro are victims of a strategy Skipper and Richardson implemented a decade ago. Pitaro replaced Skipper in 2018 and immediately declared war on the sports media Taliban. Pitaro demanded that ESPN sportscasters talk about sports rather than Twitter-approved political talking points. He bought out Michelle Beadle's $5 million-a-year contract when she could no longer hide her utter disdain for football, the primary ratings driver for all of sports television. Pitaro bought out Jemele Hill when she chose sophomoric political commentary over sophomoric sports commentary. Pitaro declined to participate in the sports media fantasy that a cute Boston bartender, Katie Nolan, was the future of sports television.

Pitaro and ESPN executive vice president Norby Williamson were having great success smoking insurrectionists out of their Bristol caves. Everything changed in the summer of 2020. That's when a Minneapolis police officer assisted fentanyl activist St. George Floyd in the destruction of his life. In terms of cultural change, Derek Chauvin's knee was more powerful than Colin Kaepernick's.

It resurrected the Taliban, aka the Alphabet Mafia.



Insurrectionists in sports media and across American culture glorified St. George Floyd so they could use him to seize power and exact revenge on the infidels who stray from or don't adhere to the politics of identity.

What we've seen play out at ESPN over the past decade mirrors the rest of American society. Those of you applauding the death of Rachel Nichols, including those of you with black skin, will be the next victim of Sha-Maria Law.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/sha-maria-law-espn-sacrificed-rachel-nichols-to-honor-george-floyd-the-alphabet-mafia-and-americas-cultural-insurrectionists,2021-08-26
"Squires: When it comes to abortion, the 'Two Kings Paradox' explains why so many black preachers sound like atheists","A strange phenomenon has emerged in the weeks since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Prominent black preachers across the country have taken to their pulpits to argue that our democracy is under assault because sending the issue of abortion back to the states is an attack on the human rights of American women.

I have viewed countless videos — courtesy of the Twitter account Woke Preacher Clips — of black clergymen making this claim, including William Barber II, Jamal Bryant, and gospel singer William Murphy. Pastor Howard-John Wesley even donned an “I’m With Her” shirt and scolded pro-life Christians who didn’t attend Black Lives Matter protests. Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the chorus of black leaders promoting abortion as a moral good when she recently told the NAACP’s 113th convention that support for it is consistent with religious faith.

Much has been made about white evangelical support for President Trump, but the sharp political divides between black and white Christians are much bigger than one man.

Black and white evangelicals today – as well as their secular ideological kinsmen – exhibit different behavior at the ballot box because they have vastly different theological perspectives on the authority, purpose, and power of the government.

I call this phenomenon the “Two Kings Paradox.”

Broadly speaking, black pro-abortion evangelicals see the government as analogous to King David. They see liberal federal and state power as the means to free God’s people, black voters, from the terror of Goliath – the imposing amalgamation of white supremacy, systemic racism, poverty, and mass incarceration. Black preachers in this scenario see themselves in the role of the prophet Samuel. Their job is to call King David to repent for his historical abuse of power and encourage him to use his might for the benefit of the people. These preachers also inform their congregations that voting is the “big rock” in their bag that can be used to aid in Goliath’s downfall. To the extent that they feel persecuted, the black pro-abortion evangelicals today view that opposition as a function of their race, not faith.

White evangelicals today, generally speaking, have a different ruler in mind when they think about the relationship between Christians and their government. While they believe civil government is an institution created by God, they see themselves much like the early New Testament Christians living under pagan Roman rule.

Christian historians believe the emperor Nero persecuted Christians and executed the apostles Paul and Peter. In contemporary terms, white evangelicals see the government and cultural institutions as challengers to God’s definitions, institutions (e.g., family, church), and position as the highest authority in heaven or on earth. To the extent that they feel attacked, the average pro-life white evangelical today views that opposition fueled mainly by their faith, which the broader culture often conflates with their race.

It is impossible to deny the role race and racism have historically played in American religious life. In previous generations, the federal government did play the role of rescuer for black citizens trapped under the weight of Jim Crow segregation. The Two Kings Paradox is not an attempt to whitewash the past. It is an explanation of why social conservative black Christians today support a party whose leaders' highest priorities are “reproductive justice,” LGBTQIA+ issues, and climate change.

The issue of abortion has been a bright red line running down the middle of our two-party system for decades. American culture post-Roe is going to show why that was only the beginning. The current administration believes that counseling gender-confused children to accept their bodies as they were created is “conversion therapy” but puberty blocking hormones, mastectomies, and genital mutilation constitute “gender-affirming care.”

No amount of deflection to Donald Trump’s personal failings or political shortcomings can justify such evil. Urbane Ivy League graduates who think men can get pregnant and want to legalize abortion up until birth are creating Franken-kids by giving teenage girls double mastectomies and removing the testicles of teenage boys.

Introducing “Generation F,” courtesy of the ""Build Back Butchers.""

The Biden administration proudly flies the Pride flag in the White House and on federal government buildings. The Trump administration banned BLM and Pride flags at foreign embassies. Only one of those banners has returned under the current administration. Today’s Democrats speak the language of Selma with their lips but have the spirit of Stonewall bound in their hearts.

Black Democrats are some of the biggest supporters of Planned Parenthood, even though its founder saw poor black women as unfit for procreation. Margaret Sanger opened her first birth control clinic in Brooklyn and to this day in New York City – which has the largest black population in the country– the number of black babies born and aborted have been roughly the same.

Learning about Sanger’s support of eugenics clearly has not made black voters abandon the party of abortion on demand. There is no reason the same capacity to acknowledge historical injustice while adjusting to contemporary realities can’t be applied to the sins of America’s religious past.

I respect the traditions and historical significance of the black church in America. Many are still preaching the good news of Jesus Christ and calling sinners to repentance. Unfortunately, many others have abandoned that responsibility. The “I’m with her” black preachers use their time, energy, and resources to disciple white people. They blame white people in the suburbs of Indiana for black men killing each other in Chicago.

They claim that the hospital room is too small for a woman, her doctor, and the government. Apparently, it’s also too small for the child’s father because none of their “womb-to-tomb” or “pro-all of life” talking points promote marriage or exhort men to take care of the children they create. These men call on society to turn from its wicked ways and free the oppressed from the yoke of gentrification and income inequality. They seem to forget that the repentant soul is the one that inherits the kingdom. The Bible doesn’t promote trickle-down salvation or paternalistic social uplift.









I recently went undercover at an abortion rally held at a Unitarian Universalist church in Washington, D.C. The crowd was at least 80% white and 90% female. The organizers of the event talked to the crowd about risking arrest at a pro-abortion rally the following day. The crowd that evening looked a lot like the church’s congregation and their website reads like a campaign page of liberal senate candidate. The church performs same-sex weddings and has a “Rainbow Souls” affinity group. The structure was solid, but like many churches today, these buildings are whitewashed tombs – towering edifices hiding spiritual decay.

For a committed Christian, the Bible is the measuring stick that should be used to evaluate every other political ideology, social theory, religious practice, or secular philosophy. Politically engaged Christians must never forget that they have a book which is their sole standard for making righteous judgements. Christians may have different perspectives on capital gains, taxes, and infrastructure spending, but the most hotly contested battlefronts of the culture wars are about biblical definitions that tie directly to God’s role as Creator.

The distinctions in role and function between male and female, the inherent worth of human life, and the institution of marriage are all laid out in the first two chapters of Genesis. These biblical definitions are complemented by observable phenomena in the natural world. Men and women have bodies that fit together for the purpose of fruitfulness. Some couples have trouble conceiving because of age or medical conditions, but the potential for reproduction is found in principle when the male and female bodies are joined together. Same-sex pairings have no such ability, in theory or practice.

Ultimately, Christian engagement in politics is a matter of spiritual conviction, not the race or color of the pastor or congregation. The only thing that matters is faithful preaching and teaching of God’s word. King Jesus reigns supreme and no political movement can exalt itself above him.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires,2022-07-22
Squires: 7 principles black voters should immediately embrace,"Last week I wrote about the abusive relationship Democrats have with black voters and the reaction of members of the black elite when people attempt to escape. Several people asked me whether I was making a blanket endorsement of the Republican Party. I certainly was not. Part of the problem in America right now is the degree to which citizens across the political spectrum look to elected officials to solve our problems and fix our lives. Much like relationships, if black voters leave one party for another without asking why we stayed in such a toxic environment for so long, we will end up repeating the same behavior. Here are seven guiding principles to ensure that doesn't happen.

1. Do not worship false idols. You know you have made politics an idol if you think a politician is going to ""save"" the country, that bureaucrats will supply all of your needs, or that you should love a political party with all your heart, mind, and soul. Voting and political engagement are critically important in a system of self-government, but politics must be put in their proper place. Politicians are not gods. Their powers — from both a legal and practical perspective — are limited. Families, churches, community institutions, and individuals all have responsibilities in a society, but they all shrink when citizens act as if the government is both omniscient and omnipotent.

2. Break the chains. The link between black identity and Democratic Party affiliation must be broken. I'm not saying that black people can't or shouldn't vote for Democrats. I'm saying that the choice to do so shouldn't be seen as what ""real black people"" do. Nor should the choice to vote Republican be seen as what ""sellouts"" do. The two parties have different views of human nature, the role of government, and visions for the country. Voting is how people express their values and political interests, and there is no reason to expect 90% of the people in any group to see the broader philosophical issues or more specific policy choices the same way.

3. Know your worldview. Like all voters, black people must know what we believe and why we believe it. A worldview is both an anchor that shows you the areas in which your principles are unmovable and a compass that provides direction as you travel. For many people, the crowd is their only compass, and what is fashionable at the moment is their only anchor. Consider the issue of gender identity. In the span of 20 years, society went from thinking someone like Caitlyn Jenner is a man dressed as a woman, to a man who thinks he is a woman, to a man who is a woman — with all the rights, privileges, and protections the law guarantees. Even though many people don't believe it, without a worldview rooted in something other than what is popular, you will feel powerless to resist it.

4. Quit lying. One hallmark of the left is saying things that you don't actually believe to look like a good and decent person. The only way to test whether you believe something is to apply it to what you hold most dear. Do you publicly agree with Teen Vogue and Cori Bush that ""sex work is work,"" but get lightheaded at the thought of your own daughter performing sex acts with men in cars for money? That's a sign you're lying. Do you claim that men wearing dresses are a perfectly acceptable expression of masculinity, but know that you would call a divorce lawyer if you ever caught your husband in your pencil skirt and halter top? That's a sign you're lying. Many people on the left engage in this behavior, but only black people have racial injustices of the past used to bully us into endorsing whatever new cause is being pushed in the name of freedom and liberation.

5. Grow some thicker skin. Black media personalities and outlets regularly post content with targeted racial critiques, with titles like ""Whiteness Is a Pandemic."" These same people act as if racism, sexism, and homophobia are the only reasons people criticize artists like Cardi B and Lil Nas X. That is the epitome of fragility. In life you can be the type of person who is insensitive with the words you say and unfazed by what people say in return. You can also be gentle with your words and sensitive to how people talk to you. What you can't be is insensitive with your words while demanding other people be sensitive with theirs. Thick skin also makes you impervious to emotional manipulation from the people who will call you a ""coon,"" ""sellout,"" or ""Uncle Tom"" because they don't actually have anything of substance to say.

6. Do it for the kids. So much of how the Democratic Party communicates with black voters is about the past. Often, it is used to scare black voters about terrors that await us if we don't get out and vote. To the left, Selma will always be the city in black and white video footage that was the site of ""Bloody Sunday."" Focusing on the past means they don't ever have to acknowledge the fact that Selma's poverty rate is close to 40%, making it one of the poorest cities in Alabama today. That is why it is a mistake to prioritize rhetoric about the society your ancestors endured over policy that will impact the society your descendants will inherit

7. Don't be an Alien American. Resist all attempts to alienate you from your country. That means we should be on guard against leftist politicians and activists who are quick to talk about tearing down this country's history, symbols, and values in pursuit of utopia. Families, organizations, and teams are always more vulnerable to fracturing from within than threats from an external enemy. That is why we should be leery of opportunistic politicians and activists who believe July Fourth and the ""Star Spangled Banner"" are celebrations of white supremacy and use genuinely good things like the Juneteenth holiday and ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" (aka the black national anthem) in a way that undermines national unity.



These principles are not an exhaustive list of policy issues, nor are they an endorsement of specific candidates. They are simply a guide on how to have a healthier relationship with our political process.

The truth of the matter is that in today's America, the only people whose economic prospects are guaranteed though our votes are the people we elect to office. They make six-figure salaries, sign book deals, get inside stock tips, hobnob with Hollywood actors, and make shallow political statements at public events. Worse yet, they often vote in direct opposition to our stated interests because on issues like school choice, their actual constituents are teachers' unions. There is no reason we owe them loyalty when all they give us is lip service.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-7-principles-black-voters-should-immediately-embrace,2021-09-21
Squires: Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice are criminalizing parenting,"The Biden administration wants to make parents who resist activist educators into domestic terrorists because the left is losing its grip on American children.

The National School Board Association (NSBA) wrote a six-page letter to the Biden administration claiming that public schools and education leaders are being threatened with acts of violence and intimidation at local school board meetings. The NSBA requested federal law enforcement assistance in dealing with frustrated parents they claim are angry about mask mandates, critical race theory (CRT), and online learning. The organization even suggested that these threats could be a new form of domestic terrorism. Its letter questioned whether the PATRIOT Act and federal hate crime legislation could be used to rein in unruly parents.

This week the Department of Justice (DOJ) responded. Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and U.S. attorneys to meet with state, local, and tribal leaders and law enforcement agencies to discuss the threats. I read the NSBA letter and the DOJ memo. They use the words violence, threat, and intimidation over 60 times. The most serious physical act of aggression I found was a man who was charged with aggravated battery and disorderly conduct after allegedly striking a school official who attempted to escort him out of a meeting. The other incidents described in the letter were of angry parents who disrupted meetings and yelled at board members.

What is happening here is clear. The federal government is taking its first steps to turn concerned parents into its newest thought criminals. This isn't the first time. The Department of Homeland Security issued a terror advisory, absent any imminent threats or plots, in September that NBC claimed was based on a rise in ""anti-government rhetoric."" The list of potential terror suspects included people who believed there was fraud in the 2020 election as well as Americans opposed to COVID mandates. Using the resources and might of the federal government to go after citizens based solely on their political beliefs is a recipe for disaster that will only further inflame political tensions.

This attempt to flex federal muscle is even worse because there is nothing parents care about more than the well-being of their children. School districts across the country have become even bolder in their desire to imprint their views and values on students. They are assigning sexually explicit books to young students, promoting gender ideology and socially transitioning gender-confused children behind the backs of their parents, and promoting regressive views on race. They are also masking children as young as three, even though the World Health Organization states that children who are five years old and under should not be required to wear masks.

The real problem for many of these educators is the fact that many parents are finally waking up and exerting their authority over the education of their children. This is one reason why there has been such a rapid increase in homeschooling — from 3% to 11% of American families — over the past year. Regardless of your religious background or moral foundation, you must realize that education is equal parts scholarship and discipleship. It is never value-neutral. This is why the following Bible verse is so important to me.

""The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher."" —Luke 6:40

Parents are delusional if they think the few hours they have with their kids before and after school are any match for the 18,000 hours their children will spend in school from kindergarten through 12th grade. This is why so many parents have experienced the disappointment that comes with pouring your values into a child for 18 years only to have them come home hating everything they've ever been taught after one year on a college campus.

We can already see what happens when absolute truth is abandoned for elite consensus. No issue makes that clearer than the ongoing debate about sex, gender, and gender identity. Every organ of cultural hegemony in this country, from advocacy media companies like the New York Times to all of the big tech platforms, is in complete lockstep with the idea that people other than women can get pregnant. These gatekeepers sound, act, and behave like Romans because they have all been trained since childhood by Caesar. They claim to know the precise efficacy of masks against a respiratory virus, but don't seem to understand the most basic fact of human biology.

Our public schools do not educate children. They teach them conformity. That reality has been made worse over the last decade as schools that can't teach children how to read and write have shifted their focus to creating loyal voters who dutifully repeat talking points. Millions of students participated in online learning last year due to the pandemic, and many parents finally got to see what their children were being exposed to at school. That is why so many are fed up and starting to make their frustrations known.



We are not in a co-parenting relationship with the federal government, and the Constitution does not give the government jurisdiction over our children. Parents are tired of seeing radical activists masquerade as educators. I hope they continue to fight for their children.

Squires: Black 'male feminists' are the white liberals of black people,"Kanye West has generated so much controversy over the past two weeks that he has forced other people to apologize for even being associated with him. But a recent Huffington Post column makes the argument that there is another rapper who is even more “dangerous” politically than the self-proclaimed richest black man in history.

According to Stephen Crockett, Killer Mike (née Michael Render) is a politically savvy and socially conscious artist who has squandered his cultural capital by becoming a Republican shill. Crockett, a former writer at the Root, based his argument on the fact that the rapper chose to meet with Governor Brian Kemp in 2020, interviewed Herschel Walker during his current Senate run, and provided constructive feedback to the Stacey Abrams campaign.

In the world of black liberation political discourse, simply speaking to a conservative – and allowing one to speak to your audience – is an act of racial treason. To Stephen Crockett, conservatives are so evil and anti-black that there is no reason for black voters to listen to anything they have to say – especially when a black woman in the South has a chance to become governor.

This is an unsophisticated way to approach politics, but this hit piece is the logical byproduct of a worldview best described by another writer from the Root.

Damon Young, author and co-founder of the site Very Smart Brothas, wrote a controversial opinion piece in 2017 entitled, “Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People.” Young argued that black men benefit from male privilege and use it to center their concerns regarding racial injustice, while dismissing the concerns of black women (e.g., sexism, domestic violence) in the same way white people downplay and disregard racism and white supremacy.

The essay lacked substance, but the provocative thesis provides a useful framework for understanding the role men like Young and Crockett play in the larger political ecosystem.

Put simply, black male feminists are the white liberals of black people.

The primary political purpose of white liberals today is to atone for the “sin” of whiteness and the actions of their historical doppelgangers. The BLM flags, black squares on social media, and “racial justice” activism are all attempts to receive absolution for the transgressions of white people past, present, and future.

The high priests of racial politics, from Rev. Al Sharpton to Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, demand a sacrifice, and white liberals are always ready and willing to offer up their conservative counterparts as an act of atonement. This is one reason they eagerly share stories about the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or the “Karens” destroying America. They want black people to know that they know and agree that white people are terrible and need to give up power and privilege for black people to thrive.

Black male feminists play a similar role within the black community. They see themselves as beneficiaries of male privilege in a systemically sexist culture and want to show black women that they are committed to black female liberation. The trick is doing so in a way that won’t be seen as black men playing dark knights in shining armor swooping in to save black women. That would only reinforce the worst aspects of “toxic masculinity.”

The goal of the black male feminist is to signal to the women who run things (as well as black LGBT allies) that they are not those kinds of black guys – the “hoteps” who listen to Kevin Samuels and Dr. Umar Johnson. They have no issue periodically acknowledging the ways in which hip-hop culture objectifies and degrades black women, but they wouldn’t be caught dead criticizing similar imagery from Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.

These are the pastors who declare “I’m with her” and comedians who wear “I WILL AID AND ABET ABORTION” shirts to show women that they too are committed to keeping as many black children from being born as possible.

The black male feminist doesn’t just share similarities with white liberals in political purpose. They share a similar outlook and disposition. They are often neurotic and anxious, two qualities that will always warp a person’s ability to assess threats and prioritize resources.

These men are the ones who think white domestic terrorism and genocidal police officers are the biggest threats to black lives in America’s largest cities. Their white liberal comrades, similarly, believe upwards of 1,000 unarmed black men are shot and killed by police each year. It’s easy for both groups to come to those conclusions when you completely ignore street crime and actual homicide data for fear of spreading “conservative talking points” about “black-on-black crime.”

White liberals think systemic racism and white supremacy – terms they rarely define – are the biggest impediments to the success of black people. Black male feminists think whiteness and masculinity are the biggest threats to black women. And increasing numbers of black women in the media think that whiteness, traditional notions of masculinity, and the gender binary itself are existential threats to trans women. In the Oppression Olympics, black men take the bronze, black women get the silver, and black trans women own the gold.

Zerlina Maxwell, a political analyst and MSNBC host, complained about sexism among Democrats after Sen. Elizabeth Warren ended her presidential campaign in 2020. Maxwell didn’t explain why Warren, the first female senator in the history of Massachusetts, came in third among women in the state, because she didn’t need to. Instead, she jumped straight to charges of sexism and demanded more men publicly support women in leadership roles.

Craig Melvin, the man moderating the discussion, sheepishly obliged: “Um … OK … uh … for the record, I want to see women in positions of power.”

The other option for black male feminists in media is to sit silently when the women are doing the hard work of leadership. Tiffany Cross felt comfortable saying black men in Georgia should “get in line” behind black women and vote for Stacey Abrams because she knew none of the male panelists – including Roland Martin – would challenge her.

Part of the reason people reacted so strongly to Stephen A. Smith telling Malika Andrews that she couldn’t silence him on ESPN’s First Take is because we have all become accustomed to seeing men like him roll over and show their bellies when a woman encroaches on their territory.

This is why the criticisms of Killer Mike will only get louder if he continues to withhold an endorsement in the Georgia gubernatorial race. He can expect to be the subject of numerous think pieces and drive-by tweets if an Abrams loss is due to black males who don’t vote or who cast ballots for her opponent.

But ultimately, these critiques say more about men like Stephen Crockett, Damon Young, and the legion of black feminists eager to separate themselves from the black men who have unapproved thoughts and speak their minds freely.

There was a time when men with their platforms challenged the status quo. Not any more. Now they harangue professional athletes for not taking experimental drugs. These men are toothless guard dogs – they have plenty of bark, but their words have no bite. They recite predictable liberal pablum that boils every social problem down to a tidy list of “-isms” and “phobias.” More importantly, they completely misunderstand the “power” to whom they claim to be speaking truth.

There is absolutely no risk in being a black liberal accusing President Trump or Governor DeSantis of racism on MSNBC. But it takes actual courage to sit in between BLM’s co-founders and ask, “Why is an organization that claims to care about black people committed to destroying the nuclear family?”

The same goes for an artist who takes the stage at the BET Awards and says, “I appreciate this award, but I will not return to this awards show until this network stops platforming artists who degrade black women and sell murder music to our children.”



Black male feminists don’t have that in them. Men who mimic the language of personal therapy that is so common on the left today aren’t built for the type of culture war playing out within black America.

If being mistaken for an Uber Eats driver in your luxury condo is a harmful, triggering microaggression that requires an extra hour of therapy, you’re not the type of man who can stand firm when the black leadership class points its rhetorical guns at you or tries to make you an outcast within the culture. It’s much easier to submit and obey.

"Squires: If Democrats peeked under the hood of ‘white supremacy,’ they’d find a mirror, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama","Democrats have accused white conservatives of being racist for decades, but now they have identified an even more dangerous group of advocates for white supremacy: black people.

That line of attack was used against Larry Elder during his recall election, Condoleezza Rice after she criticized critical race theory, and Winsome Sears after she became the first black lieutenant governor in Virginia's history.

Most people don't believe a black person running for public office would do anything to intentionally hurt himself, family, or community. Part of the problem is the extent to which the term ""white supremacy"" has been stretched to encompass things that no American associates with race.

White supremacy has historically meant the belief in the inherent superiority of white people (i.e., people of European descent) over non-whites. The use of that term was applied to the justification for American chattel slavery, Jim Crow laws, and racial discrimination. White supremacy was also associated with intense racial violence, including lynchings, church bombings, and other racially motivated attacks carried out by white people against black citizens throughout American history.

No group epitomized the ideology of white supremacy in this country more than the Ku Klux Klan, and no image captured their moral deprivation and spiritual bankruptcy more than a burning cross. What makes the ideology of white supremacy so toxic is that it assumes some of God's created beings are better than others because of something as insignificant as skin color.

Using white supremacy to describe political opinions Democrats don't like is immoral. It trivializes real acts of racial terror in the past and minimizes the progress the country has made on race. It also incentivizes Americans to attack the very things (e.g., strong families, quality education) we need for the republic to survive.

That is why it is worth honestly assessing major positions on the Left and Right, expressed through culture and policy, to determine whether any of them advance notions of white superiority or black inferiority today.

Regarding the family, the 2020 Republican platform states, ""Traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values.""

The 2020 Democratic platform only mentions marriage one time, in connection to the practice of forced marriages in other cultures.

Democrats do not see the nuclear family as a necessary ingredient for positive social and economic outcomes. Their platform and rhetoric reflect a worldview that believes the government can play the role of provider that has traditionally been the responsibility of husbands and fathers.

Another issue closely linked to the family is abortion. The differences between the two parties could not be clearer. Republicans are generally opposed to abortion and want to repeal Roe v. Wade. Democrats seek to codify the landmark Supreme Court decision to prevent state laws from restricting abortion. Several states, including New York and Illinois, have legalized abortion up until the point of birth.

Education is another area where distinctions are clear. Conservative support for school choice, including public charter schools and voucher programs, is based on the belief that parents know what education options are best for their children. Some liberals are in favor of school choice, but many others want to limit charter schools and oppose vouchers because both are seen as competition by the teachers' unions that overwhelmingly support Democrats.

The left also believes in injecting race essentialism and gender ideology into K-12 classrooms. Large urban school districts across the country are eliminating entrance exams for specialized schools, gifted programs, and grades in the name of equity.

Crime also provides an opportunity to see the differences between conservatives and leftists, both in rhetoric and policy. The conservative response to an increase in crime, including violent offenses, is typically a call for more police officers and law enforcement resources. The left's response in recent years has been defunding, decriminalization, and de-incarceration. Democrats see American policing as a leading cause of racial disparities in incarceration but ignore the fact that black people are disproportionately the victims of violent crime.

The differences in worldview extend to culture as well. The left completely supports public displays of sexuality in music, movies, television, or awards shows. Leftists even promote it to children through Drag Queen Story Hour and LGBTQ messaging in shows for toddlers. Conservatives typically support parents who see these things as inappropriate for young children.

Prominent liberal outlets like Teen Vogue also support prostitution, pornography, and other forms of sex work. Conservatives have been on the other side arguing that the body was made for more than performing degrading sex acts for money.

My question to any Democrat who cynically accuses conservatives of promoting white supremacy is simple: Whose worldview would a grand wizard endorse?

Would he applaud a pro-abortion agenda that leads to half of all black babies in New York City being aborted or support a pro-life platform that would lead to a larger black population in America?

Would he call for defunding the police in response to the murders of black people living in high-crime neighborhoods? Perhaps he would be like Democratic Rep. Cori Bush and call for defunding the police for the black citizens being killed at a rate seven times higher than white while paying $70,000 over two months for private security.

Given the link between family structure and social outcomes, would he want more children raised by single mothers or nuclear families? Would he see strong black men who love their wives and are dedicated to their families as a threat or an asset?

Would he endorse a hip-hop culture that uses black artists to promote murder, misogyny, and drug abuse to black teens enticed by money and fame? If he did, would he also volunteer his daughter to have her body groped on camera by artists?

Would he think being white is a ""privilege""? Would he see anything that is all-black as segregated and inherently inferior?



Would he want black students subjected to lower standards in school by teachers eliminating high standards for the sake of equity? Would he be happy to learn that wealthy liberals like the Obamas and Bidens send their children to expensive private schools while blocking similar opportunities for low-income black students?

These are all questions Americans should ask themselves if one party is committed to using a term as loaded as ""white supremacy"" as a rhetorical cudgel. I bet many would be surprised to find out who's behind the sheets.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-if-democrats-peeked-under-the-hood-of-white-supremacy-theyd-find-a-mirror-joe-biden-and-barack-obama,2021-11-09
"Squires: Kanye and Krasner coddle criminals, promote chaos, empower a new Klan","The most influential voices in American politics and culture have made criminals this country’s newest victim class, and their misplaced sympathies have made life very difficult for everyone else.

Larry Krasner, the district attorney in Philadelphia, raised eyebrows when he claimed his city does not have a crisis in violent crime. This came as a shock to most people, because the city recently surpassed its previous record of 500 homicides in a single year. Krasner was quick to dismiss the crime spike in his city because he knows many people blame his policies for contributing to the problem.

Krasner, a former criminal defense attorney, campaigned as a criminal justice reformer when he first ran for district attorney in 2017. He was aided by a $1.45 million donation from George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has contributed to the campaigns of several progressive prosecutors. He has done everything to live up to his reputation since then. Krasner dropped cash bail in 2018 for over twenty “low-level” offenses, including DUI and retail theft.

Krasner has also been criticized for his approach to more serious crimes. In 2020, the federal prosecutor with jurisdiction over Philadelphia detailed ten cases in which Krasner’s office offered lenient plea deals to defendants who were subsequently charged with murder. Keith Garner, a man with multiple prior felony convictions, was arrested for executing four people eight months after being given a plea deal on an assault charge. Another man named Tariq Grant was arrested for murdering a 19-year-old six months after receiving a plea deal for multiple violent offenses. A third individual with prior felonies, Francisco Reyes, allegedly murdered a man two days after pleading guilty and receiving probation on multiple drug offenses.

Despite the impact of his policy changes, Krasner easily won re-election in November. A month later, it was time for another criminal justice reformer to take the stage on behalf of America’s newest victim class.

Kanye West and Drake teamed up on December 9 to put on a benefit concert at the L.A. Coliseum for Larry Hoover, founder of the Chicago-based Gangster Disciple street gang. The event page said the concert would “raise awareness and support for Larry Hoover and the cause of prison and sentencing reform.”

Hoover has been in prison since 1973 on a combination of state and federal charges, including murder, conspiracy, extortion, and continuing to engage in a criminal enterprise. He is currently serving six life sentences but has allegedly renounced his association with the Gangster Disciples.

Kanye unsuccessfully lobbied President Trump for Hoover’s pardon in 2018. He also included a song about Hoover on his new album, “Donda,” called “Free My Father” that features Larry Hoover Jr. advocating for his father’s release.

Kanye is a Chicago native and could have chosen to use his immense influence to bring attention to any of the more than 750 people who have been killed in his city this year. One analysis of crime data in September found that more children had been shot in Chicago (261) than had died of COVID (214) across the entire country. Kanye could have done a benefit concert for those children.

Anyone who understands anything about how the ruling class thinks about crime and punishment knows why that didn’t happen. Both Kanye and Krasner, archetypes of American culture and politics, believe society’s primary criminal justice problem is a system of racist policing and incarceration that unfairly targets black people.

This is why Democratic politicians and Hollywood celebrities only bring national attention to black people when they believe the perpetrators are white police officers or vigilantes.

As a Christian, I am eternally grateful for a savior who took the punishment for my sins. But there is something important to be learned from the Old Testament laws that governed ancient Israel.

Four of the first five books of the Bible detail hundreds of laws governing Israel’s vertical relationship with God as well as horizontal relationships between people. These books also include punishments for lawbreakers, which are clear and commanded to be executed swiftly.

What caught my eye in the book of Deuteronomy was the frequent use of the phrase “and so you shall purge the evil from your midst.” The phrase is used when discussing punishment for breaking the law. That phrase was often followed by another: “And all of Israel will hear, and they will fear.”

The lesson was clear: Deal with sin quickly to stop it from spreading. Every parent understands this lesson. In general, what is rewarded is repeated, and the behaviors that don’t get corrected will only get worse.

This lesson has been completely lost on our culture, especially the liberal activists, celebrities, and politicians who are driving our national conversation around criminal justice reform. They think coddling criminality, whether through rhetoric or policy, is rehabilitative. But the recent crime waves across the country demonstrate that failure to purge evil has a multiplying effect.

Criminals, regardless of skin color, feel emboldened to steal when they know theft won’t be punished. They will run into stores, smash display cases, and stroll out with as many items as they can carry. The same dynamic exists in violent crime.

The left argues that when the people doing the shooting are black, moral problems will be corrected with material solutions.

Oddly enough, they don’t apply that principle to all groups. They would never argue that a jobless Klansman terrorizing a middle-class black family is simply in need of a new career and better housing. When it comes to that type of crime, they are quick to purge evil.



They claim that black lives matter but spend more time and attention on fake hate crimes than real street crimes.

The people elected to prevent and punish crime have incentivized it. Instead of purging evil from our midst, celebrities and political ideologues welcome it. We shouldn’t be surprised that it’s spreading.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-kanye-and-krasner-coddle-criminals-promote-chaos-empower-a-new-klan,2021-12-14
Squires: The Buffalo shooting was motivated by race hatred — and the media response is motivated by outrage inequity,"The racially motivated shooting in a Buffalo supermarket was a heinous crime that has been condemned by Americans of every color, faith, and political stripe. The shooter, Payton Gendron, drove over three hours to launch his attack on a neighborhood that has the highest percentage of black residents in upstate New York. He surrendered to police and has pled “not guilty” to charges of first-degree murder.

As is often the case, the Buffalo massacre quickly ceased being about the innocent victims or the pain and grief their families are enduring. The main story morphed into the shooter’s political motivations and the degree to which he was influenced by political rhetoric around the “replacement theory” associated with conservative politicians and media personalities, including Tucker Carlson.

Gendron’s 180-page manifesto, which has been taken off the internet, reads like a tangled web of political positions on everything from gun control laws to “green nationalism.” He certainly does describe himself as a white supremacist. The problem is that our conversations around race have become so poisoned that “white supremacy” is also evidenced by the fact that black NBA players were cheered on by white fans one day after the shootings, according to Deadspin. The author of that column didn’t seem to question whether the 21 people shot in three incidents in downtown Milwaukee Friday night also weighed on the minds of Milwaukee Bucks players during Sunday’s game against the Boston Celtics.

If we can ask questions about the shooter’s motivations for his crime, we should also ask about our motives for highlighting certain types of senseless violence and ignoring others.

Doing so would reveal an ugly and uncomfortable truth: Our political culture is infected with “outrage inequity” when it comes to race, crime, and violence. The main symptom of this condition is the selective application of moral indignation and condemnation based on specific victim-perpetrator color combinations.

The left’s view of equity holds that social outcomes should roughly match population percentages. For example, if an urban school system is 25% black, white, Asian, and Hispanic, equity advocates would expect the students in gifted programs and specialized schools – two of a district’s most important resources – to have a similar mix of students.

A school system that was 90% black and Hispanic but produced gifted programs and specialized schools that were 90% white and only five percent black would have some serious explaining to do. Leaders of that school district would have to contend with accusations that they are only concerned about education when it involves white students.

One unfortunate reality the Buffalo shooting made clear is that similar inequities exist when it comes to the types of crimes that receive national attention. Certain politicians, pundits, entertainers, journalists, and corporations are only interested in crime stories that involve white perpetrators and black victims. They chant “black lives matter” with their lips, but their actions and selective outrage reveal a worldview more accurately described as “white suspects matter.”

There is an ugly history of lynchings, cross-burnings, firebombings, and targeted shootings that have been carried out to terrorize black communities and create a sense of fear among black citizens. Violence motivated by white supremacy should be swiftly condemned, and thankfully it is in today’s society.

The reason these crimes are evil isn’t because the perpetrators are white and the victims are black. They are evil because every human being is created in the image of God and murder is an affront against our Creator. This principle holds regardless of the ethnic backgrounds of everyone involved or the motivations of the killers.

We’ve lost the ability to say that, because we live in a country where even self-professed Christians subscribe to outrage inequity driven by ethnic partiality. Christians who believe all humans are guilty of sin – and in need of the same savior – should be the first ones to acknowledge that neither vice nor virtue is inherent to any one group. Too often, however, they engage in the same types of vague claims about support for white supremacy as their secular counterparts, who now accuse black conservatives of being closeted Klansmen.

Like Deadspin, they dilute the potency and power of “white supremacy” by applying it haphazardly to trivial matters. Their use of terms like “whiteness” as a catchall that encompasses everything from the nuclear family to self-reliance also makes hopes of productive racial dialogue and “racial reconciliation” impossible.

It also makes understanding any other type of hate crime extremely difficult. The provincial thinking of America’s leading race scribes can’t even compute a shooting in a Laguna Woods church carried out by a Chinese immigrant motivated by hatred toward Taiwan.

Outrage inequity isn’t just about murder. It is also what made a verbal dispute in New York involving a white woman and black birdwatcher into a national story drawing comparisons to Emmett Till. It also explains why Jussie Smollett’s hate hoax consumed so much media coverage, while the dozens of schoolchildren who are shot in Chicago each year receive none.



We cannot continue on this path.

We will never reach a state of outrage equity until we allow sympathy to flow to victims of violent crimes without regard for their ethnic identity. It is natural and humane to mourn when you hear about a person being cut down by gunfire while going about their daily life. That should be the case no matter what the victims look like.

Moving to a place of outrage equity will require the consistent application of ethical, moral, and legal standards to the analysis of violent crimes.

It is hard to take racial justice advocates seriously when their response to thousands of black victims of street crime each year is “defund the police,” while the response to the atrocious – but comparatively rare – incidents of racial violence is a call for anti-black hate crime legislation and new executive orders.

Outrage equity also means assessments of the role political rhetoric plays in a heinous crime should apply the same standard, whether the suspect parrots talking points about white genocide from David Duke or black genocide from Benjamin Crump.

Analyzing the motivations and root causes of violent criminals should also be done without regard to ethnicity or socioeconomic status. No longer can some perpetrators be cast as blameless victims of structural forces and historic oppression and others as moral agents driven by ethnic rage and privilege.

People notice that the same outlets that blame Republicans for Payton Gendron’s actions blamed Darrell Brooks’ SUV for killing six people and injuring 60 during a Christmas parade in Waukesha. Achieving outrage equity will require a single standard when attributing blame to inanimate objects involved in crimes.

Contrary to popular belief, the reason I bring so much attention to street crimes in our biggest cities has nothing to do with playing to a specific audience. I do it because homicide is the leading cause of death of young black men, and I don’t want another generation of black boys thinking that living past 25 is a major life accomplishment.

I’m also tired of the people who use legitimate tragedies involving innocent black victims to highlight white perpetrators, not tell the truth about protecting black lives. These individuals practice a pernicious form of ethnic partiality that disqualifies them from being the arbiters of moral authority they presume themselves to be.

I would say the same thing if a white conservative site only ran stories about child sex crimes involving black suspects, even though more than 85% of people charged for possessing child pornography are white. Questions about motive would be completely appropriate if the 3% of black child pornography suspects were also the focus of 95% of the larger conservative commentary in this area.

I wish both liberals and conservatives alike would focus on the victims of crime and their families. This is a much more humane, compassionate way to address these issues. Seeing victims of crime as pieces to be moved around a cultural chess board is a sign of a sick culture that places a higher value on political power than preserving life. This applies equally to the left and right.

Transformed hearts are what we need in this country today, not more entrenched tribal conflict. The cross of Christ gives us the perfect path. It is there that we see both the universal nature of sin and the only source of true reconciliation between God and man. I pray we find our way soon.

Squires: Social (media) justice requires far different standards for Kyle Rittenhouse and Julius Jones,"America's justice system is broken.

Our laws are still in place, but as a nation, we have no shared understanding of what ""justice"" is or how it should be pursued. This reality impacts every aspect of society, especially when the modifier ""social"" is attached to the concept of justice whenever disparities between ethnic groups are found to flow in a particular direction.

This is yet another outcome of a rapidly secularizing country that attempts to cherry-pick Bible verses about justice while discarding the God who defines it.

Biblical justice reflects God's character. It promotes and upholds good and punishes evil. Its ultimate purpose is to bring people into the right relationship with God and with one another.

Our justice system draws on those principles. Ideally, our system of laws should be an impartial, proportional mechanism for promoting moral order. It should seek to punish criminals and motivate a change in their attitude and behavior, protect the innocent, deter criminal behavior from spreading, provide restitution for victims, and apply grace and mercy without prejudice.

Achieving justice is a process, not an outcome. That process includes weighing evidence, hearing from witnesses, and deciding guilt or innocence based on the facts of the particular case.

The members of the ruling class do not want a justice system. They want a system of cultural, political, and legal spoils (e.g., presumption of innocence, celebrity backing) that can be doled out to people they like and withheld from people they don't.

The cases of Kyle Rittenhouse and Julius Jones demonstrate that clearly.

Rittenhouse has been accused of being a white supremacist without evidence since last year, and his critics ignore the video footage that clearly shows him using his gun in self-defense. The fact that he came to Kenosha and was not in favor of burning it down in the name of racial justice makes him a natural enemy of the ruling class. That is why politicians and pundits on the left, as well as a few on the right, have tried to make this case about race and the dangers of Trumpist vigilantism. They make the case about Rittenhouse's age and the type of gun he was carrying and refuse to even acknowledge the chaos and disorder that were allowed to fester in Kenosha and many other cities in 2020.

The left has a completely different attitude toward Julius Jones, the convicted murderer whose death sentence was commuted on the day he was scheduled to be executed. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Kerry Washington and professional athletes including Baker Mayfield and Russell Westbrook successfully lobbied Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt to spare Jones' life.

His supporters claim that he didn't have a fair trial because of racial bias, inadequate legal representation, and issues with witness identification. They also allege that Jones' co-defendant confessed to carjacking and killing Paul Howell in 1999.

If Jones did not kill Howell and was not present at the scene, he should be fully exonerated. Justice demands it.

The actual evidence points to his guilt. A witness claimed Jones drove the victim's car to his home on the night of the shooting and was wearing the exact outfit — white shirt, black stocking cap, and red bandana — the victim's sister described to police. The police later found that bandana and the murder weapon in Jones' home. The bandana was tested in 2017 and was found to match Jones' DNA.

The issue here isn't opposition to the death penalty. There are people across the political spectrum who object to the practice for religious, moral, and administrative reasons. No definition of justice includes executing an innocent person for evil acts committed by others, but there is another side to that coin as well. Failing to punish the wicked for the evil they do is also an injustice. Worse yet is holding them up as heroes or excusing their behavior for the sake of political expediency.

This isn't just about Julius Jones. In recent years, Hollywood celebrities have joined with death penalty opponents to advocate for several people on death row. The most well-known case involved Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams, the co-founder of the Crips. Williams was convicted of murdering four people, but his case brought together rappers and actors who claimed he changed his life and should be spared death. Even the founder of one of the most notorious street gangs in America can become a sympathetic figure if the right people get behind him.

The left has a completely inverted view of justice that prioritizes the feelings of lawbreakers over the needs of the victims. This is why citizens from San Francisco to New York City are frustrated when they don't see serious consequences for thieves who steal from stores in broad daylight or commuters who assault passengers on the subway.

Imagine being the mother of Jacob Blake's children and seeing the man you accused of sexually assaulting and terrorizing you venerated as a near-martyr for racial justice. The same goes for the parents of the children Joseph Rosenbaum molested.

The same goes for the academics and journalists who claimed that people burning down buildings and destroying property were simply engaging in political speech, not committing crimes. These small business owners who work tirelessly to provide jobs and services to their communities were quickly dismissed by people who appear on cable news shows to declare that ""rioting is the language of the unheard.""

Like every other issue they champion, radicals wrap this inversion of justice in brown skin to make it more palatable to the public. This is why we are unlikely to see the same level of anti-death penalty activity on behalf of Dylan Roof. Aside from a handful of activists and academics, most of the celebrities who say the death penalty is barbaric wouldn't dare say anything that could be misinterpreted as supporting an actual white supremacist. They only champion the cause of convicted rapists and murderers if it furthers a political agenda.



The reason the left immediately brings up rape during every debate about abortion is because they actually believe unwanted children are more worthy of death than men who violate women sexually. This moral perversion is why they use ""reproductive justice"" as a euphemism for intentionally killing the unborn and ""criminal justice"" as their rallying cry for sparing the lives of convicted murderers. That's not a standard of justice I recognize.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-social-media-justice-requires-far-different-standards-for-kyle-rittenhouse-and-julius-jones,2021-11-19
"Squires: The left, like the old KKK, uses fear of racial violence to control the minds, emotions, and actions of black people","A Washington Post story about suspected lynchings in Mississippi is just the latest example of the left using the specter of race hatred to keep black people afraid for our lives and ashamed of our country.

The Post ran a story on Sunday that claimed there have been eight suspected lynchings of black men in Mississippi since 2000 and that local law enforcement has often ruled these deaths suicides. The article gives details of each incident as well as the response from family members who feel the cases were being dismissed too quickly. A significant section of the report focuses on the long and ugly history of lynching as a tool of racial terror. According to the Post, more than 4,000 black men, women, and children were lynched between 1877 and 1950.

It is impossible to deny the impact of lynching on the psyche of black Americans, past and present. The song ""Strange Fruit,"" most notably linked to Billie Holiday, originated as a poem written as a protest against lynchings. Images of smiling crowds posing in front of burning corpses are reminders of both the grave injustice of the practice and how normal it was to the people who participated in it. Lynchings are a part of American history that should not be glossed over or sanitized, but this Washington Post article is about a lot more than attempting to bring justice to eight families or a concern for black life.

I know this because each year, about 7,000 black people are killed – accounting for about half of all homicides in this country. Most people don't know about these crimes because many go unsolved or only receive local media coverage. Given the intra-racial nature of most homicides in this country, black murder victims who are killed by other black people are generally not deemed worthy of national news coverage.



In fact, large cities with high homicide rates that disproportionately impact black neighborhoods have become ground zero for progressive district attorneys and ""defund the police"" activists.

I find it hard to believe the response to these murders would be the same if the victims were journalists, college professors, hedge fund managers, politicians, or trust fund heirs. Somehow the value of black lives seems to have an inverse relationship to the melanin levels of the people taking them. The paler the perpetrator, the more compelling the crime. The Crips and other street gangs accounting for one-third of all shootings in New York City this year gets relegated to the Metro section of the New York Post, while eight suspected lynchings over two decades receive national coverage in one of the most influential newspapers in the country.

The left is not in the crime-solving business. It is in the black fear business. Journalists, politicians, and social media influencers connect with their black ""customers"" by making them feel like America in 2021 is no different, with respect to white racial violence, than it was 100 years ago. This is why corporate media latches onto any incident, whether an actual crime or a verbal disagreement, that has the familiar black-white, victim-victimizer dynamic. It's also why activists and politicians who say they are fighting for racial justice trivialize the history of actual racial discrimination and violence by calling state election bills they don't like the ""Delta variant of Jim Crow voting laws"" or trying to link the case of a black bird-watcher and white dog-walker to the murder of Emmett Till.

People who can't manage their money – running up credit cards and tapping payday lenders – eventually become someone else's investment. In a similar fashion, the book of Proverbs says that people who lack the ability to manage their emotions are like a city that has been invaded and left without any defense systems. They eventually end up under someone else's control.

Fear is the battering ram the left has used to breach the black psyche and take control of every major institution across the country. If black people are perpetually afraid of racism, we'll keep voting for politicians who commit to care for us from cradle to grave. We'll keep sending our children to schools that spend more time on activism than academics. We'll keep believing intellectuals who promise equal outcomes in every area of life. We'll keep parroting activists who use black deaths to push their Marxist agenda; keep supporting athletes and entertainers who say they're speaking truth to power; and keep buying products from companies that say they stand for racial justice.

The only thing worse than the smarmy, self-serving people who engage in this behavior is the reality that it works. That is why multiple people told me to be careful before I left on a recent road trip from D.C. to Texas that took my family through Mississippi and Alabama. They weren't just wishing me safe travels; they were warning me as a black man traveling in the Deep South. I would be lying if I said I didn't think about the same thing.

At one point I envisioned myself being pulled over late at night with the kids asleep in the back and having a white state trooper with a thick southern drawl shine his light in my car and order me out. I thought about what would happen if the situation escalated. I played out how each scenario I considered would allow me to safely return to my wife and children. Those fleeting thoughts showed me that I'm not immune to the corrosive impact of having relatively rare threats constantly amplified and the most immediate ones deliberately minimized.



I hope that the police investigate these suspected lynching incidents and take the necessary actions if foul play was involved in any of them. The families of the deceased men deserve justice if their fathers, brothers, and sons were murdered. I believe most Americans, regardless of skin color or political affiliation, would say the same. I feel much less confident that the left is ready to kick its unhealthy obsession with using racist incidents in America's past to control the minds and emotions of black people today.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-the-left-like-the-old-kkk-uses-fear-of-racial-violence-to-control-the-minds-emotions-and-actions-of-black-people,2021-08-09
Whitlock: Bigoted LeBron James promises DNC –Dead Negroes Confederacy – to remain silent on Emmett Till 2.0 murder,"Five years ago, LeBron James claimed a vandal spray-painted the N-word on the gate of his Brentwood, California, mansion.



At the time of the alleged incident, James and his family primarily resided in Cleveland, and James was in Oakland participating in the NBA Finals. James’ employees removed and painted over the racist graffiti before police arrived and could investigate.

Nevertheless, when discussing the “crime” from the NBA’s highest platform, James analogized what he and his family experienced to the mother of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black boy murdered in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a white woman.

“It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America,” James said at the 2017 NBA Finals. “And hate in America, especially for African-Americans, is living every day. And even though that it’s concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you, and when they see you they smile in your face. It’s alive every single day.

“I think back to Emmett Till’s mom, actually. It’s kind of one of the first things I thought of. The reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America. No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is tough.”

Spray-painted graffiti that LeBron James and his family never personally saw made LeBron think of the pain Mamie Till felt over the murder of her teenage son.

James, in my opinion, was lying. The hate he whined about was a hoax intended to garner sympathy and elevate his brand as a social justice warrior. I believed that in 2017, and I believe it even more today, analyzing his reaction to the murder of Ethan Liming in the parking lot of James’ celebrated, Akron, Ohio, I Promise School.

Liming and his family have far more in common with Emmett and Mamie Till than LeBron James ever will.

Two weeks ago today, three men beat Liming, a 17-year-old honor-roll student, to death near an outdoor basketball court at I Promise School. Liming is white. His accused assailants are black.

Liming and three friends were joyriding in his car and shooting a water paintball gun. They stopped at I Promise School. Two of Liming’s friends – two black teenagers – got out of the car with the water gun and approached four men playing basketball. According to initial reports, Liming’s friends fired the water gun at the men. Three of the men chased Liming’s friends back to Liming’s car. Liming, a 6-foot-1 football and baseball player, stepped out of the car and tried to calm the situation. He was attacked. The three men beat him brutally. According to witness statements and the police report, the assailants punched and kicked Liming after he was knocked unconscious on the ground.

The assailants then allegedly prevented Liming’s friends from rushing him to a hospital. The assailants snatched one of the teenager’s cellphones as they tried to call for help, took Liming’s car keys, and moved his car to the opposite side of the parking lot. Liming’s third friend ran away from the scene and called police. When police arrived, Liming was dead. Approximately a week later, law enforcement arrested the three assailants. They’ve been charged with murder and sit in jail on $1 million bonds.

A quick recap: Two black kids shot a water paintball gun at four black men, sparking a confrontation outside a white kid’s car. The white kid attempted to calm the situation. Three black men beat him to death in the parking lot of the school fronted by a high-profile racial justice warrior, the Muhammad Ali of the 21st century.

Here’s what LeBron James has had to say about the incident:

“Our condolences goes out to the family who lost a loved one!! My the heavens above watch over you during this tragedy! Pray for our community!”

His heartfelt, grammatically challenged tweet included heart and crown emojis. There was no mention of Emmett or Mamie Till. No mention of racial hatred.

Five black kids got in a fight, and the white kid who initially acted as peacemaker got killed. What would LeBron tweet if a black child was brutally beaten by three white men at I Promise School?

He would analogize it to Emmett Till and compare 2022 America to 1955 America. What happened to Ethan Liming is similar to what happened to Till. Till was allegedly trying to amuse his friends when he whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a white shopkeeper. Days later, when told of the incident, Bryant’s husband turned a would-be harmless joke into a murder that rocked America.

The water-gun horseplay of Liming’s black friends sparked his murder. Deshawn Stafford, 20, Tyler Stafford, 19, and Donovan Jones, 21 – the accused assailants – turned a harmless prank into a murder that LeBron James and his media sychophants want to ignore.

LeBron wore a hoodie to protest the death of Trayvon Martin, a teenage boy in Sanford, Florida. LeBron ranted that black people are hunted every day after two white men shot Ahmaud Arbery. LeBron put a target on the back of a white Ohio police officer after he shot a teenage black girl who was attempting to stab a black woman.

LeBron has smoke for everyone white he believes wrongly takes a life. He has nothing substantive to say when black people take lives. LeBron James is a stereotypical bigot. Racial bigotry, of any stripe, is rooted in lust for power. The KKK terrorized black and white people who failed to support the racist policies of the Democratic Party. That’s not an opinion. It’s a historical fact.

LeBron is a political soldier for the Democratic Party. His bigotry is rooted in lust for political power. Democrats have painted their political opponents as bigots. It’s LeBron’s job to promote that narrative. He pounces on every high-profile opportunity, and he’s not above going the Jussie Smollett route and creating faux hate crime.

He analogized himself to Mamie Till at the behest of his political puppet masters. He will never address the family dysfunction and chaos that leads far too many black boys and men to settle conflict with deadly violence. The DNC – the Dead Negroes Confederacy – loves dead negroes. The DNC forbids its constituents to publicly discuss the pervasive violence that plagues black communities.



That issue is to be ignored until it magically disappears due to indifference.

LeBron is indifferent to the violence that killed Ethan Liming. LeBron, like many leftists, expects black men to randomly kill.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-bigoted-lebron-james,2022-06-16
Whitlock: Can Elon Musk save America from the new KKK: ‘black Twitter’?,"Ten days ago, when we learned that Elon Musk bought a 9% stake in Twitter, I argued that the richest man in the world could not save and/or transform the toxic platform.

Perhaps I was wrong. Early Monday morning, Musk posted on Twitter his SEC filing to purchase the social media app’s remaining 91 percent. He wants to take the company private. His intent is to save Twitter by making it a free-speech platform again.

I’m still unsure if Twitter can be saved. And I’m not comfortable with one man having so much influence over public discourse. But the news of Musk’s $43 billion takeover bid has me feeling a bit optimistic. Musk can’t make Twitter worse, can he?

The platform’s hostility to truth, amplification of secular values, and promotion of identity politics have undermined the principles that inspired American freedom and liberty. Twitter – not Donald Trump, the Proud Boys, or Tucker Carlson’s brilliant monologues – is the existential threat eroding our democracy by pushing us toward violent racial conflict.

“Black Twitter,” the informal community of users who allegedly represent the identity of black people, is the bane of American society. Black Twitter is the online version of the Ku Klux Klan, the enforcement arm of a racist Democratic Party political strategy that silences truth, dissent, and biblical values with Twitter lynch mobs.

There’s no difference between the old white KKK and the new black KKK. Both groups worked on behalf of the Democratic Party. They terrorized black and white people who did not support the agenda of the Democratic Party.

Black Twitter is the Luca Brasi of the BLM-LGBTQIA+ Alphabet Mafia. For those of you who have never seen ""The Godfather,"" Brasi was a notorious hit man for Don Corleone and the Corleone crime family. When a rival crime family tried to unseat the Corleone family, taking out Luca Brasi was seen as essential.

You can’t improve Twitter and amplify truth on the platform until black Twitter sleeps with the fishes.

If Musk is serious about limiting Twitter’s ability to harm free speech and freedom, he must discover a way to dismantle black Twitter.

Fear of black Twitter is at the root of corporate media lies and false narratives. The worst nightmare of everyone in corporate media is provoking a black Twitter mob to storm their mentions, burn a cross, and demand their firing. Media employees know their bosses will acquiesce to the demand rather than risk the same mob turning on them.

So a media employee with Christian values cannot publicly state that “all lives matter.” According to black Twitter, that statement is racist. Grant Napear, a longtime broadcaster for the Sacramento Kings, was forced to resign in 2020 after tweeting ALL LIVES MATTER.

According to the Bible, Napear’s statement was Christian, not racist.

But black Twitter’s negative influence extends far beyond sloganeering. Let’s evaluate things that have happened just in the past week.

NFL coaching legend Tony Dungy, a devout Christian, had to explain why he supported Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ $70-million initiative aimed at supporting fathers. Dungy was pictured with DeSantis at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' facility. DeSantis is a Republican. Black Twitter believes black men should not work with and/or associate with Republicans. Dungy has spent his life advocating for fathers. Dungy and DeSantis have shared values on the importance of fathers and nuclear families. Black Twitter believes black people should ignore their biblical values or prioritize them below political power.

Tuesday, San Francisco Giants first-base coach Antoan Richardson, who is black, claimed that a white coach on the opposing team referred to him as a “motherf—er” and that it reeked of racism.

“I say this because his words were disproportionately unwarranted and reeked of undertones of racism when he referred to me as ‘that motherf–er,’ as if to be controlled or a piece of property or enslaved. I think it’s just really important we understand what happened tonight.”

Profanity and name-calling are commonplace in sports. Twitter has conditioned black people to see all engagement with white people as an outgrowth of slavery and racism. Antoan Richardson has been radicalized.

The same, albeit more extreme, radicalization process is at the heart of the violent and terroristic behavior of Frank James, the suspected New York subway shooter. James is a different version of Darrell Brooks, the Waukesha mass murderer. Twitter and other social media apps promote the notion that America hasn’t changed since the 1850s. James and Brooks have been convinced they’re Nat Turner, violently emancipating black people from oppression. Black Twitter rewards people for analogizing 2020 America to 1619 America. That’s why Brian Flores and Colin Kaepernick believe the NFL operates like a slave plantation. Black Twitter rewards this kind of idiocy.

It also argues that black men have every right to violently resist arrest and put themselves in position for a police officer to overreact and make a deadly mistake. Black Twitter will demand that we shout Patrick Lyoya’s name rather than learn something from his encounter with police. Lyoya is the Congolese immigrant shot and killed by a Grand Rapids, Michigan, cop after a struggle.

Lyoya wrestled with a cop and apparently tried to grab the officer’s taser before being shot while pinned to the ground. You can make the argument the police officer overreacted. But you can make a much stronger argument that it’s foolish to wrestle with a cop and reach for his weapon. Black Twitter won’t allow us to make that argument.

Neither will it allow us to have an honest discussion about the actions that led to NFL quarterback Dwayne Haskins’ tragic death. When black men die, black Twitter demands that we worship them and never critically evaluate their actions.



Black Twitter believes only the actions of white men matter. Everyone else is nothing more than a potential victim of the actions of white men. That worldview is inconsistent with a biblical worldview. That worldview emasculates every man who isn’t white. That’s why I call black Twitter the black KKK.

Both groups are dedicated to emasculating black men at the behest of the Democratic Party.

Here’s hoping Elon Musk, a white African, can save America from the KKK.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-can-elon-musk-save-america-from-the-new-kkk-black-twitter,2022-04-14
"Whitlock: 'Chill pill' New York subway assault exposes the weakness of men, the foolishness of women, and the strength of the racial grievance industry","There's a twitter feed: @libsoftiktok. Its bio states: ""Showing how society is deteriorating through videos."" The feed launched approximately one year ago. It has nearly 370,000 followers.

Libs of TikTok is the predictable reaction to the 2020 Summer of George Floyd, the ""Karen"" videos, and the past decade of viral social media videos second-guessing police-involved shootings of black suspects by white cops.

Influencers such as Shaun King and DeRay McKesson built followings and raised money popularizing the belief that white police officers were wildly, randomly, and frequently killing unarmed black men. Corporate media outlets played along with the ruse because it increased ratings, clicks, and relevancy. Young journalists such as Wesley Lowery rode the ruse to a Pulitzer Prize while at the Washington Post and then parlayed that notoriety into a lucrative TV job at CBS Evening News. Colin Kaepernick rebranded from NFL flop to social justice martyr. LeBron James cast himself as the inarticulate Muhammad Ali. Working in conjunction with Black Lives Matter, the Democratic Party raised funds, terrorized major cities, mobilized voters, weaponized poll workers, defunded and demoralized the police.

For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Social media's racial grievance industry has finally spawned a clever white rebuttal — Libs of TikTok.

Among many other things, the feed showcases instances of bad behavior by black Karens or Kendricks. Here's a video of a Rutgers University professor going on a racist rant for five minutes. The professor is a garden-variety Stacey Abrams.

But here's a more interesting video. It shows an ugly incident on a New York subway. A black man punches a white woman for using the phrase ""chill pill."" You should watch the whole video. It's both sickening and fascinating. The violence is sickening. The reaction to it is fascinating.

No one reacted. Women didn't move to check to see if the woman was harmed. Men didn't move to defend the woman. Everyone froze and watched.

The most prevalent response on Twitter was to blast the men for not coming to the woman's defense. That was my gut reaction. And then I thought about what I would do in that situation. On my podcast and in these columns, I spend a lot of time talking about the need for men to be bold, fearless, and masculine.

What would I have done on a crowded subway had I witnessed a deranged bully confront a woman and then strike her for saying he needed to take a ""chill pill""?

If the woman were a friend or relative, I know exactly what I would have done. I would have struck the man and dealt with the consequences, whatever they were. But what if the woman were a stranger, a damsel in distress?

I can't confidently say I would have reacted. Not in 2021. Twenty years ago, I would at the very least have moved to restrain the man until the police arrived. Now I have no confidence that the police will arrive. My perception of New York is that the city is lawless. Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken drastic measures to limit the authority and prevalence of law enforcement. Many major cities have done likewise.

Corporate media and social media champion black criminal suspects. By defending a white woman from the attack of a black suspect, any man, whether white or black, runs the risk of being vilified and harassed.

A year ago, a white cop shot a black girl as she tried to stab another black girl. The cop was demonized. LeBron James sent a menacing tweet that targeted the police officer.

The left has established a culture that works against men defending women. The culture is double-edged. The victim of the subway attack has bought into the new culture, too. She believed there was upside in verbally confronting a deranged male nutjob. I'm not blaming the victim. She's a victim. I just happen to believe 20 years ago she would've turned away from the male nutjob.



I feel sorry for the woman. I feel sorry for all of us. We're hostages to a society dominated by illogic, dishonesty, and racial grievance. The system is rigged for men to be weak, women to be foolish, and nonstop racial conflict.

We're rigged for self-destruction.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-chill-pill-new-york-subway-assault-exposes-the-weakness-of-men-the-foolishness-of-women-and-the-strength-of-the-racial-grievance-industry,2021-10-28
Whitlock: Democrats form new confederacy founded on love of dead negroes,"Democrats should rename their governing body. The Democratic National Committee, established in 1848, in no way reflects the modern platform, agenda, and strategy of the party.



The Dead Negro Confederacy more accurately characterizes the political party obsessed with George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, the 1921 Tulsa Massacre, and 70-year-old racial lynchings.

Dead negroes fuel the DNC.

Yesterday, Charles Booker, a Senate candidate running for Rand Paul’s Kentucky seat, released a 72-second ad featuring a noose tied around his neck. In the ad, Booker claimed mobs lynched his ancestors. Via Twitter, he stated three of his uncles were lynched in Kentucky.

“Lynching is a tool of terror,” Booker wrote. “It was used to kill hopes for freedom. In Kentucky, it was used to kill three of my uncles. In this historic election, the choice is clear. Rand Paul may want to divide us, but hate won’t win this time. It’s time to move forward, together.”

Booker’s commercial criticized Paul for blocking federal anti-lynching legislation. The accusation is disingenuous. After objecting to a proposal that failed to properly define lynching, Paul, alongside Republican Tim Scott and Democrat Cory Booker, co-sponsored the Emmett Till Antilynching Act that is now federal law. The law is purposeless, cosmetic, and totally political. For the last 60 years, death by lightning strike has been far more prevalent than lynching.

What has become prevalent in recent years is leftist public figures and political activists using relics of America’s racist past and dead black criminal suspects to advance their careers.

Charles Booker stole his campaign strategy from Jussie Smollett, the actor who tied a noose around his neck to gain popularity. The ploy backfired on Smollett. It worked for NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace. Wallace rose from obscurity and a lack of sponsorship support on the ridiculous insinuation that a garage-door rope was really a threatening hangman’s noose.

Two years ago, Booker thought he could ride the momentum of Black Lives Matter and his participation in Breonna Taylor protests to challenge Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell for his seat. During his bid for the Democratic nomination, Booker ran a more traditional campaign. He espoused stereotypical, far-left, Bernie Sanders-approved political policies such as universal health care and the Green New Deal. Booker failed to get out of the Democratic primary. He lost to Amy McGrath, who lost a relatively close race to McConnell.

Booker’s supporters blamed the racism of white Democrats for his primary defeat. It’s no surprise that Booker is back campaigning with a racially divisive message. It’s the primary message of the Dead Negro Confederacy. The Grand Wizard of the DNC, Barack Obama, modeled the strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Uvalde massacre.

Obama told the Dead Negro Confederacy, “As we grieve the children of Uvalde, we should take time to recognize that two years have passed since the murder of George Floyd.”

The DNC does everything it can to keep dead negroes at the top of mind for the American public. Wednesday, President Joe Biden commemorated the Tulsa race massacre, tweeting:

“Today, we remember the hell unleashed 101 years ago in Tulsa, where Greenwood was raided, firebombed, and destroyed by a violent white supremacist mob. It wasn’t a riot, it was a massacre. We must continue to reckon with the past and work to build a more just future.”

The Dead Negro Confederacy strikes again. Democrats do not offer solutions. They tell black people to lock their eyes on the rearview mirror or risk being caught from behind by racists. It’s the Dead Negro Conspiracy, the conspiracy theory of choice for the left.

In their preferred conspiracy, the only thing standing between black people and a noose is the Dead Negro Confederacy.

Vote Democrat or die!

That’s the same message the KKK sounded when six former Confederate soldiers founded the organization in 1865. The KKK worked on behalf of the DNC. It’s always been the Dead Negro Confederacy.

Dead negroes have long served as the platform to elevate Democrat politicians. It explains why the Dead Negro Confederacy is perfectly comfortable with Planned Parenthood and the astronomical number of black babies killed in abortions. It also explains why cities controlled by the Dead Negro Confederacy have high murder rates among their black citizens and support defunding police.

The Dead Negro Confederacy strives to make black people vulnerable and dependent on the goodwill of government. The DNC is against self-sufficiency and self-defense. It has pitted law-abiding black people against law enforcement by convincing black people that we’re all George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, or Emmett Till.

We’re not.

Tamir Rice is not analogous to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old brutally killed in 1955 after a white woman accused him of untoward behavior. An overaggressive police officer made a tragic decision to shoot Rice while the 12-year-old was holding a toy gun.

The only people who should worry about dying the way Floyd did are people who regularly use fentanyl and think it’s wise to disobey police officers for 20 straight minutes.



If you’re a woman and believe you could be killed in a similar fashion to Taylor, I strongly urge you to get a new boyfriend. Ditch him for a man strong enough to leave you in the bedroom while he checks on the trouble at the front door and one smart enough not to indiscriminately fire his gun at police or intruders on the other side of a door.

Everyone else should be asking themselves what they find so redeeming about the Dead Negro Confederacy. Perhaps it’s the organization’s position on climate change. Let’s hope it’s not the DNC’s affinity for dead negroes.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-dead-negroes-confederacy,2022-06-02
Whitlock: Democrats sentence black children to ‘Lord of the Flies’ existence,"Beelzebub killed James Lambert, a 73-year-old Philadelphia man.



Beelzebub is one of the seven princes of hell. In biblical times, Beelzebub was a god worshiped in Ekron. He could fly. Beelzebub means Satan. In popular culture, he’s known as Lord of the Flies.

The video of seven children stoning and beating James Lambert to death in the streets of Philly reminded me of the iconic 1954 William Golding novel ""Lord of the Flies.""

The book explores the barbaric and cannibalistic descent of a large group of young boys who survive an airplane crash on an uninhabited island. ""Lord of the Flies"" features seven main characters: Ralph, Jack, Simon, Piggy, Roger, Sam, and Eric. The initial alliance among the boys disintegrates into chaos as they’re overtaken by paranoia about an imaginary monster, “the beast.”

""Lord of the Flies"" is one of the greatest novels ever written. It expertly depicts man’s battle with morality and immorality, groupthink and individualism, logic and emotion.

Children left unguided and unsupervised descend into wickedness. That’s what killed James Lambert.

Police in Philadelphia believe seven children are responsible for the death of Lambert. Last week, law enforcement released surveillance video showing four black boys and three black girls stalking Lambert at 3 a.m. A young black girl appears to club Lambert over the head with a pylon street cone. Other kids are accused of hitting him with rocks and kicking him.

The video looks like a scene from ""Lord of the Flies 2.0."" Or maybe it’s a mash-up of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Purge.""

Unsupervised children on the uninhabited streets of Philadelphia at 3 in the morning terrorizing an old man. This is a crisis of the cultural rot black America has chosen to ignore and/or embrace at the behest of the Democratic Party and the Hollywood elite.

The imaginary “beast” is white supremacy. We spend nearly every waking moment paranoid that the Proud Boys or the Patriot Front or Trump supporters are terrorizing black people. We falsely claim that routine police stops could result in any of us being the next George Floyd.

I don’t use fentanyl and I don’t bicker with the police. There’s virtually no chance of me being the next George Floyd or Eric Garner or Jacob Blake. That’s a paranoid delusion the Democratic Party has asked black people to embrace. I reject it.

No woman in my house will ever be the next Breonna Taylor. I’m not a coward. I won’t allow a woman to walk to the front door with me if I believe intruders are trying to enter. I’ll leave her in safety and deal with the problem myself.

I choose to live in reality and disavow delusion.

The truth is too many black children are living in a ""Lord of the Flies"" reality. They live on uninhabited islands with little to no adult supervision. There are too many fatherless homes and way too many baby mamas. Black children are descending into depravity and insanity.

It’s not just in Philadelphia. The video out of Minneapolis showing toddlers barefoot and in diapers berating and attacking police is another scene from ""Lord of the Flies 2.0.""

Beezlebub has his hooks in our children. Yes, the same goes for too many white children as well. But that’s a deflection, a whatboutism. Seventy-five percent of black children are born to unwed mothers. That’s an uninhabited island, a recipe for violence and chaos.

White people are not in denial that something is going wrong with their kids. They go on national television and talk about it constantly. They complain about the decline in traditional family structure.

We, black people, act like improving white people will fix what’s wrong in Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Minneapolis, and every other city with a large black population. We act like there’s no benefit to improving us.

We’ve swallowed the ideology of the Democratic Party. It’s the ideology of Beezlebub.

Yesterday, I interviewed Jerone Davison, a former running back for the Oakland Raiders turned minister turned political hopeful. Davison made news last week when he released a provocative commercial that blasted Democrats as hooded Ku Klux Klansmen.

Monday, during our interview, Davison amplified his attack on Democrats.

“We’ve got to stand up and fight against these people, the Democrats, because I believe that the evil one, the wicked one, Satan has landed in their hearts and we’ve got to fight before they take away our freedoms.”

I’m sure, to some of you, that sounds hyperbolic and needlessly partisan. A Republican running for Congress argued that the political party of his opponents is possessed by demonic forces. It’s not crazy. Not to my ears. Not if you understand that black children are living in a ""Lord of the Flies"" reality.

I have friends who are lifelong Democrats. Most members of my family – the people I love the most – are lifelong Democrats, Biden voters, Clinton lovers, and Obama worshippers.



None of them seem willing to deal with the unhealthy reality that is the situation of too many black children. You can’t raise stable kids in unstable, unsupervised communities. Pronouns won’t fix it. Critical race theory won’t fix it. Villages can’t raise kids. It takes two parents, a man and a woman. It takes a commitment to preaching and practicing morality. It takes biblical values.

""Lord of the Flies"" is a novel about what happens to young kids when they’re separated from God’s natural order and family structure. Beezlebub and the seven princes of hell take control.

It’s foolish and unproductive to blame “the beast” (white supremacy) for our collective disobedience to God. That disobedience cost James Lambert his life.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-democrats-black-children-lord-of-the-flies,2022-07-12
Whitlock: The DNC and the Black KKK shocked that I would photoshop LeBron James in outfit they designed for him,"The DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party, has been dressing black voters in Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes for 60 years.



Yesterday, I ran a photoshopped image with my column of LeBron James in a hood and robe to hammer a point I made in the column about the NBA player and leftist's bigoted attitude toward black people and indifference to the murder of a white teenager, Ethan Liming.

It’s not the first time – nor will it be the last time – I have made reference to a Black KKK. My first reference was in late 2007 after the murder of NFL star Sean Taylor, who was murdered inside his home. Prosecutors charged five men – Venjah Hunte, Eric Rivera, Jason Mitchell, Charles Wardlow, and Timothy Brown – with burglarizing and murdering Taylor. Before police identified and arrested the assailants, I wrote a piece predicting that Taylor died at the hands of the Black KKK, a term I created to describe the criminal gangs of young people who terrorize black communities.

My column and use of the term “Black KKK” shocked and angered leftists. Fifteen years later, leftists are still feigning shock, anger, and disbelief that I would argue that a KKK-like pathology afflicts black people who swallow leftist ideology.

The left-wing website Mediaite acted like the LeBron photoshop was a whodunit, publishing a piece titled “For Some Reason, The Blaze Published a Photoshopped Image of LeBron as a Klansman on a Jason Whitlock Article.” John Whitehouse, a reporter for the alt-left media platform Media Matters, complained over Twitter: “The Blaze – a far-right website of Glenn Beck, Steven Crowder, Mark Levin and more – photoshopped @kingjames into a KKK hood for a column by Jason Whitlock; archived version here:”

This isn’t a whodunit. I did it. I’ve been doing it. I’ve been arguing for years that white political leftists have forced black culture and people to adopt the mindset of the KKK. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 and served as the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. It terrorized black and white people who refused to support the racist policies of the Democratic Party.

That’s not an opinion. It’s a historical fact.

There’s a myth promoted by Democrats that the party abandoned its racist policies and attitudes in the 1960s after losing the civil rights war. They did not shift their attitudes and policies. They seduced black people into adopting their anti-black attitudes and policies.

The Democratic National Committee, the governing body of the Democratic Party, massaged its name without telling black people or the media. In the late 1960s, the DNC switched to standing for Dead Negroes Confederacy. The Dead Negroes Confederacy loves dead negroes. Its policies and attitude promote the deaths of negroes.

LeBron James, most celebrity influencers, John Whitehouse, the writers at Media Matters and Mediaite, Joy Reid, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, Al Sharpton, and on and on are rewarded for advocating the policies of the Dead Negroes Confederacy.

Let’s take a quick glance at some of the DNC’s best work:

The DNC has convinced black voters that the annual slaughter of thousands of black babies through abortion is a fundamental freedom and right.

The DNC has convinced black voters that George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Eric Garner are more heroic and worthy of celebration than Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, and Thomas Sowell.

The DNC, through its promotion of Black Lives Matter, has convinced black voters that the disruption of the nuclear family serves our interests.

The DNC has convinced black voters that a government check can replace a black father and husband.

The DNC has convinced black voters that all educational and behavioral standards must be lowered or removed because it believes black Americans can’t meet them.

The policies and cultural norms supported by the DNC lead to death, violence, chaos, dysfunction, and hostility toward religious faith and objective truth.

As a means of paying homage to old-school Klansmen, supporters of the Dead Negroes Confederacy fight for the right of black people and black entertainers to commodify, commercialize, and cling to calling each other “n***er.”

Worse, the work of the DNC has caused black people to be totally indifferent to black violence, carnage, and dysfunction.

Three black men allegedly murdered a white teenager and honor roll student, Ethan Liming, in the parking lot of LeBron’s I Promise School. LeBron doesn’t care. The outspoken NBA star who can seemingly never hold his tongue or Twitter fingers when anyone black is harmed by a white perpetrator has failed to say or do anything of substance about the death of Ethan Liming.

James is quiet because he’s a member of the DNC’s Black KKK. The Black KKK expects young black men to act violently and criminally. The Black KKK holds black people to no standard of moral behavior. The Black KKK believes in the superiority of whiteness and white people.

That’s why the DNC and the Black KKK are outraged whenever white people fail. Expectations are a sign of respect. The Dead Negroes Confederacy and the Black KKK have no expectations for black people.



That’s why Media Matters and Mediaite want to credit TheBlaze, Glenn Beck, Steven Crowder, and Mark Levin for my work, creativity, and excellence.

Media Matters, Mediaite, John Whitehouse, and the rest of the DNC don’t believe in black excellence. I do.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-dnc-black-kkk-lebron-james,2022-06-17
Whitlock: Gang-of-function mutation terrorizes Washington Nationals Park and America,"Saturday night in our nation's capital, gunshots outside Washington Nationals ballpark sent fans inside the stadium scrambling for safety, suspended a Major League Baseball game, and injured three people.

Mainstream corporate media blamed ""gun violence."" The more likely culprit is ""gang violence."" Police say the shots came from shooters in separate cars firing at each other. Maybe guns were behind the steering wheels and pulling the triggers. It's more likely gang members drove the cars and aimed the weapons.

As a country, we loathe talking about gang violence … unless we're glorifying it in music. We prefer to discuss the danger of guns and the evil of the National Rifle Association. I used to do it.

The last time ""gun violence"" impacted a sporting event, I argued in a column that the Second Amendment had outlived its usefulness. That was in 2012. A linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs, Jovan Belcher, shot and killed his girlfriend, then drove to the team's practice facility and shot and killed himself in front of the team's head coach and general manager.

I wrote a piece for Fox Sports stating what I believed at the time — the proliferation of handguns makes America unsafe. The great broadcaster Bob Costas read an excerpt from my column on NBC's Sunday Night Football in America.

I've never liked guns. I still don't. But the last decade has helped me understand their value in a free society. A decade ago, I took American freedom for granted. I thought the people who argued that the political left would strip Americans of basic freedoms were crazy. Now I don't. The government and Big Tech are steadfastly censoring speech they don't like. They're dictating medical choices for all of us. They've recklessly opened our borders and relaxed immigration restrictions. They've undermined respect for and support of law enforcement to the point that many major cities feel lawless.



I live in a very nice, pricey area of midtown Nashville. There have been several shootings, including a murder, within a block of my building.

I'm going to get a gun in 2021. It's inevitable.

The gatekeepers of American culture, the super elites who live in gated communities and employ private security teams, have purposely created a culture that bows to violent gang culture.

Look at the reaction to what happened at Washington Nationals Park. A fan who left the game to catch an Uber was one of the victims. Gang violence directly impacted the sports world. Are the multimillionaire social activist athletes loudly decrying what happened? Have we heard from Colin Kaepernick or LeBron James? Has Jemele Hill tweeted a word?

They're all sitting by police scanners waiting for a white cop to shoot another unarmed black resisting criminal suspect. That happens about once a month. Gang shootings happen hourly across America. But you can't gain Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook followers by taking on the Crips, Bloods, Gangster Disciples, and MS-13.

What you can do is idolize and celebrate the rappers who normalize and celebrate gang culture and gang violence. I've long had a love-hate relationship with gangsta rap music. I consider commercial rap fast food, something that I enjoy but know is bad for my health. Dr. Dre is McDonald's, Tupac Shakur is Popeyes, and Tech N9ne is Wendy's.

You can't eat fast food forever. It's going to kill you.



The glorification of gang culture is killing America. You might think it's only killing black America. That's not true.

You have to think of the left-wing gatekeepers, the Hollywood and music executives who finance the promotion of gang culture, the same way as the scientists at the Wuhan lab in China. Gangsta rap is a gang-of-function mutation that escaped the lab and is killing us all. American culture is in crisis. We've legalized a lethal dose of immorality, dishonesty, and idolatry. Our code of conduct is driven by popularity, profit, and fear.

It's safer to demonize guns than gangs. Guns don't pull triggers. Gangs do.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-gang-of-function-mutation-terrorizes-washington-nationals-park-and-america,2021-07-19
"Whitlock: Memphis murder spree a byproduct of demonic, baby-mama cultural embrace","When trying to make sense of the criminal violence ravaging Memphis, it’s important to recognize that culture kills, not color.



The fixation on color stands in the way of addressing the cultural rot that has turned the Home of the Blues into Satan’s House of Horror. Memphis is America’s most dangerous city. Each day brings new news of the chaos and anarchy terrorizing the Birthplace of Rock & Roll.

Wednesday, a teenage black boy streamed on Facebook Live his daylong shooting spree. Ezekiel Kelly’s murderous rampage caused Memphis residents to shelter in place as law enforcement hunted the deranged 19-year-old. Shooting out the window of two separate moving cars, Kelly allegedly killed four people and wounded three others in a “joyride” that started at 1 a.m. and ended in the early evening with his arrest.

Kelly is just the latest Memphis alleged killer to make national news.

A week ago, Cleotha Abston, a 38-year-old black man, allegedly abducted, raped, and murdered a schoolteacher out on an early-morning jog. In mid-July, a trio of Latino boys ages 15 to 20 allegedly murdered a 52-year-old female pastor during a carjacking. In mid-August, 32-year-old Tifanee Wright, a black woman, allegedly shot and killed a 60-year-old political activist in a dispute over money.

The recent high-profile spate of violence will make Memphis a national talking point. Memphis is the new Chicago, the new Baltimore, the new Philadelphia, the new Compton, the new Name the Major City plagued by violent crime.

The conversation will be justifiably framed as a “black” problem or a problem for “people of color.” Justifiable is not the same as accurate. Culture kills, not color.

Black people have embraced a culture of death.

Virtually every day on social media, someone accuses me of unfairly criticizing black people. I allegedly hate myself and other black people because I constantly criticize black influencers who advocate for black people by policing the behavior and culture of white people.

Yesterday, after I published my column about why South Carolina basketball coach Dawn Staley should fear Memphis far more than Provo, Utah, a man purporting to be a Christian minister complained that I was “anti the black agenda.” Staley canceled South Carolina’s games against Brigham Young University because a BYU fan allegedly yelled racial slurs at a Duke volleyball player. I argued that Staley’s players would be in far more danger when they played at Memphis in 2023.

I don’t hate myself or black people. I hate the culture black people have embraced. I’m critical of the high-profile advocates of the progressive, secular, hedonistic, and materialistic culture that currently defines “black culture.”

They have a worldview that directly opposes my biblical worldview. They believe the highest form of humanity is victimhood. I reject that. With Jesus on my side, I cannot fail. My ultimate victory is assured. They believe that white people control the destiny of black people. I reject that, too. They believe in the attainment of financial wealth by any means necessary. I don’t. They believe the improvement of white people improves black people. I believe my improvement improves me. I could go on and on.

Bottom line: “Tha Culture” is satanic. Its wicked intent and manifestation can be most easily seen in commercial hip-hop music.

Memphis’ importance to “Tha Culture” was elevated a year ago when a relatively unknown rapper, Young Dolph, was murdered. Corporate media and the other satanic co-conspirators all pretended that Young Dolph was Young Elvis Presley. Young Dolph was nothing more than a local Memphis rapper who promoted a satanic worldview.

His successor is his cousin, Jay Fizzle, a 28-year-old deadbeat with more than 20 kids. Fizzle recently sat down for an interview with at least 15 of his “baby mamas.” He wants to do a TV show about his kids and their mothers.

If you want to understand what’s the matter with Memphis, watch the Jay Fizzle interview on YouTube. If you want to understand why I call “Tha Culture” satanic, watch the Jay Fizzle interview.

“Baby mama” culture produces 19-year-olds who livestream their killing sprees. The destruction of family destroys all morals, norms, and order.

Culture kills, not color.

I will never apologize for hating the culture that celebrates, tolerates, and proliferates a mindset that teaches black people to see themselves as victims, dependent on white guilt, and criminals.

Our fixation on color prevents us from examining the culture we’ve adopted or been assigned.

Last week, the Tennessee Titans announced a partnership with the Memphis rap group Three Six Mafia. The NFL franchise hired DJ Paul and Juicy J to write a theme song for the organization. This is an example of the NFL being “inclusive” and reaching out to the black community.

Three Six Mafia is a clever way of saying 666, the number that signifies the Devil, the antichrist. It’s taken from the Book of Revelation, chapter 13, verse 18: “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.”

The evil is hiding in plain sight. Look at the NFL’s choice in Super Bowl halftime entertainment last year – Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Eminem. The most powerful force in popular culture – the NFL – believes the best way to show affection toward black people is by embracing a musical genre that celebrates a satanic worldview.



Tha Culture is killing us. It’s not white people or black people killing us. It’s the culture we’ve chosen to embrace.

I’m going to continue objecting to this culture. I’m going to continue criticizing the black and white people who promote this death culture. If that makes me a sellout, consider me bought and sold.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-memphis-murder-spree-demonic-culture,2022-09-08
Whitlock: NBA free agency is proof frustrated sports fans must have a great reset of expectations,"Those of us waiting for professional sports to bottom out and learn a hard lesson for embracing anti-American sentiment need to anchor down for a much longer wait than we anticipated.



Maybe our grandkids will benefit from our patience. I'm not sure we will live to enjoy the reckoning we naively think is coming. Professional sports appear impervious to our frustration and abandonment. No one cares that we don't watch the way we used to, that we don't attend the way we used to, that we don't buy jerseys the way we used to.

NBA free agency, which started on Monday, serves as a reminder of how little we seem to matter in this new and woke America. It's business as usual in the NBA. Players many of you have never heard of are signing massive contracts.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander inked a $172 million deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Norman Powell received $90 million to return to the Portland Trail Blazers. Daniel Theis signed a $36 million deal to join the Houston Rockets. Evan Fournier agreed to take $78 million over the next four years from the New York Knicks.

Alex Caruso, the backup point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers? The bald white guy who wears a headband? He averaged 6 points last season. The Bulls gave him a four-year contract worth $37 million on Monday. He's going to make more money in four years than Magic Johnson made in 13 NBA seasons.

Alex Caruso, no relation to the seaman Robinson Crusoe.

For the past few years, traditional sports fans convinced themselves that eventually pro sports and pro athletes would pay a harsh price for the insanity Colin Kaepernick started five years ago. We watched the TV ratings dip in basketball, football, and baseball. We assumed the negative economic impact would quickly be passed on to the woke players.



That's how capitalism works. Or worked.

For many of us, sports operated as a microcosm of the larger society. We envisioned telling young people: ""See, you can't stick your finger in the eye of your customer base. The customer is always right.""

That's not true anymore. Professional sports operate now as a microcosm of the Hollywood movie industry. Message is far more important than the product. There is no negative consequence for bad product, declining box office receipts, or lack of relevance. Our current economic entertainment system only penalizes bad messages. Failure to tow the woke line results in a loss of revenue.

LeBron James' ""Space Jam 2"" is a box office failure. No one cares. It sends the right message. Most of the movies in contention for the Academy Award for best picture aren't very compelling and underperform at the box office. This has been going on for at least a decade. I first noticed it in 2013 when ""12 Years a Slave"" won three Oscars, including best picture. The movie is virtually unwatchable. It's a collection of slavery brutality scenes strung together. There's no humanity, not amongst the slaves or their captors. The lead character, Solomon Northrup, is separated from his wife and child. Northrup had been a free man. The movie should've tugged at your heartstrings over his loss of family and love. Instead, it terrorized your sensibilities. It was a horror flick.

It's a bad movie. But it conveyed the right message: America is evil.

The NBA is a mediocre product in comparison to the league 25 years ago. It's not as competitive or entertaining. The same is true for the NFL and Major League Baseball. There are no consequences for the decline in relevance or quality of play. No consequences the players can feel.



We've printed so much money that institutions that support the globalist agenda can operate without fear of consequence. Nike and other international corporations act as sugar daddies for the leagues that do their bidding.

No wonder the NFL is doubling down this season on social justice messaging. We're not the target audience. The games are no longer about the fans at all. The games exist to push the product and agenda of major corporations.

The great reset in sports has happened, and there's nothing we can do about it.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-nba-free-agency-is-proof-frustrated-sports-fans-must-have-a-great-reset-of-expectations,2021-08-03
Whitlock: Richard Sherman’s criticism of Matt Stafford shows Sherman still plans to be left-wing Charles Barkley,"Yesterday, NFL star and Stanford grad Richard Sherman made great use of his black privilege.

Sherman announced his retirement from football and launched his TV broadcasting career by climbing on the back of Super Bowl-winning quarterback Matt Stafford.

Sherman took a massive dump on the idea of the Rams’ Super Bowl victory justifying Stafford’s candidacy for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A handful of broadcasters on ESPN and the NFL Network floated the idea of Stafford wearing a gold jacket. Sherman filed a strong objection over Twitter.

“The HOF bar is incredibly low now,” Sherman tweeted. “Like a participation trophy. No all decade team. No All pro. No MVP. 1 Pro Bowl. Not even MVP of the SB. Never considered the best in any year he played. At least M(att). Ryan has an MVP.”

Sherman went back and forth with people defending Stafford. He added: “All Pro is a measuring stick. All Decade is a measuring stick. Those show you were considered best at your position during the time you played. If you were not in that discussion you def shouldn’t be in HOF consideration.”

In a different tweet, Sherman said: “There’s no measuring stick that makes Stafford a hall of famer other than playing in the most passer happy decade in NFL history. Inflated numbers make ever(y) QB that starts 10+ years a hof.”

Every word of Sherman’s critique is 100 percent accurate. I agree with every single word. The Hall of Fame has lowered the standard for induction. Very good players are being enshrined alongside all-time greats. Stafford, at the moment, is not worthy of Hall of Fame consideration.

Sherman’s commentary is fair. It’s just extremely unusual coming from an active NFL player, especially a player as accomplished as Sherman. Stafford and Sherman are peers. They’re the same age. Their careers overlapped. There’s a fraternity among NFL players. They’re generally highly reluctant to criticize each other in a straightforward manner. Unless they’re in the process of transitioning to a second lucrative career.

Richard Sherman is done as a player. He finished the 2021 season on injured reserve for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs picked him up in October. He played his last game in mid-December. Since then, Sherman has focused on his podcast.

A week before the Super Bowl, on his podcast, Sherman began his attack on Stafford’s legacy. Those comments were mostly ignored. Sherman aired his Stafford critique on Twitter so that the media would notice, particularly media executives.

A few years ago, it was a foregone conclusion that Sherman would easily transition into a TV broadcasting career. That was before cameras caught Sherman terrorizing the home of his wife and in-laws in July 2021. Sherman wrestled with police. He was eventually arrested and charged with driving under the influence, endangering roadway workers, resisting arrest, and domestic-violence-related counts of malicious mischief and criminal trespass.

The incident raised questions about Sherman’s mental stability and undermined his prospects of landing a high-priced, cushy studio job.

Enter Matt Stafford. The Rams’ quarterback offered Sherman an ideal opportunity to remind television executives why they coveted his services before the domestic dispute. Sherman has been on the radar of TV networks since his 2014 NFC Championship postgame interview, when he shocked Fox Sports sideline reporter Erin Andrews with a boisterous attack on 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree.

“Don’t you ever talk about me!”

It’s arguably the most famous postgame interview in the history of sports. It established Sherman as the loudest mouth in football and football’s answer to Charles Barkley.

It was easy to imagine Sherman earning $5 to $10 million a year talking football. That’s quite the football golden parachute. Thanks to the domestic incident, things are much trickier for Sherman.

Enter Matt Stafford. The Rams’ quarterback offered Sherman the perfect opportunity to promote his podcast and tempt TV executives. Criticizing Stafford is low-risk. He’s white. His wife once criticized Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling and complained that Michigan’s mask mandates were authoritarian. Plus, at this moment, Stafford’s resume is unworthy of Hall of Fame consideration.

Richard Sherman can’t lose. Publicly ripping Stafford is a win-win-win situation for Sherman. It’s a good controversy. It overshadows his last controversy – the video of him trying to bulldoze his father-in-law’s front door. The criticism of Stafford demonstrates Sherman’s ability to state opinions that drive conversation on other platforms. Sherman’s handlers will take the stories written about the reaction to his Stafford comments and show them to media executives as proof that the media has moved beyond his domestic incident. It’s all forgotten.

Sherman’s next publicity stunt will be to take a strident political stance or accuse someone white of racism. Maybe he will offer strong words in support of Brian Flores and his discrimination lawsuit against the NFL.



Richard Sherman was supposed to be the left-wing Charles Barkley. He is in the process of rehabilitating his broadcasting career. Stafford is just a pawn in Sherman’s personal chess game.

Who knows? Tom Brady could be Sherman’s next chess move.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-richard-shermans-criticism-of-matt-stafford-shows-sherman-still-plans-to-be-left-wing-charles-barkley,2022-02-15
Whitlock: September 11 is now a day to remember why we are divided,"A high school outside Seattle canceled plans for students to dress in red, white, and blue at a Friday night football game because administrators feared the colors would be perceived as racially insensitive.

Predominantly white Eastlake High played predominantly black Rainier Beach on Friday, one day before the 20th anniversary of 9/11. Students at Eastlake planned to decorate themselves in patriotic colors to honor first responders and the Americans killed on that day.

According to emails obtained by a local radio host, the principal at Eastlake told concerned parents the school nixed the plans because the colors could ""unintentionally cause offense to some who see it differently.""

Eastlake is 62% white, 22% Asian, 8% Hispanic, and 1% black. Rainier Beach is 60% black, 24% Asian, 9% Hispanic, and 5% white.

Patriotism is polarizing. It's defined now as an expression of white supremacy.

How did we get here? And how did we get here so fast?

Twenty years ago, we allegedly rallied around the flag. We put aside our political, religious, and racial differences and united against a common enemy — the threat of terrorism.

Or did we? Is the unity sparked by 9/11 just another example of fake news, of narrative subjugating fact?

I'm beginning to believe so. Sept. 11, 2001, did more to tear us apart than bring us together. Sept. 11 will be scrawled across the tombstone of the United States of America. It's analogous to Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated in broad daylight on a Dallas street.

Despite the best efforts of corporate media, sports leagues, and Big Tech to memorialize and commercialize 9/11 as a day of unity, its true impact on America is divisive. Remembrance of 9/11 is rooted in cynicism, skepticism, and distrust. It spawned conspiracy theories on the political right and left. From ""Loose Change"" to Alex Jones' shouts of ""inside job"" to Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" Americans were fed a justifiable smorgasbord of pessimism and bitterness.

Just like the narrative of Lee Harvey Oswald as lone assassin, few Americans believe we've been told the full truth about what happened on Sept. 11. The pervasive cynicism that engulfed America eventually led to the hyper political partisanship we have today.

We quit believing in America.

That's the real lesson of 9/11. It's an unlearned and/or ignored lesson from that tragic day. Why do I say we quit believing? Because it's the only explanation for how easily we surrendered long-established privacy freedoms to protect ourselves from diabolical and dangerous men hiding in caves in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Only non-believers abandon their beliefs as quickly as we did.

The administrators running Eastlake High School outside Seattle don't believe in America. That's why they think red, white, and blue in combination are potentially offensive and would rather cancel a harmless symbol of patriotism than risk offending a rival school immersed in critical racism theory.

The administrators are no different from the men running the National Football League. The NFL kicked off its new season with the playing of the so-called black national anthem, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing."" The NFL no longer believes in the United States of America. It symbolically supports the separate states of America.

Trust is built on truth. It's not built on individual acts of American heroism. The CBS magazine show ""60 Minutes"" aired a one-hour tribute to the 343 New York firefighters who sacrificed their lives in service to the men and women trapped inside the World Trade Center towers. The tribute was powerful and emotionally evocative. It was not remotely restorative. America cannot recapture its unity without reclaiming its regard for truth.

During the ""60 Minutes"" broadcast, the surviving New York firefighters acknowledged their shock that the towers collapsed. It was an unprecedented event that no one anticipated. Host Scott Pelley offered a brief explanation why the towers melted and caved in.



My point is that remembrances of 9/11 re-raise questions more than they re-raise patriotism.

The first responders in New York may one day be remembered as the last American patriots, the last Americans en masse to enthusiastically and heroically answer President Kennedy's challenge to ask not what your country can do for you, but to ask what you can do for your country.

Only the truth can save America. Unfortunately, we lack the capacity to recognize it and the courage to accept it.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-september-11-is-now-a-day-to-remember-why-we-are-divided,2021-09-13
AP and Biden administration are surprised that the Taliban broke its promises about Afghan girls' education,"Since the first day of the Biden administration's disastrous pullout from Afghanistan, President Joe Biden's band of experts have exhorted the American people — and the Afghan allies left we behind — to trust the new leaders of Afghanistan, the Taliban.

Few people outside the administration seemed to buy what the president's Cabinet was selling.

Except, apparently, the Associated Press.

In a piece published Wednesday morning, the news agency reported that the Taliban had announced that it would not be providing any education opportunities for girls beyond the sixth grade.

The initial report (which was subsequently edited without bothering to alert readers that any edits had been made), headlined ""Taliban nixes girls higher education despite earlier pledges,"" called the declaration by the terror group that now controls Afghanistan a ""surprise decision"" from ""the hardline leadership of Afghanistan’s new rulers.""

This means that nothing has really changed for girls in country since the Taliban took power in mid-August on the heels of the United States' abrupt and much-maligned exit from the South Asian nation — which falls in line with what most serious analysts expected from the Taliban.

However, the AP went on to repeatedly note how ""unexpected"" the move was.

""The unexpected decision came late on Tuesday as Afghanistan’s education ministry prepared for the new year opening of school, which was expected to herald the return of girls to school,"" the AP said in its original report.

""Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers unexpectedly decided against reopening schools Wednesday to girls above the sixth grade,"" the outlet said in the lede of its edited version of the story.

Like the AP, which called the moved ""so sudden,"" people inside the Biden administration were also caught off guard.

U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Thomas West tweeted his ""shock and deep disappointment"" over the terror group's declaration and ripped the Taliban for betraying its ""public commitments"" and previous statements that ""ALL"" off its people have a right to an education.

""I join millions of Afghan families today in expressing shock and deep disappointment with the Taliban’s decision to not allow women and girls to return to school above grade 6,"" West said.

""Education is a fundamental right of all human beings and is essential to Afghanistan’s economic growth and stability,"" he continued. ""This is a betrayal of public commitments to the Afghan people and the international community.""

""The Taliban have made clear that ALL Afghan citizens have a right to education. For the sake of the country’s future and its relations with the international community, I would urge the Taliban to live up to their commitments to their people,"" West added.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/ap-biden-administration-surprised-taliban-broke-promises-afghan-girls-education,2022-03-23
"Interim San Francisco district attorney fires 15 staffers under ousted, far-left DA Chesa Boudin. One progressive calls firings 'terrifying.'","Interim San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins fired 15 staffers who worked for Chesa Boudin, the city's controversial progressive DA who was ousted in an historic recall election last month.

""Today, I made difficult, but important changes to my management team and staff that will help advance my vision to restore a sense of safety in San Francisco by holding serious and repeat offenders accountable and implementing smart criminal justice reforms,"" Jenkins said in a statement, according to SFGate.

Jenkins — who quit her job in Boudin's office in 2021 to join the recall effort against him — was appointed DA by San Francisco Mayor London Breed on July 7 and will serve until November when she'll run in a special election determining who will complete Boudin’s term through 2023.

What are the details?

KTVU-TV legal analyst Michael Cardoza — a former prosecutor who worked in the SFDA's office — told the station that ""the purge allows the new DA to bring her people in that have the right mental attitude toward prosecuting crime.""

Jenkins has installed an all-female executive team, KTVU-TV reported, adding that her picks include Ana Gonzalez — one of Boudin's seven firings in his first two days in office — as well as Nancy Tung, Tiffany Sutton, and Kulvidar ""Rani"" Singh Mann.

""I promised the public that I would restore accountability and consequences to the criminal justice system while advancing smart reforms responsibly,"" Jenkins said in a press release, according to KTVU. ""I have full faith and confidence that these women will promote and protect public safety while delivering justice in all of its various forms.""

One leftist calls firings 'terrifying'

Cat Brooks, co-founder of the progressive Anti Police-Terror Project, told SFGate that Jenkins' firings are ""terrifying.""

""San Francisco has taken 10 giant steps backwards,"" Brooks told the outlet. ""Jenkins was dangled in front of us because she's a black woman, which was supposed to make us feel better, but the firings are terrifying. I hope this raises the ire of the left and makes us realize we must fight, or we will lose. We always say a shift to the right can’t happen in California, but it is happening right here in San Francisco.""

Anything else?

Boudin — a socialist who's the son of violent radicals — was elected in 2019 amid a national wave of progressive prosecutors running for office and promising to stop tough-on-crime policies they said disproportionately affected minorities.

Several key progressives such as Vice President Kamala Harris and socialist U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) supported Boudin's candidacy. Radical anti-Israel activist Linda Sarsour claimed she cried tears of joy after Boudin won.

Within his first two days in office, Boudin fired seven tough-on-crime prosecutors. He also vowed to not prosecute cases involving quality-of-life crimes, such as public camping, prostitution, public urination, and blocking a sidewalk.

But Boudin's soft-on-crime approach left the city's overwhelmingly liberal voting base with bad tastes in their mouths: They overwhelmingly supported Boudin's recall by a vote of 60% to 40%.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/15-chesa-boudin-staffers-fired,2022-07-18
12 Christian missionaries released after being held hostage by Haitian gang for 2 months,"After being kidnapped and held hostage by a dangerous Haitian gang for two months, the remaining captives of a group of 17 Christian missionaries have finally been freed.

What are the details?

A spokesman for the Haitian police, Gary Desrosiers, confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that the last 12 captives were set free this week. Two hostages had previously been released in November, and then three others were released earlier this month.

Christian Aid Ministries also confirmed the news in a celebratory statement Thursday, saying, ""We glorify God for answered prayer — the remaining twelve hostages are FREE! Join us in praising God that all seventeen of our loved ones are now safe. Thank you for your fervent prayers throughout the past two months. We hope to provide more information as we are able.""

The group then quoted a Bible verse, Exodus 15:1b, which says, “I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously.""

Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan, the home state of a few of the hostages, said in a statement Thursday, ""Today is the day we have been hoping for, praying for, and working so hard to achieve.""

""I want to thank members of the hostage negotiation team for their diligence in securing the safe release of all the hostages. This is a great day for families in Michigan and across the nation who have been worried about the safety of their loved ones,"" he added.

What's the background?

The missionaries, which consisted of 16 Americans and one Canadian — six men, six women, and five children — were kidnapped by members of the 400 Mawozo gang on Oct. 16 as they returned to home base from building an orphanage in Ganthier, Haiti, the Associated Press previously reported. Gang members reportedly seized the bus that the missionaries were driving.

The orphanage is reportedly located about an hour and a half from that Christian Aid Ministries Haiti base.

According to CNN, the captives were released at around 5 a.m. on Thursday and were found by locals who then alerted authorities. The gang initially demanded a ransom of $1 million per hostage, the network noted, adding that it is unclear if any ransom payment was ever sent.

The 400 Mawozo gang, which reportedly translates roughly to ""400 inexperienced men,"" controls the Croix-des-Bouquets area that includes Ganthier, a commune where the gang often carries out kidnappings and carjackings.

Kidnappings as a whole are up in Haiti in 2021. The United Nations reported in October that nearly 800 people have been kidnapped already this year.

“There are so many Haitians terrorized by kidnappings and extreme levels of violence, even as the humanitarian and security crisis in Haiti continues to worsen,” Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), founder and chair of the House Haiti Caucus told the Miami Herald.

“I reiterate my fervent belief that the United States and our international partners must work urgently to support Haitian-led efforts to bring about a real and accountable democracy that can bring peace and security to the Haitian people,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/17-christian-missionaries-released-haiti,2021-12-16
"19-year-old accused of attacking 3 NYPD officers with a machete was reportedly 'radicalized' online, expressed desire to fight alongside Islamic terrorists","Trevor Bickford, the 19-year-old who has been arrested and charged with a number of crimes in connection with a New Year's Eve machete attack on NYPD officers, was reportedly placed on a terror watch list by the FBI after his aunt reported that he had converted to Islam and had been radicalized by Islamic extremists online according to WCBS-TV.

Bickford allegedly attacked the officers on New Year's Eve at around 10pm. Police claim that Bickford attacked the officers ""unprovoked,"" attempting to strike one of the officers in the head, then striking two other nearby officers, causing cuts and fracturing the skull of one of the officers. Bickford was then shot in the shoulder and detained. All three officers have been released from the hospital, and Bickford is expected to recover.

One of the injured officers had reportedly just graduated from the Police Academy on Friday, according to New York Mayor Eric Adams.

Adams also said, following the incident, that ""And as we do a preliminary review of the bodycam video, we see how well these officers executed the plan that was put in place by the New York City Police Department in ensuring we protect those who came here to bring in a new year.""

Multiple outlets are now reporting that the FBI has visited Bickford's home in Maine, after it was revealed that Bickford was on the FBI's terror watch list. A source told Fox News that the FBI's counterterrorism task force had been actively monitoring Bickford in the weeks leading up to the New Year's Eve attack, and that Bickford had reported expressed interest in traveling to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban.

WCBS reports that the NYPD was not notified prior to the attack that the suspect was on the FBI's watch list.

Bickford has not yet been charged with any terror-related crimes, and the FBI has not officially confirmed the visit to Bickford's home in Maine. A spokesperson for the FBI said Sunday that ""I want to be clear that the FBI, through the Joint Terrorism Task Force, is working very closely with [NYPD] to determine the nature of this attack. And we will run every lead to ground. I also want to be very clear, as you've heard said tonight previously, this is very much an ongoing investigation, so our ability to talk about specifics is limited.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/19-year-old-accused-of-attacking-3-nypd-officers-with-a-machete-was-reportedly-radicalized-online-expressed-desire-to-fight-alongside-islamic-terrorists,2023-01-02
"21 years later, America remembers tragedy and heroes of 9/11","Sunday, September 11, 2022, marks the 21st anniversary of the attacks that claimed thousands of American lives, injured many thousands more, caused massive destruction, and set off America’s longest wars.

The day also saw countless acts of heroism, most of which were not recorded and the details of which will never be known. Kevin C. McDowell was a firefighter with Rescue 4 in Woodside, Queens who died while responding to the attacks. His son, James Dowell is now a firefighter with Brooklyn’s Rescue 2. “It makes me proud to put on the same uniform he died for,” James told the New York Post. Kevin’s remains were never recovered, but James carries his father’s Halligan pry bar with him. “We took it as our memento of him.”

“Where were you on 9/11?” is a question that will follow a generation of Americans for life. Despite over two decades having passed since the attacks, the scars of 9/11 — physical and emotional — remain.

First responders face a plethora of health issues related to their rescue efforts. A study published in 2019 found that 9/11 first responders have a roughly 25% increased risk of prostate cancer, a doubling in the risk of thyroid cancer, and a 41% increase in leukemia compared to the general population. Comedian Jon Stewart has served as the face of the effort to secure funding for ailing 9/11 victims and responders.

Sekou Siby was a cook at Windows on the World, the restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center’s north tower. Siby had been scheduled to work the morning of 9/11 until another cook asked him to switch shifts. More than 70 of his co-workers died when the towers collapsed. “Every 9/11 is a reminder of what I lost that I can never recover,” says Siby. He is now president and CEO of ROC United, a restaurant workers’ advocacy group that began as a relief center for Windows on the World workers who lost their jobs when the twin towers fell.

The events of 9/11 also served as the basis for unprecedented legislation in America, most notably the USA PATRIOT Act, which granted the federal government sweeping authority regarding surveillance, indefinite detention, and counterterrorism measures.

Some Americans choose this day to remember not only the tragedy of 9/11, but the unity felt throughout the country in its immediate aftermath. “The most remarkable aspect of the response was that there was no polarization of politics or opinion. Very few issues in our lifetime have resulted in such an overwhelmingly unanimous sentiment,” said retired Colonel Paul Cervone, who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.

Many veterans of the Global War on Terrorism — which began in the wake of 9/11 and has led to an estimated 900,000 deaths — also can’t help but take this day to reflect on last year’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. “Knowing what we know now, it still wouldn’t affect the responsibility we felt to go,” said Colonel Cervone. “Despite the sense of betrayal we had when Afghanistan fell, we remember how we felt on 9/11.”

"$27 billion Uvalde class-action lawsuit likely to target law enforcement, gun manufacturer for 'deliberate, conscious disregard' for human life","A class-action lawsuit on behalf of the victims and survivors of the Uvalde school shooting that occurred three months ago will soon be filed, and it is likely to name as defendants several law enforcement agencies and at least two firearms businesses.

Back on May 24, a shooter shut himself inside two adjoining classrooms in Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and terrorized children and teachers for over an hour before law enforcement breached the door and killed him. In all, 19 students and two teachers were murdered in the attack, and several others were wounded.

Last week, Charles Bonner of the Law Offices of Bonner & Bonner — located in the Bay Area — announced that he would soon file a $27 billion lawsuit on behalf of the Uvalde victims. He has been meeting with survivors and family members at a local church to discuss a possible lawsuit which will hold law enforcement accountable for their actions that day.

""Up to right now, there's been no accountability, there's no justice for those 19 children and the two teachers,"" said Daniel Myers, the pastor of Tabernacle of Worship church where Bonner and the victims have met.

Defendants in the lawsuit will likely include: Uvalde city police, Uvalde police chief Pedro ""Pete"" Arredondo, sheriffs, Texas Rangers, Border Patrol, and the Texas Department of Public Safety. The lawsuit will also likely target Daniel Defense, which manufactured the gun used by the shooter, and Oasis Outback, which sold it to him. Members of the Uvalde school board and city council may also be named.

Bonner claims that by their actions — and in many cases, their inactions — these individuals, businesses, and law enforcement agencies violated the victims' constitutional rights.

""People have a right to life under the 14th Amendment, and what we’ve seen here is that the law enforcement agencies have shown a deliberate, conscious disregard of the life,"" said Bonner, who is also representing victims of the recent mass shooting in Buffalo, New York.

The civil rights lawsuit will be ""one-of-a-kind in the whole world,"" Bonner continued.

The lawsuit is expected to be filed soon.

""Now it's time for all of us to stand up and demand change and protection,"" a statement on the Bonner & Bonner website says.

Other attorneys from a separate California law firm are preparing to file a federal lawsuit regarding the shooting on behalf of three individual families. Though it will not be a class-action suit, it will likely include many or all of the same defendants as the class-action suit filed by Bonner.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/27-billion-uvalde-class-action-lawsuit-likely-to-target-law-enforcement-gun-manufacturer-for-deliberate-conscious-disregard-for-human-life,2022-08-23
9/11 families tell Biden not to come to Sept 11 ceremonies,"Families of victims of 9/11 told President Joe Biden not to participate in any memorial events for the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11 unless he upholds his promise to declassify U.S. government documents regarding the terrorist attacks.

Nearly 1,800 family members, first responders, and survivors who were directly impacted by the Sept. 11 terror attacks told President Biden he is not welcome to attend any 9/11 ceremonies next month that will mark 20 years since the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans at the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

The 9/11 families will object to ""any participation by his administration in any memorial ceremony of 9/11,"" unless he authorizes the ""release of all documents and information to the 9/11 community that our government has accrued in its investigation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (and which former FBI agents have sworn establishes the Kingdom's role in 9/11) to allow us to rightfully obtain justice against the Kingdom.""

""As we approach the 20th anniversary of 9/11, and having been used as a political bargaining chip for two decades, our patience has expired,"" the 9/11 families wrote in a letter to Biden. ""We had great hope that President Biden, who campaigned on bringing truth and trust back to the Oval Office, would value the lives and sacrifices of America's citizens over diplomatic relations with a country accused of mass murder.""

""We understand President Biden's desire to mark the solemn occasion of the 20th anniversary at Ground Zero,"" the letter states. ""However, we cannot in good faith, and with veneration to those lost, sick, and injured, welcome the president to our hallowed grounds until he fulfills his commitment.""

""Since the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission in 2004 much investigative evidence has been uncovered implicating Saudi government officials in supporting the attacks,"" those directly affected by Sept. 11 wrote. ""Through multiple administrations, the Department of Justice and the FBI have actively sought to keep this information secret and prevent the American people from learning the full truth about the 9/11 attacks.""

""Twenty years later, there is simply no reason – unmerited claims of 'national security' or otherwise – to keep this information secret,"" the statement says. ""But if President Biden reneges on his commitment and sides with the Saudi government, we would be compelled to publicly stand in objection to any participation by his administration in any memorial ceremony of 9/11, given its continuation of polices that thwart Americans' rights to hold accountable those who, known evidence reveals, materially supported the 9/11 hijackers.""

In a campaign promise, Biden vowed to order his Department of Justice to ""work constructively"" on the 9/11 case, and direct his ""Attorney General to personally examine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended, and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.""

""I intend to be a President for all Americans, and will hear all of their voices,"" Biden told the families. ""The 9/11 Families are right to seek full truth and accountability.""

Brett Eagleson, who lost his father at the World Trade Center, said he and his co-signers ""collectively are at our wits' end with our own government.""

""We are frustrated, tired, and saddened with the fact that the U.S. government for 20 years has chosen to keep information about the death of our loved ones behind lock and key,"" Eagleson told NBC News.

A White House spokesperson said that its Office of Public Engagement and National Security Council staff met with 9/11 victims' family members to discuss their requests for documents and ""hear their thoughts on policy priorities,"" NBC News reported.



The administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump also declined to declassify 9/11 documents, citing national security concerns.

The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials funded al-Qaeda, but admitted that Saudi government-funded charities could have diverted money to the group.

""The Commission staff found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or as individual senior officials knowingly support or supported al Qaeda; however, a lack of awareness of the problem and a failure to conduct oversight over institutions created an environment in which such activity has flourished,"" the report said.

Families who lost loved ones in 9/11 terror attacks are furious at pundits saying Capitol riots were worse than Sept. 11: 'Dehumanizing our families for political gain',"Several left-wing commenters have dared to make the brash comparison between the terrorist attacks that rocked the nation on September 11, 2001, with the riots on January 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol. Some left-leaning pundits went so far as to proclaim that the Capitol riots were more dangerous than the 9/11 terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans and the more than 1,000 New Yorkers are believed to be inflicted with cancers related to the World Trade Center attack. The brazen comparison has incensed families of those who lost loved ones from the deadliest attack on American soil.

Democratic lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have called for a ""9/11-style"" commission to investigate the Capitol riot.

ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd said the Capitol riot was ""worse than 9/11.""

""To me, though there was less loss of life on Jan. 6 – Jan. 6 was worse than 9/11 because it's continued to rip our country apart and give permission for people to pursue autocratic means,"" Dowd claimed during an appearance on the left-wing cable network MSNBC.

Dowd then claimed, ""I think we're in the most perilous point in time since 1861 and the advent of the Civil War."" far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid agreed, ""I do too.""

Lincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt agreed with Dowd that the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was worse than the 9/11 terror attacks that ignited multiple wars, where thousands of U.S. troops died.



""He couldn't be more right,"" Schmidt said of Dowd's assessment. ""The 1/6 attack for the future of the country was a profoundly more dangerous event than the 9/11 attacks. And in the end, the 1/6 attacks are likely to kill a lot more Americans than were killed in the 9/11 attacks, which will include the casualties of the wars that lasted 20 years following.""



The Defense Department estimates 2,442 U.S. troops have been killed and 20,666 have been wounded in the war since 2001, as well as 3,800 U.S. private security contractors who have been killed, according to an Associated Press report from April.

Huffington Post White House correspondent S.V. Dáte said the Capitol riots were ""1000 percent worse"" than the 9/11 attacks that flew passenger-filled airliners into the Twin Towers in New York City, another into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C, and a fourth commercial plane that was likely intended to be smashed into the White House or the U.S. Capitol; the fourth suicide attack was thwarted by brave passengers, causing the plane to crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

""The 9/11 terrorists and Osama bin Laden never threatened the heart of the American experiment,"" Dáte stated. ""The 1/6 terrorists and Donald Trump absolutely did exactly that. Trump continues that effort today.""





Families of 9/11 victims vehemently disagree, and are outraged that such a comparison would even be made for political gain. Retired New York Deputy Fire Chief Jim Riches is offended by those who say that the Capitol riots were worse than 9/11. Riches' son, Jimmy, was among the 343 New York firefighters who perished at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

""Are they kidding me? 3,000 people died, plus we have more people dying from the air that was down there,"" Riches told Fox News. ""They're comparing it to score points politically. The families are really [angry]. When I talk to them, when they compare it to that, they find that outrageous.""

Debra Burlingame lost her brother during the Sept. 11 attacks. He was one of the pilots of American Airlines Flight 77, which was hijacked by terrorists and crashed into the Pentagon.

""It's unfortunate because we're coming up in the 20th anniversary,"" Burlingame said. ""There are a lot of young people who have no living memory of 9/11 … When you have all these comparisons and analogies, which are inflated and ridiculous, it minimizes what actually happened, and that's what's happening here. It's a deliberate ploy.""

Burlingame penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the offensive comparisons, and wrote, ""It is deeply offensive and sad that the brutal and harrowing memories of the worst terrorist attack in American history are being deployed by political partisans.""

Steven Schlag died in the World Trade Center, and his cousin Joe Connor says the comparisons are being made to ""dehumanize our families for political gain.""

""I guess they call it gaslighting,"" Connor said. ""They can say these things that will make people believe that these riots were worse than the worst thing that happened on American soil. Either they're ignorant or they're just really devious and clever, and you can put nothing past them, because if you're willing to lie to that degree … It's a disturbing trend to me.""

""I saw people jumping out. I saw the sides of the buildings explode. I saw papers floating in the wind, and I tried to call my cousin,"" Connor, who saw the Twin Towers fall, said. ""No one picked up … The terror, the carnage, the horror of 9/11, 20 years ago. They've forgotten or they think the rest of us have forgotten.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/911-terror-attacks-capitol-riots-media,2021-07-18
"Abraham Lincoln HS in San Francisco may get renamed — iconic president who abolished slavery wasn't woke enough, renaming committee head says","As TheBlaze previously reported, Abraham Lincoln's name — along with the names of dozens of other historical figures with connections to slavery, genocide, or oppression — may soon may be coming off buildings in the San Francisco school district.

Friday is the deadline to have all the names submitted for consideration — and the San Francisco Chronicle shared insights from the man in charge of the renaming committee as to why Lincoln and other figures are on the chopping block — and why others aren't.

What are the details?

""Uprooting the problematic names and symbols that currently clutter buildings, streets, throughout the city is a worthy endeavor,"" Jeremiah Jeffries, chairman of the renaming committee and a first-grade teacher in San Francisco, told the paper. ""Only good can come from the public being reflective and intentional about the power of our words, names, and rhetoric within our public institutions.""

More from the Chronicle:

To many, Lincoln was one of the country's greatest presidents, the Great Emancipator, a beloved historic figure as well as political mentor to his successors, including Barack Obama, who used the Lincoln Bible for his inauguration.



Yet the renaming of Lincoln High School was a slam dunk for the committee, which didn't even discuss it, according to video of the meetings. The members of the committee, appointed by the school board, deemed whether a person's actions or beliefs met the criteria for renaming, and moved on. The committee's spreadsheet with notes on their research listed the federal treatment of Native Americans during his administration as the reason.

""The discussion for Lincoln centered around his treatment of First Nation peoples, because that was offered first,"" Jeffries told the paper. ""Once he met criteria in that way, we did not belabor the point.""

He added to the Chronicle that Lincoln's overall historical legacy is overblown — and even that the Civil War was not fought over slavery or the liberation of black people.

""The history of Lincoln and Native Americans is complicated, not nearly as well known as that of the Civil War and slavery,"" Jeffries told the paper. ""Lincoln, like the presidents before him and most after, did not show through policy or rhetoric that Black lives ever mattered to them outside of human capital and as casualties of wealth building.""

Pushback

""He saved the country from dividing and ruin,"" Harold Holzer, a Lincoln scholar and director of the Hunter College's Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute, told the Chronicle. ""He should be honored for it.""

Holzer added to the paper that Lincoln ""was more progressive than most people. There was pretty rampant hostility [toward Native Americans], and I think Lincoln rose above it. Nobody is going to pass 21st century mores if you're looking at the 18th and 19th centuries.""

More from the Chronicle:

Lincoln's administration supported the Homestead Act of 1862 and transcontinental railroad, which led to the loss of Indigenous peoples' land. Lincoln himself largely delegated the sometimes bloody response to Native American conflicts while focusing on the Civil War, according to historians.



But Lincoln, whose grandfather was killed by a Native American, oversaw the hanging of 38 indigenous warriors after a Santee Sioux uprising in Minnesota, but only after he personally reviewed the legal cases against the 303 men sentenced to death. He saved the lives of 265 Indigenous men.



Lincoln, historians say, was focused on the Civil War and therefore did little to change policies related to Native Americans, but had planned to.



""If we get through the war and I live, this Indian system will be reformed,"" he said. He never got the chance.

But for the renaming committee, Lincoln's treatment of Native Americans was more bad than good — and that's why he made the renaming list, the paper said.

""We asked ourselves, 'Did the name under consideration meet one or more of our criteria?' If that name met criteria, they were put on the list,"" Jeffries told the Chronicle.

The paper said that's exactly the same reason Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's name landed on the renaming list.

After all, Jeffries told the Chronicle, she ""chose to fly a flag that is the iconography of domestic terrorism, racism, white avarice, and inhumanity towards black and indigenous people at the City Hall. She is one of the few living examples on our list, so she still has time to dedicate the rest of her life to the upliftment of Black, First Nations and other people of color. She hasn't thus far, so her apology simply wasn't convincing.""

More from the paper:

At the same time, labor leader Cesar Chavez didn't make the list, despite his feelings toward undocumented immigrants, who he called ""wetbacks"" and other derogatory names. He encouraged his supporters to report them to the authorities for deportation.



United Farm Worker members would form ""wet lines"" at the border and beat those crossing, believing they would be strike breakers, according to his biographer Miriam Pawel.



Jeffries said no one on the committee offered evidence that Chavez met the criteria. He did not say whether anyone on the committee looked for any.

""We did not discuss the life of Cesar Chavez except to say that he did not meet criteria,"" he added to the Chronicle.

The school board is expected to vote on the name-change recommendations early next year, the paper said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abraham-lincoln-hs-could-get-renamed-not-woke-enough,2020-12-15
"Actress Evan Rachel Wood accuses musician-actor Marilyn Manson of underage grooming, 'horrific' abuse — and then more women come forward","Actress Evan Rachel Wood says that her ex-fiancé, musician and actor Marilyn Manson, ""horrifically abused"" and ""brainwashed"" her, even grooming her as a teenager.

Wood and Manson began dating in 2007 when she was 19 years old and he was 38.

What are the details?

Wood, 33, says that Manson — real name Brian Warner — carried out heinous acts of abuse on her during their relationship.

In a Monday morning Instagram post, Wood wrote, ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""

Her post continued, ""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

Indeed, in 2009, Manson told Spin magazine that he often ""fantasized about smashing [Wood's] skull in with a sledgehammer"" after they broke up at one point during the tumultuous affair.



Wood first spoke of experiencing partner abuse during a 2016 Rolling Stone interview. She did not announce the name of her alleged abuser at the time, saying only that she endured disturbing abuse.

In 2018, Wood testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee in support of the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights, saying that she personally experienced ""toxic mental, physical, and sexual abuse"" and more. She did not announce the name of her alleged abuse at that time, either.

Wood's latest allegations opened up a floodgate of other women who reported having been abused by the performer.

Some of the women report experiencing rape, torture, physical abuse, death threats, and more.

What other women are saying

According to a Monday Vanity Fair report, a bevy of other women have come forward with alleged experiences of their own.

In a since-deleted Instagram post, Ashley Walters, a woman who was seen in public with Manson in 2011, writes, ""I continue to suffer from PTSD and struggle with depression. I stayed in touch with quite a few people who went through their own traumas under his control. As we all struggled, as survivors do, to get on with our lives, I'd keep hearing stories disturbingly similar to our own experiences. It became clear the abuse he's caused; he continues to inflict on so many and I cannot stand by and let this happen to others. Brian Warner needs to be held accountable.""

Another woman, Sarah McNeilly, said that she, too, suffered from PTSD after her entanglement with Manson.

""I have been afraid to bring any spotlight upon myself as to avoid winding up in his crosshairs again,"" she admitted. ""As a result of the way he treated me, I suffer from mental health issues and PTSD that have affected my personal and professional relationships, self-worth, and personal goals. I believe he gets off on ruining people's lives. I stand in support of all that have and all will come forward. I want to see Brian held accountable for his evil.""

McNeilly said that she was initially lured in as Manson posed as ""the perfect boyfriend,"" ""claiming he was just misunderstood.""

""I was locked in rooms when I was 'bad,' sometimes forced to listen to him entertaining other women,"" she wrote. ""Kept away from certain friends or if I didn't he would threaten to come after them. I was told stories of others who tried to tell their story and their pets ended up dead. I wasn't allowed to go near other artists working on the same set, as he told me they had aids and were disgusting and if I did so he would be very upset and 'I wouldn't want that.'""

She later wrote, ""I was thrown up against a wall and he threatened to bash my face in with the baseball bat he was holding, for trying to get him to pick out a pair of pants prior to a music video.""

A woman named Gabriella added, ""It has taken me five years to speak out and say that I was in an abusive relationship. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and still suffer from nightmares. I blocked out a lot of the memories, but the feelings remain and manifest in different ways. The reason I'm finally sharing this traumatic experience is for my healing and because I'm done being silent. I don't believe it's fair for someone to not be held accountable for their horrific actions. I'm not a victim. I'm a survivor.""

She also insisted that the performer forced her to take drugs, made fun of her black heritage, and cut her while the two had sex.

A woman by the name of Ashley Lindsay Morgan wrote, ""I have night terrors, PTSD, anxiety, and mostly crippling OCD. I try to wash constantly to get him out or off of me. ... I am coming forward to he will finally stop,""

What else?

In 2011, a police report was issued against Manson for ""alleged sex crimes,"" according to Vanity Fair. He denied all accusations of wrongdoing through his attorney, the outlet reported, and later issued a statement in 2020 denying any such allegations by Wood.

""Unfortunately we live in a time where people believe what they read on the internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence,"" a spokesperson for the performer said at the time. ""The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non-fact-based information is wholly irresponsible.""

In November, Loudwire asked Manson to respond to reports of abuse.

In a lengthy statement, a spokesperson for the entertainer said:

Personal testimony is just that, and we think it's inappropriate to comment on that.



You then go on to talk about Manson being accused of ""terrible things"" by unnamed ""critics"" but offer no guidance on who these critics are and what these things are, so it's not possible to comment.



You then mention Mickey Rourke. It is my understanding that Evan Rachel Wood dated multiple people around the time she was dating Manson. Basic internet research will give you a host of other names that have not come up in any of our discussions.



Your next couple of points deal with comments Manson made in Spin magazine in 2009. Your confusion around the timeline of this is extremely worrying. The comments in Spin where Manson had a fantasy of using a sledgehammer on Evan and he cut himself 158 times was obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account. The fact that Evan and Manson got engaged six months after this interview would indicate that no one took this story literally.



You go on to talk about Manson commenting on sexual harassment, Me Too and specifically the experiences of his ex partner Rose McGowan. These are all issues that Manson has publicly addressed and are available online. Please see Channel 4 interview from 15th December 2017.



Manson has never shied away from public comment – equally he does not have to make the same comment twice.



There will be no further comment on specific songs. Your journalist had the opportunity to ask Manson about his music – one of only two interviews granted in the UK – and he chose not to. Trying to weave one section of one song from an artist with a 30 plus year career to fit a narrative is both disingenuous and troublesome.

You mention Manson's ex fiancée Rose McGowan in your questions. Rose is one of the bravest and most outspoken figureheads of the Me Too movement. Manson remains friends with McGowan and she talks very fondly of their three a half years together. There are multiple sources worldwide. I link to a Washington Post article on McGowan's memoir 'Brave' (2018).



You fail to mention Manson's ex-wife Dita Von Teese, who remains good friends with Manson. Quoting from a Female First article published in 2018, 'Dita admits she has been “lucky"" to avoid any abusive episodes in the entertainment industry in her career'.



There are also numerous articles over multiple years where Evan Rachel Wood speaks very positively about her relationship with Manson. In NetAPorters.com's The Edit (2015): “I wouldn't trade any of [our relationship],"" Wood told the mag. “I appreciate everything he taught me. I just don't think we were right for each other.""



Finally you talk about death threats. Manson knows all about those – he has had many. He has spent his career being blamed for everything from Columbine to teenage suicide. Unfortunately, we live in a time where people believe what they read on the Internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence. The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible. All we can try and do, as the media and individuals, is to use facts and truth and not hide behind gossip and conjecture to further our own agendas.

A spokesperson for Manson did not respond to TheBlaze's request for comment in time for publication.

Adam Kinzinger introduced a resolution authorizing the US military to engage Russia if Putin uses WMDs,"On Sunday, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said that he introduced a resolution to authorize the U.S. military to engage in combat with Russia should the Russian military use chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Kinzinger said while on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that any such attack in Ukraine would be a “clear red line.” He said that if his proposed resolution was passed by Congress, it would give President Joe Biden the authorization to allow the U.S. to provide military assistance to Ukraine.

The New York Post reported that Kinzinger said, “I don’t think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. I just introduced an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, giving the president basically congressional leverage for permission to use it if [weapons of mass destruction] — nuclear, biological, or chemical — are used in Ukraine.”

Kinzinger said the authorization would provide Biden leverage while also serving as a deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kinzinger said that his resolution wouldn’t ""compel the president to [use military force]. It just says if [WMDs are] used, he has the leverage. It gives him better flexibility, but also it is a deterrent to Vladimir Putin.""

Shortly after his appearance on CBS, Kinzinger released a statement on his official Congressional Twitter account that said, “Words matter, but so do our actions. I’m introducing this AUMF as a clear redline so @POTUS can take appropriate action if Russia uses chemical, biological, and/or nuclear weapons. We must stand up for humanity and we must stand with our allies.”





In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress passed an AUMF. In doing so, the national legislature authorized former President George W. Bush to use the U.S. military to launch military campaigns in the pursuit of punishing the terror groups that launched the attacks.



Congress approved a similar AUMF for the 2002 invasion of Iraq.

Kinzinger said that the U.S. must similarly be ready to engage in military conflict on behalf of Ukraine.

Kinzinger said, “Prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to. I hope we don’t get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-kinzinger-russia-war,2022-05-01
Top Democrat suggests Jan. 6 committee will tie GOP lawmakers to Capitol violence,"A top-ranking Democrat who will serve on the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol appears to have confirmed Republican suspicions that the investigation will be wielded as a political weapon against the GOP.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's appointees to the committee, told MSNBC's Nicole Wallace last week that the investigation will seek to learn whether former President Donald Trump was aware of extremist groups that attended his Washington, D.C., rally before a mob of Trump supporters moved to the Capitol, trespassing there in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election by Congress.

Schiff, who led the House Democrats' second impeachment effort against Trump after the Capitol riot, indicated the select committee will examine if Trump or any other Republican lawmakers were aware of plans to incite people to violence at Trump's rally.

""You have weeks and indeed months leading up to that date that we need to examine,"" Schiff said.

He predicted that the Biden administration will be ""much more forthcoming"" than the Trump administration in releasing documents and providing information or evidence to the committee.

House Republicans have opposed new investigations into the Jan. 6 riot, bipartisan or otherwise, claiming that existing probes by law enforcement agencies and inquiries by lawmakers already underway in Congress are sufficient to determine what happened on Jan. 6. Republicans also worry that any committee with subpoena power would attempt to drag GOP members to testify about their conversations with Trump, turning the proceedings into a kangaroo court meant to politically damage Republicans ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

Schiff hinted that the select committee investigation would seek evidence that would indeed implicate Republican lawmakers in the events of Jan. 6.

""If it leads to some of our colleagues, it leads to some of our colleagues,"" Schiff said.

Democrats are particularly interested in a phone call that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had with Trump on Jan. 6, during which the two men reportedly got into a shouting match over what was happening. McCarthy would later claim that he contacted the president to inform him of what was happening at the Capitol and that after their talk Trump agreed to put out a statement urging the rioters to cease and desist. Trump eventually released a video statement that told the rioters to ""go home"" and that ""we love you"" while repeating his claims that the election was stolen.



But McCarthy's account of the phone call is disputed by Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wa.), who said in February that McCarthy told her that Trump had repeated a false claim about Antifa breaching the Capitol in disguise to frame Trump supporters.

""McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters,"" Herrera Beutler said. ""That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said: 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'""

Schiff said he wants to know if Trump had purposefully delayed deploying the National Guard to stop the riot.

""What was going on in the White House? What the reasons were behind the delay in the deployment of the National Guard?"" he asked, listing unanswered questions he had regarding Jan. 6. ""Was there any warning given to the president about the violence that may ensue?""

""Was the president on advance notice of who some of these extreme elements were that were going to be gathering there? Was there any concern about any of the rhetoric that might be used in light of who was attending?"" he added.

Schiff stated as fact that Trump incited the ""attack"" at the Capitol, adding that the committee's responsibility would be to determine the full extent of Trump's ""role.""

Schiff also said that the committee would seek testimony from Capitol Police officers who were assaulted by members of the mob in order to showcase how a ""domestic terrorism threat"" is the biggest national security issue facing the nation.

He denied claims that Democrats were engaged in a partisan effort to politically damage Republicans.

""We really are going to do our very best to operate in a nonpartisan way,"" he said. ""We'll see what Kevin McCarthy does, whether he appoints people, what kind of people he wants to appoint.""

McCarthy has not yet appointed any Republican lawmakers to serve on the select committee. Politico reported Wednesday that many veteran lawmakers have either dismissed the investigation as a partisan exercise or are ""reluctant to take on a time-consuming probe they fear will cut into their time to shape legislation.""

The Republicans most willing to serve on the committee, according to Politico, ""are the party's firebrands,"" such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).

Speaker Pelosi appointed Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) to serve on the committee, ensuring that at least one anti-Trump Republican will feature prominently in the committee's work.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-schiff-tie-gop-to-capitol-riot,2021-07-07
US Embassy issues urgent warning to Americans at Kabul airport to leave over 'security threats',"The U.S. Embassy in Kabul issued an urgent warning to Americans to leave the airport over unspecified ""security threats"" on Wednesday.

The travel warning was the latest in the ongoing crisis involving Americans stranded in Afghanistan after the fall of the government to Taliban militants.

The statement warned Americans to stay away from the Kabul airport while those who were at several airport gates were told to leave immediately.

The statement did not specify whether the threat was from the Taliban militia, who control the city outside of the airport, or from ISIS terrorists. The Associated Press reported that the threat involved potential vehicle bombs targeting Americans and others.

The Biden administration has been excoriated by critics accusing them of poorly planning the withdrawal. President Joe Biden blamed the Afghanistan army and claimed that none of his advisors foresaw the government collapsing so quickly before the Taliban.

The Biden administration had also been reticent to produce solid figures about how many Americans were trapped in Afghanistan. On Wednesday Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that they believed 1,500 Americans were still waiting to be evacuated. Of those, 500 had been instructed on how to leave the country.

""From the list of approximately 1,000, we believe that the number of Americans actively seeking assistance to leave Afghanistan is lower, and likely significantly lower,"" Blinken said.

The Taliban has warned the U.S. against leaving any military presence in the country past the August 31 deadline. Biden has vowed to evacuate all Americans from the country before the deadline, but he was unable to say what his plan would be if he were unable to do so.

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki appeared uneasy about the possibility of Americans left behind after the deadline.

""Again, we expect there could be some, but I don't — I'm not going to get into it further,"" Psaki said.

"GOP Rep: After American exit, the Taliban and China could benefit from Afghanistan's natural resources","Afghanistan's natural resources could end up benefitting America's adversaries, according to Rep. Brian Mast.

The Florida Republican noted that making hypersonic weapons requires rare earth minerals. ""And if China has the advantage of getting those because they're buddy buddy with the Taliban, that puts the United States of America in a very bad place,"" he said.

""Any extra dollar that the Taliban gets is a terrorist government having more dollars to go out there and conduct terrorism with,"" he noted.

Mast is a decorated Army veteran who served in Afghanistan and lost both of his legs.

He said that as a person who ""fought in Afghanistan, left limbs in Afghanistan, and unfortunately a lot of friends in Afghanistan, I can tell you that there's a, a lot of reasons that we fought, and there's a lotta reasons that we didn't fight. And one of the reasons that we didn't fight is to leave a, a treasure chest for our adversaries like China and others.""

The Biden administration has faced significant criticism for bungling the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The Taliban swiftly swept control in the country, seizing the capital city of Kabul in mid-August. The U.S. presided over a chaotic evacuation effort and pulled out of the country in late August even while Afghan allies and some U.S. citizens remained stranded there.

And now, nearly two months after completing the pullout, there are still Americans stuck there who want to get out.



The State Department notified congressional staff on Thursday that it is in contact with 363 American citizens in Afghanistan, 176 of whom wish to depart, two sources familiar with the call told CNN.

AG Merrick Garland claims he was unaware of Loudoun County Public Schools sexual assault cases,"Attorney General Merrick Garland told the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday that he was not aware of the sexual assault allegations in the Loudoun County Public Schools district while facing questions on the Department of Justice's decision to investigate alleged threats of violence against school officials.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) grilled Garland on the sexual assault allegations, which were first reported by the Daily Wire. A 15-year-old gender-fluid male suspect is accused of sexually assaulting a ninth-grade girl in a restroom at Stone Bridge High School last May and then inappropriately touching another girl in a classroom at Broad Run High School in early October.

The cases are relevant because Scott Smith, the father of one of the alleged victims, was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct at a June 22 LCPS school board meeting during which the schools superintendent said there was no record of any sexual assaults occurring in school bathrooms. Smith's high-profile arrest was cited in a National School Boards Association letter to the Biden administration that asked the DOJ to investigate alleged threats of violence against school officials and likened protesting parents to ""domestic terrorists.""



Garland's response to that letter, announcing that the DOJ is ""committed to using its authority and resources"" to do as the NSBA asked, was criticized by Republicans who said the Biden administration was ""weaponizing"" law enforcement against parents.

During his question time, Roy recounted the facts of the alleged sexual assaults to Garland and asked if Scott Smith's behavior at the June 22 school board meeting, in light of what happened, was equivalent to ""domestic terrorism.""

Rep Chip Roy Eviserates AG Merrick Garland www.youtube.com

""Attorney General Garland, do you know where Broad Run High School is?"" Roy asked, to which Garland shook his head no.

""On October 6, a mere 15 days ago, inside Broad Run High School in Loudoun County, Virginia, a young girl was sexually assaulted,"" Roy informed the attorney general.

He asked Garland if he was ""aware [that] Loudoun County prosecutors confirmed that the boy who assaulted this young girl in Broad Run High School is the same boy who wore a skirt and went into a girl's bathroom, sodomized and raped a 14-year-old-girl in a different Loudoun County High School on May 28? Are you aware of those facts?""

""Are you aware further that the boy was arrested and charged for the first assault in July but released from juvenile detention?"" Roy continued.

""It sounds like a state case, and I'm not familiar with it, I'm sorry,"" Garland said in response. He added that he did not know the facts of the case.

""Is the FBI or the Department of Justice investigating the Loudoun school board for violating civil rights under authority of, say, the Violence Against Women Act?"" Roy asked.

""I don't believe so, but I don't know the answer to that,"" Garland responded.

Roy then described the events of the June 22 school board meeting, including Smith's arrest.

""The superintendent, Scott Ziegler, declared in front of the father of the girl who had been raped that the 'predator transgender student or person simply does not exist,' and that to his knowledge 'we don't have any records of assaults occurring in our restrooms,'"" Roy said.

""When this statement bothered the father of the girl — I'm a father of a daughter, I believe you are too sir — the girl who had been raped, sodomized in the bathroom of a high school by a dude wearing a skirt, that father reacted,"" he continued.

""The victim's mother is heard on a cellphone video telling the crowd what happened,"" Roy said. ""The victim's father is seen being arrested, bloodied, this man, this arrest of a 48-year-old plumber became the poster boy for the new domestic terrorism, the Biden administration, the administration in which you serve, has concocted to destroy anyone who gets in the way.""

Roy then brought up the NSBA letter.

""Attorney General, do you believe that a father attending a meeting, exercising his First Amendment rights, and yes, getting angry about whatever lies are being told about his daughter being raped in the school he sent her to be educated in, that this is domestic terrorism, yes or no?"" he asked.

""No, I do not think that parents getting angry at school boards for whatever reason constitutes domestic terrorism,"" Garland answered. ""It's not even a close question.""

Facing other questions about the case, Garland reiterated that he did not know the facts of what happened.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ag-garland-claims-he-was-unaware-of-loudoun-county-public-schools-sexual-assault-cases,2021-10-22
Air marshals tasked with 'making sandwiches' for illegal aliens at southern border despite looming threat of jihadist terrorism,"The Biden administration has tasked federal air marshals with babysitting criminal noncitizens who have stolen into the country, even though neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the White House is willing to declare the border crisis an emergency.

This mandated work may appear even more intolerable for the highly trained agents since there is now cause to suspect that Islamic terrorists are once again scheming to attack American citizens.

An old foe with the same M.O.

Despite getting roundly whipped by American forces since the September 11 attacks, elements of al Qaeda have nevertheless managed to slither into the new year.



This week, al Qaeda affiliates claimed responsibility for two simultaneous attacks in southeastern Mali, reported Africanews. The Malian Ministry of Security and Civil Protection noted Tuesday that two firemen and three civilians were murdered in one of the attacks.

Al Qaeda also vowed in the latest issue of its magazine Ghazwa-e-Hind to demolish the Ram temple being built in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, in order to replace it with a mosque.

The international jihadist group may also have new deadly designs closer to home.

Judicial Watch has obtained a document from high-level DHS sources indicating that ""Al-Qaeda says upcoming attacks on US, possibly involving planes, will use new techniques and tactics.""

Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned in September 2021 that it would take between one and two years for the terror organization, rebuilding in Afghanistan, to have ""some capability to at least threaten the homeland.""

Biden administration juggling crises it won't name

Such an attack may exploit the Biden administration's monthly assignment of 150-250 air marshals to the southern border to tackle ""a surge in irregular migration"" — a surge atop an already unprecedented wave of criminal noncitizens into the nation under President Joe Biden's watch.

Air marshals are normally tasked with securing the nation's transportation system and protecting the flying public under the supervision of the DHS' Transportation Security Administration.

Air Marshal National Council executive director Sonya LaBosco explained to Judicial Watch on Jan. 1 that the Biden administration now has tasked highly trained marshals with ""making sandwiches for [illegal aliens] and driving them around like Uber or picking up supplies.""

Fox News Digital reported that mid-2021, the Federal Air Marshal Service asked for volunteers to head down to the southern border for 30-day stints. However, in late October, the Biden administration made such tours to the border mandatory.

These mandatory deployments reportedly leave just one in 100 American flights protected by a marshal.

David Londo, president of the Air Marshal National Council, told the Washington Examiner that normally, 8% of U.S. commercial flights typically have marshals keeping watch. The Federal Air Marshal Service has roughly 3,000 marshals in its employ.

The National Association of Police Organizations questioned the DHS' decision, stating, ""We strongly question the decision by the Department of Homeland Security to divert much-needed aviation security to the southern border especially as we enter the busiest travel season of the year, particularly as a Federal emergency has not been declared at the border.""

House Republicans criticized the DHS for the move, stating that ""redirecting these Air Marshals away from their critical law enforcement functions in our nation’s skies, creating a massive risk to public safety.""

The Air Marshal National Council similarly criticized the move, filing a formal complaint accusing Federal Air Marshal Service Director Tirrell Stevenson and TSA administrator David Pekoske ""of fraud, waste, and abuse of authority and violations of federal law.""

The council noted that the TSA administrator does not have ""any authority to deploy TSA or FAM employees to the southern border to perform non-transportation-security-related matters.""

The exception that still has not been met, said the complaint, is if an emergency has been declared by the DHS secretary, which has yet to take place.

Backlash

Londo, who has warned that marshals are growing increasingly willing to risk termination over the mandated border service, recently penned a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Stevenson, and Pekoske, once again expressing concern about the misuse of the marshals in light of the more pressing need to protect America from the Islamist threat.

Londo wrote, ""As you are aware currently hundreds of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) are deployed to the southern border to preform [sic] humanitarian work to include warming up sandwiches for migrants.""

The council director previously characterized these mandated tasks as ""non-law enforcement civilian humanitarian duties.""

""We have been informed that these deployments are indefinite, in other words no end in sight for sending hundreds of FAMs to the southern border,"" he noted.

Citing the news of al Qaeda activity potentially targeting American aircraft, Londo underscored that ""deploying FAMs to the southern border to perform humanitarian work is reckless and putting [our] Nation and the people we serve at extreme risk.""

The council president noted that DHS Secretary Mayorkas had testified under oath before Congress that the border was secure and that the White House has not yet declared the crisis it facilitated at the border an emergency, intimating marshals were being wasted on a problem the Biden administration still refuses to properly acknowledge.

Londo concluded the letter by writing, ""We have to ask how can you justify sending FAMs to the border in huge numbers, when the border is in your words secure, and there is no emergency? Yet we have major security incidents happening right now affecting our aviation security.""

LaBosco, who signed both the letter and the complaint, told ""Fox & Friends First,"" ""We don't understand why these decisions are being made. The intel is clear. Al Qaeda is watching for our weak areas. Our aviation is a high-risk area. We're not protecting our aviation domain, and we're going to the border. It is absolutely madness.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/air-marshals-tasked-with-making-sandwiches-for-illegal-aliens-at-southern-border-despite-looming-threat-of-jihadist-terrorism,2023-01-06
"Top al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri killed in US drone strike, Biden announces in national address","President Joe Biden announced on Monday that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the top al Qaeda terror leader, was killed in a U.S. drone strike over the weekend.

Al-Zawahiri was killed in the home of a Taliban official in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.

“He will never again, never again, allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone and we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens,"" said Biden in his speech.

“This terrorist leader is no more,” he added.

A senior administration official offered a statement about the incident to reporters ahead of the president's address.

""Over the weekend, the United States conducted a counterterrorism operation against a significant Al Qaeda target in Afghanistan. The operation was successful and there were no civilian casualties,"" the official said.

One report said that the drone strike was carried out by the CIA and not the U.S. military. Biden did not confirm the report but he thanked the U.S. intelligence community for their part in the successful operation.

Al-Zawahiri became one of the most hunted terror leaders after he took control of al Qeada when U.S. military special forces killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011. Officials believe al-Zawahiri was one of the plotters of the horrific 911 terror attack on the U.S.

In a 2013 public statement, al-Zawahiri encouraged Muslims to unite and form a caliphate to rid their lands of foreigners and institute strict Islamic law.

""The enemy has begun to reel and collapse,"" he claimed in the 103-minute audio message.

Nine years later, al-Zawahiri is dead.

“We make it clear again tonight,” Biden concluded. ""That no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.""

"Former Kansas teacher led all-female ISIS battalion, trained children how to use suicide belts, wanted to blow up shopping mall and college: Justice Department","An American citizen from Kansas has been arrested and accused of leading an all-female military battalion for ISIS, the Department of Justice revealed on Saturday.

Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, was apprehended in Syria and transferred into the custody of the FBI on Friday.

Fluke-Ekren has been ""involved with terrorism-related activities on behalf of ISIS from at least 2014,"" the DOJ said. The former Kansas teacher was involved in the planning of a terror attack on a U.S. college campus, according to the criminal complaint filed in 2019 and unsealed after her arrest.

In 2014, Fluke-Ekren discussed a plot to ""dress like infidels"" and use a backpack full of explosives to kill students at an unnamed college, FBI special agent David Robins said in the criminal affidavit. She allegedly told a witness ""not to worry about the logistics because she knew how to get into the US from Mexico,"" Robins noted.

In 2016, Fluke-Ekren purportedly became the leader of the Khatiba Nusaybah, an all-female military unit of the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria. The battalion was composed of women who were married to ISIS fighters.

Fluke-Ekren also allegedly trained more than 100 women and children on how to use AK-47 assault rifles, grenades, and suicide belts. A witness said one of Fluke-Ekren's five children — who at the time was approximately 5-years-old — was holding a machine gun at the family's home in Syria.

Fluke-Ekren allegedly talked about blowing up a shopping mall in the United States. She purportedly planned to park a vehicle full of explosives in the basement or parking garage of the shopping mall then detonate the explosives with a cell phone.

""Fluke-Ekren considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,"" the criminal complaint reads. ""According to the same witness, Fluke-Ekren would hear about external attacks taking place in countries outside the United States and would comment that she wished the attack had occurred on United States soil instead.""

""When asked how radicalized Fluke-Ekren was, according to one witness who interacted with Fluke-Ekren in Syria, Fluke-Ekren was 'off the charts' and an '11 or a 12' on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely radicalized,"" the criminal complaint states.

Fluke-Ekren left the U.S. in 2008 and moved to Egypt. She migrated to Libya and then Syria around 2012 with her husband.

The New York Post reported, ""Her first husband was killed in Syria 2016 as he attempted to carry out a terrorist attack, prosecutors said. She subsequently wed a Bangladeshi ISIS member who also died, then married a prominent ISIS leader who headed the group’s failed 2017 defense of Raqqa.""

The Associated Press reported, ""Photos from a family blog called 4KansasKids show her and her children in the years they traveled between Kansas and Egypt, posing at the base of the pyramids in Egypt and playing in the snow in the U.S.""

Fluke-Ekren is charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, according to the Justice Department.

Fluke-Ekren is expected to have her initial appearance on Monday at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-isis-mother-teacher-terrorist,2022-01-29
American oil executives known as the 'Citgo 6' sentenced between 8 and 13 years in prison in Venezuela,"A group of American oil executives known as the ""Citgo 6"" have been found guilty of corruption in Venezuela, three years after being arrested in the socialist nation shortly after they arrived for a purported business meeting.

They were each handed sentences of several years in prison, leaving their anguished families vowing to appeal and pleading for their return.

What are the details?

The six men are brothers Alirio Zambrano and Jose Luis Zambrano, Gustavo Cardenas, Jorge Toledo, Jose Pereira, and Tomeu Vadell, all American citizens who ""are employees of Houston-based Citgo refining company, which is owned by Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA,"" according to the Associated Press.

""They had been lured to Venezuela in November 2017 for a business meeting and were arrested,"" the outlet noted.

On Thanksgiving Day, they were all found guilty of corruption and handed sentences of 8 years, 10 months in prison except for Pereira — Citgo's president at the time of his arrest — who received 13 years.

Pereira's family has written a letter to Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, pleading for the release of the 63-year-old and the others, citing his serious health conditions.

Alirio Rafael Zambrano, the brother of two of the men, told the Daily Mail the men were ""undeniably innocent,"" saying they had fallen victim to ""judicial terrorism.""

""We, the family, are heartbroken to be separated even further from our loved ones,"" he said. ""We pray that the leaders of our nation step forward and continue to fight unceasingly for their freedom and human rights.""

The outlet noted that ""Roger Carstens, the U.S. envoy for hostage affairs, said in June all six men were 'in mortal danger', with several displaying Covid-19 symptoms.""

The Daily Wire pointed to a Wall Street Journal article quoting Maduro's attempt to justify the arrest of the Citgo 6 at the time that it occurred, when he said in a speech, ""These people were born in Venezuela. They're Venezuelans and they'll be tried for corruption, for being thieves and traitors against the fatherland.""

What has the Trump administration done to help?

The Trump administration has called repeatedly for the release of the Citgo 6 by Caracas, but relations between the U.S. and the Maduro regime are tense at best. America has imposed strict sanctions on Venezuela and does not recognize Maduro as its president.

'America's Most Wanted' host vows to capture 'dirtbag' Brian Laundrie: 'This is a homicide',"John Walsh, former ""America's Most Wanted"" host, has promised to capture Brian Laundrie, a person of interest in Gabby Petito's disappearance and presumed death.

What's a brief history here?

Laundrie and Petito, his girlfriend, were traveling in a van cross-country when Petito inexplicably disappeared, and Laundrie soon arrived at his family's Florida home alone and driving Petito's van.

Authorities soon declared Laundrie a ""person of interest"" in Petito's disappearance, but Laundrie himself went missing after he reportedly went hiking in a Florida swamp reserve.

Authorities soon released bodycam footage of an Aug. 12 domestic dispute between the two, and on Monday, Fox News obtained the audio of a disturbing 911 call that revealed Laundrie was reportedly hitting Petito before the initial face-to-face encounter with police.

Wyoming authorities discovered remains on Sunday at a campsite in Grand Teton National Park that were consistent with Petito's description. An autopsy is under way.

Petito's family reported her missing on Sept. 11 after she reportedly fell out of contact with them in late August.

What are the details?

Walsh, who is famed for his 23-year stint as host of the hit show ""America's Most Wanted,"" told News Nation Now that he is ""joining the hunt"" to find Laundrie, Newsweek reported.

""I'm saddling up to catch this dirtbag,"" he said.

""This is a homicide. This dirtbag is out there. I don't know how he got out of the house with the FBI and local cops watching him day and night.""

Newsweek noted that the long-running show with Walsh at the helm ""helped law enforcement capture more than 1,200 fugitives and brought home more than 50 missing children.""

Walsh, who now hosts ""In Pursuit with John Walsh"" on Investigation Discovery, added that Laundrie's parents aren't off the hook, either.

""At some point, these parents are going to have to pay,"" he said. ""They're going to have to pay for being an accessory for putting him on the run.""

What else?

In a recent interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Walsh said that the bodycam footage of Laundrie and Petito's run-in with the police ""terrified"" him.

Walsh, who said that he watched the video with an FBI source, concluded that the exchange captured the essence of ""classic domestic abuse.""

""He terrorized her not to tell the cops,"" Walsh insisted. ""He was the aggressor and slapper and puncher.""

Walsh added that he is deeply concerned that the contents of the original 911 call reporting a domestic disturbance in which Laundrie reportedly struck Petito several times were not relayed to the responding officers.

""How is it that that 911 operator ... didn't get that information to those two deputies that stopped them?"" he said.

""They let him go and in his report said that she was the aggressor,"" Walsh added. ""She was terrified. It was just chilling that those cops didn't get the information that the person who called in was so concerned that he pulled over, a tourist, and called 911 because he saw this guy beating the heck out of Gabby. And it's so sad because she might be alive today.""

He concluded, ""It's the public that will solve this case and I believe the public will catch this guy. ... We need to see this creep brought in and pay for this.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/americas-most-wanted-host-john-walsh-capture-brian-laundrie,2021-09-21
"MSNBC analyst accuses Fox News of goading viewers into 'terrorism,' and asks if it should be 'allowed to exist'","MSNBC analyst Anand Giridharadas made the case for outlawing the Fox News cable network based on his estimation that they goaded viewers into ""terrorism"" after the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

""It's time for this question to be front and center: Should Fox News be allowed to exist? Brain-mashing as a business model shouldn't be legal,"" tweeted Giridharadas on Friday.

The first tweet of Giridharadas thread received more than 3.8K retweets and more than 16.2K likes on Twitter.



""I'm not a lawyer, but I don't understand why you're not allowed to manufacture bucatini that doesn't have a certain threshold of iron in it but you can broadcast brain-mashing falsehoods and goad people toward terrorism,"" he continued.

""If the Fairness Doctrine, applying to broadcast, was constitutional, why would a new Fairness Doctrine, applying more broadly, be a violation of that same Constitution?"" asked Giridharadas.

The Fairness Doctrine, originally implemented in 1949 by the United States Federal Communications Commission, required media outlets with a broadcasting license to present both sides of a controversial political issue fairly and equally. The FCC ended the policy in 1987 because it stifled free speech.

""Twelve percent of Americans supported the terrorist insurrection on the Capitol. After the fact. You cannot pin this only on leaders. This has been institutionalized incitement in which the media played a giant role, and democracy is endangered by it,"" Giridharadas continued.

He recognized that such a policy could be abused, but added, ""none of that means, to me, that a business model of incitement and falsehood is absolutely protected.""

Giridharadas' suggestion was immediately denounced as ""fascist"" by some critics on social media, while others questioned the practicality of banning Fox News.

""Curious where @AnandWrites thinks the Fox audience should go? Should they not have news outlets at all, should they go to a new conservative outlet that will somehow suck less than Fox, should they learn to love CNN? What's the plan?"" asked Matt Taibi of Rolling Stone.

""I am amazed that people keep suggesting this without thinking through the obvious consequences. If the government could shut down Fox News, think what the Trump admin would have done to CNN, MSNBC, NY Times, WaPo and more,"" responded Tech editor Mike Masnick.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anand-giridharadas-fox-news-ban,2021-01-22
Anarchists call for 'vengeance' over death of '100% Antifa' militant who fatally shot pro-cop activist in apparent ambush in Portland,"Anarchists are calling for ""vengeance"" and a ""week of action"" over the death of "" 100% Antifa"" militant Michael Reinoehl who fatally shot a pro-police activist in Portland over the summer in an apparent ambush:

Law enforcement officials who later attempted to arrest Reinoehl for murder fatally shot him after they said he pulled a gun.

What are the details?

The call to arms comes from ""The Base,"" which conservative journalist Andy Ngo called an ""Antifa extremist training center in Brooklyn"":

The group's campaign declares, ""'Rest in Power Michael Reinoehl. Every revolution needs people who are willing and ready to fight."" It also claims Reinoehl was ""murdered by the state"" at the behest of President Donald Trump — for which the group wants ""vengeance.""

A ""week of action"" is planned to commence Thursday all over America in order to ""avenge"" Reinoehl. Here's more from the press release from the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement:

This is a call to action and a commemoration for Michael. An injury to one of us is an injury to all. We are calling for people to take actions in their cities, towns, neighborhoods, or homes. Whether banner drops, postering, demonstrations, direct actions, lighting fireworks, commemorations, or whatever creative ideas people come up with; we want the world to know that this will neither be forgotten nor forgiven.



When the State begins targeted assassinations, rule through terror becomes consolidated. Anarchists, antifascists, and all revolutionaries must stand in solidarity against these attacks and against the capitalist, imperialist state— particularly when in the fear of collapse it bares its teeth. We will not be intimidated. We will fight.

What's the background?

Aaron ""Jay"" Danielson — a police and Patriot Prayer supporter — was fatally shot Aug. 29 after a Portland pro-Trump rally that attracted a ton of pushback from leftists. (Content warning: Language):

A Portland livestreamer captured a fatal shooting near downtown protest youtu.be

While the likes of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden suggested that Danielson was killed because his fellow Trump supporters were ""inciting responses,"" the Multnomah County district attorney's office released unsealed court documents suggesting Reinoehl targeted Danielson before shots were fired.

Reinoehl said he believed he killed Danielson in self-defense because he and his friend were about to be attacked.

Law enforcement agents fatally shot Reinoehl on Sept. 3 after they said he pulled a gun when they came to arrest him in Washington state.

It's worth noting that immediately after Danielson was killed, the Antifa faithful celebrated his death in the street. (Content warning: Language):

""And tonight I just got word, the person who died was a Patriot Prayer person,"" one woman said to the black-clad crowd. ""He was a f***ing Nazi. Our community held its own and took out the trash. I'm not going to shed any tears over a Nazi.""

She added, ""If ya'll are not angry, you're not paying attention. If ya'll are not angry, you're not with me! Everybody needs to realize what's going on in the community. Our community can hold its own without the police. We can take out the trash on our own. I am not sad that a f***ing fascist died tonight!""

Andrew Yang condemns Hamas terrorists; AOC denounces him as 'utterly shameful',"New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang condemned Hamas terrorists for attacking Israel and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called him ""utterly shameful"" in response.

Yang, an entrepreneur and former presidential candidate, tweeted his support for the Israeli people ""who are coming under bombardment attacks"" on Monday.

""The people of NYC will always stand with our brothers and sisters in Israel who face down terrorism and persevere,"" he added.



One NYC woman who did not always stand with Israel was Ocasio-Cortez, who was offended that Yang would offer his support to Israelis while he was scheduled to hand out groceries to Muslims celebrating the end of Ramadan, their religious season.

""Utterly shameful for Yang to try to show up to an Eid event after sending out a chest-thumping statement of support for a strike killing 9 children, especially after his silence as Al-Aqsa was attacked,"" she tweeted on Tuesday.

Yang told reporters that the organizers of the event asked him to cancel his appearance.

Hamas fired numerous rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip after violence erupted between Palestinian protesters and police in Jerusalem. The Israelis retaliated with airstrikes on military targets in the Gaza. Palestinians have reported that as many as 20 people died in the airstrikes, including some children.

On Tuesday, violence spilled into the streets of several Israeli cities where Palestinians and their supporters attacked Jews, their homes and their businesses. The mayor of the town of Lod said the attacks were similar to those on Kristallnacht, when Jews were attacked in Nazi Germany.

Skirmishes between the supporters of Israel and those of the Palestinian cause erupted in New York City as well.

"Journalist Andy Ngo says he was attacked in Portland, releases bloody photos: 'Antifa tried to kill me'","Journalist Andy Ngo said he was recently chased and beaten in the streets of Portland while he was covering protests in Portland, Oregon.

""No journalist in America should ever face violence for doing his or her job,"" Ngo said in a statement released on Wednesday night. ""Yet on Friday, May 28, Antifa tried to kill me again while I was reporting on the ongoing protests and riots in Portland, Ore. for a new chapter of my book, 'Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy.'""

""I was chased, attacked and beaten by a masked mob, baying for my blood,"" Ngo wrote on Twitter. ""Had I not been able to shelter wounded and bleeding inside a hotel while they beat the doors and windows like animals, there is no doubt in my mind I would not be here today. Their words, like their actions, speak for themselves.""

""Antifa wants me dead because I document what they want to stay hidden,"" he proclaimed. ""The attacks against me and threats on my life are retribution for my work as a journalist, recording the tactics and true ideology of an extremist clandestine movement that relies on deception and regards the truth as the greatest threat of all.""

""They want the right to hide their identities behind masks, and erase records of their arrests and alleged crimes,"" Ngo continued. ""They want me dead for capturing these things and reporting on them. But it is the right of every journalist, protected and preserved by the founding fathers, to report freely without fear.""

""When I engaged in field reporting for my book, I did what every beat reporter would do: I took care to mitigate the risks and went to observe Antifa first-hand during a demonstration at the Justice Center,"" the author said. ""Like many other journalists Antifa has tried to silence and intimidate through violence and threats, I had to cover my face and eyes to do my job and stay alive. As the Asian son of Vietnamese immigrants, I also have to be mindful of Antifa's attacks on multiple people of East Asian origin.""



According to Ngo, an Antifa member became suspicious of him because he wasn't engaging in criminal acts and throwing objects at police like the other members were. He began asking Ngo questions, but Andy did not respond. Ngo then walked away, but ""a group of masked people in black followed and surrounded me.""

""As they interrogated me, one managed to pull off my mask and immediately yelled, 'That's Andy. Get him! Get him!' As I sprinted through downtown Portland trying to flag down help, there was no visible police presence,"" Ngo claimed. ""One of the black-clad Antifa members tackled me to the ground in front of Pioneer Place Mall, punching my head and face repeatedly, while I pleaded for them not to kill me. All the time I could hear the angry cries and footsteps of the mob approaching.""

Ngo was allegedly able to escape and entered the Nines Hotel, but the staff asked him to leave because he wasn't wearing a mask. Ngo, editor at large at the Post Millennial, said he asked them to call 911, but they refused.

""By now, masked Antifa operatives were pounding on the hotel doors and windows, screaming and shouting my name and trying to break inside,"" he added.

The vitriolic crowd became so unruly that police were called to protect the hotel. Video shows a man screaming at a Portland police officer, accusing them of ""protecting Andy Ngo.""

Ngo was reportedly escorted out of the back entrance of the hotel by a medic from Portland Fire and Rescue and taken to the hospital by an ambulance.

""I was treated in the ER for multiple injuries to my head and body,"" he wrote on Twitter. Ngo shared bloody photos of his injuries, including wounds on his knee, hand, abdomen, and eye.

In June, Ngo was attacked during an Antifa protest in Portland. He was robbed and suffered a brain hemorrhage.

Ngo appeared on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Wednesday night, where he said that he notified law enforcement of the attack. He said that he has ""not heard back from a detective at all."" He noted that he had ""more than two dozen reports to police of death threats, people showing up at my home.""

""I call on the Portland Police and federal authorities to act on this before Antifa operatives hiding behind their masks succeed in murdering an American journalist on their watch,"" Ngo said. ""And I call on journalists and all those who believe in the First Amendment to join me in standing against the tyranny of those who use violence to terrorize, silence and suppress the truth.""

Reuters/Ipsos poll: President Biden's approval rating has fallen to the lowest level of his presidency so far,"President Joe Biden's approval rating is under water, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll carried out Sept. 15-16.

According to the poll, while 50% of U.S. adults disapprove of the president's performance in office, only 44% approve, marking his lowest approval so far. It appears that 46% had been the lowest his approval numbers had been in prior Reuters/Ipsos polls.

""The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from 1,005 adults in total including 442 Democrats and 360 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points,"" according to Reuters.

While Biden's rating is under water, President Donald Trump was even worse off at the same time in his presidency: ""At the same point in Donald Trump's presidency, about 38% of Americans approved of his performance in office, while 57% disapproved,"" according to the outlet.



A recent Quinnipiac University national poll of adults similarly found that Biden's approval rating is upside down. That poll found that 50% disapprove of the way Biden is handling his role as president, compared to 42% who approve.



Biden has recently faced significant criticism for bungling the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Quinnipiac poll found that a whopping 65% disapprove of Biden's handling of the troop withdrawal, while just 31% approve.

"Anti-Israel statement from Vanderbilt U. student gov't weeps for Palestinians — and predictably fails to mention 'Hamas,' 'rocket attacks,' or 'terrorism'","Vanderbilt University's student government was called out for issuing a decidedly anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian statement over the weekend in the wake of the recent ceasefire after nearly two weeks of deadly fighting between the warring factions.

What are the details?

The unsigned statement is curiously titled ""In Solidarity with Students"" — but given the weight of the overall words, it seemed clear that not every student was created equal in the eyes of the college's student government.

While it makes a passing reference about extending ""support and consolation to Israeli students also affected by this crisis"" and that ""there is no place for antisemitism or anti-Jewish sentiment of any kind"" on campus, the vast majority of the two-page statement is passionately anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian — and fails to even mention the words ""Hamas"" or ""terrorism"" or the thousands of rocket attacks the Jewish state endured.

The most blatantly anti-Israel sections of the statement are found on the second page where Vanderbilt's student government catalogs death and destruction by Israel's ""occupying forces"" and uses phrases such as ""indigenous Palestine,"" ""targeting Muslim Palestinians during the holy month of Ramadan,"" ""ethnic cleansing,"" and ""inhumane and cruel acts of war, supremacy, and genocide.""

Hillel had something to say

In the wake of the student government statement, Vanderbilt's Hillel group put together a response on its own Instagram page — and the campus' Jewish organization was not happy.

""Vanderbilt Hillel strongly condemns the recently released, biased statement from Vanderbilt Student Government,"" Hillel's statement begins. ""Despite VSG's claim to denounce antisemitism, their statement contributes to the continued erosion of Jewish students' sense of safety at Vanderbilt and has unleashed a torrent of offensive comments online.""

The Hillel statement goes on to say that Jewish students are being ""targeted for harassment and abuse for their Jewishness, Zionism, and support of Israel as a Jewish state"" and are left feeling ""unwelcome and threatened"" on campus. The statement also urged Vanderbilt to help student leaders especially to learn ""the ways that anti-Israel activism becomes antisemitism.""

What did Vanderbilt have to say?



The school made note on its website of the competing social media statements without mentioning specific student groups and encouraged peaceful, restrained interactions in regard to the volatile topic.

""Some student organizations on our campus have posted statements on social media about this issue that have prompted heated debate and discussion, marked by at times offensive and inflammatory rhetoric. Student organizations do not speak for the university or the overall Vanderbilt community. They are formed and led by students as an opportunity to enhance their college experience and become well-rounded leaders, scholars and citizens who navigate the world with civility, curiosity and respect for others. As such, all our students, whether members of these organizations or not, are expected to adhere to our high standards of conduct aligned with the university's policies and rules governing such groups.""

The school's statement added that ""we must all ensure through our words and our actions that Vanderbilt remains a safe and welcoming community committed to civil discourse, especially when we hold strong and impassioned views. Language and actions that constitute harassment and bullying are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anti-israel-vanderbilt-student-government,2021-05-24
"Anti-Taliban protests continue on Afghanistan Independence Day, are met with violence","Anti-Taliban protests in Afghanistan continued Thursday and were met with violence from the Islamist militants, who opened fire on crowds and reportedly killed several people.

According to Reuters, the protests that began Wednesday have spread to more cities and even parts of the capital, Kabul. Hundreds of people flocked to the streets to wave the tricolor Afghanistan flag in a patriotic demonstration for the country's Independence Day.

A video posted on social media showed a crowd of men and women waving the black, red, and green national flag and shouting ""Our flag, our identity"" in the streets of Kabul.

Marchers also chanted ""God is greatest.""

Several protesters in the eastern city of Asadabad were killed after Taliban soldiers fired on a crowd, triggering a stampede. It was unclear whether the casualties were caused by gunfire or by the stampede, a witness said.

Yesterday, at least three people were reportedly killed in the city of Jalalabad when Taliban soldiers opened fire on a crowd of protesters.

Since Kabul fell to the Taliban on Sunday, spokesmen for the new regime in Afghanistan have repeatedly insisted that they seek peace, will respect the rights of women, and will form an ""inclusive, Islamic government.""

But videos of the violent treatment of protesters contradict the Taliban's public claims and serve as a reminder of the oppressive conditions the Afghan people lived under when the Taliban previously ruled the country.

Footage obtained by Fox News shows people running and cyclists and motorists charging down the streets of Asadabad while flying the Afghanistan flag. Gunshots can be heard in the background.

Fox News reported that elsewhere in Kabul, a crowd of people took cover near the international airport as gunmen opened fire. As seen in the video, a woman and her child crouched as guns roared and people fled.

It is not clear what prompted the violence.

""Salute those who carry the national flag and thus stand for dignity of the nation,"" said Afghanistan First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, an ousted leader of the Western-backed government who is working to rally resistance to the Taliban.

Saleh on Tuesday declared himself the ""legitimate caretaker president"" of Afghanistan after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country to the United Arab Emirates.



Other leaders are trying to build opposition to the Taliban.

Ahmad Massoud, the leader of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post calling on Western governments to continue to support the fight against the Taliban.

""I write from the Panjshir Valley today, ready to follow in my father's footsteps, with mujahideen fighters who are prepared to once again take on the Taliban,"" Massoud wrote. His father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was a veteran guerrilla leader who was killed by suspected al Qaeda terrorists in 2001.

Massoud asked for Afghanistan's supporters in the West to rally their governments to send weapons, ammunition, and supplies to continue the fight against the Islamist regime.

""The Taliban is not a problem for the Afghan people alone. Under Taliban control, Afghanistan will without doubt become ground zero of radical Islamist terrorism; plots against democracies will be hatched here once again,"" Massoud wrote.



""America and its democratic allies do not just have the fight against terrorism in common with Afghans. We now have a long history made up of shared ideals and struggles. There is still much that you can do to aid the cause of freedom. You are our only remaining hope.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anti-taliban-protests-afghanistan-independence-day,2021-08-19
Antifa attacks journalist at anti-eviction march in Detroit,"A video journalist was terrorized and physically assaulted by Antifa supporters because he was documenting an ""anti-eviction march"" in Detroit.

Brandon Gutenschwager is an independent reporter who has developed a massive following on Twitter for his thorough coverage of protests and riots across the country — from Seattle to Washington, D.C., to Portland. Gutenschwager, who goes by @BGOnTheScene on Twitter, has had his on-the-ground footage featured on cable news programs.

On Saturday afternoon, Gutenschwager was in Detroit covering an anti-eviction march, which included Black Lives Matter supporters and reported Antifa members.

""Just got assaulted attempting to cover an anti-eviction march in Detroit this afternoon,"" Gutenschwager wrote on Twitter, and included a video of the attack. ""A member of the protest 'security' ran up, grabbed my camera and forced me against a building.""

Gutenschwager pointed out that the man who assaulted him was wearing an Antifa pin on his flannel shirt.

""A man wearing an Antifa pin committed the first assault during the march,"" the photojournalist said. ""Camera stopped a few times while he attempted to steal it. Eventually, others in the group urged him aside to release me from against the building.""

Another man at the march in the Greektown district of Detroit, who was wearing a ""PRESS"" patch, screamed at Gutenschwager, ""You're not f***ing welcome here!"" Gutenschwager said the man ""accosts me and tries to force me to leave.""

Because Gutenschwager was harassed, he was only able to capture very little of the actual anti-eviction march, but one video shows the crowd chanting, ""Black homes are under attack, tell me what do we do, rise up fight back!""

While walking alongside the march that had Black Lives Matter flags, a man blindsided Gutenschwager and smashed him into the wall. Gutenschwager suffered injuries from the attack and was bleeding.

""Wow! I was just straight-up assaulted on the streets of Detroit,"" he said on camera. ""Straight-up assaulted!""

""A man rammed me against a concrete fence and barricade, bloodying my mouth and elbow as well as putting me in a chokehold while stealing my camera,"" Gutenschwager tweeted. ""That was then thrown over a fence, which I eventually was able to retrieve and continue recording.""

At this point, Gutenschwager decided to leave the event for his own safety.

"Antifa, radical leftists reportedly call for 'night of rage' in wake of SCOTUS abortion overturn: 'Enough is enough with peaceful protest'","Antifa expert Andy Ngo on Friday posted screenshots of tweets from Antifa-affiliated groups and other radical leftists around the country calling for a ""night of rage"" and similar actions in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's overturn of Roe v. Wade, which has permitted abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years.

What are the details?

In a Twitter thread that he promised to update, Ngo first warned that the violent anarchist group Jane's Revenge — which has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks on pro-life groups since the leak of the Roe v. Wade overturn draft — has updated its flyers and is calling for violence Friday night:

Ngo also tweeted that the Washington, D.C., chapter of the Youth Liberation Front — another ""violent Antifa group"" — is ""calling for people to wear black, mask up & to meet at Folger Park at 7:30 p.m. The YLF was responsible for months of extreme violence in Portland & Seattle in 2020.""

He added that Antifa in Portland already made plans for violence Thursday and announced a ""direct action gathering starting at 5:30 pm PT at Lownsdale Square — the same location they occupied in 2020 & used as a base to carry out mass violence & arson.""

Ngo also pointed to an ""Anifa account representing members in DC, Maryland & Virginia"" from which a tweet read, ""Is your bag packed? Let's f***ing go.""

He added that the ""Florida chapter of #Antifa group Revolutionary Abolition tells comrades to 'bloc up.' This refers to wearing black clothing & black masks to hide identities during crimes."" Ngo also said the group ""retweeted a post calling for addresses of the family of their target.""

Ngo also mentioned that ""far-left writer"" Gretchen Felker-Martin, who he said penned a ""novel where two trans people murder their targets,"" called for ""violence."" One of Felker-Martin's Friday tweets read, ""Enough is enough with peaceful protest.""

Ngo added that the ""far-left Abolitionist Law Center""— anticipating that its ""comrades will be arrested for crimes"" — is ""calling for people to donate to abortion & bail funds. Many far-left groups exist in US to provide legal support & bail money to violent far-left extremists.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/antifa-night-of-rage-abortion,2022-06-24
AOC and Bernie Sanders try to block Biden admin's arms sale to Israel — all while the US' top Middle East ally is bombarded by Hamas terrorists,"Hamas has been bombarding Israel with rockets over the last several days in its latest efforts to violently challenge the United States' top ally in the region. Over the last week and a half, Hamas terrorists have fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel, the nation's air force said, according to the Associated Press.

As Hamas rockets continued to rain down on Israeli communities, left-wing Democrats in the U.S. Congress were spending their time trying to stop President Joe Biden from selling arms to Israel that the nation could use to defend itself against terrorism.

What happened?

The Biden White House approved a $735 million sale of weapons to Israel, the Washington Post revealed Monday. These weapons include JDAMs, or Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which, Fox News said, are tail kits that convert ""dumb"" bombs into precision-guided missiles. Analysts believe JDAMs have been instrumental in the recent cross-border conflict with Hamas.

According to the Post, the administration notified Congress of the planned sale on May 5, five days before recent hostilities began. The declaration is required under law, and lawmakers have 15 days to object with a nonbinding disapproval resolution.

In the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been leading the charge to kill the arms deal, along with known anti-Israel Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.), who called the potential sale ""appalling.""

AOC, along with Tlaib and Rep. Mark Pocan, introduced a resolution Wednesday to block the arms sale.

In a statement on the resolution, the democratic-socialist lawmaker said, “For decades, the U.S. has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Israel without ever requiring them to respect basic Palestinian rights. In so doing, we have directly contributed to the death, displacement and disenfranchisement of millions,"" the Post reported.

And she took to Twitter to claim that the move was all about protecting human rights and allege that Israel has been targeting civilian and media sites.

""The United States should not be rubber-stamping weapons sales to the Israeli government as they deploy our resources to target international media outlets, schools, hospitals, humanitarian missions and civilian sites for bombing,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""We have a responsibility to protect human rights.""

Israel has said that JDAMs have been used for the Gaza airstrikes and in other similar situations in order to avoid harming civilians, which is the opposite of what Hamas has done with its indiscriminate bombing of Israeli cities.



On the U.S. Senate side, avowed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he plans to introduce a similar resolution Thursday to stop the weapons sale, the Post reported.

""At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza, and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a Congressional debate,"" Sanders tweeted.

""I believe that the United States must help lead the way to a peaceful and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians,"" he continued in a follow-up tweet. ""We need to take a hard look at whether the sale of these weapons is actually helping do that, or whether it is simply fueling conflict.""

Though the Sanders resolution will likely get an up-or-down vote, its fate is uncertain, the Post said. Should it get the 51 votes needed for passage, it would still need to pass the House, which AOC and her ilk would likely support it.



The president, however, would have the power to veto the resolution. If he did, both congressional chambers would need to rally two-thirds of their respective bodies to overturn the veto.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-bernie-sanders-block-israel-arms-sale,2021-05-20
"Authorities arrest Apple Daily senior editor, other journalists in Hong Kong under Beijing-imposed national security law","National security police in Hong Kong have arrested a former senior editor and two other employees of the Apple Daily, the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper that was raided by authorities and forced to close last month.

Former executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung was detained by authorities Wednesday under suspicion of ""collusion with foreign forces"" under the territory's new national security law, the South China Morning Post reported.

Two other employees, Chan Pui-man, former associate publisher of the paper, and ex-senior editorial writer Fung Wai-kong, were also detained by authorities Wednesday on similar allegations. The new arrests bring the total number of former Apple Daily employees detained since last month to at least eight.

The arrests follow the enactment of a Beijing-imposed national security law intended to quash pro-democracy forces in the once autonomous city. The wide-ranging law outlaws ""foreign interference"" and criminalizes any form of secession from or subversion of the power and authority of the central government as well as any collusion with external forces.

Pro-democracy activists in the city have warned that the new law means ""the end of Hong Kong"" and ""the end of one country, two systems."" In response to its enactment, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally declared last year that Hong Kong was no longer autonomous from China.

In June, authorities in Hong Kong raided the offices of Apple Daily arresting five company executives and freezing millions of dollars in assets, forcing the popular newspaper's closure. The paper sold roughly 1 million copies of its last physical issue.

Apple Daily reported on the massive pro-democracy protests that rocked the city starting in 2019 and had become a leading critic of Beijing and Hong Kong leadership.

Following Wednesday's arrests, Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung stated that police would continue pursuing anyone suspected of committing an offense, regardless of profession.

""We have the obligation to arrest and prosecute them if they have violated the law,"" he said, according to the South China Morning Post. ""I will not comment further as the case still needs further investigation.""

The Hong Kong Journalists Association, on the other hand, reportedly expressed shock and dismay at the arrests, heralding freedom of the press as the ""cornerstone of an international city.""

""The association urges the government not to keep arresting journalists in the name of national security in a bid to create white terror in the field,"" it added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/apple-daily-senior-editor-arrested,2021-07-21
Pro-abortion protesters storm Arizona state Capitol,"A pro-abortion protest escalated into a tense situation where police had to use tear gas to disperse the mob gathered outside the Arizona state Capitol.

Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, approximately 8,000 pro-abortion protesters demonstrated outside the Capitol in downtown Phoenix, according to KTAR-FM. The protest began at 7 p.m., and featured protest signs that read: ""Keep your Bible off my body,"" ""Why are old men making laws on my body"" ""forced birth is fascism,"" ""You're killing us,"" and ""my body my rage.""

Protesters amassed around the Arizona state Capitol on Friday night – when the state senate was in session.

Shortly before 9 p.m., law enforcement declared the pro-abortion protest an unlawful assembly.



Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake shared a video of the mob outside the Capitol with the caption: ""The left is showing everyone what a REAL 'Insurrection' looks like right now in Downtown Phoenix. This is domestic terrorism. The Arizona national guard should have been deployed hours ago, @DougDucey Arrest these animals immediately. They are out for blood.""

Republican state Senator Michelle Ugenti-Rita shared a video of protesters slamming on the window.

Department of Public Safety troopers used tear gas to disperse the frenzied crowd outside the Capitol.

Department of Public Safety told AZ Family reporter Michael Raimondi, ""Our troopers were in the Senate lobby in full view of the rioters as they pounded on the glass. We believe they had every intention of getting inside the senate building.""

""Troopers deployed gas outside the Senate building after protesters attempted to break the glass,"" the Arizona DPS stated. ""The crowd then moved to the Wesley Bolin Plaza where some monuments were vandalized. Gas was deployed again to disburse [sic] the crowd.""

Arizona state Republicans said, ""Pro-abortion protestors violently tried to enter our building. Members/staff/visitors evacuated to a secure location.""

Arizona GOP state Senator Kelly Townsend said, ""We are currently there being held hostage inside the Senate building due to members of the public trying to breach our security. We smell tear gas and the children of one of the members are in the office sobbing with fear. I expect a J24 committee to be created immediately.""

Townsend later said, ""Everyone is okay, and we are finishing our work.""

Arizona State Republicans stated, ""While the Senate is now secure & safe, unfortunately smoke/tear gas has spread into our chambers.""

Senate President Karen Fann issued a statement, ""We are incredibly thankful for our local law enforcement who quickly intervened during what could have been a destructive and dangerous situation for our members, staff and public inside the Senate.""

Kim Quintero – the Republican Caucus’ communications director – noted, ""Violent pro-abortion protestors’ attempts of an insurrection at the Arizona State Senate were thwarted Friday night, thanks to the swift actions from local and state law enforcement.""

Arizona lawmaker punches back at Merrick Garland over promise to scrutinize election audit,"An Arizona lawmaker fired back at Attorney General Merrick Garland Friday after the nation's top lawyer announced plans to scrutinize post-election audits.

What is the DOJ doing?

Garland announced Friday several new initiatives under his leadership, including:

Doubling the staff at the DOJ's Civil Rights Division

Scrutinizing laws that Republicans say protect election integrity, but Democrats claim restrict voting rights

Examining post-election audits

Combatting ""election disinformation""

Garland's promise to scrutinize ""post-election audits to ensure they abide by federal statutory requirements to protect election records and avoid the intimidation of voters"" was ""a clear reference to a Republican-backed audit in Arizona,"" NBC News reported.

Garland said, in part:

As part of its mission to protect the right to vote, the Justice Department will, of course, do everything in its power to prevent election fraud and, if found, to vigorously prosecute it. But many of the justifications proffered in support of these post-election audits and restrictions on voting have relied on assertions of material vote fraud in the 2020 election that have been refuted by law enforcement and intelligence agencies of both this Administration and the previous one, as well as by every court — federal and state — that has considered them.

Arizona Republicans initiated an audit of 2020 presidential election ballots from Maricopa County, the most-populous county in Arizona, earlier this spring. The audit, which has yet to be completed, has been highly controversial and widely condemned by Democrats.

What was the response?

Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers (R), an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump, had a blunt response for Garland.

""You will not touch Arizona ballots or machines unless you want to spend time in an Arizona prison. Maybe you should focus on stopping terrorism. The Justice Department is one of the most corrupt institutions in the USA,"" she said.

In another tweet, Rogers said, ""The free state of Arizona will not tolerate this federal meddling.""



""If Attorney General Merrick Garland thinks he has a right to our ballots and machines he should go to court. If he uses force when multiple courts have already authorized this audit he will be in violation of the law,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-lawmaker-punches-back-at-merrick-garland-over-promise-to-scrutinize-election-audit,2021-06-12
Armed citizen thwarts shooter who opened fire inside crowded mall food court: 'Quick action and heroism',"Police say an armed ""good Samaritan"" stepped in and stopped an active shooter who terrorized an Indiana mall south of Indianapolis on Sunday.

What happened?

Law enforcement said a man entered the Greenwood Park Mall early Sunday evening armed with a rifle and several magazines of ammunition. He then walked to the food court and opened fire.

The perpetrator shot five people, killing three and wounding two.

However, a quick-thinking 22-year-old man prevented even more loss of life when he pulled his own firearm and immediately shot down the perpetrator. Officials praised the man, who was identified only by his age and where he lived.

""The real hero of the day was the citizen that was lawfully carrying a firearm who was able to stop the shooter almost as soon as he began,"" Greenwood police Chief Jim Ison said.

""We do know that someone we are calling the 'Good Samaritan' was able to shoot the assailant and stop further bloodshed. This person saved lives tonight,"" said Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers. ""On behalf of the city of Greenwood, I am grateful for his quick action and heroism in this situation.""

Police have not yet determined a motive in the attack. However, they said there was no indication the shooter knew any of the victims, NBC News reported.

4 dead, 2 wounded in shooting at Greenwood Park Mall; police said 'good Samaritan' shot and killed s www.youtube.com

Anything else?

Gun control advocates used the tragedy to bash the Second Amendment.

""I don’t know who needs to hear this but when a 22-year-old illegally brings a loaded gun into a mall and kills a mass shooter armed with an AR-15 after he already killed three people and wounded others is not a ringing endorsement of our implementation of the Second Amendment,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of gun control group Moms Demand Action.

""The Second Amendment is why Greenwood Park Mall had a mass shooting in the first place,"" said actor John Fugelsang.

""[Three] innocent people dead + 2 innocent people injured + 1 'good guy with a gun' + A bunch of terrified people who just watched a mass murder - 1 bad guy with a gun. I dunno, I'm running these numbers and my Second Amendment at work is not looking so great, just math-wise,"" mocked progressive commentator Jill Filipovic.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-citizen-thwarts-shooter-greewood-mall,2022-07-18
"Armed crook who carjacked mom, teen daughter in their Philly driveway is arrested — and faces federal charges","The armed carjacker who targeted a Philadelphia mother and daughter in their own driveway last week was arrested and faces federal charges, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday.

What are the details?

Amir Harvey, 20, of Philadelphia was arrested and charged with carjacking and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced Thursday in a press release.

Investigators told WTXF-TV the victims were leaving their home in the 8900 block of Maxwell Place in the northeast section of the city around 6 a.m. Sept. 19 when the carjacker ambushed them.

""It appears he was laying in wait,"" Captain John Ryan told the station. ""He rode a bicycle up there, left the bicycle behind, we have that.""

The mother said she started her vehicle using an application on her cell phone, according to the justice department.

Surveillance video shows the mother and daughter opening the doors of their white Hyundai Santa Fe SUV as the carjacker sneaks up with his gun drawn and heads toward the daughter, who's standing outside the passenger-side door of the Santa Fe.

The mother and daughter begin screaming, and the daughter runs across the street as the carjacker momentarily chases after her before turning his attention to the mother, who's standing outside the Santa Fe's driver-side door. It appears the mother drops her purse on the ground, and the carjacker grabs it before entering the vehicle and driving off.

The justice department said the mother used the location tracking feature on her cellphone application and informed police, who went to the 2000 block of Griffith Street — about 2.5 miles from the victim’s residence. Investigators used neighborhood surveillance video to trace the movement of the victim’s vehicle and the defendant to a nearby apartment complex, the justice department added.

Why does the suspect face federal charges?

The department of justice said the carjacking suspect is being federally charged as a result of the newly formed Philadelphia Carjacking Task Force, which consists of members of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Violent Crime Unit, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Philadelphia police.

The task force's goal is to halt armed carjackings and violent crimes through investigative and enforcement techniques meant to identify and refer for federal prosecution ""all who terrorize innocent victims through commission of these offenses within Philadelphia and surrounding areas,"" the justice department said.

U.S. Attorney Romero added that ""this defendant threatened the lives of a mother and daughter going about their daily morning routine. Carjacking is not game or a fun pastime, it is a serious federal crime with severe consequences.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-crook-who-carjacked-mom-teen-daughter-in-their-philly-driveway-faces-federal-charges,2022-09-30
"Army officer resigns, gives up pension in protest of Biden's 'tyrannical' vaccine mandate, 'Marxist takeover of the military'","A U.S. Army officer has resigned from the service and forgone his pension in protest of the Biden administration's COVID-19 vaccine requirement for military personnel, calling the mandate one example of a ""Marxist takeover of the military.""

What are the details?

Lt. Col. Paul Douglas Hague, a 19-year veteran of the U.S. armed services, submitted his letter of resignation on Aug. 30, and it was shared to Twitter last week by his wife. In the scathing letter, he listed several factors that motivated his decision but noted the Pentagon's mandatory vaccination order was primary.

""First, and foremost, I am incapable of subjecting myself to the unlawful, unethical, immoral and tyrannical order to sit still and allow a serum to be injected into my flesh against my will and better judgment,"" Hague wrote in the letter, adding, ""It is impossible for this so-called 'vaccine' to have been studied adequately to determine the long-term effects.""

The officer pledged that he would not be used as a ""tool"" of the Biden administration to force the COVID-19 vaccine on those who wish to remain unvaccinated.

What else?

Elsewhere in the letter, Hague cited his ""complete lack of confidence"" in President Joe Biden and his Defense Department as a reason for his resignation, arguing their failed leadership ""unnecessarily cost the lives of 13 service members"" killed last month in a terror attack in Kabul, Afghanistan.

He also decried what he characterized as ""an ideologically Marxist takeover of the military and United States government at their upper echelons.""

""I would like nothing more than to continue in the Army to reach my 20 years of active federal service and retire with my pension,"" added Hague, who is currently stationed at Fort Bragg. ""However, I instead will join those who have served before me in pledging my Life, my Fortune, and my Sacred Honor to continue resisting the eternal and ever-mutable forms of oppression and tyranny — both from enemies outside our nation's borders, and those within.""

Anything else?

After critics online asked why Hague decided to resign over the COVID-19 vaccine despite accepting the many other vaccines considered mandatory before serving in the armed forces, Hague's wife, Katie Phipps Hague, tweeted that her husband ""didn't resign over a vaccine.""

""He said he felt the vaccine was being used as a political tool to divide and segregate Americans. He then went on to list many other reasons for his resignation — none of which have anything to do with vaccines,"" she said.

In an interview with Fox News, Katie Phipps Hague confirmed that the resignation letter was submitted on Aug. 30 and has since been ""sent up his chain of command.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/army-officer-resigns-covid-vaccine-mandate,2021-09-14
Schwarzenegger compares Capitol chaos to Nazis Kristallnacht,"Arnold Schwarzenegger gave his opinions about the storming of the U.S. Capitol, and called Republican politicians ""spineless."" The former Republican California governor compared last week's Capitol chaos to Kristallnacht, the two-day attack and campaign of terror against Jews in Germany that was initiated by Nazi storm troopers.

""I grew up in Austria. I'm very aware of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass,"" Schwarzenegger said in the 7-minute video. ""It was a night of rampage against the Jews carried out in 1938 by the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys. Wednesday was the Day of Broken Glass right here in the United States.""

""The broken glass was in the windows of the United States Capitol,"" the action flick actor said on Sunday. ""But the mob did not just shatter the windows of the Capitol. They shattered the ideas we took for granted.""

""They did not just break down the doors of the building of American democracy,"" he claimed. ""They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded.""

The Kristallnacht began on the night of Nov. 9, 1938, and ended in the deaths of at least 91 Jews.

""Over 250 synagogues were burned, over 7,000 Jewish businesses were trashed and looted, dozens of Jewish people were killed, and Jewish cemeteries, hospitals, schools, and homes were looted while police and fire brigades stood by,"" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

""The morning after the pogroms 30,000 German Jewish men were arrested for the 'crime' of being Jewish and sent to concentration camps, where hundreds of them perished. Some Jewish women were also arrested and sent to local jails. Businesses owned by Jews were not allowed to reopen unless they were managed by non-Jews. Curfews were placed on Jews, limiting the hours of the day they could leave their homes.""

In the aftermath of the destruction, ""The German government made an immediate pronouncement that 'the Jews' themselves were to blame for the pogrom and imposed a fine of one billion Reichsmark (some 400 million US dollars at 1938 rates) on the German Jewish community. The Reich government confiscated all insurance payouts to Jews whose businesses and homes were looted or destroyed, leaving the Jewish owners personally responsible for the cost of all repairs.""

In November, CNN International anchor Christiane Amanpour compared President Donald Trump's four years in office to the Nazis' Kristallnacht. Commenters labeled the comparison as ""despicable"" and ""disgusting.""

Also in the video, Schwarzenegger attempted to lower the temperature on the nation's rising political tensions that seem to be at a near-boiling point. He brandished the 3-foot-long sword from the 1982 movie ""Conan the Barbarian"" to make an unusual analogy.



""This is Conan's sword. And here is the thing about swords – the more you temper it, the stronger it becomes,"" the actor said of the movie prop. ""Our democracy is like the steel of a sword. It has been tempered by wars, injustices and insurrections. I believe as shaken as we are by events in recent days, we will come out stronger because we now understand what can be lost.""

Schwarzenegger then called Republican politicians ""spineless"" and ""complicit"" to those who stormed the Capitol building.

""John F. Kennedy wrote a book called 'Profiles in Courage.' A number of members of my own party, because of their own spinelessness, would never see their names in such a book, I guarantee you,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""They're complicit with those who carried a flag of self-righteous insurrection into the Capitol.""

Schwarzenegger then took aim at Trump.

""President Trump is a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst president ever,"" the actor said. ""The good thing is he will soon be as irrelevant as an old tweet.""



The bodybuilder concluded his video by sending a message to President-elect Joe Biden.

""We wish you great success as our president. If you succeed, our nation succeeds. We support you with all our hearts as you seek to bring us together,"" Schwarzenegger said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arnold-schwarzenegger-capitol-nazi-trump,2021-01-10
"5 dead, 40 others injured during Waukesha attack; person of interest in custody as bystanders recall night of terror: 'His sweet little innocent face was purple'","At least five people are dead and 40 others injured after a red SUV drove into a revelers and performers at a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Sunday night.

What are the details?

Local authorities are continuing to investigate the Sunday night attack as they now announce a person of interest in custody.

An unnamed suspect plowed a vehicle into a Christmas parade featuring children, elderly performers, and more, killing at least five people at the time of this reporting. Officials warn that the numbers could increase in the coming days if more victims come forward, or if existing victims succumb to their injuries.

During a Sunday night news conference, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said that the person of interest was in custody, but did not reveal the identity of the possible suspect.

The Associated Press on Monday reported that Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul added, ""What took place in Waukesha today is sickening, and I have every confidence that those responsible will be brought to justice.""

Further information is expected to come out during a Monday news conference.

Victims

According to Fox News, some of the victims include a Roman Catholic priest, multiple parishioners, and Catholic school children. Performers from the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies and members of the Waukesha Xtreme Dance team were also impacted during the attack.

Corey Montiho, an area resident and school board member, said that the scene was horrific.

""There were pompoms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere,"" Montiho said. ""I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter. My wife and two daughters were almost hit. Please pray for everybody. Please pray.""

Resident Angela O'Boyle, who claimed to have witness the attack from her fifth-floor apartment window, told CNN that she saw the red SUV ""plow into the band"" on the streets below, run over at least two people, and continue driving into crowds attending the celebration event.

Chris Germain, witness and local businessowner, said that he witnessed the driver of the SUV ""[blaze] right past us.""

""There were small children laying all over the road, there were police officers and EMTs doing CPR on multiple members of the parade,"" he recalled.

Angelito Tenorio, a West Allis alderman who is running for Wisconsin state treasurer, said that the aftermath of the attack was equally as horrific as the attack itself.

""[W]e heard a loud bang,"" Tenorio said. ""And after that, we just heard deafening cries and screams from the crowd, from the people at the parade. And people started rushing, running away with tears in their eyes, crying.""

Paradegoer Tyler Kotlarek told The New York Times that he saw the car was ""flying through [the parade route] going intentionally from left to right.""

Nurse Jodi Singsime said that she rushed to help after the attack.

""I heard and saw the people being hit, but what you could do more than seeing is hearing, and just that sound was insane,"" she said according to a Monday Reuters report as she explained seeing a small boy in the road.

""I felt his neck for a pulse and he had one but his eyes were barely open and his face — all I can remember is his sweet little innocent face was purple. He wasn't really with us.""







A person of interest

Authorities were able to recover the red SUV used in the attack, and took into custody at least one person of interest. Neither their identity or motives were announced at the time of this reporting.

In a statement on the horrific attack, Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly said, ""Today, our community faced horror and tragedy in what should have been a community celebration. I'm deeply saddened to know that so many in our community went to a parade but ended up dealing with injury and heartache.""

A spokesperson for the White House also issued remarks on the attack, telling , ABC News, ""The White House is closely monitoring the situation in Waukesha and our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this terrible incident. We have reached out to state and local officials to offer any support and assistance as needed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/at-least-5-dead-40-others-injured-during-waukesha-parade-horror-attack-person-of-interest-in-custody,2021-11-22
Video: Ohio woman sprays fire extinguisher at Atlanta airport,"A viral video of a woman terrorizing travelers and workers with a fire extinguisher at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia has been viewed millions of times.

Around 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, a woman from Ohio ate at a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant at the airport and ran out on the bill, according to Newsweek.

Jennifer Kaye Holder, 27, of Dayton, Ohio, allegedly made her way to the Delta Airlines Gate D9. That's where she purportedly attempted to open the secured doors to a jetway but was unsuccessful because she didn't know the security code.

A Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport worker was heard telling Holder, ""You can't go out that door, ma'am.""

The woman screamed, ""I'm from Dayton, we murder everybody every day.""



The Ohio woman was then seen walking down the concourse hallway while wielding a fire extinguisher. As an airport worker attempted to get close to Holder, she was seen on video spraying him in the face with the fire extinguisher.

The man recording the video noted, ""She's a terrorist.""

She contemplated exiting from another gate. However, airline employees rushed to close the jetway door, and the woman sprayed them with the fire extinguisher. She then sprayed the entire gate with the fire extinguisher to the point that there was extremely limited visibility because of the thick cloud.

The man recording the video said the chemicals tasted ""nasty.""

In the last seconds of the video, it appeared that a police officer was running toward the suspect.

Fox 5 Atlanta reported that the woman sprayed police officers when they attempted to take her into custody. Police said that Holder continued to ""behave erratically and combative, by spitting and kicking at officers.""

Atlanta Police Department officers were eventually able to take the woman into custody and booked her into the Clayton County Jail after she was treated for self-sustained minor injuries.

Holder was charged with obstructing law enforcement officers, two counts of simple assault, and three counts of simple battery, according to online jail records.

Three flight attendants were hospitalized with respiratory issues from being sprayed with the fire extinguisher, according to Delta Airlines.

A Delta Airlines spokesperson said the woman's behavior was ""unacceptable,"" and she would ""not be welcome on future Delta flights.""

The spokesperson added, ""Delta is grateful for our people — the best in the business — who quickly addressed the evolving situation, and the first responders who ensured the safety of employees and customers following this incident.""

The viral video has been viewed more than 2.3 million times on one Twitter video alone.

"Atlanta 'machete man' scaring customers, 'terrorizing' residents with knife-waving rituals. He can't be removed due to unwilling police and the COVID eviction moratorium.","Business owners and residents in Atlanta's Kirkwood neighborhood are complaining that an individual performing daily knife-waving rituals is ""terrorizing"" customers and visitors, but the ""machete man"" reportedly can't be removed.

What are the details?

""I pass him [and] I immediately get alarmed,"" local salon owner Kelsey Womack told WAGA-TV this week before recounting the first time he showed up on the block.

""I came back to the business [and] tried to warn all of the clients and the staff that there was someone out there that didn't look sane with a weapon,"" she recalled.

The man, 33-year-old Brandon Barkley, has several knives and — based on video footage — what appears to be a sword. He regularly waves them in the front lawn of the home where he is staying and sometimes even in the street.

Yet police have said his behavior doesn't amount to a violation of the law, instead characterizing the situation as a ""civil matter."" WAGA reported that police have been called on the man repeatedly since he first showed up a few months ago, yet he still remains.

I-Team: Atlanta business owner says man with machete scaring her customers www.youtube.com

When reached by the news outlet this week, Barkley insisted that he means no harm to anyone and classified the performances as religious rituals. He added that he's simply ""a passionate person who talks about God.""

But according to Invitation Homes, the property management company that owns the home he's living in, Barkley is a squatter. The group has tried earnestly to evict him, but the process has reportedly been slowed by DeKalb County's COVID-19 eviction moratorium.

What happened in August?



Things reached a boiling point in August when Barkley was caught on surveillance video threatening passersby with what later was identified as a stun gun.

""He was shocking the Taser, however it works. The client who was outside said, 'Do not come at me with that Taser,'"" Womack said.

Several believed the stun gun to be an actual firearm and called the police. Shortly after, Barkley was arrested on a felony charge of aggravated assault.

According to WAGA, Invitation Homes changed the front door lock and put up a no trespassing notice. But only days later Barkley, still holding a key to the backdoor, returned claiming to be out on bond.

""He assured us he owns the home, has the keys, and that his knife performances are part of his journey to becoming an angel,"" the news outlet reported.

Anything else?

Barkley and his mother claim that he paid $20,000 in cash to a couple to live at the home, but no documentation has been submitted as proof.

Barkley's mother added that her son does not have any mental health issues, he's just ""really into God.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/atlanta-machete-man-terrorizing-residents,2021-10-05
Man caught on video yelling anti-Semitic slur during attack on Jewish man in Brooklyn,"The NYPD said that a Jewish man was attacked randomly by a man yelling anti-Semitic slurs and it was all caught on surveillance video.

The incident unfolded at about 11:30 a.m. on Monday in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough of New York City.

A man can be seen grabbing a discarded piece of furniture and slamming it to the ground in the surveillance video obtained by WCBS-TV.

The man then seizes a wooden board from the furniture and accosts a 25-year-old man in traditional Jewish garb. Police say that he was hit in the chest with the board and also in the back.

""It's ridiculous and disrespectful and crazy and madness, all in sadness,"" commented one resident in the area.

The incident is being investigated by the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also ordered the state Hate Crimes Task Force to aid the investigation.

Police are seeking to identify the suspect caught on surveillance video.

Attacks on members of the Jewish community appeared to increase as a result of the brief but deadly war between Israel and Hamas militants. Incidents of hate-filled violence against Jews were documented from Florida to California in the weeks after the state warfare.

Some blame the hatred on anti-Semitic rhetoric coming from people like Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) who recently compared Israel and the United States to terror groups.

Here's a local news video about the incident:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/attack-jewish-man-brooklyn,2021-07-10
Security camera captures vandal tossing an incendiary device into Democratic Party offices in Austin,"Police are looking for a man caught on surveillance video tossing an incendiary explosive device into the offices of the Democratic Party of Travis County in Texas.

Arson investigators say the man lobbed what is colloquially known as a Molotov cocktail into the offices in downtown Austin at about 2 a.m. Wednesday.

The video shows a man with a bandana with the American flag, black shorts an a gray shirt approach the offices and toss a rock through the window of their door. Then he places inside what appears to be the incendiary device and runs away.

Video from inside the offices show what appears to be a commercial smoke bomb also go off inside.

The incident caused only minor damage to the building and no one was inside at the time. Investigators say the Molotov cocktail did not actually ignite, and if it had it would have caused much more damage to the offices.

The video also shows an employee from a nearby business helping to put out the growing flames with a fire extinguisher before police arrive.

Police say the man also left a threatening note but did not say what it said.

""This is an act of terror. When you leave a threatening note, the intent is to terrorize people. We are Texas Democrats, and we are unafraid,"" claimed Katie Naranjo, the chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, at a media briefing later that day.

Authorities said that vandalism was committed on the same night at the Travis County Ned Granger Administration Building about a half hour before the attack on Democratic offices.

Austin police did not say what charges the man might face, but did say that they would likely be felony charges. They are asking for the public's help to identify the suspect in the attack.

""The Democratic Party believes in free speech,"" Naranjo claimed, ""believes in your right to vote, and we will not be intimidated by any individual who takes such a cowardly act as to attack a democratic institution. Our political parties are a part of our democracy.""

"Police update on Austin shooting, 13 injured, photos, videos","Photos and videos show a chaotic scene after at least 13 people were injured from a mass shooting in Austin's bustling entertainment district. Police in the Texas city say the perpetrator is still at large.

The first call of shots fired came in to 911 around 1:24 a.m. local time Saturday. The incident occurred in a popular area featuring bars and restaurants, which attracted large ""pre-pandemic"" sized crowds on the night of the incident. Austin-Travis County EMS medics responded to the emergency, which they described as an ""active attack.""

Taylor Blount was at a bar on Sixth Street when he heard the gunshots.

""I only heard them from a single weapon and then everyone started running in different directions,"" Blount told the Austin American-Statesman. ""People were freaking out a lot, and there were some people crying, but most people were just freaking out.""

(CAUTION: Graphic video):

""It was very difficult to contain the scene, it was very difficult for EMS to make their way into this crowd,"" interim Austin Police Chief Joe Chacon said. ""And because of the nature of the injuries, officers had to go ahead and use their police vehicles to put some of these shooting victims into their vehicles and transport them themselves.""



EMS took four people to the hospital by ambulance, Austin police took six other victims to the hospital, and three were taken by private vehicle.



""I'm happy to report no one has died,"" Chacon said.



""We do have two patients in critical condition,"" he added. ""We have a total of 11 people transported to one hospital, one was transported to a different hospital and one person reported to an Urgent Care Clinic. So there is a total of 13 shooting victims.""



""Our officers responded very quickly,"" Chacon continued. ""They were able to immediately begin life-saving measures for many of these patients, including applications of tourniquets; applications of chest seals.""

""Security (on Sixth Street) is always pretty good down here because of the way that we cordon off the streets, block off the streets, using barricades and try to keep people safe that way,"" he said.





The ""large crime scene"" was blocked off following the incident to begin the investigation. Investigators are reviewing video footage of the area of the shooting, including from the Public Safety Camera System. Detectives from the Aggravated Assault, Homicide, Organized Crime, and Gang units are involved in the investigation, police said. The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force Team is also on scene, Chacon noted.



Authorities say the perpetrator appears to have fired randomly into the crowd. The interim police chief said the motive for the shooting was ""unclear"" at this time. Investigators have not ruled out gang involvement. ""At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident,"" Chacon stated.

Police noted that they do not have a ""very detailed"" description of the suspect, who Chacon said is a ""black male wearing a black shirt with a skinny build and with dreadlocks.""

Chacon said Saturday's incident was part of an alarming trend of shootings in Austin.

""What we have seen in recent months and over the last year or so is an increase in gun violence,"" Chacon said. ""And so this is just emblematic of that, it continues, and it's something we're trying to work to decrease.""

Anyone with more information or video of the shooting are encouraged to call police detectives at 512-974-8477, or contact Crime Stoppers by calling the tip line at 512-472-8477 or the mobile app.

'In Defense of Looting' author tells Twitter followers to 'ATTACK' police — yet her account is still active,"The author of ""In Defense of Looting"" — which argues that ""stealing goods and destroying property are direct, pragmatic strategies of wealth redistribution"" — told her Twitter followers to ""ATTACK"" law enforcement Sunday, noting that ""this is not the time for defense, respectability, reorganization. We gotta take what we got and throw it at the motherf***ers.""

Yet Vicky Osterweil's Twitter account — while having shifted to protected status in the wake of publicity over her words — was still active Tuesday morning despite her apparent violation of Twitter's policies.

What did she say?

Conservative author and Antifa expert Andy Ngo pointed out Osterweil's tweets Monday, saying she was ""inciting violence & terrorist attacks through her Twitter account.""

Image source: Twitter, redacted

""My shrill a** self thinks there's only one thing to do. ATTACK,"" she tweeted. ""This is not the time for defense, respectability, reorganization. We gotta take what we got and throw it at the motherf***ers, because at the moment those two pincers (anti-trans, anti-protest) are deeply unpopular.""

Minutes later Osterweil added another tweet:

Ngo added that Osterweil soon ""locked down"" her Twitter account ""so that she cannot be reported for inciting violence & terrorism.""

It appeared she had a few things to say about Ngo as well:

Image source: Twitter

What was the reaction?

More than a few folks didn't take too kindly to Osterweil's words:

""People like her will talk and act tough right up until the bullets start flying at them,"" one commenter remarked.

""She is a nasty despicable human!"" another user declared.

""People like her end up medicated on a psych ward if they and we are lucky,"" another user noted.

""We see the problem here,"" another commenter said. ""But Twitter let's [sic] their violent rhetoric go on without any redeeming social value.""

Anything else?

Osterweil's suggestion to ""ATTACK"" police coincided with far-left U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) telling Minnesota protesters Saturday to ""get more confrontational"" if the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial doesn't go their way.

In the aftermath, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) promised to bring action against Waters if Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) doesn't act. And it appears that Pelosi will not.

The judge in the Chauvin trial blasted Waters for her ""abhorrent"" comments, and while Judge Peter Cahill said that they could lead to the overturn of the trial if the defense chooses to appeal the verdict, he didn't grant a mistrial Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/author-tells-twitter-followers-to-attack-police-account-still-active,2021-04-20
Authorities pin man to ground at LaGuardia airport after fellow passenger mistakes vintage camera for bomb,"Authorities detained a man with a vintage camera after a fellow passenger reported the item as ""suspicious,"" a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey tells the New York Daily News.



What are the details?

The incident took place on Saturday afternoon at theLaGuardia Airport after American Airlines flight 4817 from Indianapolis, Indiana, made an emergency landing when a passenger reported a suspicious item on the plane.

An unnamed female passenger who was traveling with her husband and children spotted a man across the aisle who she believed to be browsing through bomb-making instructions on the internet. The female passenger believed her suspicions were confirmed when the unnamed male passenger pulled out what she believed to be an explosive device and began fiddling with it.

It turned out that the male passenger was browsing the web for information on vintage cameras — and the ""bomb"" turned out to be an antique camera of his own.

Frightened passengers

Airline chatter was captured on LiveATC.net, according to a report from the New York Times, in which one of the pilots can be heard saying, ""We have a situation where a person, a suspicious person, has an item that looks like an explosive device.""

""We're planning to turn off the runway, and then we will plan to evacuate,"" the pilot adds.

The pilot later says that flight crew aren't sure what the person has, but notes that ""everyone else is scared on this aircraft.""

Pilots made the emergency landing at the Queens airport, where authorities took the male passenger into custody, where they searched and questioned him over the woman's accusations.

Video footage of the incident showed emergency responders surrounding the male passenger as he was detained on the tarmac.

Authorities also confiscated and searched the male traveler's bags.

Inside, police found vintage cameras and a skateboard.

'It was crazy'

Fawad Khuja, a passenger on the plane, told the Times that pandemonium broke out during the flight.

""People were panicking and getting shoved to the ground,"" he recalled. ""The slide opened and I jumped out. People were sliding and rolling down to the floor. It was crazy.""



The male passenger was not charged in the incident.



Thomas Topousis, a spokesperson for the Port Authority Police Department, told the outlet that the department ""determined there was no criminality"" after it was determined that the male passenger ""did not make a verbal threat"" and was not carrying any suspicious items with him.

""The JTTF [Joint Terrorism Task Force], the FBI and the Port Authority Police Department determined that there was no criminality on the part of the passenger and he was released,"" Topousis .",https://www.theblaze.com/news/authorities-pin-man-to-ground-at-laguardia-airport-after-fellow-passenger-mistakes-vintage-camera-for-bomb,2021-10-11
Video shows man attack New York City McDonald's,"Viral video shows the moment that a man went on a rage-filled rampage with an ax at a McDonald's in New York City.

Around 2:25 a.m. on Friday, a man wearing blue shorts and a black tank top appears to get in an altercation with another man at the McDonald's on Delancey Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. However, two other men physically prevent the aggressor from getting near the other McDonald's customer.

The menacing man – later identified as Michael Palacios – shove the two men out of the way. Palacios punches a man dressed in white, which cause two other men to retaliate. Three men punch Palacios in the head, but he remained completely unfazed. Palacios appears to seemingly welcome the punches and doesn't defend himself from the flurry of fists as he casually leans on a garbage receptacle.

Palacios then takes his backpack off, and retrieves an ax. The men who punched Palacios quickly back away with their hands up.

A man begs him, ""Bro, please!""

Palacios then swings the ax and smashes a table. He hammers a wall where nearby onlookers were standing and then obliterates a large glass partition.

Palacios – a 31-year-old from the Bronx – then slaps and punches two men, knocking one to the floor.

A witness is heard saying on video with nearly 16 million views on Twitter, ""That's why I keep my knife on me all the time, man. S**t like this, you never know. God knows, man.""

The ax-man then gets in the face of a young woman who was sitting down and points his weapon at her. He then bashes the ax on the table she was sitting at.

Palacios walks towards one of the men who punched him earlier and threatens him with the ax. A young woman is shielding him from a possible ax attack.

The 2-minute video ends with Palacios leaving the McDonald's.

The New York Post reported that Palacios was charged with criminal mischief, three counts of menacing, and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. The outlet said that Palacios has a prior arrest for resisting arrest.

Police said nobody was injured in the furious frenzy. However, there was thousands of dollars of damages done to the McDonald's restaurant.

A spokesperson for the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information told TODAY, ""Upon arrival of officers, witnesses at the location reported that the suspect got into a physical dispute with three unknown males inside of the location. The suspect removed an ax from his backpack and menaced the unknown males. The suspect intentionally caused property damage to the establishment. The individual was taken into custody by responding officers. A search incident to a lawful arrest, an additional knife was recovered from his backpack.""

Paul Hendel – the owner-operator of the destroyed McDonald's – said, ""The safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority. We are shocked by these acts of violence committed in our restaurant, and we are cooperating fully with the authorities in their investigation.""

Rep. Ayanna Pressley says Republicans engaged in 'chemical warfare' by not wearing masks,"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) attacked GOP members of Congress who did not wear face masks during the Capitol riots. Pressley went so far as to say Republicans committed ""chemical warfare"" by not wearing face masks.

""It's criminal behavior,"" Pressley told CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday. ""I don't know what else to call it.""

""They have been complicit from the very beginning in their willful criminality to carry the water for Donald Trump and these science denials which allowed this pandemic to rage out of control,"" she said of Republican lawmakers.

""And then by refusing to wear the masks, this is criminal behavior,"" the Democrat alleged. ""That's chemical warfare so far as I'm concerned.""



Purposely spreading the coronavirus would technically be considered ""biological warfare"" and not ""chemical warfare.""

""When they took us to the 'safe room,' and I walked in and saw that there was this contingent of anti-maskers in the room gathered, I immediately exited,"" Pressley claimed. ""So imagine in that moment the choice that I was making. And we were told as we left that space, 'You'll be on your own in an evacuation.' And I said, 'I'll take my chances.'""

Pressley then denounced her Republican colleagues who were not wearing face masks during the Capitol riots.

""So in the midst of this terrorizing event, which inflicted great trauma, injury, and loss of life, where you would think even in that moment that they would attempt to extend some grace, some collegiality, or just to be decent human beings, they chose to recklessly endanger the members in that room, my spouse, my staff, and that of everyone else who was in proximity of them,"" she ranted.

On Tuesday, Pressley took to Twitter to condemn Republican lawmakers.



""The second I realized our 'safe room' from the violent white supremacist mob included treasonous, white supremacist, anti masker Members of Congress who incited the mob in the first place, I exited,"" she tweeted. ""Furious that more of my colleagues by the day are testing positive.""

According to Fox News, the maskless GOP politicians include Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Markwayne Mullin (Okla.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Scott Perry (Pa.), Michael Cloud (Texas), and Doug LaMalfa (Calif.).

Pressley announced Wednesday that her husband, Conan Harris, tested positive for COVID-19. Harris was with Pressley in the Capitol when the riot broke out Jan. 6 in Washington, D.C.

Harris, who is in isolation, has experienced mild symptoms, and it is was unclear how he contracted COVID-19, Boston.com reported. Pressley has tested negative for coronavirus, but is isolating along with her staff members.

Pressley also said she was proud to co-sponsor the resolution by Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) that calls for the expulsion of GOP House members who supported contesting the 2020 presidential election results in battleground states during the Electoral College certification, adding that these Republican lawmakers are ""unfit to serve.""



Pressley has been in the news recently after her comments calling for ""unrest in the streets"" from the summer have resurfaced online.



""There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives and unfortunately there's plenty to go around."" Pressley told ""AM Joy"" guest host Tiffany Cross in August.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ayanna-pressley-republicans-chemical-warfare-capitol,2021-01-15
"Bear tears through campers' tent, terrorizes mother and daughter","A black bear was euthanized after it attacked two people while they were tent camping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Sunday.

What are the details?

According to a report from ABC News, a family of five was visiting the park and came face to face with a black bear after it tore into the family's tent at approximately 5:20 a.m. local time.

The bear then proceeded to attack the mother and her 3-year-old daughter, leaving them with superficial head wounds. The family's father was eventually successful in scaring the bear away from the campsite and rushed the injured to a nearby medical facility for treatment. Park rangers quickly placed the immediate area on lockdown until the bear could be located and contained.

The park service in a statement said that it was able to capture the bear and put it down due to its apparent risk to humans. The bear, authorities said, appeared to have been ""food-conditioned,"" which is said to have prompted the animal to invade the family's tent.

“The bear weighed approximately 350 pounds, which is not standard for this time of year, suggesting the bear had previous and likely consistent access to non-natural food sources,” Lisa McInnis, chief of resource management, said in the statement provided by the park. “In this incident, the bear was likely attracted to food smells throughout the area, including dog food at the involved campsite. It is very difficult to deter this learned behavior and, as in this case, the result can lead to an unacceptable risk to people.”

The outlet reported that the black bear is the second of its kind to have been euthanized in June due to being fed — and becoming accustomed to — human food. Authorities encourage campers to make all necessary precautions to properly store food while in the parks.

""According to park officials, human-bear conflicts peak in late May and June when natural foods such as berries are not yet available,"" the outelt reported. ""As a result, bears are attracted to the smell of food in the park’s developed areas, including campgrounds and picnic areas.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bear-attack-great-smoky-mountains,2022-06-15
"After initially saying 'nothing untoward' occurred after Belarus used fighter jet to seize opposition journalist, Ryanair now calls it an 'act of aviation piracy'","Belarus drew swift condemnation from international leaders after the country reportedly used a fighter jet and a false bomb alert to force the landing of a Ryanair passenger plane over Minsk and seize opposition journalist, Roman Protasevich, on Sunday.

But in the hours after the abduction, Ryanair's press office amazingly reported that ""nothing untoward"" occurred during the flight's simple ""diversion.""

In a statement issued on Sunday, Ryanair stated, ""The aircraft landed safely and passengers were offloaded while security checks were completed by local authorities. Nothing untoward was found and authorities cleared the aircraft to depart together with passengers and crew after approx. 7hrs on the ground in Minsk.""

Responding to the statement, Washington Post reporter Liz Sly charged, ""Ryanair has quite literally airbrushed Roman Protasevich from the record,"" noting the airline neglected to mention in its summary of facts that ""one passenger was kidnapped [and] taken away.""

Roughly a day later, the company issued an updated statement in which it condemned the ""unlawful actions of the Barusian authorities"" as ""an act of aviation piracy."" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary followed by calling the incident ""state-sponsored hijacking"" on Irish Newstalk radio.

But the amendment came much too late as far as many critics were concerned, many of which were upset at the airline for turning over Protasevich to authorities of the despotic regime led by Alexander Lukashenko in the first place.

After all, Ryanair's initial response put them in line with the likes of Russia, whose foreign minister, Sergei Lavro, on Monday defended Belarus's actions as an ""absolutely reasonable approach.""

The United States and the rest of Europe on Monday condemned the shocking action as an act of ""piracy,"" ""hijacking,"" and ""state terrorism,"" NBC News reported, adding that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had demanded an international investigation to be conducted.

Reuters reported that the incident and subsequent punitive actions against Belarus were expected to dominate a planned European Union summit on Monday.

The news agency also reported that 26-year-old Protasevich — who has worked for Poland-based news service NEXTA and is wanted in Belarus for broadcasting protests against Lukashenko last year — ""held his head in his hands and looked sad and scared on landing.""

According to reports, Protasevich was seen being escorted by authorities into custody shortly after the plane landed on Minsk. At this point it is unclear what crimes he is charged with, but BBC News noted that in Belarus, causing mass unrest can be punished by up to 15 years in jail.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/belarus-hijacks-ryanair-plane-seizes-journalist,2021-05-24
Biden admin faced day one controversy over change to US ambassador to Israel Twitter account,"The Biden administration on Wednesday stirred controversy on day one by temporarily changing the Twitter account for the U.S. Ambassador to Israel before reversing the change after a report from the Washington Free Beacon called attention to it.

The Twitter account, which was most recently operated by former Ambassador David Friedman, was changed to read, ""U.S. Ambassador to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza,"" after Friedman vacated his office. The modified account drew heavy criticism from Republican lawmakers and others who thought that the change suggested the United States would not recognize Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza amid the ongoing dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.



Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was among the first lawmakers to speak out about the change, accusing Democrats of ""hostility to Israel.""



""The Biden Admin title change for the @USAmbIsrael shows the Democrats' hostility to Israel,"" Scott tweeted. ""There is no country of West Bank or Gaza, only territories that Israel has been willing for decades to negotiate sovereignty over but has been met with only hostility and terrorism.""

Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the change was ""provocative.""

""It's incredibly troubling the administration made this controversial move on Day One, [without] consulting [with] Congress. It also seems to fly in the face of comments made by Antony Blinken yesterday. I strongly urge the president to clarify this provocative move quickly,"" McCaul said.

Blinken, President Joe Biden's nominee for secretary of state, said during his confirmation hearing that the Biden administration would keep President Trump's policy of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that there were no plans to move the U.S. Embassy from the holy city.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Israel told the Jerusalem Post that the change, which was quietly reversed, ""was an inadvertent edit.""



""This is not a policy change or indication of future policy change,"" she said.

The Trump administration's Middle East policy placed a strong emphasis on strengthening ties with Israel. In 2017, Trump became the first U.S. president to keep his campaign promise of moving the embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing the city as Israel's capital, a move that infuriated Palestinians who have long claimed the city as their own.

In 2019, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights, overturning 52 years of U.S. foreign policy on the issue.

Going forward, Blinken's confirmation testimony suggested the Biden administration will not take immediate action to reverse Trump's policies, but did signal there will be some attempt to return to pre-Trump diplomatic normalcy.

""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Blinken said.

""Realistically it's hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward on that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-admin-controversy-ambassador-to-israel,2021-01-21
Biden admin issues new gun control rule in response to Michigan school shooting,"The Biden administration announced a new firearms rule this week in response to last year's tragic school shooting in Michigan that aims to ensure that all gun owners have secure storage devices for their guns.

What are the details?

The new rule, detailed in a Department of Justice press release issued Monday, requires all federally licensed gun retailers to certify that they have secure gun storage devices that are specifically compatible with the firearms they are selling available on-site to customers.

According to the Justice Department, acceptable devices ""include a safe, gun safe, gun case, lock box, or other device that is designed to be or can be used to store a firearm and that is designed to be unlocked only by means of a key, a combination, or other similar means.""



The new rule amends and officially codifies gun storage requirements already mandated under the Gun Control Act of 1999 for new Federal Firearms License applicants. With the new rule, the requirements will be law for ""any place where firearms are sold under the license to non-licensed individuals.""

The department also noted that ""integral to the new rule is the requirement that FFLs have available secure gun storage options that are compatible with the firearms they are selling.""

The rule has been submitted to the Federal Register for publication and is set to go into effect on Feb. 3. It can be read in its entirety here.

What else?

In a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the policy is intended ""to reduce the risk of firearms falling into the wrong hands."" He added that it builds on the Justice Department's efforts to cut down on gun crime.

“Gun safety is a Department of Justice priority, and we will continue to take all appropriate steps to help reduce the number of people killed and injured by the misuse of firearms,"" Garland said.

Lars Dalseide, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, responded to the news by telling the Washington Times that the gun-rights group “has always supported the safe storage of firearms.”

Bearing Arms, a pro-Second Amendment blog, noted that for new guns the change isn’t a big deal since new guns generally come with gun locks that would qualify under the regulation.

""But the problem is that many gun stores sell used guns, which means they have to also have some means of gun storage on-site regardless of what comes with new firearms,"" he added. ""That means already limited inventory space is going to have to be filled with expensive and often unnecessary gun storage options.""

Anything else?

The Times noted that the rule change came just one month after the arrest of the parents of Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old Michigan student who killed four and injured seven others using a firearm he took from his parents' home.

The parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter on Dec. 3 for failing to prevent the shooting, in part, by failing to secure the 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 they had purchased only days before.

In charging documents, Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said the gun had been stored in an unlocked drawer in the parents' bedroom and claimed that the parents ignored several warning signs indicating that their son would carry out the egregious act.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-admin-gun-storage-rule,2022-01-04
"Biden admin sued for sending $500 million to Palestinian Authority that allegedly funded policy responsible for killing hundreds of US, Israeli citizens","On Tuesday, a lawsuit was filed against the Biden administration and Secretary of State Antony Blinken that accused the administration of sending over half a billion taxpayer dollars to the Palestinian Authority, despite allegedly being aware that the PA was funding a policy responsible for killing hundreds of Israeli and American citizens, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.



The lawsuit, which was filed by America First Legal Foundation, argued that the Biden administration sent large sums of money to the Palestinian Authority, a government that has supported paying terrorists who commit acts of violence against Israelis via the PA Martyrs Fund. The program, also referred to as “Pay to Slay,” is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. and Israeli citizens.

Taylor Force, a 28-year-old U.S. Army veteran, was murdered by Palestinian terrorists while on a graduate program trip to Israel. In response to the atrocity, former President Donald Trump and Congress passed the Taylor Force Act in 2017, which prevents U.S. taxpayer dollars from going to the PA until the regime ends its “Pay to Slay” policy.

The lawsuit argues that the Biden administration has continued to send funds despite the legislation. After announcing in May 2020 that he planned to restore funding to the PA, Biden signed off on over $360 million to the PA the following year.

According to a Palestinian official, that same year, the PA sent $181 million to terrorists who committed acts of violence against Israel.

The lawsuit claimed the administration admitted to Congress a few months before distributing the funds that it was aware that the PA was still implementing the policy. According to the complaint, again in May 2022, a private report to Congress revealed that the Biden administration was aware that the PA had not ceased its deadly policy and had sent another $341 million to terrorists and their families.

“The defendants took power on January 20, 2021, with a new plan: Transfer hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers to the Palestinian Authority despite Pay to Slay and contrary to the Taylor Force Act,” the complaint stated. “Contrary to law, they have transferred nearly half a billion American taxpayer dollars to directly benefit and subsidize the Palestinian Authority.”

Taylor Force’s father, Stuart, told the DCNF that his family hopes to hold the administration accountable.

“Our role in the lawsuit is as it was in our efforts to enact the original Taylor Force Act – to put a human face on the horrific effects of the Palestinian Authority’s Pay for Slay policy,” Force told the news outlet. “Multiply the devastating loss of our beloved son Taylor by the hundreds of Israeli families that have also been impacted by this inhumane atrocity of Pay for Slay and you will understand why we are committed to ending the flow of US dollars to the PA.”

“If [Biden and Blinken] understood what motivates Israel’s enemies, the elimination of the State of Israel, I would think they would stop any funding that could possibly find its way into the wrong hands,” Force continued. “Aside from the increased rocket barrages, tunnel construction, and increased frequency of attacks on innocent civilians when ‘foreign aid’ increases, the money is used in its widespread PR campaign to incite violence and foment hatred of Israel and the United States.”

A State Department spokesperson told the DCNF, “As a matter of practice, we do not comment on pending litigation.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment, the DCNF reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-admin-sued-sending-money-to-palestinian-authority,2022-12-22
Biden administration grants Afghan nationals 'temporary protected status' protecting them from deportation,"The Biden administration will not deport citizens of Afghanistan who are illegally living in the United States.

The Washington Examiner reported that the Department of Homeland Security announced on Wednesday the implementation of “Temporary Protected Status"" (TPS) for Afghans currently residing in the United States. This program, debuted by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, means that Afghans brought to the United States during last fall’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan are protected from deportation and will be able to secure employment for the next 18 months.

Many of these Afghan citizens were not fully vetted by the federal government prior to their evacuation from Afghanistan.

Mayorkas said, “This TPS designation will help to protect Afghan nationals who have already been living in the United States from returning to unsafe conditions.”

He said, “Under this designation, TPS will also provide additional protections and assurances to trusted partners and vulnerable Afghans who supported the U.S. military, diplomatic, and humanitarian missions in Afghanistan over the last 20 years.”

DHS officials said that the TPS policy is not necessarily intended for the nearly 80,000 Afghans whom the U.S. evacuated from Kabul last year, but “these individuals may also be eligible for TPS.”

Afghan refugees brought to the U.S. during this time were released into the country’s interior on a “parole basis” that protected them from deportation and enabled them to secure employment for a period of two years.

In a press release, the DHS said that Afghan refugees were targeted for TPS due to the “extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent the country’s nationals from returning in safety.”

Since the Taliban came into power last summer, terror groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State-Khorasan have periodically carried out attacks on civilians.

The department’s press release also indicated that Afghanistan’s unstable economy and poor record on human rights issues justified extending the TPS program to cover Afghan refugees.

It cited “a collapsing public sector, a worsening economy, drought, food and water insecurity, lack of access to healthcare, internal displacement, human rights abuses and repression by the Taliban, destruction of infrastructure, and increasing criminality” as reasons for protecting Afghan refugees from deportation.

However, the department noted that TPS will not be granted to Afghans who arrived in the country after March 15, 2022, and that to qualify for TPS, Afghans must undergo background and security checks.

DHS officials did not say how many Afghan refugees currently in the country are protected from deportation.

Over 300,000 people — from 13 total countries — have been approved for TPS since Congress launched the program in 1990.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-grants-afghan-nationals-temporary-protected-status-protecting-them-from-deportation,2022-03-16
Biden administration moving towards closing Guantanamo,"The Biden administration is taking steps towards closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, The Wall Street Journal reports.

For the first time, the administration has appointed a senior diplomat to oversee detainee transfers. The WSJ also reports that the administration “signaled it won’t interfere with plea negotiations that could resolve the long-stalled prosecution of alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants.”

Biden has long stated his intention of closing the facility, which has housed prisoners captured as part of the Global War on Terrorism.

The prison — known formally as the Guantanamo Bay detention camp — was established by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 following the attacks of 9/11. Since that time, roughly 780 detainees have been held at the prison located in Cuba. Currently, 36 prisoners remain, according to The New York Times.

Almost since its opening, the prison has been a source of controversy, due to its condition and the treatment of prisoners located there.

“Since the Bush administration, there has been agreement among national security experts and across the political spectrum that the Guantánamo prison – a notorious site of torture and unjustifiable indefinite detention – should be closed,” said Daphne Eviatar, Director of the Security with Human Rights Program at Amnesty International USA.

During his time in the White House, President Obama called for shutting the prison down. Congress pushed back, responding to Obama’s efforts in 2010 by passing a ban on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the U.S.

The debate over closing the prison remains politically fraught. “The administration doesn’t want to look like it’s soft on terrorism and is awaiting a political consensus,” said Harvey Rishikof, a law professor who helped draft a recent report on closing the facility.

According to that report, the Guantanamo Bay prison costs $540 million a year to operate. That comes to $15 million per detainee, compared with about $78,000 a year for an inmate at the high-security U.S. Penitentiary in Florence, Colorado, reports the Wall Street Journal.

The WSJ also reports that the Pentagon is moving ahead with building a third courtroom at Guantanamo Bay at a cost of $4 million, even though no additional trials are expected there.

“Obviously, if this were easy, four presidents, 20 years, we would have figured this out,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told a Senate committee in December.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-moving-towards-closing-guantanamo,2022-09-19

The revived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, includes American concessions negotiated by the Biden administration that immunize Moscow from certain sanctions deployed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, the Washington Free Beacon reported, citing Russian and Iranian documents.

Specifically, the new deal will allow Rosatom, Russia's top state-controlled energy company, to ""cash in on a $10 billion contract"" to help Tehran expand its Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, according to the Free Beacon. Bushehr is one of the most controversial nuclear sites in Iran.

Thus, the new JCPOA establishes a ""sanctions evasion hub"" providing Russian companies with money, essentially counteracting energy sanctions deployed after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

A State Department official confirmed to the Free Beacon the U.S. will ""not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the JCPOA.""

""The United States will take actions as necessary to ensure that U.S. sanctions do not apply to the implementation of JCPOA nuclear-related projects and activities by non-U.S. individuals and entities,"" the official explained. ""Perhaps it is now clear to Moscow that, as we have said publicly, the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its implementation.""

The Russian Foreign Ministry also confirmed the development.

""Additions were made to the text of the future agreement on #JCPOA restoration to ensure that all the JCPOA-related projects, esp. with Russian participation, as well as Bushehr NPP, are protected from negative impact of anti-Russian restrictions by US & EU,"" the ministry's Vienna mission said on Twitter.

The U.S. is also lifting sanctions on Iran.

As part of the deal, the U.S. will lift economic sanctions on Tehran that prevented the country from accessing funds held in South Korean and Japanese banks. Unfreezing the funds will allow Iran to pay Russia for working on its nuclear program.

Additionally, Axios reported the U.S. is considering removing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from terrorist lists. The IRCG is known to fund terrorism against the U.S. and its allies across the Middle East.

Anything else?

Republican lawmakers have been extremely critical of Biden's administration for renegotiating the JCPOA over fears the U.S. would give up too many concessions.

Unfortunately, those fears will probably be realized once the deal is finalized.

In fact, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's lead negotiator, recently bragged that Moscow, Tehran, and Beijing essentially took the U.S. to the cleaners in getting what they wanted from the deal at the expense of America.

""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" Ulyanov said. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-caves-to-russia-on-sanctions-in-new-iran-nuclear-deal-will-enrich-russia-report,2022-03-17
"Report: Biden considers using private firms to surveil 'extremist chatter' online in response to domestic terrorism, Capitol riot","The Biden administration is considering partnering with outside firms to surveil ""extremist chatter"" online as part of an effort to combat domestic terrorism in the country, CNN reported Monday.

What are the details?

The move — which comes in apparent response to the growth of far-right extremism in America and, specifically, the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol — would enhance the federal government's ability to gather intelligence from conversations happening in private spaces online.

As it stands, the Department of Homeland Security is legally limited in how it can surveil citizens online without justification and prohibited from assuming false identities to breach private messaging apps, CNN noted. Instead, federal authorities can only browse through information shared on social media and other open platforms.

But under the new plan, which is currently being discussed inside the department, federal officials would be able to ""circumvent those limits"" by partnering with ""research firms who have more visibility in this space.""

""A source familiar with the effort said it is not about decrypting data but rather using outside entities who can legally access these private groups to gather large amounts of information that could help DHS identify key narratives as they emerge,"" the report stated.

Essentially, private researchers who already monitor such activity online would act as middlemen in the new scheme, providing DHS with ""broad summaries or analysis of narratives"" emerging in private groups operated by groups such as the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.

DHS officials reportedly insisted to CNN that any information obtained by the department would ""not be used to target specific individuals.""

What else?

The plan aims to close an intelligence gap which allegedly contributed to a failure to prepare for the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, experts and officials argued, despite claims that warnings were given to the FBI well in advance of the riot. Notably, even as concerns grew ahead of the day, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser discouraged additional federal law enforcement.

One DHS official reportedly told CNN that by the time narratives are appearing on Facebook, it is usually too late.

""Domestic violent extremists are really adaptive and innovative. We see them not only moving to encrypted platforms, but obviously couching their language so they don't trigger any kind of red flag on any platforms,"" the official said.

""There was only limited awareness before January 6 of what violent extremists were planning through social media,"" added Tom Warrick, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who served as DHS deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism policy from 2008 until 2019.

He said he expects the DHS is exploring ""whether contractors could help them understand plots and trends"" emerging online.

Anything else?

The Biden administration has been outspoken about its intentions to combat the growth of white supremacist extremism in the country.

Last week, during his first address to a joint session of Congress, Biden claimed that white supremacists have replaced jihadists as the ""most lethal terrorist threat"" to the U.S.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-considers-surveilling-extremist-chatter-online,2021-05-03
President Biden gets into heated exchange with Fox News reporter during media briefing on deadly terror attack in Kabul,"President Joe Biden appeared to get flustered as Peter Doocy of Fox News challenged him to take responsibility for the debacle in Afghanistan that has now cost the lives of 12 U.S. service members.

Biden had a moment of silence during the briefing Thursday for the service members killed in the attack and he promised to have a military response against those who were responsible.

After the briefing, Doocy asked Biden if he took full responsibility for the events leading to the attack.

""Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline, you pulled troops out, you sent troops back in, and now 12 Marines are dead,"" said Doocy.

""You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way things have unfolded in the last two weeks?"" Doocy asked.

""I bear responsibility fundamentally for all that has happened of late,"" Biden replied.

""But here's the deal. You know, I wish you someday would say these things, you know as well as I do, that the former president made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1,"" he continued.

""In return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others but would not attack any American forces. Do you remember that? I'm being serious. I'm asking you a question,"" he added, interrupting Doocy.

The president laid his head on his hands in frustration at Doocy during their crosstalk.

Biden also stood by his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan after Doocy pressed him on the issue.

""Yes I do, because look at it this way folks,"" Biden replied.

""Imagine where we'd be if I had indicated on May the 1st I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date. We were gonna stay there. I'd have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won relative to why the reason we went in the first place,"" he explained.

""I have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a Democratic government in Afghanistan,"" Biden continued, ""a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country, and is made up, and I don't mean this in a derogatory, made up of different tribes who have never ever ever gotten along with one another.""

Biden ended the briefing at that point and cited other meetings he needed to attend.

Biden says the gov't will begin a door-to-door push for vaccination after failing to meet 4th of July goal,"President Joe Biden said that his administration would implement a door-to-door effort to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated after failing to meet his goal for the Fourth of July.

Biden made the announcement in a speech on Tuesday outlining how the government would move forward to improve the nationwide vaccination rate.

""Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and often times door to door— literally knocking on doors to get help to the remaining people, protected from the virus,"" said Biden.

""Look, equity, equality, it remains at the heart of our responsibility of ensuring the communities that have been hardest hit by the virus, have the information and the access to get vaccinated,"" he continued. ""So, as we shift from these centralized mass vaccination sites, we're doing thousands of people a day, we're going to access close to your community, close to home, conveniently, and location you're already familiar with.""

The Biden administration failed to meet their goal to vaccinate at least 70% of U.S. adults by the Fourth of July after new vaccinations slowed as more states reopened their economies.

About 47% of adults in the U.S. are fully vaccinated. Health officials say a 70%-90% vaccination rate is needed in order to fight the pandemic successfully, including the emerging variants.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated the door-to-door plan during Tuesday's media briefing.

""One, targeted community by community door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need on how both safe and accessible the vaccine is,"" explained Psaki.

Some critics of Biden responded by comparing the door-to-door effort to the terror campaign against the Jews under the Nazi regime in Germany.

""Not only is this utterly ridiculous. It is totally un-Constitutional and 100% Nazi Germany,"" responded Pastor Greg Locke.

""Sending Joe Biden's Gestapo door-to-door to check up on non-vaccinated Americans is really a recipe for disaster,"" tweeted Lavern Spicer, a Florida Republican congressional candidate.

Here's more about the new Biden vaccination effort:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-door-to-door-vaccines,2021-07-06
Biden to announce end to US combat mission in Iraq,"President Joe Biden and Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi will announce on Monday an agreement to end the U.S. military's combat mission in Iraq, a senior Biden administration official told reporters.

The two leaders are meeting at the White House in the afternoon and will release a ""broad communiqué"" that will establish a timetable for the U.S. military to withdraw from combat by the end of the year. U.S. forces will remain in Iraq in a training and advisory role, according to a transcript of the call released by White House.

""As this evolution continues, and as we formally end the combat mission and make clear that there are no American forces with a combat role in the country, Iraq has requested, and we very much agree, that they need continued training; support with logistics, intelligence, advisory capacity building — all of which will continue,"" the official said.

The announcement follows the Biden administration's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, ending the 20-year war that began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The war in Iraq began in 2003, when President George W. Bush invaded Iraq after linking Saddam Hussein to the terrorist group al-Qaeda, which was responsible for 9/11.

Nearly two decades later, there are about 2,500 troops still deployed in Iraq and the U.S. military has trained 250,000 Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish fighters to combat the remaining forces of the Islamic State. These fighters are ""battle tested"" and ""have proven very capable in protecting their country,"" according to the official.

""At the same time, ISIS remains a threat,"" the official acknowledged, citing a roadside bomb attack in Baghdad that killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens more last week. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Biden administration appears to want to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Obama administration's premature 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, which left a weak Iraqi government unprepared for the threat of ISIS. By 2014, ISIS had captured several major cities including Mosul, and the Obama administration returned troops to Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.

""Some of these battles in Mosul were extremely costly on the Iraqi side. And so, nobody ever wants to see something like that again,"" the official said. ""And we're committed to making sure, as we always said from the beginning, nobody is going to declare 'mission accomplished.'""

Since ISIS was routed on the battlefield in 2017, Iraqi lawmakers have demanded that the U.S. withdraw its combat presence in their country. The U.S. and Iraq have met for three strategic talks to discuss the future of U.S. military intervention in Iraq, the first beginning under the Trump administration and the last being held in April when the Biden administration agreed to shift the mission of U.S. troops to training and advisory roles.

Though a timetable will now be set for when that transition is completed, the official declined to say how many U.S. troops would withdraw from Iraq, if any.



""The goal is the enduring defeat of ISIS. We recognize you have to keep pressure on these networks as they seek to reconstitute, but the role for U.S. forces and coalition forces can very much recede, you know, deep into the background where we are training, advising, sharing intelligence, helping with logistics,"" the official explained. ""And that's about where we are now.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-end-combat-mission-iraq,2021-07-26
"Biden mocks resurgence of Al Qaeda on 9/11 anniversary, gets booed at memorial: 'Terrible!'","President Joe Biden mocked the resurgence of Al Qaeda on the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on Saturday after earlier in the day being booed while visiting the 9/11 Memorial at the World Trade Center.

What did Biden say?

While speaking with reporters at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania — the location where 40 people lost their lives after thwarting hijackers' plans to fly United Flight 93 into the White House or U.S. Capitol building — Biden admitted that Al Qaeda could ""come back.""

""If you would have told anybody that we were going to spend $300 million bucks a day for 20 years to try to unite the country after we got [Osama] bin Laden, after Al Qaeda was wiped out there— can Al Qaeda come back? Yeah,"" Biden said.

""But guess what? It's already back in other places,"" he continued, lowering his voice to a mocking tone. ""What's the strategy? Every place where Al Qaeda is, we're going to invade and have troops stay in? Come on.""

Biden's admission contradicted what he said just weeks ago. In defending the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, Biden described the mission there as a success.

""What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al Qaeda gone? We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, as well as getting Osama bin Laden. And we did,"" Biden said on Aug. 20. ""We went and did the mission.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby later contradicted Biden.

""We know that al Qaeda is a presence, as well as ISIS, in Afghanistan, and we've talked about that for quite some time,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin admitted Thursday that Al Qaeda could make resurgence in Afghanistan, and the Biden administration is merely employing a ""wait and see"" approach.

""I think the whole community is kind of watching to see what happens and whether or not Al Qaeda has the ability to regenerate in Afghanistan,"" Austin said. ""The nature of al Qaeda and ISIS-K is that, you know, they will always attempt to find space to grow and regenerate, whether it's there, whether it's in Somalia, whether it's in any other ungoverned space.""

When was Biden booed?

While walking with former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, Biden stopped to speak with a nearby person.

That's when the crowd of people began booing.

""You're a mug for what you did to Afghanistan,"" one man yelled. ""Terrible! Terrible!""

Another person yelled, ""Don't sniff 'em.""

"Biden neglects to mention slavery reparations in landmark speech on racial violence, upsetting some","President Joe Biden bitterly disappointed some activists after he neglected to mention slavery reparations in a major speech he gave this week on racial violence in America and steps his administration is taking to reduce racial inequities. Biden also privately downplayed expectations on advancing reparations for slavery for black Americans through Congress, according to a report.

On Tuesday, the president gave an address in Tulsa, Oklahoma on the 100th anniversary of the race massacre where hundreds of black Americans were attacked and killed by a white mob in 1921. Biden said the senseless murder of 300 black people in Tulsa's Greenwood district was ""an act of hate and domestic terrorism, with a through-line that exists today.""

He announced several policy initiatives intended to reduce racial inequity, including investing in minority-owned businesses, regulating the housing market to combat racial discrimination, and urging Congress to pass his American Jobs Plan to spend more than $60 billion on programs designed to create jobs and support infrastructure in communities of color.

But the president omitted any mention of H.R. 40, a Democratic bill that would create a commission to study reparations for slavery, which surprised some Democrats. As a presidential candidate, Biden supported forming a reparations commission and promised to do so if elected president.

But according to Politico, Biden downplayed expectations for such a bill in a private meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus.

""He didn't disagree with what we're doing,"" said Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). ""He did talk about his plate [being] full with trying to get the infrastructure bill passed and that he really wanted to make sure that he could get that through before he took on anything else.""

Lawrence told Politico that Biden was concerned H.R. 40 would be held up in the United States Senate, where Senate Democrats would be forced to take a tough vote on a controversial issue and Republican filibuster threats would assuredly prevent the bill from passing.

Many Democrats praised Biden's speech, even with the omission of the reparations issue.

""He called out how through the years there have been members in elected office who were very public about their association or membership with [the] KKK,"" Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.). ""He set up the scene in his speech to take us into what was happening at that time. And that was really powerful. I was so glad to hear it.""

Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) called Biden's speech ""meaningful"" for Tulsa and the country. ""Most of America had absolutely zero knowledge of the greatest single atrocity to Black people in this country. For him to use his pulpit to publicize what happened to them has to have been cathartic for them.""

Oklahoma state Rep. Regina Goodwin, a descendent of survivors of the Tulsa massacre, was thankful Biden came to address the anniversary of the massacre, even if he didn't mention reparations.

""Look, it was not in the speech, but he was gracious enough to be here. He was gracious enough to take the steps. He was open to the conversation. A lot more than I can say for some folks,"" she said.

But others expressed displeasure with the president.

""I personally would have liked to hear the word reparations. I think that he was very strategic in the words that he used. He used the word repair,"" Nehemiah Frank, another descendant and founder of The Black Wall Street Times in Tulsa, told Politico. ""If you want to pull the people together, you can't fully help Black people. That's how I feel about it. If you want to make Black folks happy, you're going to piss a lot of Americans off.""

Dreisen Heath, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, told Politico she stormed off immediately after Biden's speech because she was frustrated with his neglect to mention reparations.

""This was not a celebration. People are mourning. Every day counts for these survivors. And I think that people just play games with Black people's lives too much. It's not enough to just come in and say words and reiterate the truthful narrative,"" Heath said.

Heath authored a report last year that said reparations for survivors of the Tulsa massacre should serve as a model for any larger reparations study or program initiated by the federal government.

""This is a huge national [and] global moment. Everybody is looking here. So why not start the process for the precedent? Why not make Tulsa a precedent for reparations nationally? Why not commit to signing H.R. 40 into law? Why not commit to establishing an H.R. 40 reparations commission if the legislative avenues fail?"" Heath added.

Biden's private discussion with lawmakers appears to answer Heath's questions. The president wants Congress to put together a bipartisan deal on infrastructure because there's a chance it could actually pass. Reparations are not going to pass the U.S. Senate and haven't yet come up for a vote in the House of Representatives.

Additionally, as Politico notes, results from a poll conducted earlier this year found that only 38% of U.S. voters support forming a commission to study reparations for slavery. While 60% of Democrats may support the commission, the rest of the country still views the issue skeptically and Biden, a career politician, is sensitive to political realities, especially with the upcoming 2022 congressional elections in mind.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-neglects-to-mention-slavery-reparations-in-landmark-speech-on-racial-violence-upsetting-some,2021-06-02
Top Biden official admits he 'can't make any guarantees' Afghan troop withdrawal won't empower terrorists,"National security adviser Jake Sullivan admitted Sunday the Biden administration cannot guarantee that withdrawing United States troops from Afghanistan will not create another power vacuum that emboldens terrorist groups like the Islamic State.

Biden announced last week that he would formally withdraw all U.S. personnel from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the infamous terror attacks on U.S. soil.

Currently, there are about 2,500 U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan, along with 1,000 special forces personnel.

What is the background?

After U.S. forces successfully defeated al Qaeda in Iraq, then-President Barack Obama ordered the full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011.

The move is now seen as a strategic failure, likely creating a power vacuum that allowed ISIS to exponentially grow in the destabilized region.

Army officer Ryan N. Mannina explains:

[T]he [Obama] administration mishandled the withdrawal of US forces in 2011, leaving the Sunnis vulnerable and the Iraqi security forces (ISF) unprepared to take responsibility for the country's security. Almost simultaneously, a civil war broke out in Syria. The remnants of AQI—under a new name, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS or the Islamic State)—exploited the conflict to renew their jihad and rebuild their combat power. Iraq's Sunni minority—alienated and abandoned—began fighting back against oppression by the Maliki government. In 2014, the Sunnis welcomed ISIS back into Anbar province and helped them seize nearly a third of Iraq's territory, establishing the physical caliphate ISIS had always dreamed of building.

What did Sullivan say?

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sullivan admitted that he ""can't make any guarantees"" that Biden's troop withdrawal will not result in another power vacuum that will be exploited by terrorists.

""I can't make any guarantees about what will happen inside the country. No one can,"" Sullivan said.

""All the United States could do is provide the Afghan security forces, the Afghan government, and the Afghan people resources and capabilities, training and equipping their forces, providing assistance to their government,"" he continued. ""We have done that, and now, it is time for American troops to come home and the Afghan people to step up to defend their own country.""

Though Sullivan did not provide details, he explained the U.S. has the capabilities to ""suppress the terror threat"" in Afghanistan without having U.S. personnel stationed there, but reiterated that Biden has ""no intention"" of sending troops back to Afghanistan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-official-afghan-troop-withdrawal-empower-terrorists,2021-04-19
Report: Biden officials — including John Kerry — 'colluded' with Iran behind Trump’s back during his presidency,"Members of the Biden administration, including former Secretary of State John Kerry and current special envoy on Iran policy Robert Malley, held backchannel meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during Trump's presidency in attempt to undermine the Republican president, according to a new report from the Washington Times.

The meetings were reportedly part of a counter-diplomacy effort by the former Obama-era officials — who now serve in the Biden administration — which ""allowed for the Iranian regime to bypass Trump and work directly with Obama administration veterans that Tehran hoped would soon return to power in Washington,"" according to several unnamed national security and intelligence sources.

One former senior U.S. official told the Times that the ""underlying goal"" of the meetings was ""to devise a political strategy to undermine the Trump administration"" and set the stage for a more accommodating U.S. stance towards Iran in anticipation of Obama-era officials returning to power.

The meetings reportedly occurred between 2017 and 2019. One of the meetings, between Zarif and Malley, took place after former President Trump withdrew from the Iran deal, which was signed during Obama's presidency.

The deal, which halted sanctions against the terror-sponsoring regime in exchange for its promise to discontinue development on a nuclear weapon, was considered a hallmark achievement by Obama administration officials. But many suspect that Obama officials were simply suckered by the regime, which never had any intentions of holding up their end of the deal's obligations.

Kerry publicly acknowledged meeting with Zarif multiple times early on during Trump's presidency, which prompted Trump to accuse the former secretary of state of violating the Logan Act.

Though the exact details regarding what was discussed are not clear, one of the major objectives of the meetings was to lobby support for reentrance into the Iran deal should the next president be a member of the Democratic Party.

The Times report also notes that, in 2019, Trump sought to set up backchannel communications with the regime in order to defuse rising tensions, but those attempts were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, top Democrats were continuing to meet with Zarif.

Mark Dubowitz, head of the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Times, ""Former administration officials can play a very helpful role in close coordination with a sitting administration to open and support sensitive diplomatic channels ... But it is not good practice for senior officials who served at the highest levels of a former administration, Democratic or Republican, to be trying to undermine the policy of a sitting administration by engaging actively with a known enemy of the United States.""

""That's especially true when multiple administrations have determined that this enemy is the leading state sponsor of terrorism,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-officials-john-kerry-iran-colluded,2021-02-23
"Biden in ​Prayer Breakfast pulpit calls out 'white supremacy,' 'domestic terrorism' — then fellow Catholic slams him for backing abortion, transgenderism","President Joe Biden made sure to use his pulpit for the National Prayer Breakfast to hit all the Democratic talking points.

Let's see: Climate change, racial justice, lives and jobs lost due to COVID-19, the Capitol riots — which he characterized as ""an assault on our democracy ... a violent attack that threatened lives and took lives"" — and the need to ""confront and defeat political extremism, white supremacy, and domestic terrorism.""

""For so many in our nation, this is a dark, dark time. So, where do we turn?"" the Democrat inquired.

He had an answer; but the first Catholic commander-in-chief since John F. Kennedy didn't say ""God"" or ""Jesus"" — or even ""Buddha"" or ""Muhammad.""

""Faith,"" Biden replied to himself before finally quoting a religious figure — philosopher Soren Kierkegaard — saying ""faith sees best in the dark.""

""I believe that to be true,"" he continued. ""For me, in the darkest moments, faith provides hope and solace. It provides clarity and purpose as well. It shows the way forward as one nation in a common purpose to respect one another, to care for one another, to leave no one behind.""

After reminding us that ""the Bible tells us 'weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,'"" Biden concluded his speech by finally invoking God: ""May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.""

Pushback

As you might guess, not everyone was tickled pink by Biden's address.

The Christian Post reported that Brian Burch — president of CatholicVote, a national faith-based advocacy organization — stated that the president ignored ""the aggressive and hostile steps taken by his administration against people of faith, including the anti-science transgender mandate and the deeply unpopular decision to fund abortion around the world.""

While Biden has been criticized by Catholics and other Christians for such views, he's seen plenty of support elsewhere. The New York Times called Biden the ""most religiously observant commander-in-chief in half a century,"" pointing out that he ""regularly attends Mass and speaks of how his Catholic faith grounds his life and his policies. And with Mr. Biden, a different, more liberal Christianity is ascendant: less focused on sexual politics and more on combating poverty, climate changes and racial inequality.""

But Burch wasn't buying any of it.

""It's important to also remember that President Biden does not speak for Catholics or the church,"" he said, according to the Post. ""In fact, he explicitly departs from many of the church's non-negotiable beliefs and teachings. For this reason, the Catholic Bishops of the United States have rightly pointed to deep concerns about Biden's policies that would 'advance moral evils' on issues such as marriage, family, religious liberty, and the defense of vulnerable children in the womb.""

He added, ""Our country is desperately in need of healing and unity. Throughout our history, our leaders have called the country to prayer and obedience to the truths of our Judeo-Christian heritage. President Biden's words this morning were both underwhelming and disappointing,"" the outlet noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-prayer-breakfast-gets-slammed,2021-02-05
White House says Biden will shut down Guantanamo Bay prison by the end of his term,"The Biden administration said that they intended to shutter the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba by the end of the president's term.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the intended closure during the media briefing on Friday.

""That certainly is our goal and our intention,"" said Psaki when asked about the closing of the detention center.

""And we are three weeks in, I realize, at a certain point I can't say that anymore, but we are still just three and a half weeks in, so we are undertaking an NSC process, which is how it should work. Through that, to work with the interagency, to assess the current state of play that the Biden administration has inherited from the previous administration,"" she explained.

""I would note that in order to see this process through completely and thoroughly, there are a number of key policy roles that still need to be filled within the interagency,"" Psaki added.

If the Biden administration were successful in their intention to close the prison it would fulfill a promise made by the former Obama administration in February 2016.

""For many years, it has been clear that the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay does not advance our national security — it undermines it,"" former President Barack Obama said at the time, with then-Vice President Joe Biden standing next to him.

At the time, there were 91 detainees at the prison, but there are currently only 40 left.

Among those detained at the prison is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the al-Qaeda terrorist who masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks that killed 2,997 Americans. In January, it was reported that detainees at the center would be given the option to receive the coronavirus vaccine.

""The President's objective is what any president's objective is — to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values. And so yes, that was an ask that was made,"" Psaki told reporters at a media briefing.

Among the more prominent members told to resign were KellyAnne Conway, former senior counselor to the president, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster.

Conway published a fiery response saying that she would not resign.

""Three former Directors of Presidential Personnel inform me that this request is a break from presidential norms,"" said Conway in her statement.

""It certainly seems petty and political if not personal. The result is that faithful and willing public servants will be discouraged or thwarted from service. Our service academies will risk being further politicized and polarized,"" she added.

""Your decision is disappointing but understandable given the need to distract from a news cycle that has you mired in multiple self-inflicted crises and plummeting poll numbers,"" Conway continued, ""including a rise in new COVID cases, a dismal jobs report, inflation, record amount of drugs coming across the southern border, and, of course, the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan that has left hundreds of Americans thousands of Afghan allies stranded under Taliban rule.""

She went on to reference the 13 U.S. service members that died in a terror attack in Afghanistan before concluding.

""I'm not resigning,"" said Conway, ""but you should.""

Other advisors protested in their responses to the request from the Biden administration.

""Frankly, I find this whole act unconscionable and not all in the spirit by which this Administration promised to govern,"" responded Meagan Mobbs. ""It is tragic that this great institution is now being subjected to and hijacked by partisan action that serves no purpose and no greater good.""

Russell Vought said simply, ""No. It's a three year term.""

Biden announces US war in Afghanistan will end ahead of schedule by Aug. 31,"The U.S. war in Afghanistan will officially be over by the end of August, President Joe Biden announced in remarks delivered Thursday. The president gave an update on the status of U.S. troop withdrawal, which is proceeding ahead of schedule.

""Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on Aug. 31. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart,"" Biden said.

Last April, Biden pledged to withdraw the remaining 3,500 troops from the war-torn nation, bringing an end to a 20-year-old military conflict.

""As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan — to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and deliver justice to Osama bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That's why we went,"" Biden said.

""We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build,"" he added. ""And it's the right and the responsibility of Afghan people, alone, to decide their future and how they want to run their country.""

The president said that U.S. forces have trained and equipped 300,000 Afghan soldiers to maintain control of the country after American troops have withdrawn and emphasized that the federal government will continue to provide funding for the Afghan military to maintain its air force.

Biden made clear that he will resist calls for continued military intervention in Afghanistan despite the gains Taliban fighters have made as the U.S. exited the region. In just the last week, the radical Islamic terrorist group has taken control of 10% of the country, according to the Foundation fo Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit group that is monitoring the conflict in the Middle East. The foundation's analysis found that the Afghan government only controls 20% of the country, with the rest disputed.

Earlier this week, NBC News reported that the Taliban had seized containers full of weapons and military hardware from the Afghan military after U.S. forces left. The weapons were taken from the Sultan Khil military base in a province near Kabul and included 900 guns, 30 light tactical vehicles and 20 army pickup trucks. Reports indicate that some Afghan military posts have surrendered to advancing Taliban forces without putting up a fight.

Republicans have hammered Biden for leaving Afghanistan prematurely.

""It is not in America's interest for the Taliban to take over Afghanistan. If the Taliban takes over part of Afghanistan, I fear that al Qaeda and ISIS will reemerge, and we will be paving a way for another 9/11,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters Tuesday.

Last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized Biden's plans for withdrawal as ""reckless"" and ""hasty,"" warning that ""the threats we face from terrorism and tyranny have not been defeated.""

But Biden said 20 years of experience fighting in Afghanistan has demonstrated that continued U.S. military presence there for another year or even for six more months is unlikely to improve the situation.

""How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?"" Biden asked, addressing his critics. ""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.""

As the United States completes its military withdrawal, Biden committed to evacuating thousands of Afghan translators and their families who assisted the U.S., promising to expedite their emigration to the United States. He also said the U.S. will continue to provide humanitarian support for Afghanistan, including defending the rights of women and girls.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-war-in-afghanistan-end-august-31,2021-07-08
Reports: Biden to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11,"Multiple reports indicate that President Joe Biden will order all American troops to withdraw from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attack that destroyed the Twin Towers in New York City and instigated the War on Terror.

The timeline for Biden's withdrawal will break the May 1 deadline set by the Trump administration in an agreement with the Taliban by several months. U.S. officials have previously reported there are about 2,500 troops stationed in Afghanistan, though the New York Times reported last month about 1,000 more special operations forces were also stationed in the country.

All U.S. troops will reportedly leave the country by Sept. 11, ending U.S. involvement in a nearly 20-year war that's cost the lives of more than 2,000 U.S. soldiers and 100,000 Afghan civilians and added trillions of dollars to the national debt.

The Washington Post was the first to report Biden's impending announcement, which is expected Wednesday.

""This is the immediate, practical reality that our policy review discovered,"" an anonymous source who spoke to the Post said. ""If we break the May 1st deadline negotiated by the previous administration with no clear plan to exit, we will be back at war with the Taliban, and that was not something President Biden believed was in the national interest,"" the source said.

Biden administration officials spoke to the press anonymously because the plans to announce U.S. troop withdrawal are not yet public.

""We're going to zero troops by September,"" the source emphasized.

Last month, President Biden said it would be difficult to meet Trump's May 1 deadline to withdraw, though he signaled his willingness to end the war.

""We are not staying for a long time. We will leave,"" Biden said. ""The question is when we leave."" He explained it would be tough to meet the deadline for ""tactical reasons.""

CNN reported that Secretary of State Tony Blinken communicated with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday to inform him that the president will be calling later this week to announce the U.S. withdrawal. The Biden administration is reportedly making contact with several U.S. allies in the region to coordinate a strategy to withdraw.

U.S. commanders have previously expressed opposition to withdrawing, warning that without a peace deal negotiated between the Taliban and the Afghani government, the Taliban could retake key cities, including the capital, Kabul, should American forces leave the Afghanistan Army to fight alone.

Last week, CNN reported that the Taliban attacked a heavily guarded U.S. base in March. The terrorist group has vowed to renew attacks on U.S. forces and NATO troops should they fail to withdraw from the country by May 1.

A U.S. intelligence report released at the end of March said that should the U.S. withdraw, it is likely the Taliban could take over Afghanistan within two to three years and potentially bring al Qaeda back to power in the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-withdraw-troops-afghanistan-sept-11,2021-04-13
"Bill Gates admits COVID is 'kind of like flu,' vaccines are 'imperfect in two very important ways,' applauds Australia's quarantine camps, and says Americans aren't great at making sacrifices","Bill Gates – the software developer – has been making the media rounds the past two weeks to promote his new book about preventing a new pandemic. In interviews this week, Gates delivered his opinions on a myriad of COVID-related topics – including the coronavirus lab-leak theory, individual liberties during a pandemic, Australia's quarantine camps, issues with COVID-19 vaccines, and the possibility of climate change causing disease outbreaks.

On Tuesday, Gates was interviewed by CNN host and Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria at an event organized by 92nd Street Y – a self-described ""cultural and community center where people all over the world connect through culture, arts, entertainment, and conversation.""

Gates proclaimed, ""The vaccines are imperfect and in two very important ways.""

""One is they don't block infection,"" he said. ""We were hoping that the vaccine would create enough antibodies in your upper respiratory tract, including your nose and throat, that vaccinated people wouldn't get infected.""

""Well, once Omicron comes along, the vaccine is not reducing transmission, hardly at all, particularly about three or four months after you take the vaccine,"" Gates noted.

""The other thing is duration,"" he added. ""You know, we're seeing through a variety of the data, Israel data, U.K. data, that particularly if you're in your 70s, within four or five months of taking the vaccine, that protection really is going down. Weirdly for young people, that protection does not seem to go down and we've seen this with previous vaccines.""

""The mRNA vaccines are a miracle, but they weren't perfect,"" he said. ""And so next time, people will have much better vaccines and, and better therapeutics as well.""

Gates stated, ""We're going to create some new flu vaccines that that are much better.""

Gates noted that early in the pandemic, ""We didn't really understand the fatality rate, you know, we didn't understand that it's a fairly low fatality rate and that it's a disease mainly the elderly, kind of like flu is, although a bit different than that.""

""So that was pretty scary period, where the world didn't go on alert, including the United States, nearly as fast as it needed to,"" Gates told Zakaria.

Zakaria asked Gates, ""Should we accept some restrictions on our liberties?""

Gates responded, ""Absolutely. But you know, the U.S., that's not our greatest strength – that is making, in some cases, sacrifice for the collective.""

He opined that the U.S. made ""incredible sacrifice for the collective goal"" during World War II, but Gates believes Americans haven't been willing to make sacrifices since the 9/11 terror attacks.

""We're a society of individual rights, and there's a lot to be said for that,"" he added. ""So we're not optimized for pandemics.""

Speaking of civil liberties, Gates praised Australia's draconian COVID-19 response – which included quarantine camps.

Gates said there ""weren't many countries"" that handled that COVID-19 pandemic well during a Tuesday interview on PBS' ""Amanpour and Company.""



""But a few responded very quickly to scale up the level of diagnostics, and then they had quarantine policies that were well adhered to,"" Gates stated. ""So Australia stands out, and their death rate is about 10% of other rich countries. So pretty dramatic benefit.""

Last week, Gates sounded the alarm about the possibility of a new, more deadly COVID-19 variant and called for the formation of a global disease outbreak task force that would be controlled by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Gates expounded on the dangers of a new variant in the interview with Zakaria.

""There could be more variants come that would be immune-escaping because their shape of their spike protein would be a little different,"" he claimed. ""And sadly, they could even have a higher fatality rate. You know, I read the chance of that is, you know, maybe 5% to 10%.""

Gates advised people they ""need to keep boosting."" He said ""the public should be ready"" for mask mandates to be reinstated and ""not view it as a deep infringement.""

Zakaria asked Gates about the warning he made at the 2017 Munich Security Conference in Germany about a ""fast-moving airborne pathogen"" that ""could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year,"" which he said could happen in 10-15 years.



""I was willing to take risk and go out on a limb, because you know, the modern world is just so susceptible to this human-to-human transmissible respiratory virus,"" Gates said in the nearly hour-long interview.

""You know, we're invading more area, you know, we're getting into, you know, where bats are having, getting squeezed,"" he continued. ""HIV came through chimpanzees, Ebola came from bats.""

Gates also highlighted his prediction that the world was ""not ready for the next epidemic"" – which he declared during a 2015 TED Talk.

Gates claimed that climate change increases the risks of a pandemic.

""In these changing ecosystems, have animals seeking new areas to live in, because it gets too hot in the areas they're in, and so they tend to head away from the equator,"" Gates suggested. ""And so as they go into those new habitats, they run into farms.""

Gates asserted that there are ""too many humans"" for all those other animals because humans are ""hogging the habitat.""

The Microsoft founder warned that ""bushmeat markets"" and ""wet markets"" are possible disease outbreak origins because humans are ""working in such close proximity"" to pigs. He added, ""Flu almost always comes out of China because that's where the pigs are.""

During a Tuesday appearance on ""The Daily Show,"" Gates claimed that climate change would cause more diseases and dismissed the COVID-19 origin possibility of a lab leak.

""Where we should be careful about lab safety,"" Gates said. ""It's quite clear in this case that it came across through animals.""

""Almost all our diseases like HIV crossed over from chimpanzees and Africa. Quite some time ago, Ebola came from bats. This also, with one step in between, came from bats. So it's going to keep happening, particularly with climate change, where we're invading a lot of habitats.""

Bill Maher says Christianity to blame for US Capitol riot — just weeks after defending Trump supporters,"HBO's Bill Maher said recently that Christianity was to blame for the riots and violence that took place in January at the U.S. Capitol.

What are the details?

During Friday's episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" the namesake host, now 65, said that a belief in Christianity is comparable to a belief in conspiracies like QAnon, and helped spur on the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

""As long as we're going to go to the trouble of another impeachment trial,"" he said, ""we might as well be honest about what it's really about: The events of Jan. 6 were a faith-based initiative.""

Maher said that Trump supporters who belong to a ""Christian nationalist movement"" are firm in their beliefs that God ""literally sent [Trump] from heaven to save them,"" and pointed to remarks made by Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who once said that God personally chose Trump for president of the United States of America.

""There's a lot of talk now in liberal corners about how Republicans should tell their base who still believe the election was rigged that they need to grow up and move on and stop asking the rest of us to respect their mass delusion,"" Maher continued. ""And, of course, it is a mass delusion. But the inconvenient truth here is that, if you accord religious faith the kind of exalted respect we do here in America, you've already lost the argument that mass delusion is bad.""

The longtime political commentator then went on to make a direct comparison between Christianity and QAnon.

""It's fun to laugh at QAnon, with the baby-eating lizard people and the pedophile pizza parlors,"" he added, ""but have you ever read the book of [Revelation]? That's the Bible. That's your holy book, Christians. And they've got seven-headed dragons and locusts that have the face of men and teeth of lions and other stuff you see after the guy in the park sells you bad mushrooms.""

He also explained that ""magical religious thinking"" — such as faith in Jesus' resurrection — is not dissimilar to a ""current mutation"" of the QAnon ""virus.""

""All the armies of the world will gather and Jesus will come down on a flying horse, shooting swords out of his mouth,"" Maher added, ""and have a thousand-year cosmic-boss battle with Satan, the Beast, and the antichrist. ... It's like 10 'Avenger' movies plus 10 'Hobbit' movies plus a night out with Johnny Depp.""

""Please, magical religious thinking is a virus and QAnon is just its current mutation,"" he insisted. ""That's why megachurches play QAnon videos. It's the same basic plot. 'Q' is the prophet and Trump is the messiah. There's an apocalyptic event looming, 'The Storm.' There's a titanic struggle of good versus evil, and if you want good to win, just keep those checks coming in.

""We need to stop pretending there's no way we'll understand why the Trump mob believes in him. It's because they're religious! They've already made space in their heads for s**t that doesn't make sense,"" Maher railed. ""When you're a QAnon fanatic, you're also a fundamentalist Christian. They just go together like macaroni and cheese.""

What else?



It seems fair to point out that Maher just a few weeks ago defended Trump supporters and said that they shouldn't be judged by the 5,000 people who rioted.

""Let's not confuse 5,000 people with 74 million,"" Maher said of the rioters versus Trump supporters at large. ""Yes, even supporting the insurrection in spirit is, well, deplorable. But there's a difference between holding illiberal beliefs and acting violently on them. At least that's what they always told me about Islamic terrorism.""

He continued, ""I keep wrestling on this show with the hard question of how do Americans, all of us, learn to share a country with a**holes you can't stand. I preach, and still do, you can hate Trump, but not all the people who like him. And as counterintuitive as it may seem, you can like something run by a**holes without being one yourself.""

"Bill Maher tells his audience not to hate 74 million Trump voters because 5,000 people rioted","Comedian Bill Maher, often a voice of reason for those on the liberal left, told his audience on Friday's episode of his HBO show ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" not to hate the 74 million people who voted for President Donald Trump because about 5,000 people claiming to support the president stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.

In his profane monologue, transcribed by Ian Schwartz for Real Clear Politics, the liberal Biden-supporting Maher discussed the ""tragedy"" of Trump voters and what he thinks are the underlying causes of people turning to violence when the system fails them.

""Let's not confuse 5,000 people with 74 million,"" Maher said. ""Yes, even supporting the insurrection in spirit is, well, deplorable. But there's a difference between holding illiberal beliefs and acting violently on them. At least that's what they always told me about Islamic terrorism.

""I keep wrestling on this show with the hard question of how do Americans, all of us, learn to share a country with a**holes you can't stand,"" he continued. ""I preach, and still do, you can hate Trump, but not all the people who like him. And as counterintuitive as it may seem, you can like something run by a**holes without being one yourself.""



Maher told the story of 14-year Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, a woman who was fatally shot by Capitol Police after participating in the riot. Babbitt, a former Obama-Biden voter, was a strong Trump supporter who owned a business in San Diego, California. She faced economic hardship after being forced to take out a short-term loan with a 169% interest rate to keep her business open. Maher showed sympathy for Babbitt, who he believes was justifiably angry, but at the wrong people.

""She is the tragedy of the modern Republican voter personified: Pissed off at the greed and corruption that yes, has squeezed the middle class hard, but always coming up with the wrong answer to who is doing most of the squeezing,"" Maher said.

Addressing the Capitol rioters, Maher said they were ""storming the wrong building.""

""The feet up shouldn't have been on Pelosi's desk, it should have been on Trump's tanning bed,"" he added. ""You thought Trump was going to be your bull in the china shop? Yeah, he was, but you were the china.



""Should Ashli Babbitt have applied better logic in seeing that her real problem in life wasn't pedophile Democrats or Antifa and that people like Elizabeth Warren were actually the ones who were at least trying to do something about predatory lending and economic exploitation? Yes. But not everyone can watch MSNBC all day. She had other priorities, like fighting overseas,"" Maher continued.



Then he took a swipe at California Democrats, criticizing woke politics and characterizing his state as overwhelmed by regulations and indifferent to the hardships of working people.

""Maybe, since all politics is local, all she knew was she lives in a state that cares more about her toxic whiteness than her toxic brokeness,"" Maher said. ""And that the state that is run entirely by Democrats. Yeah. They didn't stop anyone from charging her 169% interest on a loan either.

""It shouldn't be that surprising that America is full of fed-up unhappy people who just want to break s**t,"" he continued. ""Trump sure didn't drain any swamps but when it comes to graft and corruption and everybody wetting his beak, California, yeah, that's a swamp too. We can't put up a housing unit for the homeless for less than $500,000 or build a rail line connecting the state for less than $200 million a mile.""

Bill would label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism,"GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have introduced a bill to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Currently, the only nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism include Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea.

Graham called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a terrorist,"" according to a press release.

""Putin has crossed every line of civilized norms during the war in Ukraine and years before,"" Graham said, according to the release. ""He has engaged in state-sponsored assassinations, the Wagner group supported by Russia terrorizes the world, and the war crimes being committed in Ukraine on a daily basis shock the conscious,"" he said, according to the press release. ""If Putin's regime is not a State Sponsor of Terrorism after all this, then the designation is meaningless. We believe that it is long past due to designate Putin's Russia as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and suffer the consequences thereof because he is a terrorist. Ukrainians have been asking for this designation, and we are listening. This will be a game changer in how we deal with terrorists worldwide.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have been advocating for Russia to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.

But according to Reuters, President Joe Biden answered, ""No,"" earlier this month when he was asked whether Russia should be named a state sponsor of terrorism.

""What has been revealed in Ukraine's success on the battlefield is not only its military prowess and Russia's weakness, but also Putin’s reliance on brutal atrocities, genocide, and war crimes against the people of Ukraine. Russia has more than earned the right to be among the club of pariah nations,"" Blumenthal said, according to the press release.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-russia-state-sponsor-terrorismbill-russia-state-sponsor-terrorism,2022-09-15
"'As a woman, I think porn is a disgrace': Billie Eilish says she began watching porn as an 11-year-old and it traumatized her","Billie Eilish revealed that she started watching pornography as an 11-year-old and said that it ""destroyed"" her mind about what sex is supposed to be.

The alternative rock music star made the comments in an interview with Howard Stern.

“As a woman, I think porn is a disgrace, and I used to watch a lot of porn, to be honest,"" Eilish said.

""I started watching porn when I was like eleven,"" she added. ""I didn't understand why it was a bad thing, I thought that's how you learned how to have sex.""

Eilish explained that pornography misrepresented what sex is like and it led to her having unhealthy sexual behavior.

“I think it really destroyed my brain and I feel incredibly devastated that I was exposed to so much porn, I think that I had sleep paralysis, and these almost like night terrors, just nightmares, I think that's how they started, because I would just watch abusive [pornography] and that's what I thought was attractive, and it got to a point where I couldn't watch anything unless it was violent, and I didn't think it was attractive,"" said Eilish.

""And I was a virgin, I hadn't done anything!"" she added.

“The first few times I, you know, had sex, I was not saying no to things that were not good. And it was because I thought that’s what I was supposed to be attracted to,” Eilish said. “I’m so angry that porn is so loved, and I’m so angry at myself for thinking that it was okay.”



Eilish went on to explain that even the anatomy portrayed in pornography was misleading.

""Women’s bodies don’t look like that,"" she said. ""We don't enjoy things that it looks like we're enjoying.""

She also revealed in the interview that she had contracted the coronavirus but that she believes being vaccinated kept her from experiencing the worst symptoms of the virus.

Black officer to resign after fatally shooting three minorities in five years. Black Lives Matter mob allegedly shot at officer during August protest.,"A black officer from the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, Police Department is resigning after fatally shooting three people — all of them minorities — in five years.

The resignation of Joseph Mensah, who's been suspended since July in the wake of his third fatal shooting, is effective Nov. 30, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

What's the background?

The Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office ruled all three fatal shootings justified self-defense, including the most recent shooting in February, the paper said.

But Mensah remained suspended after the family of Jay Anderson Jr. — whom Mensah fatally shot in a Wauwatosa park in 2016 — filed a complaint, the Journal Sentinel added.

The paper reported in a previous story that two of the fatally shot individuals were black and the third person shot and killed was Latino/Native American.

Retaliation?

In August, Mensah said protesters chanted ""black lives matter"" while shooting at him and punching him at his girlfriend's home.

Mensah posted on Facebook that protesters ""tried to kill me. I was unarmed and tried to defend my property and the property of my girlfriend. We were both assaulted, punched, and ultimately shot at several times. A shotgun round missed me by inches. Not once did I ever swing back or reciprocate any the hate that was being directed at me. I am all for peaceful protests, even against me, but this was anything but peaceful. They threw toilet paper in her trees, broke her windows, and again, shot at both of us as they were trying to kill me. There are children that live there any the knew that. The irony in all of this is that they chanted Black Lives Matter the entire time, but had zero regard for any of the black children that live there or me, a black man.""

Wauwatosa police said between 50 and 60 people gathered at the home to protest Mensah on the night of Aug. 8, where he was physically assaulted and a single shotgun round was fired into the home, the Journal Sentinel noted in another story.



Police added that protesters began to vandalize the home around 8 p.m. and that while Mensah ""attempted to establish a dialog,"" he ""was ultimately physically assaulted,"" the Journal Sentinel said, citing a police department release.

As Mensah went inside, ""armed protesters approached the rear door and a single shotgun round was discharged by a member of the group into Officer Mensah's backdoor,"" the paper added, citing the release.

Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called the incident ""domestic terrorism"" and said officials ""must take action"":

Three people have since been charged in that incident, the paper said.

Mensah also told WISN-AM that roughly 100 protesters came to his home on the night of July 27, the Journal Sentinel reported in a separate story.

""To call me a murderer, without any conviction, without any charges, and then to do something like this, again, I'm angry, I'm frustrated, I'm confused,"" he said during the interview, the paper reported.

Mensah added that ""it'd be one thing if there was any kind of cause, whatsoever, for my actions. But I defended myself, several times. Proven that I defended myself several times,"" the Journal Sentinel said.

He also said he believes he was suspended to appease protesters, WITI-TV reported.

""They knew all about this in 2016,"" Mensah said, according to the station. ""They didn't have an issue with it in 2017. They didn't have an issue with it back in 2018. They didn't have an issue in 2019. Now, it's 2020. Let's just suspend him for no reason.""

A GoFundMe for Mensah's legal fees set up in mid-July raised over $78,000.

What's been happening lately?

Before Mensah's resignation was announced Tuesday, a hearing before the police and fire commission was scheduled for Dec. 16 in which Mensah would have had the opportunity to regain his job, the Journal Sentinel said.

More from the paper:

The commission was the only panel that could fire Mensah. But others have weighed in throughout the year.



On the same day that Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm cleared Mensah of any criminal wrongdoing in his third fatal shooting, an independent investigator hired by the commission recommended that Mensah be fired.



Steven Biskupic wrote in his report released Oct. 7 that the potential for a fourth fatal shooting by Mensah ""creates an extraordinary, unwarranted and unnecessary risk to the Wauwatosa Police Department and the City of Wauwatosa.""



He said there was ""just cause"" for Mensah to be fired since he made ""inconsistent and misleading"" public statements about the shootings, which violated a department policy and which could compromise his ability to testify in court.



Three months earlier, the common council passed a resolution calling for the removal of Mensah. The next day, the police and fire commission suspended him.



Mensah later filed a lawsuit in Milwaukee County, contesting there wasn't ""just cause"" for his suspension. Mensah's attorney, Jonathan Cermele, said in advance of the December hearing that Mensah would have been ""completely capable"" of performing his duties as an officer and that suspending him violates his due process because ""one simply cannot be disciplined for an act that has yet to occur.""

The city is asking the commission to meet as soon as possible to dismiss the charges pending against Mensah, the Journal Sentinel added.

""Now is the time for all of us to come together and heal,"" Wauwatosa Mayor Dennis McBride said, according to the paper.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-cop-resigns-shot-three-minorities-in-five-years-black-lives-matter-mob-allegedly-shot-at-officer-during-august-protest,2020-11-18
BLM co-founder blames racism and sexism after bombshell report exposes the group 'secretly bought a $6 million house',"Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors claimed new allegations involving the purchase of a nearly $6 million mansion are rooted in racism and sexism.

What is the background?

New York magazine reported this week that BLM ""secretly bought a $6 million house"" in southern California in October 2020 using funds donated to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.

According to the report, BLM leadership hoped to keep the luxury property's existence a secret.

In fact, documents reviewed by New York magazine suggested the ""property’s purchase and day-to-day operation suggest that it has been handled in ways that blur, or cross, boundaries between the charity and private companies owned by some of its leaders.""

Black Lives Matter revealed last year that it received more than $90 million in 2020.

How did Cullors respond?

In an Instagram post, Cullors claimed on Wednesday that ""what’s happening to me and to our movement is both racist and sexist.""

""This is bigger than me. It's about a long history of attacking black people and black women specifically, creating unsafe conditions for us and our families, scrutinizing our every move publicly and privately in ways that are unfair and unjust,"" she claimed. ""It's dangerous, and we should all be trying to stop it, interrupt it, protest it.""

In a lengthy statement, Cullors called the New York magazine story a ""despicable abuse of a platform that’s intended to provide truthful information to the public.""

Cullors claimed the reporter behind the story — Sean Campbell, who is black — has a ""very public bias"" against her and other ""black leaders."" She said the story is filled with ""misinformation"" and ""innuendo and incendiary opinions."" However, Cullors failed to provide concrete evidence confirming her claims.

For instance, Cullors said the home was purchased to be a space where BLM activists ""could work, create content, host meetings and foster creativity.""

However, Campbell noted in his story that after he contacted BLM last month for comment on his forthcoming story, leaders began discussing internally how to frame the purchase of the home. They discussed explaining its purpose as an ""influencer house"" or as a ""safehouse.""

The day after a BLMGNF board member responded to Campbell, the organization released a statement framing the house as a place ""for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship."" But, as Campbell observed, the a BLMGNF board member did not explain ""why, if the house was primarily intended to be a creative space, relatively little content has been produced there over the course of 17 months.""

Meanwhile, Cullors denied having ""misappropriated funds"" and repeatedly emphasized that she left BLMGNF last year. She claimed the truth about BLMGNF ""will soon be made clear"" upon the release of financial disclosure documents required of tax-exempt organizations. The organization has not disclosed finances pertaining to 2020 or 2021.

Finally calling the New York magazine story ""hateful and erroneous content,"" Cullors claimed that she is ""living under the constant threat of white supremacist terror and real threats on my life and those of people I love.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-co-founder-blames-racism-and-sexism-after-bombshell-report-exposes-the-group-secretly-bought-a-6-million-house,2022-04-07
Black Lives Matter co-founder — a 'trained Marxist' who reportedly purchased four homes for $3.2M — says her money is for her 'family members',"Amid scrutiny and controversy over the co-founder of Black Lives Matter reportedly having purchased four homes for $3.2 million — including a $1.4 million property in overwhelmingly white Topanga Canyon, California — ""trained Marxist"" Patrisse Khan-Cullors said in an interview that she's investing her money in her ""family members.""

What are the details?

Commentator and activist Marc Lamont Hill interviewed Khan-Cullors for ""Black News Tonight"" and asked about the problematic optics, specifically from the perspective of ""the left.""

""If you are a trained Marxist, if we're talking about a certain kind of radical politic, that extravagant homes of any sort, or multiple properties of any sort, is itself contradictory to the ideology that you hold,"" Hill said. ""And so it's not about having money per se ... or about property per se, but it's about being a potential contradiction between your expressed politics and your lived practice.""

Khan-Cullors called such a critique ""wanting"" and asserted that ""the way that I live my life is a direct support of black people, including my black family members, first and foremost.""

She added that many black people who can ""invest"" choose to do so with their families, ""and that's what I have chosen to do. I have a child, I have a brother that has severe mental illness that I take care of, I support my mother, and I support many other family members of mine. And so I see my money as not my own; I see it as my family's money as well.""

Activist Patrisse Cullors Talks Criticisms Surrounding Black Lives Matter Network Foundation: Pt. 1 youtu.be

She also noted in the interview the homes she's purchased are specifically for family members.

Khan-Cullors also dismissed accusations that she's taken money from BLM for such purchases, and the BNC News video description indicated she said ""her money comes from other various sources but believes that activists should get paid a living wage for their work."" Yet the Marxist also asserted that capitalism is harmful to the black community.

Black Lives Matter — which raked in more than $90 million in 2020 alone — has come to Khan-Cullors' defense, saying earlier this week that recent criticism of her is a ""right-wing offensive"" that ""continues a tradition of terror by white supremacists."" BLM added that she's a ""volunteer"" and does not take a salary, having earned only $120,000 through her work there ""for duties such as serving as spokesperson and engaging in political education work.""



How did folks react to the interview?

Some Twitter observers responding to the segment during which Khan-Cullors said her money is for her family members weren't terribly sympathetic.

""I gotta hand it to Patrisse Cullors, 'my aim is to help Black people, and I am Black, so I decided the person I'd focus on helping is myself' is an impressive defense of being a Marxist while getting rich off of BLM,"" Noam Blum of Tablet declared.

Others echoed the sentiment:

""It's important to invest in the black community...buys house in majority white neighborhood, OK Patrisse,"" one user quipped.

I have to admire the honesty at least,"" one commenter noted. ""I think it speaks to how much control this organization has over it's pawns that they aren't afraid in the slightest to say things like that.""

""Marxists are just temporary under the radar elitists,"" another user said. ""Seriously. They're all obsessed with power because they resent not having it all. It's really that simple.""

""The irony is that self-interest is exactly in-line with Marxist reality,"" another commenter observed.

Anything else?

On the heels of the Khan-Cullors controversy, Hawk Newsome — leader of Black Lives Matter Greater New York City — said there should be an ""independent investigation"" into Black Lives Matter and its finances.



And conservative black journalist Jason Whitlock said he was suspended from Twitter after criticizing Khan-Cullors and her most recent real estate purchase.

""Black Lives Matter founder buys $1.4 million home in Topanga, which has a black population of 1.4 percent,"" Whitlock tweeted last Friday. ""She's with her people!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-cofounder-marxist-homes-money-for-family,2021-04-16
Black Lives Matter says criticism of co-founder who bought four houses is 'terror by white supremacists',"Black Lives Matter claimed Tuesday that criticism of co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors is a product of a ""right-wing offensive"" that ""continues a tradition of terror by white supremacists.""

What is the background?

Khan-Cullors found herself at the center of controversy last week when her latest real estate purchase — a $1.4 million home in Topanga Canyon, California — circulated through the media.

The New York Post then revealed that, actually, Khan-Cullors has purchased four homes in the U.S. over the past five years, three in California and one in Georgia. According to the Post, Khan-Cullors even considered buying property in an exclusive area of the Bahamas where Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake reportedly own property.

The news triggered renewed scrutiny about the finances of Black Lives Matter, which raked in more than $90 million in 2020 alone.

What did BLM say?

The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation said in a statement that Khan-Cullors is a ""volunteer"" and does not take a salary from her role with the organization, having earned only $120,000 through her work there ""for duties such as serving as spokesperson and engaging in political education work.""

""Patrisse did not receive any compensation after 2019,"" the statement read.

Further, the statement said BLM has not used organizational resources for the purpose of purchasing personal property.

The statement went on to dismiss criticisms against Khan-Cullors as racist terrorism meant to silence her.

Patrisse's work for Black people over the years has made her and others who align with the fight for Black liberation targets of racist violence. The narratives being spread about Patrisse have been generated by right-wing forces intent on reducing the support and influence of a movement that is larger than any one organization. This right-wing offensive not only puts Patrisse, her child and her loved ones in harm's way, it also continues a tradition of terror by white supremacists against Black activists. All Black activists know the fear these malicious and serious actions are meant to instill: the fear of being silenced, the trauma of being targeted, the torture of feeling one's family is exposed to danger just for speaking out against unjust systems. We have seen this tactic of terror time and again, but our movement will not be silenced.

But what do critics say?

Most notably, prominent critics who spoke out against Khan-Cullors over the weekend are not white.

For example, Hawk Newsome, leader of Black Lives Matter Greater New York City, said there should be an ""independent investigation"" into Black Lives Matter and its finances.

""If you go around calling yourself a socialist, you have to ask how much of her own personal money is going to charitable causes,"" Newsome told the New York Post. ""It's really sad because it makes people doubt the validity of the movement and overlook the fact that it's the people that carry this movement.""

""We need black firms and black accountants to go in there and find out where the money is going,"" he added.

Meanwhile, black journalist Jason Whitlock was allegedly suspended from Twitter after criticizing Khan-Cullors and her most recent real estate purchase.

""Black Lives Matter founder buys $1.4 million home in Topanga, which has a black population of 1.4 percent,"" Whitlock tweeted mockingly last Friday. ""She's with her people!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-criticism-of-co-founder-terror-by-white-supremacists,2021-04-14
Black Lives Matter group invades 'Candy Cane Lane' — streets decorated with Christmas lights to benefit children with cancer — with protest march,"A Black Lives Matter group invaded ""Candy Cane Lane"" on Friday night — a residential neighborhood in West Allis, Wisconsin, decorated with Christmas lights to benefit children with cancer — marching and chanting and shouting through bullhorns at vehicles lined up in the streets to see the displays.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

What is Candy Cane Lane?



Here's a brief history of Candy Cane Lane from its website:

In December,1984, a wonderful group of neighbors living in West Allis, Wisconsin, joined together to collect donations for the MACC Fund — Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer, Inc., in honor of a neighbor's child diagnosed with cancer. The neighbors worked in concert in decorating their homes and encouraged visitors to make a small donation as they drove through the festively enhanced neighborhood. All of the money raised went to supporting research, treatment, and the eventual discovery of a cure for childhood cancers and related blood diseases.

What happened Friday night?

Several videos showed the protesting group — the People's Revolution — marching through the brightly lit streets chanting ""Black lives matter!"" ""No justice! No peace!"" and ""Whose lane? Our lane! Whose streets? Our streets!"" The People's Revolution has protested for months in Wauwatosa, as member of the group is accused of firing a gun at former police officer Joseph Mensah, Wisconsin Right Now reported.

The outlet said the Milwaukee County Crime, Fire, and Police News page on Facebook contained comments about the protest. ""Yes, they came through. Did not obey any traffic rules,"" one woman wrote, Wisconsin Right Now noted.

One man added, ""My significant other lives on Candy Cane Lane, and she just texted me – BLM just crashed Candy Cane Lane! …they were blasting music so loud that it made her windows and walls shake and scared the crap out of her dogs,"" the outlet said, adding that the man also had an issue with the group disrupting a charity: ""If you don't have a problem with this, then not only are you part of the problem, you are also a Class A Asshole!!!!""

Here's a video of the march:



TPR- Day 204- MERRY CHRISTMAS CANDY CANE LN #neverstopvoices #independentmedia youtu.be

Wisconsin Right Now also said a man shared a post from a friend:

So my son and I were playing in the living room, and we heard very loud music and people chanting from the outside. We open up the front door to see what all the commotion was about. It was a ""Black Lives Matter"" march going up and down my block and through Candy Cane Lane. These people saw my ""Back the Badge"" sign and ""Trump 2020"" sign and began to shout at us. They began to give us the middle finger and shouted, ""F*** YOU F*** THE POLICE F*** TRUMP!"" Uhm really? I am holding my ONE year old son in my arms. Glad to see how ""peaceful"" and ""respectful"" these people and protests really are lol. What a bunch of pieces of s**t.

Available videos so far don't depict such a confrontation — but the latter YouTube video does show a woman apparently confronting the group in the street:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Mariah Smith shared a livestream of the march during which she acknowledged that several non-participants were ""mad as hell"" at the group. Prior to the march she asked her comrades, ""Ready to make some f***in' noise, man?""



What did police have to say?

""Last evening, starting at about 6:40 pm, we received a handful of calls of a protest group moving through Candy Cane Lane. The callers indicated that the group was causing traffic congestion and noise disturbances. West Allis officers responded to the area and monitored the situation. There was heavy traffic congestion related to Candy Cane Lane. There were reports of protestors walking in the roadway and using a bullhorn. Officers did not observe any violence or vandalism. No arrests were made and no citations were issued,"" police told Wisconsin Right Now.

What did supporters of the protest have to say?

Never Stop Media LLC defended the People's Revolution group: ""The group planned the march through Candy Cane Ln with the intent to bring awareness to the neighborhood and stand up for [people of color] who live in the area. Marchers were seen dressed in holiday spirit and of course Santa made a special appearance for the occasion.""

In addition, Never Stop Media noted:

In our video it clearly shows demonstrators walking down the center of the streets to not impede any of the vehicles. None of these vehicles were surrounded, stranded or harassed. Posts claiming that TPR harassed people who did not approve of the protest are also not true. You can see in our video posted that when met with distain, protestors wished those people a Merry Christmas & Happy Holiday with of course the chant that ""Black Lives Matter"" as they continued to march. Posts also claim that TPR was terrorizing children who were looking at the holiday decorations. In the video posted by us it clearly shows families, both black and white with children showing full support for the group with parents and children yelling black lives matter. When demonstrators approached organizers (also standing in the streets) who were collecting donations they were asked to go around because they were trying to collect money. Members of TPR formed a wall as the rest of the group walked past so that organizers could collect their donations without interruption. This can also be seen in our video. At no time were donations interrupted for the MAAC Fund.

Official Black Lives Matter organization turns on Joe Biden: 'Communities being terrorized at a greater rate than under Trump',"President Joe Biden didn't even make it to 100 days in office before Black Lives Matter turned on him. The official Black Lives Matter organization said this week that communities are being ""terrorized"" more under Biden than under former President Donald Trump.

The Black Lives Matters Global Network Foundation has had no lovefest for Trump, disparaging him as the ""racist in the White House"" and a ""fascist,"" who implemented ""proto-fascism"" during his term as the ""white supremacist-in-chief."" Despite all of the vitriolic scorn that the Black Lives Matter organization has launched at former President Trump, BLM recently went on the attack of Biden, and said he is ""sending more military equipment to our neighborhoods than Trump did.""

Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, which one of its founders proclaimed last June that ""our goal is to get Trump out,"" had tough words for President Biden on Wednesday.

""Biden's first 100 days are up in 10 days. By then we need him to #End1033, which transfers military equipment into the hands of police across the country – including school & campus police,"" the official Black Lives Matter Twitter account wrote. ""Another example? The military you see out on your streets ahead of the Chauvin verdict.""

""Biden is currently sending more military equipment to our neighborhoods than Trump did,"" the BLM page declared. ""You read that right. Our communities are being terrorized at a greater rate than they had been under Trump.""

The organization headed by self-proclaimed ""trained Marxists"" asked its 1 million Twitter followers to sign a petition demanding ""Biden demilitarize our neighborhoods and #End1033,"" a program that began in 1997 under the National Defense Authorization Act. The 1033 program ""granted permanent authority to the Secretary of Defense to transfer defense material to federal and state agencies for use in law enforcement, particularly those associated with counter-drug and counter-terrorism activities.""

A post on the official Black Lives Matter website elaborated on the organization's stance on the militarized police, ""The Law Enforcement Support Office, known as the 1033 Program, allows the transfer of surplus military-grade equipment to local law enforcement agencies across the country. It includes school and campus police, too.""



""Over $7 billion has gone to the law enforcement agencies since its creation under the Clinton administration,"" BLM declared. ""Disappointingly enough, the flow of military equipment to police under the 1033 Program has accelerated under the Biden administration — and based on recent reporting, police might just receive even more military equipment under the Biden administration than they did with the Trump administration.""

Black Lives Matter then referred to the police as ""violent upholders of white supremacy.""

""Let's make things abundantly clear: Military-style weapons and equipment have no place in our streets,"" the post on the official BLM website stated. ""They have no place in our communities and have no place in our schools or on our campuses. They especially have no place in the hands of police — violent upholders of white supremacy that have no regard for Black life.""



""With the stroke of a pen, President Biden can put an end to the dangerous practice of enabling and upholding white supremacy through the 1033 Program,"" Black Lives Matter said in another reference to the police being racist.

Days after the 2020 presidential election, the Black Lives Matter Foundation congratulated Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

However, only a month later, the organization soured on the Biden-Harris administration for holding a meeting that included several civil rights groups, but did invite Black Lives Matter.

""Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Rep. Cedric Richmond met with several civil rights groups yesterday. @blklivesmatter — as the largest social justice movement in history — was not invited,"" Black Lives Matter tweeted.



The group asserted that it deserves a ""seat at the table,"" then demanded that Biden and Harris meet with them.



""The night of their victory, we sent @joebiden and @kamalaharris a letter requesting a meeting. It has now been 32 days and we have yet to receive a response,"" BLM stated. ""To set up a meeting with civil rights leaders, without BLM, is unacceptable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-turns-on-biden-communities-terrorized,2021-04-22
"Despite border crisis, DHS chief sets sights on combatting domestic extremism","There may be a raging humanitarian crisis at the southern United States border, but Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas wants you to know his department is taking serious claims of ""domestic violent extremism.""

What are the details?

Despite facing the largest influx of migrants in two decades that is overwhelming and quickly depleting American immigration resources, Mayorkas made it clear Monday that his department is serious about combatting domestic threats.

In a statement, Mayorkas cited the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol.

""Recent events, including the January 6th attacks on the U.S. Capitol, have highlighted that domestic violent extremism poses the most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat to our country today,"" Mayorkas said.

""Addressing this threat is an urgent priority of the Biden-Harris Administration and of this Department,"" he continued. ""We will continue to work with our partners to immediately address it.""

According to Mayorkas, the problem is serious enough that DHS brass will conduct an internal investigation to weed out all threats of domestic extremism that may exist within the DHS.

""As we work to safeguard the Nation and our values, we must be vigilant in our efforts to identify and combat domestic violent extremism within both the broader community and our own organization,"" Mayorkas said. ""Violent extremism has no place at DHS and we will work with urgency and focus to address it.

""Given the evolving threat landscape and the grave risks posed by domestic violent extremism, including to our employees and operations, I have directed the Department to immediately begin a review of how to best prevent, detect, and respond to domestic violent extremism threats within DHS,"" he added.

What about the border crisis?

Despite the Biden administration's unwillingness to call the border crisis a ""crisis"" — in fact, Mayorkas has blamed the Trump administration for the growing migrant problem — a Customs and Border Protection intelligence alert reportedly identified Biden's policies as one of the culprits behind the ongoing crisis.

According to Yahoo News, CBP dispatched an intelligence cable on April 16 saying the crisis is ""largely attributable to perceptions of U.S. immigration policy changes,"" disputing the Biden administration's repeated assertions that problems in the Northern Triangle region of Central America are to blame.

From Yahoo News:

The CBP document obtained by Yahoo News suggests some level of disagreement within the government about what exactly is causing the increase. CBP says that ""large group apprehensions,"" referring to more than 100 migrants, continue to increase at the southern border, and says the surge is ""largely attributable to perceptions of U.S. immigration policy changes, economic opportunities, elevated violence and reduced COVID-19 travel restrictions.""

Indeed, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agrees that Biden's policies, or at least the perception of his immigration agenda, is behind the surge.

""Expectations were created that with the government of President Biden, there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border thinking that it is easier to do so,"" López Obrador said last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/border-crisis-dhs-chief-domestic-extremism,2021-04-27
Border Patrol agents nab previously deported convicted rapist among group of illegal aliens hiding in California,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection revealed Wednesday that agents recently arrested a convicted rapist who had made his way back into the U.S. with a group of nearly 20 illegal aliens.

CBP said agents in the Yuma Sector apprehended the previously deported sex offender in California on Monday night, just across the border from Yuma, Arizona.

The convicted rapist, Aurelio Sandoval-Valdivia, was found with 17 other illegals near midnight Monday.

Sandoval-Valdivia, a 54-year-old Mexican national, had been deported following his conviction on rape charges, as well as charges of willful cruelty to a child and driving while intoxicated.

From CBP:

Yuma Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended a convicted rapist who illegally entered the United States as part of a group of 18 Monday night.



Agents assigned to the Yuma station encountered and arrested the group near Andrade, California, at approximately 11:30 p.m. After conducting record checks, agents discovered that one of the individuals, Aurelio Sandoval-Valdivia, had a felony conviction for rape. Sandoval-Valdivia also had misdemeanor convictions for willful cruelty to a child and driving while intoxicated, and was previously deported from U.S.



The 54-year-old Mexican national was processed according to CBP guidelines.

The New York Post said that Border Patrol officials have not responded to requests for comment.

Anything else?

Axios reported this week that four people whose names match those of suspects on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database have been arrested trying to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico since Oct. 1.

CBP said that three of the individuals were Yemen nationals and the fourth was Serbian.

""Individuals that they have on the watch list for terrorism are now starting to exploit the southern border,"" Rep. John Katko (N.Y.) — the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee — said during a press conference at the southern border.

"Border Patrol nabbed 10 suspects on terror watch list in July alone, bringing this year's total to 66","Millions of migrants continue to cross the U.S. border, and while many of them are breaking the law when they do so, few are considered a threat to national security. However, a report from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol suggests that suspected terrorists are also lurking among the giant waves of migrant families and workers who cross the border en masse.

According to the report, CBP apprehended 10 suspects listed on the U.S. terror watch list in July alone, bringing the total for the fiscal year, which began on October 1, to 66.

Compared to recent years, these numbers are staggering. In fiscal year 2021, there were just 15 terror suspects apprehended total. And in the four years before combined, there were just 11.

Moreover, many of those suspects who are stopped by CBP often don't even know they are on the terror watch list.

“Anybody who actually knows or has a fear they’re on the watch list, they’re coming through those gaps and holes,” said Rodney Scott, former chief of the Border Patrol.

And there are many ""gaps and holes"" through which many people — and many illegal substances — have crossed. CBP says it has had 1.8 million encounters this fiscal year, and the Washington Times reports that the amount of fentanyl apprehended by CBP in July tripled the amount apprehended in June: 2,072 pounds last month compared to 640 pounds the month before.

Though the amount of drugs seized at the border fluctuates from month to month and from substance to substance, the overall picture still appears grim. In the month of July, cocaine seizures fell 54%, while seizures of methamphetamine rose 15% and heroin 8%.

Between the influx of people and drugs, border states have come up with creative ways to draw national attention to the problem. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has bused some migrants to Washington, D.C., and New York City, and Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake has repeatedly promised to ""blow up"" the drug tunnels used by the Mexican drug cartels, should she be elected this November.

Scott remains hopeful that this latest report regarding terrorist apprehensions will likewise cause a national stir. The number of terrorists apprehended in July, he said, is ""beyond red flares.""

""Those are rocket flashes going on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/border-patrol-nabbed-terror-watch-list-suspects,2022-08-16
Border Patrol: 50 migrants on terror watch list arrested at border so far this year,"Under President Joe Biden's watch, the number of people on the terror watch list apprehended at the southern border has spiked compared to the years former President Donald Trump was in office.

There were 50 arrests of migrants on the Terrorist Screening Dataset at the southwest border in FY 2022, according to new data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Friday. That's a dramatic increase from 15 such encounters in FY 2021, President Joe Biden's first year in office.

While Trump was in office, the highest number of terror watch list arrests at the border was six in FY 2018. There were three such arrests in FY 2020, zero in FY 2019, and just two in FY 2017 when Trump occupied the White House.



To sum up, there have been 65 terror watch list arrests at the border under Biden compared to just 11 under Trump.

CBP said there were a total of 192 encounters at points of entry in FY 2022, with 50 at the southern border and 142 at the northern border. That's compared to 157 total encounters in FY 2021, 196 in FY 2020, 538 during the border surge in FY 2019, 351 in FY 2018, and 333 in FY 2017.



These numbers come after CBP reported a record high 239,416 migrant encounters in May, which was a 2% increase over April's number. Data showed that a whopping 25% of those encountered had been previously arrested and deported by CBP.

The actual number of migrants crossing U.S. borders illegally is far greater than what's reported because many of them are not apprehended. Fox News reported Friday there were as many as 440,000 ""known gotaways"" since October, with more than 50,000 in May alone. Adding that number to 400,000 known gotaways since the beginning of FY 2021, Fox reported there were more than 800,000 illegal immigrants who got past U.S. border agents since October 2020.

Last month, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that illegal immigration has surged 10% during Biden's presidency. The administration has faced intense criticism from Republicans who blame Biden's decision to undo many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies for the surge in illegal immigration.

Biden officials have blamed factors outside their control for rampant migration to the U.S., including natural disasters, poor economies, corruption, and violence in South and Central America.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told migrants not to come to the U.S. in late May, warning that immigration laws will be enforced and that anyone without legal permission to remain in the U.S. will be expelled.

'Worse than monsters': Two 13-year-old suspects accused in string of physical attacks with larger juvenile gang held on bail,"Two 13-year-old suspects accused of physically attacking people and vandalizing businesses in downtown Boston are being held on bail, WFXT-TV reported.

The two suspects are part of a larger group of violent juveniles who've been terrorizing the city in recent weeks.

What are the details?

One suspect was charged with 14 counts in connection with nine incidents and ordered held on $5,000 bail; the other suspect was charged with nine counts in connection with five incidents and ordered held on $3,500 bail, the station said.

Judge Peter Coyne in Suffolk County Juvenile Court on Monday ordered that the pair wear GPS tracking bracelets if they post bail, WFXT reported, adding that Coyne also ordered that they leave home only for school or service provider reasons — and stay away from Downtown Crossing.

'Worse than monsters'

An 81-year-old man named James told the station in a separate story that the marauding group of teens attacked him at a McDonald’s in Downtown Crossing last month.

“They are worse than monsters,” James told WFXT. “These kids don’t care. They are defiant to the law.”

He told the station three girls and one boy taunted him “just for the fun of it"" on March 21, knocking a hamburger from his hands and then smacking his head.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

“They came straight to me like they know me,” James added to WXTF. “They hit me two or three times and covered my head with whipped cream.” He also told the station ""nobody intervened. They were all fraidy cats. This is a disgrace.”

James noted to the station that he's still furious over the incident as the juveniles are connected to more and more violent crime.

“Something’s got to be done,"" James told WFXT. ""It’s a ridiculous situation,” he said.

Indeed the station said some of the repeat offenders continue to roam the streets because they're too young; authorities can’t arrest or prosecute children younger the age of 12 under 2018 state criminal reform legislation — which also provides limited options for detaining anyone under 14.

“They need to change the law where everyone is punished,” James told WFXT. “They’re not innocent! I don’t care what age they are.”

What else have the youngsters been up to?

Last month the same group of juveniles kicked and punched a woman — calling her a ""white b***h with braids"" — in Downtown Crossing.

WFXT-TV said in a video report that an 11-year-old girl involved in the attack against the woman and against the 81-year-old man at the McDonald's wasn't charged.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Then last Wednesday night, two students from Suffolk University in Boston were physically attacked on Boston Common by the same group of juveniles, WFXT said.

Police believe the main instigator in the attack was that same 11-year-old girl, the station said.

At 6:30 p.m. the juveniles were harassing a woman and her child near the Earl of Sandwich shop on the common, and two Suffolk students tried to help, WFXT said.

“As the woman walked away the group began swearing at her,"" according to a police report, the station said.

With that, the Suffolk students told the juveniles to leave the woman alone — and then the group took aim at the students, WFXT reported.

“At this point the slim, black juvenile female began punching [her] and knocked her glasses off her face,"" the police report said, according to the station. ""She then stepped on her glasses before punching her again.""

One of the students shot video of the incident, WFXT said, adding that police identified the main instigator as an 11-year-old and said she's well known to officers and is responsible for terrorizing unsuspecting citizens of downtown Boston.

But because of her age, the 11-year-old girl won't be formally charged — just issued a summons, WBZ-TV reported. There were were five juveniles in the attacking group on the commons consisting of kids no older than 14, WBZ said.

'Absolutely no fear'

WFXT said video shows the same group of juveniles trying to enter the Silvertone Bar & Grill in Downtown Crossing in late March.

""The really scary part is absolutely no fear,"" restaurant owner Dave Savoie told WFXT of the juveniles. ""Like, the look in their eyes, very matter of fact, a lot of anger.""

Savoie told the station they were demanding alcohol, and when he told them to leave, they began yelling at patrons and at him.

""So much profanity and so much crap and harassment,"" he noted to WXTF. ""The one little girl even tried to ... swing at me when I wouldn't let her back down into the restaurant to go after my customers.""

After getting the juveniles outside, Savoie told the station one of the girls went after him with a knife; he retreated, but the group then broke windows on the front of the restaurant.

(Updated) Man who wanted to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh arrested outside of justice's home,"An armed California man was arrested near Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Maryland home early Wednesday morning after allegedly making threats against the justice, according to a spokeswoman for the court.

The man was taken into police custody at around 1:50 a.m. Wednesday, Supreme Court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said in a statement.

“The man was armed and made threats against Justice Kavanaugh,” McCabe said. “He was transported to Montgomery County Police 2nd District.”

The arrest was first reported by the Washington Post. According to the paper, the suspect is in his mid-20s and was carrying at least one weapon and burglary tools. He had reportedly told police officers he was at Kavanaugh's home to kill the justice.



NBC News reports the suspect arrived by taxi at a street near Kavanaugh's residence in Montgomery County. He was reportedly intercepted by police shortly after.

According to the Washington Post, the man was motivated to kill Kavanaugh because he was upset with a leaked draft of a majority opinion for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Orgnaization, a case concerning Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. The draft decision authored by Justice Samuel Alito indicated the court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that created a constitutional right to have an abortion. The man was also angry over recent mass shootings, the Post reported.

Federal law enforcement is aware of and has been monitoring threats against the Supreme Court and justices made by pro-abortion activists since the draft opinion was leaked. The Department of Homeland Security circulated a bulletin in May that warned of threats to ""burn down or storm"" the Supreme Court building. The memo stated that threats against Supreme Court justices, lawmakers, churches, and abortion clinics ""are likely to persist and may increase leading up to and following the issuing of the Court's official ruling.""

Radical abortion rights activists have called for a ""summer of rage"" in anticipation that the court will return the abortion issue to the states. Protesters have congregated outside of the private homes of several Supreme Court justices and demanded, possibly illegally, that they keep Roe's precedent intact.



There have been violent acts as well. Pro-abortion terrorists took responsibility for a Molotov cocktail attack against a pro-life pregnancy center in Madison, Wisconsin last month. The anarchist group behind that attack is alleged to have firebombed another pro-life pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York on Tuesday.

Anarchist groups have promised more ""militant action"" once the Supreme Court hands down an official decision on abortion rights, which is expected later this month or in early July.

Breaking: Republican Glenn Youngkin wins Virginia gubernatorial race,"Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin has defeated Democratic candidate and former Governor Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race.

The gubernatorial race in Virginia was widely expected earlier in the year to serve as a standard-issue referendum on national politics, as Virginia's odd-year gubernatorial election often does. However, to a large extent, furor over local issues, particularly pertaining to education, took center stage and may have pushed Youngkin over the top.

Parent anger began when many school districts in Virginia were slow and reluctant to reopen for in-person learning after the COVID-19 pandemic. School districts, backed by teachers' unions, mused aloud that they might not reopen even in the fall of 2021, even though evidence suggests that children in particular are at low risk for serious complications from COVID-19, and there is a dearth of evidence that schools have served as transmission vectors for the pandemic. The issue became so contentious that the legislature eventually caved in February 2021 and passed a law mandating that all schools open for in-person learning, over the strenuous objection of many school districts and teachers' unions.

Although almost all Democrats voted for the measure, parental anger at school boards did not abate, as Virginia schools responded to the civil unrest of 2020 by instituting race-based curriculum that many critics characterized as ""critical race theory"" teaching. Parents began confronting school boards at increasingly contentious meetings about the things their children were reporting that they were being taught at school, and school board officials responded by closing meetings to the public and complaining about the behavior of parents.

Loudoun County, in particular, became the focus of the national spotlight when a Loudoun County parent was arrested after an angry confrontation at a school board meeting wherein he alleged that his daughter had been sexually assaulted by a ""gender fluid"" student in a restroom. Although officials denied any knowledge of the assault at the meeting, subsequently unearthed documents revealed that they had, in fact, been notified of the incident. A juvenile court later found a male teenager guilty of the assault in question. The father's arrest was used as a reference in a letter from the National School Boards Association as an example of what the organization likened to a form of ""domestic terrorism,"" prompting national outrage.

In the midst of this furor, during a September 28 debate, Youngkin pressed McAuliffe on his education record, which forced McAuliffe to state, ""I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach."" McAuliffe, who was consistently leading by single digits in the polls prior to that debate, immediately saw his standings sink in the polls. He promptly released an ad that claimed his debate comments were taken out of context, but he appears never to have recovered. McAuliffe was likely not helped with respect to the angry parent vote by having infamous teachers' union President Randi Weingarten speak at his election eve rally.

Joe Biden won Virginia by over 10 percentage points in 2020.

Perhaps even more ominous for Democrats, as counting continued into the night in New Jersey, Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli maintained a slim lead on incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who was widely expected to win re-election easily. Joe Biden won New Jersey in 2020 by almost 16 percentage points.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/breaking-republican-glenn-youngkin-wins-virginia-gubernatorial-race,2021-11-03
British foreign minister fires back over accusation that critical gate at Kabul airport was left open for UK personnel,"A senior British official denied accusations that a key gate was left open at the Kabul airport prior to the ISIS-K terror attack to allow British personnel to pass through the gate.

What is the background?

Politico reported Monday that top American commanders wanted to close the Abbey Gate — the location of the terror attack — but kept ""the gate open longer than they wanted in order to allow their British allies, who had accelerated their withdrawal timeline, to continue evacuating their personnel, based at the nearby Baron Hotel.""

The reporting is based on classified notes taken during a meeting hosted by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly before the attack. The allegation, as the report explained, is that American officials had a ""detailed plan"" to shut the Abbey Gate, but kept it open to help British allies.

How did Britain respond?

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab categorically denied the accusation.

""Look, we coordinate very closely with the U.S., in particular around the ISIS-K threat that we anticipated, although tragically were not able to prevent,"" Raab said on Sky News. ""But we, it's certainly right to say that we got our civilian staff out of the processing center by Abbey Gate — but it's just not true to suggest that other than securing our civilians staff inside the airport that we were pushing to leave the gate open.""

""In fact, and let me just be clear about this, we were issuing changes of travel advice before the bomb attack took place and saying to people in the crowd, which is what I was particularly concerned that certainly U.K. nationals and anyone else should leave because of the risk,"" he added.

In fact, Raab explained in a separate interview with BBC News that British operations never necessitated leaving the Abbey Gate open at the Kabul airport.

""We also shifted the civilian team that we had in the Baron Hotel to the airport, because [being] a stone's throw away from where the terrorist attack took place, it clearly wasn't safe, but none of that would have required or necessitated Abbey Gate to be left open,"" Raab explained.

Anything else?

The Pentagon strongly rebuked Politico for publishing its story, but did not deny the material facts.

""This story is based on the unlawful disclosure of classified information and internal deliberations of a sensitive nature,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement, according to Politico.

""As soon as we became aware of the material divulged to the reporter, we engaged Politico at the highest levels to prevent the publication of information that would put our troops and our operations at the airport at greater risk,"" he added. ""We condemn the unlawful disclosure of classified information and oppose the publication of a story based on it while a dangerous operation is ongoing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-foreign-minister-fires-back-over-accusation-that-critical-gate-at-kabul-airport-was-left-open-for-british-personnel,2021-08-31
"British MP delivers powerful, emotional speech in House of Commons ripping Biden's 'shameful' questioning of the courage of Afghan troops","President Joe Biden dug his Afghanistan hole deeper this week with a speech attempting to justify his administration's botched efforts to extricate American forces, resources, and allies that left the Afghani people being terrorized by a resurgent Taliban — all while questioning the courage of the nation's troops and people.

During his speech Monday, Biden slammed Afghans for not fighting hard enough for their country.

""We gave them every chance to determine their own future,"" the president said. ""[What] we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future,"" adding that the Afghan military ""collapsed, sometimes even without trying to fight.""

""How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghanistan's civil war when Afghan troops will not?"" Biden asked.

The president's attack on the people of Afghanistan was not well received by his critics — in America and abroad.

One British member of Parliament stood on the floor of the House of Commons on Wednesday to blast Biden's ""shameful"" remarks and to remind his fellow lawmakers of the courage of the Afghan troops.

What did he say?

Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, a British military veteran who was stationed in Helmand and served alongside U.S. and Afghan troops, took issue with Biden's lie that Afghans were unwilling to fight for themselves.

Tugendhat shared the emotions he and many fellow international veterans, volunteers, and journalists have been experiencing since Biden's Afghanistan disaster began to unfold.

""Like many veterans, this last week has been one that has seen me struggle through anger and grief and rage — the feeling of abandonment of not just a country but the sacrifice that my friends made,"" he began, adding, ""I've watched good men go into the earth, taking with them a part of me and part of all of us.""

""This week has torn open some of those wounds, left them raw, left us all hurting,"" he continued. ""And I know it's not just soldiers. I know aid workers and diplomats who feel the same. I know journalists who've been the witnesses to our country and its heroic effort to save people from the most horrific fate.""

The MP later noted that the Afghanistan mission was ""a NATO mission"" that is a reminder that Western nations are linked to the south Asian nation — and that European nations and the U.S. are also linked.

Which, he told the chamber, made the criticisms he was about to air so difficult.

Tugendhat, who expressed his admiration for the U.S. military, noting that he had received an award with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne, said, ""To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with — to claim that they ran — is shameful.""

""Those who have never fought for the colors they fly should be careful about criticizing those who have,"" he added.

Which received a supportive ""hear, hear"" from his fellow MPs.

Tugendhat went on to say that the U.K. could now set out a new vision, one that does not leave allies in the lurch and does not have to include the U.S. or President Biden.

""We can set out a vision, clearly articulated, for reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure that we are not on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader,"" he said, ""but that we can work together with Japan and Australia, with France and Germany, with partners large and small and make sure we hold the line together.""

Lamenting the scene the world is seeing in Afghanistan today and remembering the experiences he saw in combat, Tugendhat did not see much hope in the situation as it currently sits.

""This doesn't need to be defeat, but at the moment, it damn well feels like it,"" he concluded.

"Brooklyn subway shooting suspect arrested while wandering NYC streets, will reportedly face terror-related charges","New York City police have arrested 62-year-old Frank James, the primary suspect in Tuesday morning's Brooklyn subway shooting that injured more than two dozen people.

In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, NYPD commissioner Keechant Sewell declared, ""Frank Robert James had nowhere else to run or hide — and is now in NYPD custody. The work of our detectives is second to none and the dedication of our patrol officers is never ending.""

James was taken into custody Wednesday afternoon after being spotted by bystanders at a McDonald’s near East 6th Street and First Avenue in the East Village, the New York Post reported.

Police quickly responded to the tip and eventually intercepted the suspect a few blocks away at St. Mark’s Place and First Avenue. When officers caught up to James, they found him casually sauntering down the street. He was reportedly taken into custody ""without incident.""

""My fellow New Yorkers, we got him. We got him,"" Mayor Eric Adams said in a press conference following news of the arrest, according to WABC-TV.

Videos purportedly showing the moment that James was handcuffed and led into the back of a patrol vehicle have been posted on social media.

James is currently being held at the NYPD's 9th Precinct.

He is expected to face terror-related charges for setting off a smoke grenade on a subway train car before opening fire on dozens of innocent passengers. He was wearing a gas mask and a reflective vest at the time of the attack.

WABC reported that James will be charged under a federal statute that prohibits terrorist and other violent attacks within a mass transit system. Another federal charge for crossing state lines will also be applied.

James, who is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was identified as a suspect in the case after a set of keys and a credit card linked him to the crime scene.

Another surveillance video published by WNBC-TV allegedly shows James entering a subway station two hours prior to the attack.



In the hours following the hellish attack, rambling and conspiracy-laden videos that James had recently uploaded to YouTube were unearthed and circulated. In the videos, James espoused controversial views on race, angrily complained about the city's mental health services, and threatened NYC's mayor.

""It’s just a matter of time before these white motherf***ers decide, ‘Hey listen, enough is enough, these n***ers got to go,'"" he said in one of the videos, seeming to predict a race war was coming.

Witnesses have claimed the attacker was seen muttering under his breath before launching the attack.

Mayor Adams defended the terror charges on Wednesday, saying, ""There was a clear desire to create terror. If you bring a smoke bomb or would you bring an automatic weapon with a gas mask and in a very methodical way injured ... innocent New Yorkers, that is terror.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brooklyn-subway-suspect-frank-james-arrested,2022-04-13
"Brutal Mexican massacre leaves 20 dead near Acapulco, including mayor whose father may have been in league with the gang responsible","On Wednesday in San Miguel Totolaplan, a municipality in the southwestern Mexican state of Guerrero (roughly five hours away from both Mexico City and Acapulco), terrorists killed 20 people and wounded three. Mayor Conrado Mendoza Almeda and his father, the former mayor, were among those targeted in the massacre.

Two groups of gunmen wearing face coverings arrived in SUVs. They carried out simultaneous attacks at the city hall and at a private residence. In the first instance, they interrupted a meeting between the mayor and city officials, riddling all participants and the building enclosing them with bullets.

Mexico's assistant secretary of public safety, Ricardo Mejia, stated, ""This act occurred in the context of a dispute between criminal gangs."" The BBC reported in 2020 that this is a claim often repeated by Mexican politicians.

The Los Tequileros gang claimed responsibility for the massacre. Los Tequileros is affiliated with the Jalisco Nueva Generación Cartel (JNGC) and is in an ongoing territorial dispute with the Familia Michoacana gang in the region.

Mejia indicated that the ""Tequileros dominated the region for some time,"" kidnapping, extorting, murdering, and smuggling and distributing opiates.

Evelyn Salgado Pineda, the governor of Guerrero, condemned the attack and indicated there would be no impunity for those who committed this aggression against the municipal president and local government officials.

The leftist party affiliated with Almeda issued a statement, saying it condemns the ""cowardly murder"" and its members ""demand justice.""

It is unclear if Almeda knew his killers, but his father, also gunned down on Wednesday, had encountered them before.

In 2015, after the June 7 Guerrero state elections in which Almeda's father was himself elected mayor, a video circulated online wherein Mendoza Acosta could be seen drinking with members of the Los Tequileros gang. The gangsters indicated Mendoza had been elected with their help: ""Just as we made you win, also give us a hand.""

When asked whether he would work with them, Mendoza replied, ""We will! I will never work with other cochos.""

One month prior to the election, Mendoza had been kidnapped but released shortly thereafter.

Al Jazeera reported that Mendoza, as seen in the video, might not have been meeting with the gang voluntarily, but rather under duress.

Entrevista con la fiscal de Guerrero tras masacre en San Miguel Totolapan - Despierta youtu.be

According to the analytics firm Etellekt Consultores, Almeda's murder brings the number of mayors assassinated during Mexican President Lopez Obrador's administration to 18. An additional 31 aldermen and 11 trustees have been assassinated during Obrador's term in office.

In recent months, Obrador has come to rely more on the military than on civilian police to rein in Mexico's incredibly high levels of violent crime. After all, the police may no longer be well equipped to handle a threat that has grown increasingly militarized.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, director of the Brookings Institute's Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors, told Metro.co.uk, ""Over the last 15 years, the operational tempo of these groups in terms of hits, counter-hits and other attacks has been as high as the Taliban.""

Cartels and related gangs ""are able to take entire cities like an invasion force associated with an insurgency, they deploy drones to drive people out of areas, they use quite stunning forms of violence,"" said Brown.

August was a particularly bad month for cartel violence in Mexico.

Edgar Garcia Carrillo, a doctor in the Mexican city of Celaya, told the New York Times that the region had descended into ""absolute warfare.""

Cartels and gangs reportedly rampaged throughout the country, firing on police and troops. They torched businesses, blockaded roads, and committed executions in broad daylight. In Celaya, homicides skyrocketed 32% in the first four months of the year.

In one such instance of brazen violence, gangsters lined up mourners at a funeral on February 27, gunned them down, and then cleaned up the scene, leaving behind only a bag of brains.

The JNGC cartel has taken to employing drones for bombing campaigns, as seen in this video showing one such bombing in Michoacan.

The violence is encroaching on the U.S. southern border. In Juarez, which sits next to the American city of El Paso, Texas, a prison battle between members of two rival Mexican cartels spilled out this summer into the streets, killing at least 11, most of whom were civilians.

On August 13, 24 cars were set on fire in Tijuana, Mexico, amid sporadic shootings. Members of the JNGC, whose proxies committed the massacre in Guerrero this week, set out to terrorize the city. The city ultimately issued a shelter-in-place order.

The U.S. State Department recently warned American citizens about travelling to Mexico, stating: “Violent crime — such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery — is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico.”

The State Department said not to travel to the following Mexican states: Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas.

It suggested that Americans ought to reconsider traveling to Baja California, Chihuahua, Duranjo, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, and Sonora. The U.S. government also underlined the need to exercise ""increased caution"" virtually everywhere else in Mexico.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brutal-mexican-massacre-leaves-20-dead-near-acapulco-including-mayor-whose-father-may-have-been-league-with-the-gang-responsible,2022-10-06
"Buffalo supermarket shooting update: 'Troubled' suspect investigated for threat last year, shooter linked 'hate crime' to Waukesha massacre, 'hero' security guard died in gunfight","New developments have surfaced in the heartbreaking mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. The tragic shooting at the Tops supermarket has been deemed a ""racially motivated hate crime"" that resulted in the deaths of 10 innocent people and wounded three others.

Buffalo supermarket shooting update

Police have named the suspect as 18-year-old Payton Gendron of Conklin, New York. He was arraigned on Saturday on one count of first-degree murder and was ordered held without bail. The suspect appeared before a judge while wearing a paper gown since he is on suicide watch. He pleaded not guilty.



If he is found guilty, the suspect faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said his office is investigating terrorism charges.

A felony hearing has been scheduled for May 19.

Suspect was investigated by State Police for a high school threat in 2021



The suspect previously threatened to shoot up his high school in June 2021, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press.



""A school official reported that this very troubled young man had made statements indicating that he wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after,"" the same government official familiar with the case told the Buffalo News.

""FBI officials confirmed the shooter allegedly wanted to commit a murder/suicide at the graduation of his high school in 2021 and was taken into custody by the New York State Police and given a mental evaluation,"" ABC News reported.

Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia confirmed that the then-17-year-old was given a mental health evaluation after the violent threat.

""Federal law bars people from owning a gun if a judge has determined they have a 'mental defect' or they have been forced into a mental institution — but an evaluation alone would not trigger the prohibition,"" ABC News reported.



No criminal charges were levied against the teenager.

Firearms used in the shooting were purchased legally

The suspect legally purchased a semi-automatic Bushmaster XM-15 rifle a couple of months ago from the Vintage Firearms shop in Endicott, New York, ABC News reported. The suspect allegedly purchased another gun at a Pennsylvania gun shop and was given another by his father.



Sources told the outlet that there was a pistol and a shotgun in the suspect's car.

The Daily Beast reported that the rifle had a racial slur written on it, a white supremacist symbol, and the name of Virginia Sorenson – a victim of the Waukesha Christmas parade massacre.

Suspect may have had manifesto, 'planned the attack for months'

Authorities have yet to authenticate a 180-page manifesto said to have been written by the suspect. The purported manifesto contained anti-Semitic tropes claiming that the New York Times, CNN, and Fox News are run by Jews. The alleged manifesto also focused on ""replacement theory,"" a white supremacist doctrine that non-whites will eventually replace white people.



A law enforcement official told the Associated Press that the suspect repeatedly visited websites that promulgated white supremacist ideologies and race-based conspiracy theories. The alleged shooter reportedly praised South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof and New Zealand mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant online.

The Daily Mail reported that the teenager ""planned the attack for months before he drove for three hours to carry out the vile ambush that authorities are calling an act of 'violent extremism' motivated by race.""

The suspect – who is white – allegedly targeted that specific Tops Friendly Market because the neighborhood is predominantly black. All 10 of the people who were killed were black.

Erie County Sheriff John Garcia told reporters on Saturday, ""This was pure evil. It was a straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community ... coming into our community and trying to inflict evil upon us.""

The FBI is investigating the attack as a hate crime and as a ""racially motivated violent extremism"" case.

New York State Police's Hate Crimes Task Force has joined the investigation.

'Hero' security guard did everything he could to stop the shooter

The shooter was dressed in tactical gear, including a helmet with a camera attached that he allegedly used to livestream the carnage to Twitch – a video game streaming platform. Twitch reportedly removed the graphic content within two minutes.

The gunman fired at least 50 shots during the rampage, according to Gramaglia.

The gunman shot four people in the supermarket's parking lot – three of which died.

The shooter entered Tops supermarket and was confronted by a security guard Aaron Salter Jr. The two exchanged gunfire, but the shooter's body armor protected him. The suspect allegedly shot and killed Salter a retired police officer.

Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said of Salter, ""He's a true hero. He went down fighting. He went towards the gunfire.""

Yvette Mack, a frequent shopper at Tops, said of Salter, ""He cared about the community. He looked after the store. He did a good job you know. He was very nice and respectable.""

Other victims of the mass shooting include Ruth Whitfield, 86, Pearly Young, 77, Katherine Massey, 73, Deacon Heyward Patterson, 68, Celestine Chaney, and Roberta Drury, 32.

Ohio CAIR group fires director after finding out he's been secretly recording their meetings for an anti-Muslim 'hate group',"The Center for American-Islamic Relations organization said that a senior staffer of their Ohio chapter was secretly recording their meetings for an ""anti-Muslim hate group,"" and they have fired him and alerted law enforcement authorities.

A press release from CAIR national executive director Nihad Awad on Tuesday outlined their accusations against Romin Iqbal, the former executive director of CAIR-Ohio. Iqbal had led the Columbus and Cincinnati offices of CAIR-Ohio since 2018.

The statement said that CAIR had hired a private investigator after suspecting that they had become the target of The Investigative Project on Terrorism, which they called a hate group. That investigator found that Iqbal had allegedly been secretly recording meetings for IPT.

For years, Mr. Iqbal was secretly sharing confidential information about our civil rights work—including surreptitiously recorded conversations, strategic plans and private emails—with anti-Muslim extremists. He did this in violation of his ethical duties to the organization and his moral duty to protect the Ohio Muslim community.

Awad claimed that Iqbal confessed after being confronted with the evidence against him, and he was fired.

After firing Iqbal, employees at CAIR-Ohio claimed that a package containing parts to construct an AR-15 rifle arrived at their offices. They found that they had been purchased with a CAIR business credit card to which they claim Iqbal had exclusive access.

Fearing that Iqbal might have been planning a violent retaliatory attack on their offices, they alerted local law enforcement.

Awad claimed that Iqbal and IPT violated local and federal laws and said they would pursue legal action against them. The statement from CAIR also accused the Israeli government of collaborating with IPT.

CAIR is the largest civil liberties organization in the U.S., with over 35 chapters nationwide.

Canadian civil rights org fires back at Justin Trudeau over decision to invoke Emergencies Act: 'Threatens our democracy',"The Canadian Civil Liberties Union published a defiant message condemning Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for using increasingly powerful methods to quell Freedom Convoy protests.

What is the background?

Trudeau announced Monday that Canada's federal government would, for the first time in its history, invoke the Emergencies Act to stop the protests and silence those advocating for freedom. Invoking the Emergencies Act gives Trudeau enormous power to end the politically inconvenient protests.

According to Politico, Trudeau emphasized his conviction that the protests are no longer ""non-violent,"" although Trudeau did not explain how the peaceful protests had become violent. Trudeau also claimed he would not limit Canadians' freedoms of speech, protest, or peaceful assembly — despite invoking the Emergencies Act to do exactly that.

As part of Canada's expanded efforts to crack down on the protests, the Washington Post explained that Canada's ""money-laundering and terrorism financing rules will also be widened to cover crowdfunding sites such as GoFundMe and GiveSendGo and payment service providers that have been used to funnel funds, including cryptocurrencies, to the protesters.""

Additionally, Canadian authorities will crack down on businesses that own the trucks being used in the protests, which could include revoking insurance policies or freezing corporate bank accounts.

What did the CCLU say?

The CCLU — which is essentially the Canadian version of the American Civil Liberties Union and is, therefore, by no means conservative — warned that Trudeau is threatening Canadian democracy by using government power to stop Canadians from exercising freedom of speech.

""The federal government has not met the threshold necessary to invoke the Emergencies Act,"" the CCLU explained. ""This law creates a high and clear standard for good reason: the Act allows government to bypass ordinary democratic processes. This standard has not been met.""

The Emergencies Act, according to the CCLU, can only be invoked when no other legal redress allows Canada to protect its sovereignty.

""The Emergencies Act can only be invoked when a situation 'seriously threatens the ability of the Government of Canada to preserve the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Canada' & when the situation 'cannot be effectively dealt with under any other law of Canada,'"" the CCLU explained. ""Governments regularly deal with difficult situations, and do so using powers granted to them by democratically elected representatives. Emergency legislation should not be normalized. It threatens our democracy and our civil liberties.""

Canadians who are angry over draconian COVID restrictions, of course, are not a threat to Canadian sovereignty. They do, however, constitute a threat to the Canadian elite and those in government who have been exercising fierce control over the lives of Canadian citizens for the past two years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/canadian-civil-rights-org-delivers-powerful-message-to-justin-trudeau-over-decision-to-invoke-emergency,2022-02-15
Canadian leaders weigh 'online harm' bills which would further restrict free speech,"Political leaders in Canada are moving forward with plans to impose further restrictions on online free speech.

They have assembled an ""expert advisory group"" to develop so-called ""online harm"" bills which will hold online service providers ""responsible for addressing harmful content on their platforms and creating a safe online space that protects all Canadians,"" according to the government's website.

However, others worry that the Canadian government is stoking fears regarding hate speech, child exploitation, the sharing of non-consensual images, incitements to violence, and terrorism — all of which are already illegal — to pass sweeping restrictions against free speech that the government just doesn't like.

Douglas Blair, an American writing for the Daily Signal, warns that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ""brand of authoritarian speech-policing"" may soon metastasize in the U.S. Citing Trudeau's stringent crackdown on the truckers of the Freedom Convoy, who were protesting continued government shutdowns earlier this year, Blair claims that elites in both Canada and America ""will ruthlessly enforce orthodoxy toward leftist positions and accuse peaceful protests against them as hateful.""

Still, despite dire warnings from Blair and others, many say that a sizeable majority of Canadians favor heavy restrictions on ""hate speech"" and ""disinformation."" A recent poll from the Canadian Race Relations Foundation claims that almost 80% of Canadians want social media companies to remove ""hateful"" and/or ""racist"" messages posted to their platforms.

""Exaggerated concerns that regulations will erode our constitutional freedoms are misplaced and out of step with what Canadians have repeatedly made clear: Hate speech has no place in our democratic society,"" said Mohammed Hashim, Executive Director of the CRRF, according to CBN.

To demonstrate the supposed danger posed by unfettered free speech, many have pointed to a recent incident in Alberta in which an unidentified man followed Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland into an elevator and hurled obscenities at her and called her a traitor. Though the man's actions have been condemned by leaders on both sides of the aisle, some believe that those in power plan to use this example of unsavory speech as an excuse to censor the opposition more generally.

Peter Menzies of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute recently said that Canada is ""poised to become a global leader in restricting online speech and meddling with news media"" and that Canadians ""will be soon communicating only in manners of which their government approves,"" even as leaders insist that the ""online harm"" bills will operate ""within the parameters of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.""

Regardless of intent, the ""online bills"" have since stalled in the legislative process, and some now say that a formalized bill won't be introduced until early 2023 at the earliest.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/canadian-leaders-weigh-online-harm-bills-which-would-further-restrict-free-speech,2022-09-06
Canadian police call the Freedom Convoy a 'nation-wide insurrection',"The term “insurrection” has gotten an unprecedented amount of use ever since the events that unfolded at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.

It evokes fear of societal instability and conveys a mental image of a rowdy crowd that is hellbent on upheaval.

So, it may come as some surprise that Canadian officials have begun characterizing the peaceful and polite Freedom Convoy that has inspired Canadians from all walks of life to oppose their government’s COVID-19 vaccinations mandate as a “nation-wide insurrection.”

Diane Deans, chair of Ottawa’s police board, referred to the coalition of truckers protesting the vaccine mandate in Canada’s capital as a “threat to our democracy.”

“What we’re seeing is bigger than just a City of Ottawa problem,” she continued, “This is a nation-wide insurrection. This is madness. We need a concrete plan to put an end to this.”

Peter Sloly, the Ottawa police chief, described the Freedom Convoy’s presence in Canada’s capital city as “mindboggling” and an “occupation.”

Police chief Sloly announced on Friday that the police of Ottawa were launching a “surge and contain” strategy to put an end to the peaceful demonstration.

Diana Deans suggested that the government begin to coerce dispersion of the Freedom Convoy. She asked city officials if they would be willing to declare the peacefully assembled truckers “unlawful” and subsequently a “riot” so that the government may begin making mass arrests or pursue a court injunction against the Freedom Convoy.

“We cannot allow this kind of terrorism in our community to continue in this way,” Deans said.

Ottawa’s city councilors even explored the possibility of invoking the National Defense Act in order to curtail the Freedom Convoy. Should the National Defense Act be invoked, the Canadian military would be mobilized to disperse the Freedom Convoy and its supporters.

Despite Canadian officials decrying the peaceful assembly of truckers as “violent,” the only actual act of violence was carried out against supporters of the Freedom Convoy when a 42-year-old man drove his SUV into a crowd of protesters.

Interestingly enough, Diane Deans does not condemn or even mention the 2021 burnings of Canadian churches online. Yet, when it comes to blue-collar workers peacefully opposing government-mandated medical procedures, she is swift to decry their mobilization as dangerous.



Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau even decried the Freedom Convoy as being prejudiced against virtually every possible demographic.

Yet despite this, the men and women who the Canadian government lambast as violent bigots are cleaning up garbage on Canada’s streets, shoveling snow off of sidewalks, and cleaning grime off of national monuments.

Calls for permanent Capitol fencing blasted over hypocrisy of canceled border wall: 'Take down these fences!',"Following the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, the Dr. William Thornton-designed building for Congress has been fortified with barricades and fencing. There are calls to erect permanent fencing around the U.S. Capitol building to protect Congress, but many are pointing out the hypocrisy after shrieks for four years that walls are offensive and inhumane.

Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman is calling for permanent fencing surrounding the Capitol building after she ordered the department to ""conduct a physical security assessment of the entire Capitol Complex"" on Jan. 8.

""In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol,"" Pittman recommended following the evaluation.

Pittman noted that even before the 9/11 terrorist attacks that ""security experts argued that more needed to be done to protect the U.S. Capitol."" She added, ""In fact, a 2006 security assessment specifically recommended the installation of a permanent perimeter fence around the Capitol.""

""I look forward to working with Congress on identifying the security improvements necessary to ensure the safety and security of the Congress and the U.S. Capitol,"" Pittman concluded in a statement released on Thursday.



The recommendation was immediately countered with resistance, including by Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D), who said the city ""will not accept extra troops or permanent fencing as a long-term fixture in D.C.""

Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio White House Correspondent, noted the Capitol hadn't had a permanent fence in the building's 220-year history.

Other reactions on the internet to a permanent wall at the U.S. Capitol include Rep. Ashley Hinson(R-Iowa), who proclaimed, ""This is wrong. We serve in the People's House—we need to be safe, but cutting off access to the Capitol isn't the answer.""

Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) said, ""It is a mistake to turn the home of our democracy into a fortress. The Capitol needs to be safely open for constituents, press, and visitors.""

Rep Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) demanded, ""Madam Speaker, take down these fences! #ThePeoplesHouse.""

Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) stated, ""I adamantly oppose this action. A fence didn't fail us. Law enforcement leaders did. I believe we can keep Members, press, staff, my constituents, and all those who work here safe without walling off the symbol of our democracy. It's the People's House—let's keep it that way.""

There was also a flood of people on Twitter pointing out the hypocrisy of Congress being protected by permanent fencing after four years of Democrats vehemently opposing former President Donald Trump's southern border wall that sparked thousands of debates about immigration. Last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to halt the construction of the border wall.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) quipped, ""The first wall the Democrats support.""

Former White House national security aide Sebastian Gorka scoffed, ""So walls work. Just not at the border.""

Ricochet editor-in-chief Jon Gabriel riposted, ""Fences don't work. Build bridges not walls.""

RedState editor Kira Davis sneered, ""So we won't build a wall to keep non-citizens from busting into our country illegally but we'll build a wall around the People's House to keep the citizens out. Got it. Got that America? You're not welcome in your own buildings.""

Former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright reacted by pointing out, ""Democrats spent the past four years outraged at security fences & walls being built on the border because racism!, violence!,Trump!, etc. Their support of fences now — to protect their hides — makes it clear: Security for them, not for you. Not for America.""

GOP operative Alex Plitsas noted, ""The same week the southern border emergency and fence was cancelled by Presidential executive order.""

Writer Greg Price joked, ""We should really consider putting one of these on our southern border.""

Global Guerrillas Report writer John Robb wrote, ""As expected, the new Green Zone in DC has become permanent. We might see another exclusion zone for the HQs of hedge funds and investment banks in the not too distant future too.""

Max Abrahms, professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University, advised, ""Law enforcement needs to decide whether the threat is an insurgency or a terrorist attack. I would suggest the threat is terrorism. But most of the countermeasures since January 6th have been for an insurgency.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/capitol-building-fencing-border-wall,2021-01-29
Authorities identify man who rammed car into Capitol Police as Nation of Islam follower; officer killed in attack is also identified,"Law enforcement authorities released the identity of a 25-year-old man who was shot and killed after ramming his car into U.S. Capitol Police officers on Friday, killing one and seriously injuring another.

NBC's Pete Williams reported that police had identified the man as Noah Green, an ""unemployed"" man from Indiana. He added that the man's Facebook page identified him as a follower of the Nation of Islam.

The Capitol Police also released the identity of the officer who was killed in the attack as William ""Billy"" Evans. He was an 18-year veteran of the force.

Capitol Police said that Green was driving a blue sedan when he rammed two Capitol officers near the north barricade at the U.S. Capitol. He then exited the vehicle and ran toward other officers with a knife. At least one officer shot at him and he later died at a hospital.

D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said that the incident did not appear to be terrorism related, and that there was no ongoing threat.The Facebook page of the suspect said that he had recently lost his job.



In a recent post documented by Mediaite, he wrote a religious message related to the Nation of Islam.

""Peace, friends, family, enemies, and the like,"" Green wrote in March. ""To be honest these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher. I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life. I am currently now unemployed after I left my job partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey.""

That Facebook page was quickly scrubbed from the internet after many circulated screenshots.

The Capitol complex was locked down after the incident but was later opened back up. National Guard troops moved in to secure some areas at the Capitol.

Capitol rioter sentenced to less than a year in prison as first felony case is resolved,"A Florida man who carried a Trump campaign flag onto the floor of the U.S. Senate during the January 6 riot at the Capitol building was sentenced to eight months in prison on Monday, becoming the first Capitol rioter to receive prison time for felony charges.

Paul Allard Hodgkins, 38, of Tampa plead guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding for interrupting the certification of the Electoral College results by Congress. He was photographed on the Senate floor carrying a ""TRUMP"" flag and wearing goggles around his neck.

Reading a prepared message to the court, Hodgkins apologized for his involvement in the riot, saying he got caught up as the crowd at former President Donald Trump's rally moved on to the Capitol and became a mob, escalating to violence.

""If I had any idea that the protest ... would escalate (the way) it did ... I would never have ventured farther than the sidewalk of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Hodgkins said, according to the Associated Press.

""This was a foolish decision on my part,"" he added, acknowledging that Joe Biden is the legitimately elected president of the United States.

Prosecutors sought to have Hodgkins sentenced to 18 months behind bars, writing in a recent court filing that he, ""like each rioter, contributed to the collective threat to democracy"" by attempting to interrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results declaring President Joe Biden the winner. They told the court that even though the defendant was not destructive and did not assault anyone, he had still participated in ""an act of domestic terrorism"" as one of 50 people who had breached the Senate chamber.

The prosecution asked the judge to ""send a loud and clear message to other would-be rioters... if and when they're caught they will be held accountable,"" according to WRC-TV reporter Scott MacFarlane.

Lawyers for the defense asked for leniency and no prison time, strongly objecting to calling the January 6 riot an act of ""domestic terrorism."" They said it was a protest that became a riot and observed that of the more than 535 individuals arrested in connection with the riot, no one has been charged with terrorism.

The defense attempted to compare the Jan. 6 riot to the violence in Minneapolis after George Floyd was killed in 2020, but Judge Randolph Moss cut off their argument.

Defense lawyers also said in court filings that Hodgkins' actions were similar to those of Anna Morgan Lloyd, who was among the first rioters to be arrested. She pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct last month and was sentenced to three years' probation.

In pronouncing his sentence, which amounts to less than a year in prison, Moss said that Hodgkins had participated in ""an assault on democracy.""

""It left a stain that will remain on us ... on the country for years to come,"" he added.

Hodgkins struck a deal with prosecutors last month to plead guilty to one count of obstructing an official proceeding, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. In exchange, prosecutors dropped lesser charges of entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct.

Photographs and video footage show Hodgkins on the Senate floor wearing a Trump 2020 T-shirt, carrying the campaign flag, and wearing eye-goggles around his neck. He took a selfie with several other rioters, including Jake Angeli, an Arizona resident known as the QAnon Shaman.

Prosecutors agreed that Hodgkins deserved some leniency because he was never accused of assaulting anyone or damaging property and because he almost immediately pleaded guilty after his arrest. But they also emphasized that he had left Tampa for the Jan. 6 Trump rally with rope, protective goggles, and latex gloves in a backpack. They said these items demonstrated that he had come to Washington D.C. prepared for violence.

This sentencing is seen as a key benchmark for how the hundreds of other rioters facing charges might be sentenced should they also plead guilty.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/capitol-rioter-sentenced,2021-07-19
Democratic House Homeland Security chairman calls for Capitol rioters to be put on 'No Fly List' usually reserved for suspected terrorists,"Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is calling on the Transportation Security Administration and FBI to place the riotous Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on the national ""no-fly list"" — a subset usually reserved for terrorism suspects.

Hundreds of rioters supportive of President Donald Trump's election challenge fought with cops, breached security barricades, and entered the Capitol Wednesday afternoon, forcing a lockdown and resulting in the deployment of National Guard troops. Multiple people died in the pandemonium, including a Capitol Police officer injured during the confrontations with rioters and a Trump supporter who was shot by law enforcement.

In a statement issued Thursday, Thompson said, ""Given the heinous domestic terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol yesterday, I am urging the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use their authorities to add the names of all identified individuals involved in the attack to the federal No-Fly List and keep them off planes. This should include all individuals identified as having entered the Capitol building — an intrusion which threatened the safety of Members of Congress and staff and served as an attack on our Nation.

""We already saw reports of 'unruly mobs' in air on the way to Washington, D.C.,"" Thompson continued. ""It does not take much imagination to envision how they might act out on their way out of D.C. if allowed to fly unfettered. This is an action that TSA and the FBI, by law, are able to take but, to my knowledge, have not yet taken. Alleged perpetrators of a domestic terrorist attack who have been identified by the FBI should be held accountable.""

Sam Mintz, a transportation reporter for Politico who posted the statement on Twitter, noted that the committee does not have the power to order protesters be placed on the no-fly list.

""[This is] a request (albeit one with a lot of eyes on it),"" he said. ""No indication yet from TSA or FBI that this has actually happened.""

Thompson's request came after the nation's largest flight attendants union also expressed safety concerns and demanded that identified rioters be barred from their return flights.

According to the TSA, the no-fly list is ""a small subset of the U.S. government Terrorist Screening Database (also known as the terrorist watchlist) that contains the identity information of known or suspected terrorists."" Individuals are placed on the watchlist when they are ""reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.""

In a statement to Newsweek, a spokesperson for the TSA said the agency is ""always on high alert.""

""We prepare for all contingencies. For security reasons we do not discuss the precise details of our multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen. Travelers may notice additional law enforcement and canine presence, especially when events justify an increased security posture,"" the statement said. ""TSA is, of course, always at the ready to accommodate FBI requests and Congressional authorizations related to the No Fly List.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/capitol-rioters-no-fly-list,2021-01-08
New York City car chase caught on viral video,"A viral video captured the moment of a crazy car chase in New York City on Saturday afternoon. The car chase escalated into a fender-bending demolition derby on a street on the Upper East Side. The insane situation ends with a gunpoint robbery in broad daylight.

A silver Toyota RAV4 is seen on video speeding away from a black Mercedes Benz around 4:40 p.m. on Saturday. The Mercedes races to the driver's side of the SUV despite an oncoming car driving down the street.

The Mercedes rams the driver's side of the RAV4 – which caused the SUV to lose control and slam into another car. The vehicles then burn rubber and continue the car chase down a sidewalk as pedestrians scramble to avoid being run over.

The Mercedes rams the RAV4 yet again – this time on the passenger's side. The RAV4 spins 180 degrees because of the car crash.

A man gets out of the Mercedes and begins using a gun to smash a window on the SUV.

A witness is heard on video screaming, ""He's got a gun! He's got a gun!""

The gunman then runs to the driver's side and commits a gunpoint robbery. In the video, the armed man is seen running back to the Mercedes with a black bag. The Mercedes races off and the video ends.



""The guy was in shock he cannot say nothing,"" a witness told the New York Daily News. ""He just standing in his place. At first when he see the gun… He get out and he put his hands up.""

The New York Daily News reported that the car crash that ended in an armed robbery took place on Second Avenue, only a few blocks from Gracie Mansion – the official residence of the Mayor of New York City Eric Adams.

Police said the RAV4 driver is a 55-year-old man.

The Mercedes was reportedly found on E. 86th St. near Third Ave. A witness said three men fled from a black Mercedes Benz and sprinted to the Second Ave subway station.

Another witness said, ""When we were in the store and saw there were guns involved, I told everyone to go to the back of the store. It all happened so quickly – maybe it took three minutes at most.""

The New York Police Department (NYPD) is investigating the apparent crime.



According to NYPD crime statistics, robberies are up nearly 40% over the past year in New York City and grand larceny has spiked by 46%.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/car-chase-new-york-city-video,2022-09-04
Chair of Ben & Jerry's board of directors accused of self-dealing tens of thousands of dollars to fund her own pro-Palestinian nonprofit,"The chairwoman of Ben & Jerry's board of directors has been accused of self-dealing tens of thousands of dollars from the left-wing ice cream company's foundation to fund her own pro-Palestinian nonprofit, the New York Post reported, citing a watchdog complaint to the IRS.

What are the details?



Besides chairing the board since 2008, Anuradha Mittal also is a vice president of the company's nonprofit foundation, the Post said.

And between 2017 and 2018, the foundation gave more than $100,000 to the Oakland Institute, which the paper calls ""a progressive think tank that studies land reform around the world, where Mittal is executive director and the only salaried employee, according to IRS filings.""

""It is our contention that this a possible violation of self-dealing as Mittal is considered a disqualified person under IRS rules,"" a copy of a complaint from the National Legal and Policy Center in Virginia says, the Post reported.

More from the paper:

The Ben & Jerry's Foundation sent a total of $104,000 in grants to the California-based Oakland Institute where MIttal was paid a combined $156,000 in salary in 2017 and 2018, IRS filings show. Part of the Ben & Jerry's Foundation cash went to finance the Badil Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights. The controversial human rights group in the West Bank received $3,000 from the foundation in 2017, according to tax filings.



Last year, the European Union pulled nearly $2 million worth of funding from Badil after it refused to sign an ""anti-terror"" clause in its funding contract. The clause stated that none of the EU's funds would be diverted to members of terrorist organizations, such as the military wings of Hamas and Hezbollah.



The Ben & Jerry's grant was used to finance ""a bold multimedia project on land rights to mark 50 years since the Six-Day War and Israel's occupation,"" according to the Oakland Institute's 2017 annual report. ""Palestine: For Land and Life"" documented individual stories of ""marginalization and struggle.""

The Post said Mittal didn't comment on the complaint and instead said ""false allegations"" were made about the Oakland Institute and the Ben & Jerry's Foundation.

And about that anti-Israel boycott

Oh, and remember when Ben & Jerry's announced last month that its ice cream no longer would be sold in ""Occupied Palestinian Territory"" belonging to Israel?

Well, the Post said the 54-year-old Mittal was one of the creators of the controversial anti-Israel boycott as well.

StopAntisemitism.org criticized Ben & Jerry's for giving in to the demands of the radical Boycott, Divestment, Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.

""Ben and Jerry's fails to realize BDS refers to ALL of Israel as occupied Palestinian territory,"" the organization tweeted. ""Do they honestly think appeasing these bigots will help anything?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chair-ben-jerrys-board-of-directors-self-dealing,2021-08-30
Charlie Hebdo Meghan Markle and Queen racist cover outrage,"The French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo sparked online outrage after its latest cover evoked memories of the death of George Floyd. The controversial cover depicted a cartoon caricature of Queen Elizabeth II pressing her knee into the neck of Meghan Markle, which was labeled as ""hate speech,"" and lambasted as being ""offensive"" and ""racist.""

The front page of the provocative newspaper parodies the death of George Floyd, where former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was caught kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. The Charlie Hebdo cover satirizes the death of Floyd with a visual comparison to the split of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with the royal family.

The headline on the cartoon reads: ""Why Meghan left Buckingham Palace."" There is a dialogue bubble from Meghan, saying, ""Because I couldn't breathe anymore,"" a reference to the May 25 video of Floyd, where he is heard saying, ""I can't breathe"" over 20 times.

The controversial illustration was relentlessly chastised online by furious commenters, who racked up thousands of likes and retweets for their outrage.

One Twitter user declared, ""Charlie Hebdo is a racist rag and has been for a very long time. Saying it does not mean condoning the 2015 attacks or being against free speech. It simply means being against racism. Ignoring it is being complicit and plays right in the hands of all those who seek to divide us.""

NBA basketball player Enes Kanter castigated the paper, ""Shame on @Charlie_Hebdo_ for promoting Racism, Xenophobia, Islamophobia and Sexism. They make millions while making light of oppression and injustice all for a punchline. This is disgusting. Racism is NOT free speech. ITS HATE SPEECH AND TERRORISM!""

One tweet read, ""Charlie Hebdo is a disgusting newspaper that promotes Racism, Xenophobia, Islamophobia and sexism. For years it has made fun of many serious social issues that exists in the world, whilst making millions of dollars. We need to call them out for this Bulls***.""

Another commenter ranted, ""Creating a culture of hate is terrorism. STOP NORMALIZING RACISM AS FREE SPEECH! Racism is NOT free speech. ITS HATE SPEECH AND TERRORISM! It's only white people I see defending racism under free speech and blatantly racist publications like Charlie Hebdo.""

Another said the cartoon was ""absolutely disgusting.""

One person said, ""I feel sick"" after seeing the Charlie Hebdo cover.

Some people were so enraged by the cartoon that they referred to and attempted to justify the 2015 massacre that happened at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris that killed 17 and injured 11 others. Radical Islamic terrorists slaughtered the employees of the newspaper because of a satirical image of the Prophet Mohammed.

There were a few commenters who defended Charlie Hebdo's cover as free speech.

One commenter said, ""I remember when people were defending Charlie Hebdo after people their were murdered for free speech.""

""Charlie Hebdo has more than earned the right to say what it likes in the way it likes, and through the blood of their staff remains the rights of ourselves to freely criticize them in turn. But not to shut them down or shut them up. If you don't like it, don't RT it,"" one person wrote on Twitter.

Chilling threat promising terrorist attack on US Capitol to avenge death of Iran's Soleimani made to air traffic controllers,"Federal officials are investigating a chilling threat made on air traffic control radio waves two days ago, which promised revenge for the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran's top terrorism architect who was killed one year ago in an airstrike authorized by President Donald Trump.

Air traffic controllers working airspace over New York heard the threat on Monday, CBS News reported.

""We are flying a plane into the Capitol on Wednesday. Soleimani will be avenged,"" the unidentified person said on the aviation frequency.

The threat came on the one-year anniversary of Soleimani's death, whom Iranian officials have repeatedly vowed to avenge.

More from The Hill:

The possibility of retaliation from Iran to mark the anniversary has been a major concern for the U.S. In the immediate aftermath of the killing, Iran launched an attack on a Baghdad airbase housing U.S. troops, killing none but injuring several.



This week, Iran called on the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) to issue a ""red notice"" for Trump's arrest in connection with Soleimani's killing. The international agency's general secretariat told NPR it is ""strictly forbidden for the Organization to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character"" and that it will not act on Iran's request.

Perhaps not coincidentally, the threat promised an attack Wednesday at the Capitol, the same time and location where chaos is unfolding over Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.

Is the threat credible?

Fortunately, government officials do not believe the threat was credible, although senior national security officials were briefed about the threat, Fox News reported.

What is more concerning about the incident, officials said, was the fact that someone was able to breach the highly secured communication lines between pilots and air traffic controllers than ensure planes are able to operate safely.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chilling-threat-promising-terrorist-attack-on-us-capitol-to-avenge-death-of-irans-soleimani,2021-01-06
China pulls BBC World News off the air permanently for reports on mishandling of the coronavirus and Uighur genocide,"China's main broadcasting regulator announced Thursday that it is pulling BBC World News off the air across the communist nation for ""serious content violation,"" the country's state-run Xinhua News reported.

The National Radio and Television Administration declared that BBC World News had ""seriously violated"" the Hermit Kingdom's radio, television, and overseas satellite management regulations in some of its reports on China-related issues, Xinhua said.

The BBC World News reports violated ""requirements that news reporting must be true and impartial"" and also ""undermined China's national interests and ethnic solidarity,"" according to the outlet.

""As the channel fails to meet the requirements to broadcast in China as an overseas channel, BBC World News is not allowed to continue its service within Chinese territory,"" the regulator said in a statement. ""The NRTA will not accept the channel's broadcast application for the new year.""

The ban comes in the wake of reports from the outlet on topics that made the communist leaders in Beijing look bad — specifically the Uighur genocide and coronavirus failures, BBC World News host Yalda Hakim wrote on Twitter.

The BBC has repeatedly reported on the ongoing genocide of ethic Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. Most recently, the outlet exposed allegations of systematic rape, sexual abuse, and torture of Uighur women in Chinese internment camps.



According to the BBC, ""more than a million men and women have been detained in the sprawling network of camps, which China says exist for the 're-education' of the Uighurs and other minorities.""

China's President Xi Jinping reportedly told local Xinjiang officials to crack down on the minority groups following a 2014 terror attack by Uighur separatists:

According to documents leaked to the New York Times, [Xi] directed local officials to respond with ""absolutely no mercy"". The US government said last month that China's actions since amounted to a genocide. China says reports of mass detention and forced sterilisation are ""lies and absurd allegations"".

China is also upset over BBC reports on the government's failed handling of the coronavirus. For example, a story in late January looked at Beijing's failures during ""five critical days early in the outbreak"":

A year ago, the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand officials had maintained that the outbreak was under control — just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact the virus had been spreading throughout the city and around China.

The BBC responded to China's ban in a statement to Variety: ""We are disappointed that the Chinese authorities have decided to take this course of action. The BBC is the world's most trusted international news broadcaster and reports on stories from around the world fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.""

China's move comes one week after the U.K.'s own media regulator, Ofcom, determined that Chinese state broadcaster CCTV's English-language service CGTN is controlled by the Communist Party and canceled the outlet's broadcast license for violating its license agreements, Variety reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-pulls-bbc-world-news-off-the-air,2021-02-11
China began stockpiling PPE months before COVID-19 outbreak,"China began stockpiling personal protective equipment (PPE) months before the COVID-19 outbreak, according to former and current U.S. government officials.

The damning accusations stem from an analysis conducted by Dr. Tom McGinn and Col. John T. Hoffman.

McGinn is a Senior Health Advisor at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Hoffman is a Senior Research Fellow at the Food Protection and Defense Institute (FPDI) – a U.S. Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence at the University of Minnesota. Hoffman also served in the U.S. Army – where he specialized in anti-terrorism and developing ways to protect military supply chain systems from attacks. Hoffman was also an advisor to the U.S. Department of Justice.

McGinn and Hoffman didn't believe the narrative that the COVID-19 outbreak emerged from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market – better known as the Wuhan wet market.

The duo examined a Customs and Border Protection database that tracks goods entering the United States. They discovered that China began piling up PPE way before China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the outbreak on Dec. 31, 2019.

""You can go and look about three years back [at import data],"" Hoffman told the Telegraph. ""This is not the normal up and down that occurs.""



McGinn and Hoffman presented their findings to the Department of Homeland Security's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. However, the government agency passed on an investigation, claiming that the information reflected typical PPE supply fluctuations.

Believing that they were on the verge of uncovering a potential narrative-buster, Hoffman then contacted HCA Healthcare – the largest health system in the United States that operates 211 hospitals and around 2,000 clinics. HCA Healthcare stated that the pattern was highly unusual.

An HCA Healthcare representative revealed that surgical gowns and drapes were in such short supply in late September 2019 that the medical necessities were on backorder.

Hoffman said, ""I asked HCA folks if this had happened anytime recently. The answer was no — they could not remember ever seeing so much of this stuff on back order.""

The Telegraph reported, ""PPE exports to the U.S. fell by around 50 percent between August and September of 2019, in a significant drop which raised alarm bells at key U.S. government agencies. China also started to buy up global PPE stocks in Europe, Australia, and the U.S. around the same time, experts said.""

David Asher – a former State Department official who investigated nuclear biological and chemical weapons proliferation and development issues – declared that the Chinese government was snatching up PPE supplies.

Asher told the Telegraph, ""It was a persistent uptick [of Chinese purchasing]. And it was significant enough that my colleagues at DHS heard about it from American companies that manufacture PPE, and most importantly from U.S. hospitals reporting they weren’t able to get the normal supply of masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles.""

The report added that China – the biggest manufacturer of PPE in the world – started ""severely restricting"" the export of medical gowns and masks months before the COVID-19 outbreak.

Chip Roy explodes at DHS secretary over border crisis: 'You're ignoring the actual truth',"Texas Congressman Chip Roy unloaded on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Thursday, accusing the secretary of failing his duties to uphold the law and maintain ""operational control"" of the southern border.

Roy, a border state Republican, is part of a group of lawmakers planning to impeach Mayorkas should the GOP regain the House majority after the midterm elections. When the secretary testified before the House Homeland Security Committee Thursday, Roy pressed him to state, under oath, whether the U.S. has ""operational control"" of the southern border in accordance with federal law.

""Yes, we do,"" Mayorkas answered.

But an incredulous Roy read the statutory definition of ""operational control,"" which according to the Secure Fence Act of 2006 means, ""the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""

He also read from federal law that says any alien making an asylum claim with a ""credible fear of persecution ... shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum.""

Roy asked if migrants making asylum claims are currently being detained as required by federal law, and Mayorkas said they are not.

""As a matter of fact congressman, that is an issue that is before the United States Supreme Court,"" the secretary said, but again Roy interrupted him.

""The fact of the matter is our law says they should be detained and your agency is releasing people on purpose in order to flood the zone and make sure that more people can come to the United States,"" Roy charged.

""Congressman, are you actually interested in the facts and the law?"" Mayorkas asked after Roy berated DHS for the department's catch-and-release policy.

""I'm reading you the law and I'm actually talking to you about the facts about who's entering this country,"" Roy said, while Mayorkas shook his head, looking resigned.

As Roy continued, a Democratic congresswoman asked if the secretary would be permitted to answer his questions and committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.J.) attempted to tell Roy his time was up, but the Republican from San-Antonio was not finished.

He held up pictures showing the cost in human life brought by the U.S. government failing to secure the border, including a mobile morgue carrying 27 dead bodies, more dead bodies discovered by Texas ranchers living near the border, a little girl who was branded by human traffickers, and photos of Americans who died from overdoses from fentanyl smuggled into the country by transnational drug cartels.

Yelling, Roy asserted that DHS policies were ""encouraging cartels, encouraging people to come here, harming Texans, and harming this country.""

""You know it!"" he thundered, pointing a finger at Mayorkas. ""And you're ignoring the actual truth!""

""The time for the gentlemen has expired, he no longer has time to slander the secretary,"" Nadler interjected, which prompted an angry reaction from Roy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chip-roy-explodes-at-dhs-secretary-over-border-crisis-you-re-ignoring-the-actual-truth,2022-04-28
"Chris Cuomo blasts those who put 'Christian' first in Twitter bios, says they 'tend to be the nastiest people I encounter here'","After mocking Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio for his Christian faith, saying on Monday that ""Mr. Bible Boy"" has a ""Bible quote for every moment,"" CNN anchor Chris Cuomo doubled down on his disdain for those who profess their Christianity on Twitter.

What are the details?

""People who put 'Christian' first in their bio tend to be the nastiest people I encounter here,"" Cuomo tweeted early Wednesday morning. ""I don't give a pass for being a member of my religion...no one gets a pass.""

Cuomo's comment was in response to a Twitter user who told him — presumably in reaction to his attack on Rubio — ""I use [sic] to like you, but now I will pray for you. You better get right with God instead of bad mouthing a Christian.""

How did folks react?

Cuomo's newest attack has elicited plenty of responses on Twitter, and it appears the vast majority of users agree with him — and are adding their own barbs:

""Yep. Raised Catholic, and I walked away from that because of the constant cruelty and hypocrisy everywhere I looked. I'm a Christian but I don't feel the need to scream it from the rooftops,"" one person commented. ""If you're a true Christian other people will see that in how you treat them.""

""I tend to respect God and Christianity, but the fundamental thinkers, the alt right idiots, and the ultra evangelicals have to go,"" another user declared. ""I've met Catholics who believe all Protestants are damned. What? Of all the good people, the crazy ultra religious types aren't it.""

""I agree,"" another commenter said. ""The worst things that have been said to me (you're Satan. You should happy we had slavery, otherwise you'd be crawling around on all 4s in Africa. Go back to where you come from) have all been from 'Christians.'""

""People who are screaming they are Christian are most likely to be less tolerant to others ... they don't want gay people to marry or have kids, they don't want mothers to have an abortion, they don't like other religions,"" another user said. ""But those are the screamers, not the Christians.""

But not every commenter agreed with Cuomo:

""Serious question, what traits do you exhibit that could possibly make someone believe (even you) that you're a Christian?"" another user asked Cuomo. ""Abortion supporter, foul-mouthed, egotistical, liar, etc.?""

""If you were a Christian guy you wouldn't act the way you do. So why are people surprised with anything you do,"" another commenter said. ""You get a pass for being a hateful bitch. You are a big problem and someone needs to put you in check. Maybe it will be the big guy up stairs. Hopefully. God Speed.""

Not the first time

Cuomo has invoked his views on Christianity to advance his points in the past. A little over a year ago, Cuomo said those who call themselves Christians can't support the ""ugliness"" the President Donald Trump ""spits out.""

But believe it or not, after the 2015 San Bernardino mass killing — which was tied to Islamic terror — Cuomo appeared to defend Christians: ""Are all Muslims bad when Muslims do something bad? No. But at the same time, when you analogize it to — you know, a guy who might be a Christian and does something, you don't see Christians killing in the name of Christianity the way you do with Muslims right now. And it feeds a lot of the phobia, and it's something that requires discussion and time and context. And that's in short supply when people are angry.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-cuomo-blasts-christian-twitter-bios,2021-01-06
MSNBC's Chris Hayes gets torched for suggesting the US turn to Iran for help to relieve gas crisis,"MSNBC host Chris Hayes got lambasted on social media for suggesting that the U.S. alleviate the skyrocketing price of gas by turning to the Iranian regime for help.

Hayes linked to a proposal to buy gas from Iran in response to increased prices as caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as from growing inflation.

""If you’re a) devoted to cutting off Russia’s oil revenues and b) worried about inflation and spiking oil prices, this is one possible solution…,"" Hayes Tweeted.

Critics excoriated Hayes and the suggestion to seek oil from one murderous regime in response to the military aggression of another murderous regime.

""Actually, giving billions to American-murdering terrorists is a really bad idea,"" responded Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

""Oh great, give our money to Iran instead of Russia. Much better than revamping domestic production,"" read one popular tweet.

""Maybe start producing more of our own oil and gas? You know, like we were doing until Joe happened?"" said another critic.

""Or, you know, we could just let Americans make lots of money producing it domestically instead of funding a terror state,"" another user offered sarcastically.

""Buying oil from Russia and Iran after cutting our own supplies is the act of an imbecile or a traitor. There is no logic to any Democrat environmental idea,"" responded another detractor.

""Funding terror to end terror?"" asked Ian Haworth.

Others pointed out that Hayes had been against the Keystone XL pipeline in 2014, which could have relieved some of the lack of oil supply.

The Biden administration had blamed inflation on everything from supply chain issues related to the pandemic to the ""greed"" of ""meat conglomerates."" The pain of high inflation has been cited among the many causes of the very low favorability rating for President Joe Biden ahead of the midterm elections.

Chris Wallace says Biden's presidency won't survive a terror attack on the homeland launched from Afghanistan,"Fox News' Chris Wallace opined that President Joe Biden could come back from the lethal terror attack on Thursday but his presidency won't survive an attack on the homeland launched from Afghanistan.

Wallace made the comments Friday on ""America's Newsroom"" on Fox News with Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino.

""It's terrible, and this is the one thing that the administration, even in the mess of the evacuations and the way that this has all played out, was hoping against hope that they would be able to pull it off the evacuations,"" explained Wallace.



""And they've gotten a hundred thousand people, Americans and Afghan allies, and foreign nationals out of the country,"" he added, ""they were hoping against hope they were going to be able to do this without the loss of any American lives, and of course, yesterday that hope was dashed when 12 American troops were killed.""

Wallace said that the attack had weakened the ability of the U.S. to deal with the threat from various terrorist groups.

""We are so diminished in our ability to deal with all the jihadists that are going to come into that part of the world, into Afghanistan, and that's going to raise real questions,"" he continued.

""As bad as yesterday was, the president can come back from that, but if there is an attack on the U.S. Homeland from Afghanistan after the withdrawal of all of our troops, that could be curtains for the Biden presidency,"" Wallace concluded.

The ongoing disaster in Afghanistan has hit Biden squarely in the polls, where his favorability has fallen precipitously from above 50% to 41%. Vice President Kamala Harris, who would replace Biden if he stepped down, hasn't fared much better — in a recent poll a majority of Americans said she was not fit to become president.

On Friday an official with the State Department told USA Today that they were in contact with about 600 Americans trying to evacuate Afghanistan safely.

CNN's Christiane Amanpour blasted for comparing Trump's term to Nazis' Kristallnacht: 'Disgusting',"CNN International anchor Christiane Amanpour compared President Donald Trump's four years in office to the Nazis' Kristallnacht. After Amanpour made the comparison of President Trump's first term to the campaign of terror against Jewish people in 1938, the CNN International segment from Thursday was characterized as ""despicable"" and ""disgusting.""

""This week 82 years ago, Kristallnacht happened,"" Amanpour said on her interview TV show. ""It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity and, in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history and truth.

""After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to normal,"" she said as images of wrecked storefronts and a book burning were displayed on her show ""Amanpour."" ""And every day Joe Biden makes presidential announcements about good governance and the health and security of the American people, while the great, brooding figure of his defeated opponent rages, conducting purges of perceived enemies and preventing a transition.""

Kristallnacht, the ""Night of Broken Glass,"" was the two-day onslaught on Jews in Germany that began on the night of Nov. 9, 1938. ""Over 250 synagogues were burned, over 7,000 Jewish businesses were trashed and looted, dozens of Jewish people were killed, and Jewish cemeteries, hospitals, schools, and homes were looted while police and fire brigades stood by,"" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.



""The morning after the pogroms 30,000 German Jewish men were arrested for the 'crime' of being Jewish and sent to concentration camps, where hundreds of them perished. Some Jewish women were also arrested and sent to local jails. Businesses owned by Jews were not allowed to reopen unless they were managed by non-Jews. Curfews were placed on Jews, limiting the hours of the day they could leave their homes.""

There was a wave of backlash against Amanpour on Twitter.

StopAntisemitism.org reacted to the segment by saying, ""Hey @CNN@camanpour please stop using the horrors of the Holocaust to justify an agenda. Our suffering is not yours to play political ping pong with.""



StopAntisemitism.org is a self-described organization ""that works to hold antisemites accountable and to create consequences for their bigoted actions by exposing the threat that they present to all Americans and showing how their ideologies conflict with American values, morals, and principles.""

The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council called Amanpour's comparison ""despicable.""

""@camanpour compares verbal fact checking of a POTUS to a Nazi pogrom in which dozens of Jews were murdered. Amanpour uses the book burning of Kristallnacht to reach this comparison thus ignoring the overall deadliness and human cost of the night,"" the Council tweeted.

""This is not the 'typical' comparison of a political figure to Hitler or Nazism which is sadly done too often. @camanpour took a verbal fact checking thing about a politician and compared it to a specific violent and deadly event (Kristallnacht) by the Nazis.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said, ""A glimpse of what so many of the people who control large corporations, the media and Hollywood really think. That the over 72 million Americans who voted for Trump are supporters of the modern day equivalent of Nazi's.""

Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, wrote, ""DISGUSTING demeaning of the Holocaust by ⁦@camanpour⁩, ⁦@CNN. How far the left goes to wrongfully attack ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ is depraved. Will ⁦@cnn do the right thing?""

Sohrab Ahmari, New York Post opinion editor, replied, ""@camanpour: I'm ashamed to have to count you an Iranian compatriot. This is a grotesque abuse of history, a horrific, ahistorical equivalence-drawing, a shameful cheapening of the Shoah.""

Richochet editor Bethany Mandel told Fox News, ""It's disgusting, though not surprising, that a major media figure would use dead Jews as a way to make a cheap political point.



""It is something progressives have done for a long time, disgracing the memory of those who have passed in the Holocaust in order to make a false accusation against the United States president,"" Mandel continued. ""It seems the only time many people care about anti-Semitism is when they can use it to their political advantage.""

Last week, Amanpour compared Trump to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by saying, ""A reflection on President Trump's comments last night: The last President I covered who refused to accept the vote count in an election was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran, 2009.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-amanpour-trump-nazis-kristallnacht-reactions,2020-11-13
CNN analyst says Trump is the 'leader of a terrorist organization',"A CNN national security analyst on Tuesday called President Donald Trump the ""leader of a terrorist organization,"" calling for the ""complete isolation"" of a president 74 million Americans voted for in the 2020 election.

Juliette Kayyem, a lecturer at Harvard University and former member of the Obama administration's Homeland Security Advisory Council, appeared on a CNN panel with Jim Sciutto and Poppy Harlow, during which she made the case that Trump is the ""spiritual"" and ""operational"" leader of a ""domestic terrorism effort.""

""Trump is the spiritual, but I will also say operational leader of this domestic terrorism effort. He tells them where to go. He tells them what to do. He tells them why they're angry,"" Kayyem charged.

She argued that the United States government needs to begin a counterterrorism effort against elements of the president's supporters who participated in the violent riots at the Capitol building Jan. 6, during which five people died, and that such an effort requires going after Trump first.

""And so we need to start at the top, like any counterterrorism effort, which is total isolation of the president of the United States. Impeachment, yes. 25th Amendment, yes. Deplatforming, yes. All of the above. No money. No access to campaign funds,"" Kayyem said.

She called for Trump's ""complete isolation"" because Trump, ""as the leader of a terrorist organization,"" will have a more difficult time recruiting followers if he is ""viewed as a loser.""

""He's going to have his radical elements. We will arrest them, we will isolate them. But what we have to make sure is that Donald Trump does not have a second act. I know I sound incredibly harsh right now calling the president this, but we are in the tactical response right now. Enough with the 'let's unity' and stuff, this is a tactical effort right now to make sure that we protect American citizens and, of course, the next president of the United States.""

Kayyem laid out her argument in more detail in a column published by the Atlantic Tuesday in which she accused the president of being a ""rallying point for a coalition of theocrats, internet fantasists, white supremacists, and various other authoritarians who are in no way committed to peaceful transitions of power.""

""The way to unite this country is to isolate acts of violence—and a leader who incites it—from legitimate expression,"" Kayyem wrote. ""Trump was a north star for a certain kind of radical. Americans will be safer the more that star loses its shine.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-analyst-trump-leader-terrorist-organization,2021-01-12
CNN anchor backtracks from Trump-Nazi comparison after being called out by Israeli government,"CNN International anchor Christiane Amanpour was blasted last week after she compared President Donald Trump's presidency to the reign of terror that Nazi Germany unleashed on Jews in November 1938, infamously remembered by history as ""Kristallnacht.""

Now, the CNN personality is backtracking.

What did Amanpour say?

Amanpour made her shocking comparison while celebrating Joe Biden's media-declared victory over Trump in the election.

""This week 82 years ago, Kristallnacht happened,"" Amanpour said on her CNN show. ""It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity and, in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history and truth.

""After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to normal,"" she added.

As TheBlaze reported, Amanpour was widely condemned by Jews, politicians, and media figures for offensive comparison.

Even the Israeli government demanded that Amanpour apologize.

Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Omer Yankelevitch said in a letter to CNN, ""Using the memory of the Holocaust for cheap headlines or a political agenda is concerning and distorts the historical and moral truth.""

""Distortion and minimization of the Holocaust are deplorable lies that only encourage the evil voices of anti-Semitism. Employing the memory of the Holocaust for cheap shock value and to further a political agenda is a deeply troubling and offensive spin of historic and moral truths with dangerous implications,"" Yankelevitch added.

What is Amanpour saying now?

On her show Monday, Amanpour expressed regret over her comments, but did not offer an apology outright.

""And finally tonight, a comment on my program at the end of last week. I observed the 82nd anniversary of Kristallnacht, as I often do — it is the event that began the horrors of the Holocaust. I also noted President Trump's attacks on history, facts, knowledge, and truth,"" Amanpour said.

""I should not have juxtaposed the two thoughts,"" she continued. ""Hitler and his evils stand alone, of course, in history.""

""I regret any pain my statement may have caused,"" she added. ""My point was to say how democracy can potentially slip away and how we must always zealously guard our democratic values.""

Anything else?

The comparison triggered anger because, as the U.S. Holocaust Museum explains, ""Kristallnacht was a turning point in the history of the Third Reich, marking the shift from antisemitic rhetoric and legislation to the violent, aggressive anti-Jewish measures that would culminate with the Holocaust.""

"'Next week on 'The Masked Singer,' Harvey Weinstein': CNN anchor objects to the reported inclusion of Rudy Giuliani on celebrity singing show","CNN anchor John Berman expressed disapproval about the news that the Fox television show ""The Masked Singer"" reportedly included Rudy Giuliani in the celebrity lineup of its upcoming season.

Berman appeared to draw a parallel between Giuliani, who reportedly took part in a yet-to-be aired season of the show, and two other individuals: Harvey Weinstein, a disgraced Hollywood figure who has been convicted of sexual offenses, and Manuel Noriega, a deceased former Panamanian dictator.

The anchor said, ""next week on 'The Masked Singer,' Harvey Weinstein. The week after that, Manuel Noriega. Great job guys. Great job. I hope the viewers that you're attracting here are worth it to you.""

Berman then read a tweet from Michael Schur, who he said was a friend. Schur wrote that, ""The bare minimum — the absolute bottom-level for the bar we set as a society — must be: if you try to launch a coup and overturn a Presidential election, you are no longer allowed on game shows.""

Berman opined, ""I know everyone gets a chuckle outta this, but ... we can all do better than that.""

""The Masked Singer"" features a lineup of celebrities who compete in a singing competition while wearing costumes that disguise their true identity. The show includes a panel of judges who try to guess the identity of each contestant.

According to Deadline, when Giuliani was unmasked during a taping of the show, judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke departed from the stage in protest, though they later came back. The outlet said that judges Jenny McCarthy and Nicole Scherzinger stayed onstage and spoke to the contestant.

CNN reporter explains how polling is 'underestimating' Republican strength ahead of 2022 midterm elections,"Polls surveying voters ahead of the 2022 midterm elections are likely ""underestimating"" the strengths of Republicans, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten explained on Wednesday.

What are the details?

Heading into summer, polls showed Republicans with a significant lead over Democrats on the generic ballot, suggesting a ""red wave"" would hit the U.S. in November.

Recent polling, however, shows that lead shrinking.

But according to Enten, Republicans historically outperform what their July polling indicates. That means when all the votes have been counted, Republicans may still win the midterm elections in dominating fashion.

""If we were in fact to say, 'OK, we think it's underestimating one side,' I would think it would be underestimating Republicans,"" Enten admitted on CNN Wednesday.

""Here's why: Take a look at the July 27 House polling versus the November national vote, in midterm cycles where there's a Democratic president, we'll go back since 1994, right? And what we see generally we see some blue here, some Democratic leads in 2014, 1994, a tie back in 1998, Republicans +3,"" Enten showed.

""Then look at the November result, in each of these years, the Republicans outperformed their July polling in the November result, and the average shift from the July polling to the November result: an average shift of +6 points to Republicans,"" he explained.

So why the discrepancy? According to Enten, it boils down to registered voters compared to voters who actually turn out on Election Day.

""If we look at every single election since 1978 with a Democratic president, there has been a shift in the party ID margin,"" Enten explained. ""More Republicans turnout on Election Day compared to what the actual registered voters are in midterm elections when there's a Democratic president.""

What about Democrats?

Given the position of Republicans, anchor Jake Tapper asked Enten whether Democrats ""should be looking at November in sheer terror.""

""I would not be a big fan of what's going to happen in November if I were a Democrat,"" Enten responded, explaining the party in control of the White House historically loses in the midterms except when the president has high job approval ratings.

And unfortunately for Democrats, President Joe Biden's approval rating remains significantly underwater.

According to the FiveThirtyEight average of polls, 55.7% of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance while only 39.2% approve.

Even Democrats seem to want a new leader. A new CNN poll released this week showed that a whopping 75% of Democratic voters want a different presidential nominee in 2024.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-enten-midterm-polling-underestimating-republicans,2022-07-28
CNN interviewed top ISIS-K commander who made brazen threat two weeks before terror attack at Kabul airport,"Two weeks before ISIS-K launched an attack outside the Kabul airport, CNN's chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, spoke with a senior ISIS-K commander who allegedly promised to ""restart operations"" after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.

Tragically, that threat became reality on Thursday when ISIS-K launched an attack outside the Kabul airport where evacuation operations were ongoing. That attack killed 13 United States service members and more than 160 Afghanistan civilians.

What are the details?

The interview was conducted just days before Kabul fell to the Taliban several weeks ago. According to Ward, ISIS-K was already in the city, ""lying low and waiting for its moment to strike — words that turned out to be eerily prophetic.""

The commander, whose real identity was masked but was called Abdul Munir, is from Kunar Province in east Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan. Speaking with Ward from a Kabul hotel, the commander said he and his men used to fight for the Taliban, but joined the Islamic State because they believed the Taliban was not implementing pure Sharia law.



The commander explained ISIS-K was exploiting the Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan by engaging in a large-scale recruitment drive, and promised to ""restart operations"" once the takeover was complete.

""That moment has now come, as the world saw all too clearly on Thursday,"" Ward said in the video.

Now that ISIS-K ""operations"" have been restarted, Ward explained the goal of ISIS-K is to ""undermine"" the Taliban. By launching attacks, the terrorist group is doing just that, eroding the allusion that a Taliban government can guarantee security.

Anything else?

The U.S. military conducted a strike on Friday against the ISIS-K terrorist purportedly responsible for planning the attack outside the Kabul airport.

""U.S. military forces conducted an over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation today against an ISIS-K planner,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban, USN, said in a statement. ""The unmanned airstrike occurred in the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan. Initial indications are that we killed the target. We know of no civilian casualties.""

Shockingly, State Department spokesman John Kirby admitted Friday the Taliban released ""thousands"" of ISIS-K terrorist from Afghanistan prisons.

During a press briefing, Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin asked, ""How many ISIS-K prisoners were left at Bagram and believed to have been released from the prison there and why weren't they removed before the U.S. pulled out to some place like Gitmo?""

""Well, I don't know the exact number. Clearly, it's in the thousands when you considered both prisons,"" Kirby responded. ""Because both of them were taken over by the Taliban and emptied.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-interview-isis-k-commander-promised-attack,2021-08-28
CNN launches personal attack at Kirstie Alley after she criticizes their reporting — and she fires back,"Kirstie Alley took to Twitter Friday to voice criticism of CNN's reporting, and the network's communications account fired back with a personal attack on the actress that sparked strong reactions. But Alley hit right back.

What are the details?

""I now Know why my personal friends who walk around in SHEER TERROR of contracting Covid are simply CNN viewers!"" Alley wrote. ""I decided to watch CNN myself to get a their viewpoint and oh my God DID I EVER!!!! IF YOU TOO WANT TO LIVE IN TERROR WATCH CNN!! FEAR OF DYING IS THEIR MANTRA! OMG!""

CNN Communications replied, ""Kirstie, you are welcome to change the channel - just like countless viewers did every time 'Veronica's Closet' came on TV. But don't downplay the loss of nearly 230K American lives. And please, wear a mask.""

The CNN public relations team was referring to a show Alley starred in in the late '90s. The actress, who supports President Donald Trump for reelection, then slammed the cable network for turning a blind eye to stories that might damage Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

""If only you paid as much attention to Joe Biden's alleged corrupt business dealings as a TV show that was rated top ten in 1997,"" Alley responded. ""I guess you got that wrong too.""

Some on social media joined CNN in accusing Alley of downplaying the coronavirus, which she denied, explaining, ""Don't misinterpret my objection to CHRONIC FEAR MONGERING,WITH ZERO NEW SOLUTIONS TO AVOID THE PLAGUE, as non empathetic. That's a lie spread by Democrats who want to twist my words & make me seem unsympathetic. Chronic FEAR mongering doesn't help ANYONE physically or mentally.""

'This is some grade-A juvenile stuff here.'

Others slammed CNN for the way the outlet responded to Alley.

Newsbusters managing editor Curtis Houck wrote, ""This is some grade-A juvenile stuff here, CNN. But this is also very on-brand of you. No class. No ethics. It's all a game.""

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) also weighed in with a burn on CNN, tweeting, ""Veronica's Closet had 35 million initial viewers. About 10 million more than the Mueller testimony. It ended its third season with 8 million viewers, down for sure. But still about 8x the viewership of CNN's top-rated show.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-launches-personal-attack-at-kirstie-alley-after-she-criticizes-their-reporting-and-she-fires-back,2020-10-31
Twitter reactions to CNN blaming car for Waukesha attack,"CNN was thrashed so severely on social media for deceptively blaming a car for the Waukesha Christmas parade massacre instead of the repeat felon that the outlet was forced to walk back its misleading headline.

Exactly a week after the tragedy in Waukesha, CNN duplicitously insinuated that a car was the cause of six deaths and 62 people being injured, including 18 children. The corporate media outlet crafted a tweet that read: ""Waukesha will hold a moment of silence today, marking one week since a car drove through a city Christmas parade, killing six people and injuring scores of others.""

In the actual article, CNN waited until the final paragraph to mention Darrell Brooks the suspect charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide. A sixth count is likely after an 8-year-old died from his injuries on Tuesday.

Commentators obliterated CNN for deceptively blaming a car for the massacre during Waukesha's 58th annual Christmas Parade.

BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey: ""A car did it.""

Former Navy SEAL Robert J. O'Neill: ""Oh snap… the car drove itself?""

New York Post writer Jon Levine: ""Has this car been arrested yet?""

Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon: ""We need answers from the manufacturer of this car. And we need laws that permit us to charge vehicles with a crime.""

Former New York Times writer Nellie Bowles: ""Someone (Joe Rogan?) is radicalizing cars.""

Outkick founder Clay Travis: ""Did the car have a driver @cnn? The amount of media covering for the murderer here is embarrassing.""

California congressional candidate Buzz Patterson: ""A 'car' did this? Not a human being with intent to kill and maim and being held on $5 million bail? You guys are a joke.""

Florida political candidate Martha Bueno: ""You all know @CNN is a political hack, but seriously, a 'CAR DROVE THROUGH A PARADE?!' Who writes for CNN? Obviously it's someone who's scared to call the murder of 6 what it really is: An act of domestic terrorism. Please hire actual journalists CNN.""

Former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright: ""It's been a week since the #WaukeshaMassacre. CNN framed it this way, with a car taking the blame.""

The Daily Wire writer Cabot Phillips: ""CNN wants you to think this massacre was committed by a driverless car because the race of the driver doesn't fit their narrative.""

Townhall writer Gabriella Hoffman: ""'A car plowed through the Farmers Market.' 'A car plowed through the Christmas Parade.' What's old is new again on covering mass ramming attacks. Who operates a car? A DRIVER. Obfuscating this fact is criminal. Huge disservice by media with this shoddy reporting.""

Sen. Ted Cruz's communication adviser, Steve Guest: ""Give me a break CNN. 'A car drove through a city Christmas parade.' The headline was written like this for a reason.""

Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza: ""Not a 'black leftist who supports BLM and vilifies white people.' No, this CNN headline insists it was the 'car' that drove through the parade. Now imagine how CNN would frame this if the perpetrator happened to be white.""

Photojournalist Ford Fischer: ""These sorts of headlines are where distrust of mainstream media come from. A car didn't kill six people, a person did. They used a car to do it. People commit actions. Tools are just tools.""

Radio host Buck Sexton: ""It was intentional, brutal mass murder of children and the elderly during a Christmas parade, and the only plausible motive for the suspect based on his online postings is anti-white bigotry in the aftermath of the Rittenhouse verdict But CNN headline is 'a car drove through.'""

Commentator Mike Mike Cernovich: ""They know what they are doing, they don't care, they are evil.""

Podcast host Gerry Callahan: ""I think the car was upset that the rifle got acquitted in Kenosha.""

CNN was trashed so unmercifully on Twitter that the outlet changed its headline to: ""Waukesha will hold a moment of silence Sunday, one week after a man plowed a vehicle through a Christmas parade.""

This is the second legacy media outlet to run with the deceitful narrative that a car was to blame for the Waukesha Christmas parade attack despite fully knowing that ex-convict Darrell Brooks was the suspect and was criminally charged for the deaths.

On Thursday, the Washington Post ran a headline that read: ""Here's what we know so far on the sequence of events that led to the Waukesha tragedy caused by a SUV.""

That deceptive headline was also hammered for not telling the entire story. The Washington Post deleted the headline, and changed it to: ""What we know so far on the sequence of events that led to the Waukesha tragedy."" Once again the Washington Post made no mention of Darrell Brooks, the suspect who reportedly called for violence against white people before driving into the parade route and running over dozens of innocent people.

The Babylon Bee — a conservative satirical publication — lampooned legacy media outlets for blaming the massacre on a car by publishing an article with the headline: ""Waukesha SUV Charged With Six Counts Of Murder.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-waukesha-attack-car-reactions,2021-11-29
"College's basketball announcer fired after comparing opponents to Antifa: 'They might go to jail, but they get out right away.' And he refuses to apologize.","The play-by-play announcer for Montana State University women's basketball was fired after comparing players from Portland State University to ""Antifa after a riot,"" 406MTSports.com reported.

""They might go to jail, but they get out right away,"" Mark Martello broadcasted following what he believed was a lack of called fouls against Portland State in a late January game, the outlet said. ""They can get away with it.""

He also compared the city of Portland to the south side of Chicago, the outlet added.

What are the details?

Martello — who was calling the game for ESPN+ and LEARFIELD's Bobcat Sports Properties, Montana State's multimedia rights holder, the outlet said — offered commentary during the fourth quarter regarding Portland State center Rhema Ogele.

""Ogele, from Saint Ignatius College [Prep] in Chicago, which is south side. You've heard of [it],"" Martello said. ""Portland not much different, I don't think, these days.""

Montana State's Mark Martello compares Portland to South Side of Chicago youtu.be

The outlet said Martello added in a text with a laughing emoji that he's ""been to the south side, a lot. Portland looked worse when we were there last year.""

Later in the quarter, Martello complained there were no referee calls after a Montana State Bobcats player ""got fouled two or three times"" — and then lowered the Antifa boom.

""Evidently, 'Cats are up 19, Portland can get away with whatever they're going to get away with,"" Martello said. ""Portland's like Antifa after a riot. They might go to jail, but they get out right away. They can get away with it.""

Martello soon apologized: ""Uh-oh. I shouldn't say stuff like that. I'm sorry."" Montana State beat Portland State 71-56.

What happened next?

Joe Terry of Big Sky Valhalla tweeted about Martello's words the same day as the game — Jan. 22 — and also copied Leon Castillo, Montana State's director of athletics. On Jan. 23, Terry tweeted that he'd heard Martello had been fired.

Martello told 406mtsports.com that Tom Boman — LEARFIELD'S vice president of broadcast operations — fired him because of Terry's tweets.

But Martello wouldn't apologize.

""I am taking responsibility for what came out of my mouth,"" Martello soon texted to 406mtsports.com. ""I will miss the team and coaches. There will be no apology, no one was harmed.""

The outlet said he also texted that ""this is part of the world we live in, a big reason why I hate social media. Dumb thing to say maybe, but firing me represents MONTANA values? I think not. MSU promotes Portland values, in Montana. Kneeling is fine, political warm-ups are no problem, but some radio yahoo making wise cracks is a capital offense. Everything I said was true. I guess the truth hurts.""

After reaching out to Martello for comment, the Post Millennial said he replied with the following: ""As a taxpaying citizen of Montana, I am deeply offended that my tax money goes to institutions that defend terrorism. As a sportscaster, I say lighten up, it was a joke""



MSU in a press release said Martello ""has been removed from Montana State's radio broadcast team"" and that the decision was made by LEARFIELD. No reason was given in the press release. LEARFIELD and ESPN declined to comment, 406mtsport.com said.

However, the outlet said the Portland State athletic department provided a statement: ""That type of commentary has no place in the description of a college basketball game. The portrayal of Portland State was both inaccurate and inappropriate. We appreciate that Montana State acknowledges that as well.""

Apart from his now-defunct announcer gig, Martello is a realtor and the CFO of Z's Meze Market, a Mediterranean restaurant in Bozeman he co-founded, 406mtsport.com said.

College founded to 'promote the cause of Christ' defends hosting 'White Citizenship as Terrorism' event,"Berea College — a private liberal arts college in Kentucky that says it's ""still firmly rooted in its historic purpose,"" which is ""to promote the cause of Christ"" — is hosting an event next Wednesday titled, ""White Citizenship as Terrorism: Make America Great Again, Again.""



What are the details?

The event — sponsored by the Women's and Gender Non-Conforming Center at Berea — will feature a Zoom presentation from Amy Brandzel.

The latter notice regarding the event reads:

""Despite the calls for multiculturalism, the presentation and color-blindness, segments of white America mourn their so-called loss of privilege, consistently begging to return to the nostalgic past in which their esteemed value as white citizens went unquestioned. Trump's 'Make America Great Again' appears to follow suit by offering a seemingly benign promise to return America to a previously 'great' past. But the offer to 'Make America Great Again, Again,' requires we refocus on how the last four years of daily tweets and administrative actions redefine whiteness. If terrorism is defined as the use of violence and threats to create a state of fear towards [sic] particular communities and identities, then this is what 'Trumpism' is at its core. The talk offers to resuscitate Trumpism and white citizenship as forms of white terrorism enacted against the majority of people living within the borders of the U.S. and beyond.""

It wasn't immediately apparent that Berea College or the campus organization sponsoring the event described who Brandzel is, but the Federalist noted she's an assistant professor of women studies at the University of New Mexico and author of ""Against Citizenship: The Violence of the Normative.""

The outlet added that Brandzel's book proposes that ""citizenship is a violent dehumanizing mechanism that makes the comparative devaluing of human lives see,"" and that ""citizenship requires anti-intersectionality, that is, strategies that deny the mutuality and contingency of race, class, gender, sexuality and nation…""

Pushback and a defense

After word got out regarding the ""White Citizenship as Terrorism"" event and some pushback was felt, Berea College posted a statement defending the event. The school also quoted its motto — ""God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth"" — which is based on Acts 17:26:

""A planned event by the Women's and Gender Non-Conforming Center at Berea College has attracted a great deal of attention on social media, and resulted in several emails from concerned persons. To some, the provocative title of the event implies that Berea is not a welcoming place for individuals with differing political views. That is not true. At Berea, we strive to live out our motto: God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth. Berea accepts students of all faiths (or none at all), religious beliefs, ethnicities and political leanings, creating a diverse environment that encourages acceptance, respect and even appreciation across our differences.



""We encourage open dialog on difficult topics. Racism and white nationalism have been topics of great debate over the past five years. The event planned for next week seeks to confront aspects of the political spectrum that relate to the difficult topic of race in America. While that may cause discomfort, it is a valid and important conversation in this time of political and racial division. It is our hope that these types of conversations will occur across the country. Open, honest dialogue is essential to understanding racism and moving toward an anti-racist society.""

The Women's and Gender Non-Conforming Center issued a statement, as well:

""We are grateful to President Lyle Roelofs, Interim Provosts Scott Steele and Steve Gowler, Dean Matthew Saderholm, Associate Vice President for Marketing and Communications Kim Brown, and Director of Publications and Media Relations Abbie Darst for this statement in support of our Gender Talk next week about the white terrorism that claims to make America great again (again). Be sure to tune in!""

Anything else?

Berea College notes on its website that it was ""founded by ardent abolitionists and radical reformers"" and wants staff and students to ""work toward both personal goals and a vision of a world shaped by Christian values, such as the power of love over hate, human dignity and equality, and peace with justice.""

The school's website also stated that it ""stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and those peacefully demonstrating against police brutality across the country and around the world. As the first interracial and coeducational college in the slaveholding South in 1855, this moment calls for our support. Our history and our commitments demand it.""

Colorado mass killing suspect moved to new jail facility over threats to his safety,"Authorities have transferred Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, the suspected murderer charged with gunning down 10 people at a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket on Monday, to a new facility following threats to his safety.

What are the details?

According to the New York Post, Alissa, 21, remains in custody of the Boulder County Sheriff's Office but is being housed in a correctional facility outside the county after he was reportedly targeted with threats.

The suspect appeared in court Thursday morning. He faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. The outlet reported that Alissa, a Syrian native, will also face additional charges, which are undetermined at the time of this reporting. Prosecutors, according to the Post, will file ""additional charges"" in the coming weeks.

He did not enter a plea during the Thursday hearing.

""Defense attorneys requested evidence and a witness list from the prosecutors, and asked the judge for a three-month trial delay so they could look into 'Mr. Alissa's mental illness,'"" the outlet reported. ""Prosecutors said they have not yet received evidence from police, who are still processing the King Soopers grocery store crime scene.""

What else?

The Post on Friday revealed that Alissa passed a gun background check ahead of the massacre that took the lives of 10 people.

""A store where the suspect in the Colorado supermarket massacre bought his gun reportedly said the sale was lawful after he passed a background check,"" the outlet reported.

Alissa purchased a Ruger AR-556 at the Eagles Nest Armory in his hometown of Arvada on March 16.

The store's owner, John Mark Eagleton, said that he is ""shocked"" by what happened.

""We are absolutely shocked by what happened and our hearts are broken for the victims and families that are left behind,"" Eagleton said. ""Ensuring every sale that occurs at our shop is lawful has always been and will always remain the highest priority for our business.""

He added, “We have and will continue to fully cooperate with law enforcement as their investigation continues.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colorado-mass-killing-suspect-new-jail-threats,2021-03-26
Thousands of Colorado residents have no heat after 'intentional attack' on gas services,"Thousands of residents in Aspen, Colorado, are without heat after what authorities say was an ""intentional attack"" on local gas service.

According to a Tuesday report from ABC News, the temperature in Aspen is expected to fall to just 2 degrees Tuesday night.

What are the details?

Authorities say that the attack — ""coordinated acts of vandalism"" — took place Saturday night and impacted at least three area Black Hills Energy locations.

The outlet reported, ""At one of the targeted sites, police said they found the words 'Earth first' scrawled, and investigators were looking into whether the self-described 'radical environmental group' Earth First! was involved.""

As work crews continued to restore gas service across the city, authorities began handing out electric-powered space heaters to residents without heat service on Tuesday as a storm is expected to roll in this week and dump an additional eight inches of snow on the region.

Work crews were forced to visit each gas meter on an individual basis, manually turn them off, and relight pilot lights in order to restore services. It wasn't just homes impacted by the attack — authorities said that businesses including area hotels and restaurants were forced to close their doors following the apparent sabotage.

In a statement, Aspen Assistant Police Chief Bill Linn said that the vandals appear to have had ""some familiarity"" with the natural gas line system.

""They tampered with the flow lines,"" he revealed. ""They turned off gas lines.""

Linn — who is also working with the FBI as it investigates the attack — added that physical evidence recovered at the three scenes included footprints. The three locations did not have security cameras, Linn said.

What else?

About 3,500 customers were impacted by the outage. It remains unclear how long it will take crews to restore service to all customers.

In a statement, Pitkin County Commissioner Patti Clapper added, ""It's almost, to me, an act of terrorism. It's trying to destroy a mountain community at the height of the holiday season. This wasn't a national gas glitch. This was a purposeful act. Someone is looking to make a statement of some kind.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colorado-residents-no-heat-attack-on-gas-services,2020-12-29
SUNY campus invites convicted cop killer to speak; speaker encourages black students to use 'any means necessary' to 'ensure our survival',"Jalil Muntaqim — who was found guilty of murdering two New York City police officers in 1971 and served nearly 50 years in prison for the crime — was invited to and recently appeared at SUNY Brockport where he claimed that black Americans are facing a genocide like never before seen, Campus Reform reported on Thursday.

What are the details?

Muntaqim — who used to go by the name of Anthony Bottom and now refers to himself as a ""political prisoner"" — said that while he ""abhors violence,"" he ""loves self-preservation,"" and black students need to ""ensure our survival"" by ""any means necessary.""

""We take nothing off the table,"" he added.

According to the report, Muntaqim — who was once a member of both the Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army — said that he believes the United States intentionally ""creates conditions of poverty for black Americans so they will have to resort to crime and end up in jail to produce 'slave labor,' and advocated for the abolition of prisons.""

He added that all people are terrorized by white supremacy — including white people.

""If you're white, you're traumatized by white supremacy because you believe that you're better than anybody else on the planet,"" he reasoned.

WHAM-TV reported that Muntaqim did not once mention his murder convictions, and instead, told the audience that he was imprisoned for fighting white supremacy.

“The United States prison system is a slave system. Slave plantation, right? Let's call it just that,” Muntaqim in his remarks. ""The United States prison system is a slave plantation.”

His appearance sparked campus-wide protests featuring members of the New York State College Republicans, local politicians, and more. Supporters, however, insisted that Muntaqim had the same right to free speech as any other speaker at the school.

Muntaqim in 1971 went to prison after making a bogus 911 call to lure law enforcement officers to a site where they could be ambushed. He and others then shot one of the officers at least 22 times, killing him and another officer.

What else?

Campus Reform asked Muntaqim about his statements presented during the visit and stated that ""apparently you understood the [worst] of the message I wanted to convey.""

""I imagine like many right-wing pundits you are looking for some kind of score to make,"" he said. ""I am confident you will be able to find another controversy to exploit. Be kind to yourself and stay safe, a lot of right-wing nuts out there as you witness on 1/6/22.""

He added that the media was guilty of vilifying him because ""they don't want me to tell you about"" what he said is the history of America's white supremacy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/convicted-cop-killer-who-spent-nearly-50-years-in-prison-speaks-at-college-urges-students-to-take-any-means-necessary-approach-when-it-comes-to-surviving-as-a-black-american,2022-04-08
California cop busted for masturbating in home during disturbance call: Report,"Authorities say a California police officer was caught masturbating in a family's home after he arrived there for a domestic disturbance call.

He was placed on administrative leave following his arrest, according to various reports.

What are the details?

According to KNTV-TV, former San Jose Officer Matthew Dominguez, 32, was arrested for indecent exposure after reportedly masturbating in an area family's home.

Dominguez, authorities said, reportedly ""touched himself"" in front of two female family members and went on to expose himself to a third female household member.

Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said that the purported behavior is ""beyond disturbing.""

""Law enforcement officers respond to our homes to help crime victims, not terrorize, traumatize, and create new victims,"" Rosen said.

The station reported that Dominguez showed up at the family's home for a call about a mentally ill family member exhibiting erratic behavior and becoming violent.

San Jose Police Chief Anthony Mata told the New York Post that he physically escorted Dominguez out of the building.

""Last week I said that when an officer violated the public's trust or engages in criminal conduct I would personally walk that officer out the door,"" he said. ""Today I did it.""

Sean Pritchard, president of the San Jose Police Department Officers Association told KNTV that Dominguez ""has no place in law enforcement"" if the allegations are proven to be true.

“Having these different incidents has really led us to a place where we want to take a much harder look at our hiring process, our backgrounding process and really see if there’s something that’s being missed,"" he said.

If convicted on the indecent exposure charge, Dominguez could face one year in jail and spend 10 years on a sex offender registry.

"Democrat Rep. Cori Bush gets slammed for defending 'very violent' jail riot, decrying US Capitol riot","Freshman Democratic Rep. Cori Bush (Mo.) was sharply criticized over the weekend after she seemingly defended prisoners who started a riot at the St. Louis County Jail.

What's the background?

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the riot started early Saturday morning after an angry inmate attacked a guard. City officials blamed a ""faulty locking system"" that allowed about 115 inmates to escape their cells and participate in the mayhem.

The inmates took control of the jail's fourth floor and caused widespread damage, ""where they set fires, clogged toilets, flooded parts of the floor and caused other damage,"" the Post-Dispatch reported.

""These were just very angry, defiant, very violent people that we house at the Justice Center,"" the city's director of public safety, Jimmie Edwards, said. ""No one at the Justice Center is housed for a misdemeanor, a municipal offense or a low-level felony. Everybody housed at the Justice Center is housed there because of very serious offenses like assault on police officers and homicide and things of that sort.""

What did Bush say?

In response, Bush seemingly defended the prisoners, empathizing with them by quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

""'A riot is the language of the unheard.' - Dr. MLK Jr,"" Bush began ""I want to talk to my constituents in the window. Their lives and their rights must be protected. My team and I are working to ensure that the urgent needs of people who are incarcerated are not ignored.""

Bush, whose congressional district includes St. Louis, also released a statement decrying the conditions of the criminal justice system. The statement called for ""full transparency and human rights protections.""

What was the response?

Bush was criticized because, just one month ago, she was condemning riots, the one at the U.S. Capitol that she claimed then-President Donald Trump ""incited.""

""Our country deserves better,"" Bush tweeted at the time.

In fact, many critics said that Bush was engaging in hypocrisy by seemingly defending one riot while condemning another.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cori-bush-jail-riot-hypocrisy,2021-02-07
Video: Ukraine truck bomb explosion on Crimea bridge to Russia,"A surveillance camera captured video of the moment that a bomb detonated and blew up a large portion of a key bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. A Ukraine official vowed that the huge explosion is only ""the beginning.""

At sunrise on Saturday, a massive explosion destroyed part of the Kerch Bridge – a 12-mile road and rail bridge that links Crimea and Russia. Part of the bridge collapsed into the Kerch Strait. Russian authorities said three people were killed in the blast.









Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee stated, ""At 06:07 Moscow time today, an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed.""

Sergey Aksenov – the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea – confirmed that “two spans of the roadbed of the part [of the bridge] from Krasnodar to Kerch, collapsed.""

""Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said that a truck bomb caused seven railway cars carrying fuel to catch fire, resulting in a 'partial collapse of two sections of the bridge,'"" the Associated Press reported.

Vladimir Putin ordered a “government commission” to investigate the Kerch Bridge “emergency,"" according to Russian state media TASS.



Mykhailo Podolyak – an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky – did not directly take responsibility for the explosion, but said it was just ""the beginning.""

""Crimea, the bridge, the beginning. Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,"" Podolyak said on Saturday.

The official Twitter account for the government of Ukraine simply wrote, ""Sick burn.""

David Arakhamia – leader of the Servant of the People party in Ukraine – wrote on Telegram, ""Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode. And this is just the beginning. Of all things, reliable construction is not something Russia is particularly famous for.""

Oleksiy Danilov – the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council – posted a video of the Crimea Bridge on fire next to the 1962 video of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday Mr. President."" Vladimir Putin turned 70 years old on Friday.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declared, ""The reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure shows its terrorist nature.""

The Kerch Bridge – also known as the Kerch Strait Bridge and the Crimean Bridge – is the longest in Europe and was opened by Vladimir Putin in 2018. The $3.7 billion bridge crosses over the Kerch Strait – which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The Kerch Bridge links Russia's Krasnodar region with the Crimean Peninsula – which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.

The Crimean Bridge can reportedly handle 40,000 cars a day and 14 million passengers, plus 13 million tons of cargo per year. The bridge gives Russia access to important Ukrainian ports such as Sevastopol, and is a critical supply route to transport fuel, goods, and military weapons into Crimea. At the time of completion, Russian media hailed the bridge as ""the construction of the century.""

In 2021, Russian National Guard Chief Viktor Zolotov said, ""The facilities of the Kerch transport link are today comprehensively protected on the ground, from the air and from the water and under the water.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crimea-bridge-explosion-bomb-russia-ukraine-war,2022-10-08
Baseball legend Curt Schilling — an outspoken Trump supporter — claims AIG canceled his insurance over his 'social media profile',"Former major league pitcher Curt Schilling — an outspoken conservative and supporter of President Donald Trump — on Tuesday claimed that AIG canceled his insurance due to his ""social media profile.""

What are the details?

Schilling also said on Twitter that his assertion is ""real"" and that it won't be ""even close to what we will witness in the coming months, years."" In his aforementioned tweet, he also included a screenshot of what appears to be communication from an AIG representative.

The text of the apparent AIG communication states: ""Unfortunately, the underwriter was unable to accept my request. I also went up the chain of ... command and asked our AIG Marketing Representative for an exception, but unfortunately he was unable to grant one. He realized that you were a longtime AIG client since 2004 and also a profitable account (no claims), but it was a management decision that was made collectively between underwriting and marketing teams that could not be overturned.""

When a commenter wondered if Schilling's claim about AIG is true, he shot back, ""If it's true? First off why would I lie about some bulls**t like this, and second ... You don't think they'd be lining up lawyers to sue for defamation/slander/libel RIGHT NOW if I was lying? Hell, I tagged them in the tweet.""

AIG on Wednesday didn't immediately reply to TheBlaze's request for comment on Schilling's accusation. Schilling also on Wednesday didn't immediately reply to TheBlaze's request for additional information.

What else did Schilling say?

Schilling also said his insurance cancelation mirrors ""the coming storm"" in America under Democrats who want ""power and control, then FU.""

Another commenter asked if his insurance being dropped is legal. Schilling replied, ""Woooooooooo there. Hold up champ. 'Legal,' at least as I see it, is no longer a restraint on the left. The burning, looting, rioting, F the police, assault, all of that and the massive fraud. Hell the next time a Clinton does something legal will be the first. None in jail...""

In addition, Schilling posted a tweet the night of Jan. 6 that appeared to support the U.S. Capitol riot, saying, ""You cowards sat on your hands, did nothing while liberal trash looted rioted and burned for Air Jordan's and big screens, sit back, stfu, and watch folks start a confrontation for s**t that matters like rights, democracy and the end of gov't corruption.""

The aforementioned tweet was still on Schilling's Twitter page Wednesday afternoon; it's not clear if the tweet had anything to do with Schilling's claim about AIG dropping his insurance.

Outspoken

Schilling's outspokenness, particularly with regard to his conservative politics, has led to numerous controversies over the years:

His June 2016 blog post in the wake of the terror attack at an Orlando gay nightclub lit into gun control advocates and Muslims.

ESPN fired him in April 2016 for a meme he posted that mocked transgender bathroom laws.

And the sports network pulled him off the air in September 2015 for the rest of the baseball season over a tweet against radical Islam.

Also it's long been opined that his politics have kept him out baseball's Hall of Fame, but a Philadelphia sportswriter — Schilling played for the Phillies before taking the mound for the World Series-winning Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox — wrote that ""Schilling belongs in Hall of Fame even though his views are worthy of nothing but shame.""

Just before Trump's 2017 inauguration, Schilling said his support of the president also was keeping out of the Hall.

""I promise you if I had said, 'Lynch Trump,' I would be getting in with about 90 percent of the vote this year,"" Schilling told TMZ Sports, a reference to baseball writers' politics as well as their all-powerful votes that grant entrance into Cooperstown.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/curt-schilling-aig-insurance-canceled-social-media,2021-01-13
"Curt Schilling snubbed by Hall of Fame for 9th time, says he 'will not participate' next year","Former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling missed out on induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame for the ninth straight year on Tuesday, and says he ""will not participate"" in the 10th and final opportunity for the honor.

The legendary player, who is an outspoken conservative and Trump supporter, has fallen under scrutiny on both social media and in the media for political takes.

What are the details?

The Washington Times reported that while Schilling received ""the most votes of any player, appearing on 71.1% of the ballots from the Baseball Writers Association of America,"" he ""fell short of the 75% threshold for induction.""

Following the tallies, Schilling tweeted out, ""Former players will be the ultimate judge, as it should be. I won't allow a group of morally bankrupt frauds another year to lie about my life.""

He posted a link to a Facebook post that shared a lengthy letter he had written to the Hall of Fame the day before.

In his letter, he expressed his gratitude to the panel before telling them, ""I can say at this point I am mentally done. I know math and I know trends and I know I will not attain the 75% threshold for induction.""

He went on to address the controversies sparked over his expressed views, saying:

My love of this country has always been worn on my sleeve. My desire to do the right thing and be a good person has driven most of my life choices. I stood at my locker 400+ times after my starts and took every question and answered honestly. Those people who stood there asking the questions KNOW what they are claiming is untrue yet they quote, re-quote and link to one another story after story that began as lies and grew into bigger ones. The game has made it clear it does not want me back and that's fine, the game owes me exactly nothing. It gave a billion more times than it took and I'll forever be deeply in debt to it. My desire to work with and teach young men the art of pitching will be tucked away.

Schilling also discussed the pain that ""hit pieces"" written about him have caused his children and his wife, who is currently battling breast cancer.

""I am requesting to be removed from the ballot,"" he said. ""I'll defer to the veterans committee and men whose opinions actually matter and who are in a position to actually judge a player.""

The Times noted that Schilling was ""referring to the Veterans Committee, which considers the candidacy of players not elected by the writers.""

The legendary pitcher has become a controversial figure, a factor that several analysts suggested made a difference in the Hall of Fame voters' decision.

ESPN's David Schoenfield responded to the news by saying that Schilling ""was clearly the best pitching candidate aside from Roger Clemens — this should have been his year, especially after getting 70% last year. But some voters stopped voting for him due to offensive comments he made on Twitter, and it's not a lock he gets in next year, his final one on the BBWAA ballot.""

Bradford Doolittle agreed, saying of Schilling, ""Once you reach 70%, as he did last year, that's supposed to be the tipping point. But if the ballots had not been due until after Jan. 6, his total would have been even lower. That doesn't bode well for his last year on the ballot next winter.""

On Jan. 6, following the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters, Schilling tweeted, ""You cowards sat on your hands, did nothing while liberal trash looted rioted and burned for air Jordan's and big screens, sit back, stfu, and watch folks start a confrontation for shit that matters like rights, democracy and the end of govt corruption.""

Crenshaw accuses McCarthy opponents of 'terrorism tactics',"GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas has accused the more than a dozen Republicans blocking Rep. Kevin McCarthy from securing enough votes to become House speaker of engaging in ""terrorism tactics"" and asserted that ""we cannot let the terrorists win.""

So far, McCarthy has come up short in six votes, including three on Tuesday and three more on Wednesday, failing over and over again to reach the threshold necessary to clinch the speakership.

Initially, 19 Republicans had been voting against McCarthy, but after the first two votes, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who had previously supported McCarthy, joined the 19 others in voting against McCarthy. Democrats have been voting for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York.

Crenshaw has also claimed that the McCarthy opponents are seeking ""notoriety over principle"" and described them as ""enemies"" who have demonstrated that they prefer a Democratic agenda to a GOP agenda.

""Unclutch your pearls. It's a figure of speech. You can't insult, slander, and hold everyone hostage with no way out - and not expect me to punch back. Grow thicker skin,"" Crenshaw tweeted when responding to a clip of Fox News' Tucker Carlson discussing Crenshaw's inflammatory comments.

Former President Donald Trump is supporting McCarthy, a move that Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has described as a terrible decision. ""Supporting McCarthy is the worst Human Resources decision President Trump has ever made. Sad!"" Gaetz tweeted.



Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado has said that Trump should urge McCarthy to bow out of the race since he cannot secure enough votes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dan-crenshaw-terrorists-mccarthy-opponents,2023-01-05
Assassination of British conservative lawmaker declared a terror attack by UK police,"The assassination of a British conservative lawmaker was declared a terror attack by police on Friday.

69-year-old Parliament member Sir David Amess was stabbed multiple times by a man who walked into a ""meet and greet"" Amess was having with his constituents in a Methodist church.

Officials said Amess died at the scene.

Police arrested a 25-year-old suspect and recovered a knife at the church.

""The early investigation has revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism,"" read a statement from Metropolitan Police at New Scotland Yard.

Official sources said that the suspect arrested was a British national with Somali heritage.

""It will be for investigators to determine whether or not this is a terrorist incident. But as always, they will keep an open mind,"" said Essex Police Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington.

Police went on to say that they believed the suspect acted alone, but that the investigation was ongoing. The identity of the suspect has not been released.

This is the second attack in Europe this week that is suspected to be motivated by Islamic terrorism. On Wednesday a man armed with a bow and arrow attacked random strangers in a town near the capital of Norway, killing 5 and seriously injuring 3 others. Authorities say the suspect in that attack had been flagged for possible radicalism and had posted a video about his Islamist faith containing a threat.

Amess was first elected to parliament in 1983 and is survived by his wife, Julia, and five children. He was known as a champion for animal rights, brexit, and the pro-life cause. He was also one of the longest-serving members in the chamber.

""I think all our hearts are full of shock and deep sadness today,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a video statement about the murder of Amess. ""He was one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics.""

"DC mayor tells all Americans to stay out of the city on Inauguration Day, calls for major increase in federal security presence","Inauguration Day is usually one where hundreds of thousands of people from both parties pack the National Mall to celebrate the swearing in of the president. It's marked by celebrations, parades, concerts, and other events.

But not this year.

President-elect Joe Biden and his team already announced the event would be scaled back due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Now the mayor of Washington, D.C., is looking to make it even smaller by asking everybody to stay put and avoid the capital city, and she is calling for a massive increase in the already significant federal security presence.

What did she say?

At a news conference Monday, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser urged Americans to stay away from the Jan. 20 Inauguration.

The mayor said she was worried about a repeat of what the world saw at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday because, she said, ""Trumpism won't die on Jan. 20.""

""If I'm scared of anything, it's for our democracy,"" Bowser said, ""because we have very extreme factions in our country that are armed and dangerous.""

Her statement echoed what she told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday:

I think what we have seen is real domestic terrorism in our nation's capital, and that's what we need to call it. Who we saw charging the Capitol building were trained people in many cases — former military, former law enforcement. I think we may find other trained people, trained at marching and surging and sieging buildings. So we have to take it seriously. We, too, have to take seriously how we're spreading our resources. That's why we're very focused on making sure that the federal government is providing enough coverage for federal facilities, including the Capitol, but many federal buildings across the district so that other law enforcement, our law enforcement can focus on other threats across the district's eight wards.

With that mindset, the mayor declared, ""Our goals right now are to encourage Americans to participate virtually and to protect the District of Columbia from a repeat of the violent insurrection experienced at the Capitol and its grounds.""

Bowser also asked the Department of Homeland Security extend the span of time and perimeter for the Inauguration's ""national special security event"" designation and told CBS News that she want the president to ""declare a pre-emergency declaration"" for the district that will allow for greater federal coordination.

CNN reported that the Pentagon is considering boosting the number of guardsman in the city to 13,000 for the Inauguration, up from about 7,000 that were planned before Wednesday's riots.

"Federal violent crime initiative results in more than 1,500 arrests across US over last 3 months","A Drug Enforcement Administration initiative to combat violent crime has resulted in more than 1,500 arrests across the U.S. over the last three months, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.

Since the operation launched in August, law enforcement agents have arrested 1,521 suspects in both state and federal cases — including almost 40 fugitives — seized 2,135 firearms, and seized nearly $24 million in assets, according to acting DEA Administrator Tim Shea.

In a news release about the operation, the DEA noted the goal of the project is to work in cooperation with state and local law enforcement to ""identify and prioritize ongoing drug trafficking investigations with a nexus to violent crime.""

The agency plans to accomplish this by primarily focusing efforts on three areas:

Disrupting, dismantling, and destroying the most significant violent drug trafficking organizations throughout the United States;

Increasing collaboration with ATF to ensure effective federal prosecution of firearms traffickers associated with drug trafficking organizations; and

Prioritizing the capture of DEA fugitives who employ violence as part of drug trafficking.

""Drug trafficking and violent crime are inextricably linked,"" Shea said in announcing the operation. ""From the extreme levels of violence in Mexican cartels, to the open air drug markets in American cities, drug traffickers employ violence, fear, and intimidation to ply their trade. Neighborhoods across our country are terrorized by violent drug trafficking organizations that have little regard for human life, and profit from the pain and suffering of our people. Along with our law enforcement partners, DEA is committed to safeguarding the health and safety of our communities.""

The effort is similar to another initiative, Operation Legend, which was also launched by the Department of Justice earlier this year. Both initiatives aim to combine the efforts federal and local law enforcement in order to stem the rise in violent crime in America's cities.

Under Project Safeguard, the agency implemented structural changes that allow it to focus efforts on violent crime and target larger drug networks and cartels.

According to the AP report, some of the changes include ""assigning specific coordinators in each [DEA] field office for violent crime and working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to trace guns that are used in drug crimes or by suspected drug traffickers.""

Combating violent crime has been a major campaign theme for President Trump's reelection, especially as the country has experienced an uptick in violence this year due in part to the coronavirus lockdowns and Black Lives Matter protests.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dea-initiative-project-safeguard-1500-arrests,2020-10-20
Muslim comedian compares Trump to terrorist Osama Bin Laden,"Muslim comedian and national talk radio host Dean Obeidallah compared former President Donald Trump to terrorist Osama Bin Laden in a bid to pressure the media to stop covering the former president's statements.

Obeidallah, who is a frequent guest on MSNBC and CNN, said on Easter Sunday that Trump was comparable to Bin Laden in that they both inspired terror attacks on the U.S.

""Every Trump statement he puts out should be covered by the media the same way they covered Bin Laden's tapes in the year after 9/11,"" tweeted Obeidallah.

""Both Trump and Bin Laden incited terrorist attacks on our nation designed to destroy our democracy. Anything else by media is normalizing terrorism,"" he added.

In an earlier tweet, Obeidellah explains that he is referring to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that led to numerous deaths, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. Democrats have charged that the charged rhetoric of the former president led directly to the attack by some of his supporters.

""Would any reporter do a story about Osama Bin Laden or Timothy McVeigh without mentioning their role in deadly terrorist attacks? Of course not,"" he tweeted.

""Same rule MUST apply to Donald Trump for his role as the inciter of the Jan 6 terrorist attack. Anything less is normalizing terrorism,"" he added.



Trump had released a short statement earlier on Easter Sunday where he excoriated liberals and continued claiming that the election had been stolen from him.

""Happy Easter to ALL, including the Radical Left CRAZIES who rigged our Presidential Election, and want to destroy our Country!"" he said in the written statement.

Prior to that statement he advocated that conservatives boycott Major League Baseball and other corporations who cave to demands from liberal activists and the media.

Others voices on the left have lamented that the news media continues to circulate the former president's statements despite Trump being banned from most popular social media platforms. He himself has said that Twitter did him a favor by banning him since his statements are getting more coverage than the tweets from his suspended account.

Far-left actress Debra Messing bucks the party narrative on lethal Waukesha parade attack,"A Hollywood actress known for her far-left reactionary takes appeared to side with many on the right over the lethal car attack on a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin.

Six died and 62 were seriously injured when a red SUV plowed through the festivities at the Christmas parade on Sunday. Police arrested Darrell Brooks, Jr. for the attack.

Brooks left a large social media presence that has led many to conclude that he might have had racist, anti-white motivations for the attack. Others have cautioned against jumping to conclusions so early in the official investigation. Authorities have not as yet announced anything conclusive about a possible motive in the attack.

One of the few on the left who is demanding for the media to frame the horrific incident as a ""domestic terror attack"" is Debra Messing.

""Dear Mainstream Media—a man intentionally drove his car through a parade killing 6 and injuring 50+. It was not an ACCIDENT,"" Messing tweeted.

""Call it by its name #WaukeshaMassacre And it was a domestic terror attack,"" she added. ""Don't minimize. Please.""

Messing has been an outspoken critic against conservatives, former President Donald Trump, and his supporters. In one humorous instance, she expressed shock and confusion at a headline from right-wing satire site the Babylon Bee, and later pretended that she hadn't been fooled by the joke.

Brooks has been charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide and was given an extraordinary bail of $5 million. If convicted, Brooks could face a sentence of life imprisonment for each charge.

Messing is best known for her title role in the television comedy series, ""Will & Grace."" In 2019, Trump tweeted that Messing should be fired from the show.

Defense Sec. Austin admits al Qaeda might come back and fill the void the Biden administration created in Afghanistan with the Taliban,"The world has already witnessed and decried the chaos President Joe Biden's administration created in Afghanistan with its botched pullout of the U.S. presence in the South Asian nation where American and international forces kept the Taliban and other terrorists at bay for two decades following the attacks of 9/11.

Tens of thousands of people scrambled to escape the disaster.

Americans were left stranded.

Afghan allies were betrayed.

International military partners were stunned.

Private groups that chartered flights to help rescue people abandoned by the U.S. were hampered by the State Department.

Now, as many analysts on both the right and the left had warned, bad actors are poised to take advantage of the Afghan government that is now controlled by the Taliban, which is installing its own terrorists in positions of power.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was forced to admit Thursday that al Qaeda might just make a comeback in the vacuum the Biden administration created, the Associated Press reported.

That's right, the same terror group that used Afghanistan as a staging area to attack the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, while under the protection of the Taliban, the organization America just left in charge in Afghanistan, may well make a return to power in the same place under the same ruling group.

Austin made the admission during a small press gaggle in Kuwait City, ABC News said, while also claiming the government is prepared to prevent any return to power by al Qaeda that could threaten the U.S.

""I think the whole community is kind of watching to see what happens and whether or not al Qaeda has the ability to regenerate in Afghanistan,"" the secretary told reporters.

People need to understand, he indicated, that this is just the nature of the beast.

""The nature of al Qaeda and ISIS-K is that, you know, they will always attempt to find space to grow and regenerate, whether it's there, whether it's in Somalia, whether it's in any other ungoverned space,"" Austin said. ""I think that's the nature of the organization.""

And it's not just the United States that is worried about an al Qaeda return.

Though the Taliban pledged to the Trump administration in 2020 not to support al Qaeda or other extremist groups, officials from the U.S. and many other nations, including several Gulf Arab states, ABC News reported, believe the organization maintains ties to al Qaeda and worry that the Taliban's return to power will invite an al Qaeda resurgence.

But never fear. Our government has ""put the Taliban on notice that we expect them to not allow that to happen,"" Austin added.

Though the Biden administration has downplayed talks about putting forces back on the ground in the region, the secretary did say that ""we do have the ability to address threats ... using over-the-horizon capability"" and that ""our capability has evolved dramatically over the last 20 years.""

Despite his claims that the military can contain al Qaeda with ""surveillance and strike aircraft based elsewhere,"" ABC News said, Austin acknowledged that it will be more difficult without U.S. troops and intelligence teams based in Afghanistan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defense-secretary-austin-al-qaeda-comeback-afghanistan-taliban,2021-09-09
Defund-the-police advocate running for Senate calls Rand Paul's campaign ad 'dangerous',"Despite losing in the Democrat Senate primary in 2020, defund-the-police advocate and former Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker won his party's nomination in May and is presently running against Republican Sen. Rand Paul in the November election. On Tuesday, Booker accused Paul of employing ""dangerous and dishonest rhetoric"" in a new campaign ad posted to social media earlier this week. The ad denounced by Booker highlights ties between the Democrat's campaign and persons who have allegedly committed or celebrated political violence.

The Republican Party of Kentucky rallied behind Paul and his message, stating on Monday, ""Charles Booker and his far-left allies espouse dangerous views and tactics. ... It is beyond time for him and his supporters to apologize for joking about the serious attack that left Senator Paul with six broken ribs.""



Sen. Paul's ad and Democrat violence

The Paul campaign ad stated that ""the Charles Booker campaign has repeatedly embraced people who celebrate and glorify the violent attacks against Senator Paul.""

The ad alleged that Kevin Mays, a Brooker campaign volunteer, tweeted a ""graphic doctored image"" of Paul with a broken neck and published the senator's home address.

The ad also claimed that Amy Jean, who has been featured in at least one Brooker campaign ad, expressed her belief that the man who sent Paul to the emergency room was a ""hero"" whom she often thought about.

In 2017, Amy Jean's ""hero,"" Rene Boucher, assaulted Paul, breaking the senator's ribs and leaving Paul with a ""significant injury"" that he now suffers ""lifelong symptoms from."" Boucher pled guilty to assault charges.

In the same year, Paul was among those who survived a shooting in which Republicans practicing for a charity baseball game were targeted. The leftist gunman, James Hodgkinson, was a supporter of Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). He wounded Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and three others.

In 2020, an enraged mob of BLM activists attacked Paul and his wife, Kelley Ashby Paul, as they attempted to return to their hotel after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention. The mob that swarmed the Pauls chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""Say her name, Breonna Taylor.""



Paul, endorsed by the Kentucky Fraternal Order of Police this week, later noted that he was the author of the federal legislation to prohibit police officers from using no-knock warrants like the one that led to the shooting of Taylor. ""The irony is lost on these idiots that they're trying to kill the person who's actually trying to get rid of no-knock raids.""

Republican Sen. Rand Paul swarmed by protesters after Trump speech youtu.be

After the ordeal, Paul told ""Fox and Friends,"" ""We can't let our cities be taken over by these marauders and thugs.""

The Paul campaign's ad pointed out that Charles Booker campaigned with accused assassin Quintez Brown, the BLM activist who was charged earlier this year with the attempted assassination of Louisville, Kentucky, mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg. According to police, Brown fired multiple shots at Greenberg as the mayoral candidate exited his campaign headquarters. One bullet grazed Greenberg's shirt.

The Paul campaign ad concluded by saying, ""It's clear: Charles Booker doesn't believe in civil discourse, only violence.""

Booker's response

Booker responded to the ad, suggesting it ""grossly lies about me and, in a very sinister way, attacks several Kentucky citizens by name.""

He added, ""Neither I, nor my campaign, have ever endorsed violence against any political candidate. It is despicable for Rand Paul to even insinuate that.""

In an advertisement entitled ""Pain of our Past"" posted to YouTube on June 1, Charles Booker put a noose around his neck and insinuated that a vote for Paul was tantamount to a tightening of the noose.

Booker alluded to the historic use of lynching as a ""tool of terror"" and as a means of killing ""hopes of freedom"" and stated that Paul stands to ""forever hold us back."" The Hill reported that in the ad, after Booker criticized Paul, he said, ""The choice couldn't be clearer,"" at which time the ""sounds of a tightening rope can be heard.""

Pain of our Past youtu.be

In criticizing the Paul campaign's Monday ad, Booker claimed that ""Rand Paul has used racially charged dog whistles throughout his campaign to paint a violent picture of me.""

Notwithstanding Booker's recent and past accusations that Paul is racist, the AP reported that during his Senate tenure, Paul has frequently visited mostly black neighborhoods, supporting criminal justice reforms, anti-violence efforts, and education initiatives.

Booker, critical of the rhetoric employed by Paul's campaign, previously stated, ""Rand Paul has built a career out of weaponizing hate and hiding his hand."" He suggested further that Paul was a ""privileged, spoiled brat.""

Defunding the police

When Booker announced his intention to run again last year, Paul said he didn't think that ""defunding the police and forcing taxpayers to pay for reparations will be very popular in Kentucky.""

J. McCauley Brown, chair of the Kentucky Republican Party, concurred, suggesting, ""Charles Booker's extremist agenda has zero chance with Kentucky voters. He supports the radical socialist policies of D.C. Democrats like defunding the police, the Green New Deal and forcing taxpayers to pay for reparations.""

Universal basic income and so-called racial justice are two pushes that occupy much of Booker's focus. The latter is what prompted him to take part in numerous identitarian Marxist protests. A spokesman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Booker during his failed 2020 campaign, lauded Booker for showing up at BLM protests and for ""being engaged in the movement for Black lives.""

Booker told the Root that he supported defunding the police and that the legal system was ""woven with racism."" According to Booker, police saw black Americans as deadly weapons, not as human beings. He proposed reallocating police funding to other services in the hope bolstering ""public safety.""

Earlier this year, Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy indicated Paul led Booker in the polls by 15 points.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defund-the-police-advocate-running-for-senate-calls-sen-rand-pauls-campaign-ad-dangerous,2022-10-05
Video compilation of Democrats calling for defund the police,"Despite Democrats demanding to defund the police since early last summer, the White House recently attempted to flip the narrative on Republicans. White House press secretary Jen Psaki and senior adviser to President Joe Biden Cedric Richmond pushed out a message that it was Republicans who are in favor of defunding the police. Their alleged reasoning for the accusation is that Republicans didn't support Biden's America Rescue Plan, which Richmond said was an ""emergency relief plan for cities that were cash-strapped and laying off police and firefighters.""

The notion that the GOP was for defunding the police was dismissed by many, including a Dallas police sergeant and even the left-leaning Washington Post called out Psaki's claims against Republicans.

""Although Republicans all opposed Biden's coronavirus relief package, no one voted to cut, or defund, anything,"" the Washington Post wrote in its article that gave the Biden administration ""three Pinocchios"" for its claim. ""Rather, Democrats proposed $350 billion in emergency funds for state and local governments, and Republicans voted against those extra funds. That's not a reduction.""

This week, Republicans launched a counterattack with a new highlight reel of Democrats calling to defund the police. The Republican Study Committee, the largest House conservative caucus, released a video compilation of Democrats arguing for defunding the police.

Looking Back: Democrats Push to Defund the Police youtu.be

""We looked for an example of a Republican official calling for defunding or 'reimagining' police, but couldn't find anything,"" the Republican Study Committee said. ""Democrats can't say the same - in fact, here are over two dozen examples of when they have.""



The collection of Democrats calling to cut funds for policing features Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Jamaal Bowman of New York, and Cori Bush of Missouri.



""The 'defund the police' movement, is one of reimagining the current police system to build an entity that does not violate us, while relocating funds to invest in community services. Let's be clear, the people who now oppose this, have always opposed calls for systematic change,"" Omar wrote on Twitter in June 2020.

""Defunding the police isn't radical, it's real,"" Bush declared in January.

""A system this cruel and inhumane can't be reformed. Defund the police, and defund the system that's terrorizing our communities,"" Bowman said in December 2020.

Last month, a report stated that Bowman requested special police protection to guard his home, despite being a staunch supporter of the defund the police movement and asserting that policing is rife with ""white supremacy.""

Some left-wing Democrats previously went to a further extreme, and demanded to abolish the police entirely.

However, many Democrats have been more outspoken about opposing the policy of defunding the police recently. Democratic House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina said on Thursday that the defund the police idea ""is a chokehold around the Democratic Party.""

The sudden opposition to defund the police may have something to do with how unpopular the movement is with Americans.

An Ipsos/USA TODAY poll in March found only 18% of respondents supported defunding the police, and 58% opposed it. There were only 28% of black Americans and 34% of Democrats who were in favor of it.

A New York Times report published last month found that black and Latino voters are rejecting far-left policies pushed by Democrats, including defunding the police.

Another reason Democrats are now coming out against the defund the police movement is because Americans are not pleased with President Joe Biden's handling of crime. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in late June found that just 38% approve of how the president is handling crime, while 48% disapprove.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defund-the-police-democrats-video,2021-07-09
Dem congressman introducing resolution to expel GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from House,"Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California announced Wednesday night that he will introduce a resolution calling for newly elected Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to be expelled from the House of Representatives, citing reports of her ""repeated endorsements of sedition, domestic terrorism, and political violence.""

What are the details?

Gomez tweeted, ""I don't need to explain why @RepMTG is a clear and present danger to Congress and our democracy. She did it herself. And she must go. I'm introducing a resolution to expel her from Congress immediately.""

In a news release, the congressman wrote, ""As if it weren't enough to amplify conspiracy theories that the September 11 attacks were an inside job and the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was staged, a string of recent media reports has now confirmed that Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had previously supported social media posts calling for political violence against the Speaker of the House, members of Congress, and former President Barack Obama.""

He argued:

Such advocacy for extremism and sedition not only demands her immediate expulsion from Congress, but it also merits strong and clear condemnation from all of her Republican colleagues, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Her very presence in office represents a direct threat against the elected officials and staff who serve our government, and it is with their safety in mind, as well as the security of institutions and public servants across our country, that I call on my House colleagues to support my resolution to immediately remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from this legislative body.""

At the time of Gomez's announcement, Rep. Greene's name had already been trending on Twitter for hours after video went viral showing Greene accosting Parkland survivor and gun-control advocate David Hogg as he walked through Washington, D.C., in March 2019 — roughly one year after the mass murder that took the lives of 17 people and left several more injured.

Gomez did not make mention of Greene confronting Hogg, but pointed to several other instances of the congresswoman's past social media activity, such as when she liked ""a comment from 2019 that a 'bullet to the head would be quicker' than an election for removing Speaker Pelosi from office, and messages about executing FBI agents working for the 'deep state.'""

On Tuesday, CNN published a report detailing Greene's controversial messages, including a post where she suggested Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama would be hanged over the Iran deal.

A commenter asked Greene, ""Now we get to hang them?? Meaning H & O???,"" to which she replied, ""Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.""

Greene called the CNN story a ""hit piece,"" and issued a statement saying, ""Over the years, I've had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet.""

"Democratic lawmaker breaks from party ranks over border crisis, blasts Biden for hypocrisy on Title 42: 'You just can't have both'","Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar (Texas) broke party ranks Monday and sharply criticized President Joe Biden for his failure to adequately address the ongoing border crisis.

What did Cuellar say?

Speaking on ""Fox & Friends,"" Cuellar, whose congressional district sits on the U.S.-Mexico border, called out Biden's hypocrisy in repealing Title 42.

""You can’t say we have a pandemic or a public health issue here but then say everything is fine at the border and then lift the Title 42, which is a health order,” Cuellar said. ""You just can’t have both.""

The Biden administration is slated to repeal Title 42 next month. The public health provision, first used by the Trump administration but continued under Biden, allows immigration officials to force migrants to wait outside the U.S. while their asylum claims are processed. Left-wing immigration advocates oppose the policy.

""Certainly, right now, the cartels are looking at Title 42. The moment they lift that, you're going to start seeing a lot more people coming across [the border],"" Cuellar explained.





Later in the interview, Cuellar revealed that only 40% of Border Patrol agents in the Laredo and Rio Grande border sectors, the heart of the border crisis, are working on border security.

""Think about that: 60% in both of those sectors right now, their men and women are changing diapers, are making food for the migrants — important work, but they don’t belong there. They should be out there. So we are only working with 40% of our personnel, Border Patrol,"" Cuellar said. ""You can bet that the bad guys know this.""

The result of the situation, Cuellar added, is that Border Patrol agents have become extremely demoralized.

""Right now, when you talk to men and women in green and in blue, they feel demoralized. They don't feel that Washington has their backs,"" Cuellar said.

""You know, the other 60% of the Border Patrol, the two sectors I mentioned, they want to be out there securing a border. They don't want to be changing the diapers and all that,"" he continued. ""Look, it's OK to listen to immigration activists when this policy has been made, but who's listening to the men and women in green, who's listening to the border communities?""

Anything else?

Cuellar's remarks come after Border Patrol agents intercepted 221, 303 migrants in March, the most during Biden's presidency and nearly an all-time monthly record.

At the same time, government data shows that at least 23 individuals on the FBI's terrorist watch list were intercepted at the southern border last year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-breaks-from-party-ranks-over-border-crisis,2022-04-18
Democrat Charles Booker misleads with racially charged attack ad against Rand Paul,"A Democrat running for Congress against Sen. Rand Paul puts a noose over his head and misleadingly suggests the Kentucky Republican opposed efforts to criminalize lynching in a campaign ad that's sure to be controversial.

Charles Booker, a former state lawmaker who is the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, released a video Wednesday that attacks Paul for opposing an anti-lynching bill in 2020. The ad does not mention why Paul opposed the bill, or that he co-sponsored a new bipartisan version of that legislation this year that went on to become law.

The ad, titled, ""The Pain of Our Past,"" contains a content warning for ""strong imagery."" It features Booker, who is black, narrating over a historic lynching photo and images of a noose hanging from a tree.

""The pain of our past persists to this day,"" Booker says in the video. ""In Kentucky, like many states throughout the South, lynching was a tool of terror. It was used to kill hopes for freedom.

""It was used to kill my ancestors,"" he says, appearing onscreen with a noose fitted over his neck. ""Now, in a historic victory for our commonwealth, I have become the first Black Kentuckian to receive the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.""

""My opponent?"" he continues, as an image of Paul grimacing appears. ""The very person who compared expanded health care to slavery. The person who said he would have opposed the Civil Rights Act. The person who single-handedly blocked an anti-lynching act from being federal law.""

""The choice couldn't be clearer,"" Booker states as the camera shifts back to him. ""Do we move forward together? Or do we let politicians like Rand Paul forever hold us back and drive us apart?

""In November, we will choose healing,"" he declares, lifting the noose off his neck. ""We will choose Kentucky.""

Booker posted the ad to his social media pages early Wednesday morning and it has since received over 300,000 views on Twitter.

His attack ad makes several references to controversial comments Paul has made during his two-term career in the U.S. Senate, but it does not offer context for what Paul said and misleads viewers.

Booker's charge that Paul would have opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, is based on comments Paul made in a 2010 interview with the Louisville Courier Journal before he was elected to the Senate. The Journal had asked Paul, a libertarian Republican, whether he would have voted for the landmark civil rights bill, which outlawed segregation in public spaces and in private business establishments, as well as banning racial discrimination in employment.

Paul said that he opposes racial discrimination, but suggested that he disfavors government interfering with the freedom of private businesses.

""I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant, but at the same time I do believe in private ownership,"" Paul said in 2010. ""But I think there should be absolutely no discrimination in anything that gets any public funding, and that's most of what the Civil Rights Act was about, to my mind.""

Democrats seized on Paul's comments and accused him of opposing civil rights legislation, but Paul has since repeatedly said he supports the Civil Rights Act and detests racism.



Booker's ad also accuses Paul of comparing ""expanded health care to slavery,"" a charge that the the Louisville Courier Journal believes refers to statements he made on the Senate floor in 2011, in a speech opposing Obamacare.

""With regard to the idea whether or not you have a right to health care, you have to realize what that implies. I am a physician. You have a right to come to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery,"" Paul said at the time.



""You are going to enslave not only me but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants, the nurses,"" he added.

As for the claim that Paul opposed anti-lynching legislation, while it is true that in 2020 he held up a bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime, that's not the full story. Paul said at the time that lynching should be ""universally condemned,"" but objected to language in the bill that included non-fatal injuries as lynching.

""If you're gonna call something an anti-lynching bill, but you're gonna have a new conspiracy charge for someone who has minor bruising, we don't think that's appropriate. And someone has to read these bills and make sure they do what they say they're going to do rather than it be just a big PR effort, and then everybody gets up in arms and wants to beat up anybody who wants to read the bill, and actually make the bill stronger,"" he told reporters.

He offered an amendment to the bill that would have added a ""serious bodily injury standard,"" but the Senate did not adopt his proposal.



In 2022, Paul co-sponsored an updated version of that bill with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) that addressed his concerns and passed with bipartisan support.

""It wasn't a popular stand to slow this bill down, but I wanted to do it because, you know, I thought it was the right thing to do,"" he told the Courier Journal in a March 1 interview. ""And in the end, I think the compromise language will hopefully keep us from incarcerating somebody for some kind of crime that's not lynching.

""We just wanted to make sure that the punishment was proportional to the crime, and I guess it's just good news that it finally worked out,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-charles-booker-misleads-with-racially-charged-attack-ad-against-rand-paul,2022-06-01
Democrat-sponsored gun buyback rejects 3D-printed 'ghost guns' despite federal rule,"On July 30 at the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, Democrat Mayor Sylvester Turner held a gun buyback event, which is said to have taken in around 150 guns. The city awarded gift cards to citizens who turned in their firearms. For a non-functioning firearm, a citizen received a $50 gift card; for a rifle or shotgun, the amount was $100; for a handgun, the amount was $150; and finally, for a fully automatic rifle, a gift card worth $200 was awarded.

Turner touted the exchange as a success and has two similar buyback events planned. However, not all firearms — like 62 of the 150 reportedly exchanged on July 30 — will be accepted at subsequent buybacks. Turner said that 3D-printed guns, also referred to as ""ghost guns,"" will be excluded the next time around.

One unnamed individual turned in 3D-printed guns in exchange for gift cards. He told Fox 26 that he exchanged 62 3D-printed guns, which each cost him approximately $3 to produce, and received $50 per firearm. He noted that ""The goal was not personal profit, but to send [Houston leaders] a message about spending 1 million tax dollars on something that has no evidence of any effect on crime…”

The $1 million figure the person referred to concerns the money Turner has set aside from the city’s $53 million federally funded “One Safe Houston” program for this gun buyback initiative.

Other 3D-printed handguns were, however, rejected.

Cody Wilson, the director of Ghost Guns, brought around 25 3D-printed firearms that each allegedly met the criteria for ""non-functioning firearm"" to the buyback. With the understanding that finished frames are receivers for the purposes of federal law, Wilson and other members of the Ghost Guns team produced and brought such parts, which took them only a few hours and cost ""mere dollars in plastic"" to make. Houston police refused to take them.

Wilson told TheBlaze that such gun buybacks call to mind to ""the apocryphal story of how the English Imperial Office tried to get rid of cobras in India,"" by placing a bounty on them. ""And supposedly people began to farm cobras."" In the case of gun buybacks, he suggested that one way to ""spoil liberal posturing"" would be to breed cobras or in this case 3D-print firearms for buybacks.

Wilson regards both law enforcement's and governments' acceptance of ghost guns and their rejection at these events as a win.

If accepted, entrepreneurial ghost-gun manufacturers can make some money. What's more, changes in definitions and in criteria incentivize innovation. ""If you think about it, it's like a technology challenge ... encouraging the advancement of the state of the art."" For instance, when lawmakers targeted polymer handgun parts, they ""created structural incentives for people to make ghost guns from rifles and rifle parts"" instead. Additionally, the attempt to pass off a 3D-printed firearm in light of the new exclusion forces private printers to improve quality.

If, on the other hand, ""they have to say they don't want 3D guns, then we say, 'well, how big a problem can they really be?'"" Wilson noted the disconnect at the event, where Houston police would have arrested 3D-gun manufacturers who had trunks full of firearms, despite having just been denied gift cards on the basis that the same items were not in fact guns.



On April 11, the Biden administration announced that the U.S. Department of Justice had issued a rule to “rein in the proliferation” of “ghost guns,” then defined as “unserialized, privately-made firearms.” The rule banned the business of manufacturing unserialized “buy build shoot” kits that individuals could use to assemble firearms without background checks. The rule further deems these kits “firearms” under the Gun Control Act.



This rule goes into effect August 24.



Wilson suggests that this rule and related efforts are tantamount to ""pure anarcho-tyranny. We know the only people that have the equipment in the hobby to make guns are good, law-abiding people. And this [rule] is meant to terrorize.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-gun-buyback-rejects-3d-printed-ghost-guns-despite-federal-rule,2022-08-08
Democratic Socialist anti-cop Muslim activist seeks emulate AOC and take down veteran New York Democratic lawmaker,"Remember how radical left-wing activist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came out of nowhere to unseat longtime New York Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley a few years ago thanks to help from Democratic Socialists of America and the Justice Democrats?

Well, the left is looking to do it again in New York City, the New York Post said Friday. This time they've got veteran Democratic U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney in their sights — and they are using another radical, anti-cop socialist to wage their war.

The Democratic Socialists' pick to click for the 2022 congressional election is a Muslim activist named Rana Abdelhamid, a 27-year-old Google employee from Queens, who has accused the New York Police Department of ""state-sanctioned violence"" and repeatedly echoed the far-left's favorite chant-o-the-day, ""defund the police.""

Who is this woman?

Abdelhamid announced her candidacy Tuesday with the full backing of the radical Justice Democrats, which now has a massive fundraising video spot at the top of its website for her. The site, which proclaims ""the squad is growing,"" asks fellow travelers to help ""usher in a new generation of diverse, progressive, working-class Democrats with a bold vision to transform our economy and democracy."" The fundraising pitch focuses less on the candidate's policies and ideas and more on perpetual victimhood:

Rana Abdelhamid for Congress NY-12 www.youtube.com

The candidate, the Post noted, works for Google as a ""global marketing and partnerships lead"" and has been a longtime advocate for Muslim women's rights. That advocacy stemmed from what became an infamous attack on her when a man allegedly attempted to rip a hijab off her head when she was a teen. However, she never reported the incident to the NYPD.



In fact, she has been nothing but critical of the NYPD, which began with the department's post-Sept. 11 stop-and-frisk policies, she alleged last fall during a speech for a city council candidate who vowed to divest from the NYPD.

She further engaged pro-police New Yorkers when she told the United Nations Association of the USA that her Muslim community ""experienced a lot of NYPD surveillance, a lot of state-sanctioned violence.""

But Abdelhamid's anti-cop coup de grace was an article she wrote for MPower Change, the website of the Muslim Grassroots Movement, in June shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The piece, ""Dear non-black Muslims: To be anti-racist is to help defund the police,"" called for an end to ""police terrorism.""

The internal community work to address anti-Blackness in the Muslim community is important. We write this to also ask our non-Black Muslims to center the calls to action presented by Black organizers across this country. This uprising, sparked by the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Nina Pop and others at the hands of police, has been a call to defund policing systems across the U.S. We support the #8toAbolition campaign presented by Black organizers as a strategy to get to 100% fewer police murders. The 8 to Abolition campaign calls for:



1. Defund the police

2. Demilitarize communities

3. Remove police from schools

4. Free people from prisons & jails

5. Repeal laws criminalizing survival

6. Invest in community self-governance

7. Provide safe housing for everyone

8. Invest in care, not cops



There are several reasons why non-Black Muslims should be wholly invested in this call to action and ways for us to get involved. We recognize the long history of non-Black Muslim engagement with systems that perpetuate anti-Blackness and uphold white supremacy. Non-Black Muslim institutions, like stores and mosques, often times engage heavily with police, neglecting the reality of violence that these police systems are rooted in and contribute to in all of our communities.

Abdelhamid went on to claim that ""policing is rooted in anti-Blackness.""

""The 'Slave Patrol,' which has evolved to becoming our modern day policing system, was founded first in 1704, when laws were passed to keep enslaved Africans from resisting White violence and exploitation,"" she said, adding that ""random mobs of White men were assigned the role of 'maintaining order,' by violently controlling the movement of enslaved people.""

This, she claims, led to today's professional police that ""were created to uphold segregation and a racial and class order that perpetuated violence against the most marginalized in many communities.""

""To this day, we know that policing continues to perpetuate a racial caste system where Black people are most frequently targeted and at the bottom of the hierarchy,"" she continued in her anti-cop rant.

Her essay went on to claim that ""we don't actually need policing"" and call for fellow Muslims to ""demand and join organizing to defund the police and fund community needs.""

Can she beat the incumbent?

Maloney, for her part, is considered a markedly more formidable incumbent than Crowley.

She won her seat by beating an incumbent Republican in 1992, has a long record of supporting Democratic priorities, and has broad support in her district that covers most of Manhattan's East Side, the Post said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-socialist-anti-cop-muslim-activist-challengind-new-york-democrat,2021-04-16
"Democratic US rep calls out 'white supremacy' of Capitol siege, says rioters 'would have been shot' if they were black","Brand-new U.S. Rep. Cori Bush — a Black Lives Matter proponent who was part of the mob that confronted Mark and Patricia McCloskey outside their St. Louis home over the summer as the couple armed themselves — said the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday ""would have been shot"" had they been black.

What are the details?

Bush — a Missouri Democrat — told MSNBC ""had it been people who look like me, had it been the same amount of people, but had they been black and brown, we wouldn't have made it up those steps. We wouldn't have made it to be able to get into the door and bust windows and go put our feet up on the desks of Congress members. We wouldn't have made it that far. We would have been shot. We would've been tear gassed ... rubber bullets. That would've happened before we made it there.""

She continued: ""We need to call it what it is. It's white supremacy. It was white privilege, and it was the call of our president, and it was encouraged by our Republican colleagues.""

Several hundred supporters of President Donald Trump — among tens of thousands who gathered Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to protest the results of the 2020 election — breached police lines, broke into the Capitol building, and rioted, forcing a lockdown and evacuation of elected officials and their staff members.

She also wants GOP legislators expelled who wanted to overturn election

Bush also told MSNBC that Republican lawmakers who disputed the election results ""have been the ones trying to steal this election. That's why we are calling for them to be removed. They should not be seated.""

Indeed, the Hill reported that her first legislative act is introducing a resolution to investigate and possibly remove them.

""I believe the Republican members of Congress who have incited this domestic terror attack through their attempts to overturn the election must face consequences,"" Bush said, according to the outlet. ""They have broken their sacred Oath of Office. I will be introducing a resolution calling for their expulsion.""

Questions for law enforcement

Bush in her MSBC interview also questioned the actions of law enforcement during the Capitol rioting.

""It was strange because it was almost like there was this call to not use force,"" she said. ""I'm not used to seeing this where there could be this many people, and there is nothing that looks like it's in place. There are pictures and video of police officers ... walking away. I'm even hearing people talking about ... that they just stood by.""

Bush added that lawmakers at the Capitol have been reassured that ""when we are here on these grounds that we are safe ... but today was not that day.""

Anything else?

During their appearance at the Republican National Convention in August, the McCloskeys called Bush a ""Marxist liberal activist"" who was ""leading the mob through our neighborhood"" and ""stood outside of our home with a bullhorn screaming 'you can't stop the revolution'"" — and ""that Marxist revolutionary is now going to be the congresswoman for the 1st District of Missouri,"" the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said.

Bush responded to the couple's remarks that ""this is their way of just trying to get attention, trying to get some notoriety,"" the paper added.

Last month a judge dismissed the St. Louis prosecutor from the McCloskey case, saying improper fundraising emails by Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's campaign infringed on the couple's right to a fair trial. Gardner filed felony gun charges against the McCloskeys in July.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-us-rep-white-supremacy-capitol-siege,2021-01-07
State Democratic lawmakers apologize for posing with sign,"Two New York state senators have issued apologies after posing in front of a sign that drew a parallel between climate change and the 9/11 terror attacks.

Democratic state Sens. Robert Jackson and Rachel May both condemned the imagery and said that when they posed with the sign, they had not realized what it depicted.

The state lawmakers were photographed with a sign that featured an airplane labeled ""climate change"" pointed in the direction of the Twin Towers, which were destroyed as a result of the 2001 terror attack.

""I attended the rally today to support a significant investment in climate change in the state budget. I posed for numerous photos with activists, and did not see the content of the sign,"" May tweeted. ""The imagery on the banner is unacceptable and I would never endorse such a cynical use of our state’s history to score cheap points. I apologize sincerely to all New Yorkers and call upon the organizers to similarly condemn this message.""



""Today, I attended a rally in support of investments in addressing climate change. I posed for photos with many advocates standing at the rally, one of them a veteran of our nation holding up his banner,"" Jackson tweeted. ""I did not note the details of the artwork and would never support anything that denigrates the memory of all who were impacted by 9/11. The artwork depicted is wrong and I fully reject it,"" he continued.

""As a NYC native who continues to be personally impacted by the events of that horrific day, I sincerely apologize to anyone who might be confused by any political ploy to mischaracterize my actions,"" he tweeted. ""Indeed the only time I saw the banner in its entirety was on the minority leader's social media. There are two truths here: climate justice is not a political agenda and 9/11 can never be used for political points.""

New York state Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt slammed the two Democrats, claiming that they were ""using a horrific attack on our Nation to advance their political agenda.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-apologize-sign-climate-change-911,2022-03-09
Democrats demand Google purge pro-life pregnancy centers from search results,"Democratic lawmakers are demanding that Google remove pro-life pregnancy centers from search results when a pregnant woman searches online for an abortion clinic.



Thirteen senators and three members of the U.S. House, all Democrats, sent a letter to Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., Friday urging the company to remove ""fake clinics"" and crisis pregnancy centers from search results when people do a Google search for ""abortion clinic"" or ""abortion pill.""

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin were the top signatories on the letter, which was first reported by Reuters.

""Google should not be displaying anti-abortion fake clinics or crisis pregnancy centers in search results for users that are searching for an 'abortion clinic' or 'abortion pill,'"" the lawmakers wrote.

""If Google must continue showing these misleading results in search results and Google Maps, the results should, at the very least, be appropriately labeled,"" they said.

According to Reuters, the letter cited a recent study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a left-wing nonprofit. The study found that one in 10 Google search results for abortion services in so-called ""Trigger Law"" states led users to pro-life pregnancy centers, which the left-wing group dubbed ""fake clinics.""

Crisis pregnancy centers offer reproductive health services for women that can include free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, STD testing and treatment, and counseling or therapy for mothers who need emotional support after giving birth or women who have had an abortion. Many of these organizations are operated by faith-based groups that do not provide abortion services.

Abortion rights activists have accused pro-life pregnancy centers of providing women with misinformation about abortions in an attempt to dissuade them from taking the lives of their unborn children. Pro-life groups deny this charge.



The CCDH study said that 11% of search results for ""abortion clinic near me"" and ""abortion pill"" in 13 Republican-led states that have passed laws that would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade directed women to pro-life pregnancy centers instead of abortion clinics. This included 37% of Google Maps results.

""When people search for information or services relating to their sexual and reproductive health, Google is sending them to sites that users might expect contains robust, scientific, evidence-driven healthcare information – but they actually contain ideologically-driven opinion and misinformation,"" said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

“We have a right to expect that safety by design is a key consideration for any tech platform. If Google refuses to guarantee users’ right to good information, it will be up to lawmakers to step in to ensure that people aren’t harmed by Google’s negligence and greed.”

In recent weeks, pro-life pregnancy centers, faith-based groups, and churches across the country have come under attack from radical pro-abortion anarchists who have pledged to escalate violence unless these organizations shut down. The FBI said Friday it has opened investigations into these terrorist threats following at least 16 crimes, including firebombing and vandalism, allegedly committed by a group called Jane's Revenge.

"'Open brawl': House Dems rip Rep. Omar for equating US, Israel, and Hamas — with some reportedly calling her an 'anti-Semite.' Omar claps back.","Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) upset a lot of people this week when she equated the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban. It turns out it wasn't just Republicans who are calling her out for her remarks.

A dozen of her fellow U.S. House Democrats issued a statement Wednesday night criticizing her statements. And now a report has surfaced that the split between Omar and Democratic caucus is more significant than previously reported, with some Democratic lawmakers reportedly calling her an ""anti-Semite"" privately.

What did Omar say?

In a Monday tweet, Omar claimed the U.S., Israel, Hamas, and the Taliban have all committed ""unthinkable atrocities"" and human rights abuses.

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity,"" she said.

The tweet included a clip of Omar questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken how those who perpetrate human rights abuses — including, she said, Hamas, the Taliban, and Israeli security forces — will be held accountable.

Omar's tweets and questions for Blinken came in the wake of thousands of Hamas rocket attacks against Israel in May, to which Israel responded with targeted air strikes. During the conflict, Omar accused Israel of committing war crimes.



How did her Democratic critics respond?

On Wednesday, 12 Democratic representatives, led by Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider, issued a statement condemning Omar's accusations.

""Equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided,"" the statement began. ""Ignoring the differences between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one's intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice.""

""The United States and Israel are imperfect and, like all democracies, at times deserving of critique, but false equivalencies give cover to terrorist groups,"" the dozen Democrats concluded. ""We urge Congresswoman Omar to clarify her words placing the US and Israel in the same category as Hamas and the Taliban.""

Schneider was joined by Democratic Reps. Jake Auchincloss (Mass.), Ted Deutch (Fla.), Lois Frankel (Fla.), Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Elaine Luria (Va.), Kathy Manning (N.C.), Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Dean Phillips (Minn.), Kim Schrier (Wa.), Brad Sherman (Calif.), and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.).

Things, however, are reportedly worse than even that statement let on.



According to Punchbowl News, the fallout from Omar's actions ""has erupted into an open brawl"" and the ""fight threatens to leave a deep divide among Democrats."" It could even cost Omar her seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Punchbowl reported that a group of Jewish Democratic lawmakers met on a call Wednesday and were listening to a speaker address concerns about the right's anti-Semitism. The discussion, however, ""quickly turned to Omar's recent remarks and what they should do in response.""

This is not the first time Democrats have had to contend with Omar's anti-Semitic rhetoric, the outlet noted, citing the March 2019 anti-bigotry resolution the House was forced to pass in response to her multiple contentious statements.

Apparently, Omar's schtick is wearing on some of her liberal colleagues, as a ""number of Omar's fellow Democrats believe Omar is an anti-Semite,"" Punchbowl reported, ""even if they don't say so publicly.""

Omar claps back

The left-wing Minnesota lawmaker did not take kindly to the Democrats' Wednesday statement about her latest remarks.

She went on Twitter to rip her fellow lawmakers for their ""islamophobic tropes"" and their ""constant harassment & silencing.""

""It's shameful for colleagues who call me when they need my support to now put out a statement asking for 'clarification' and not just call,"" she said. ""The islamophobic tropes in this statement are offensive. The constant harassment & silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dems-rip-omar-us-israel-hamas-anti-semite,2021-06-10
"Deportations under Biden fall to lowest level since mid-1990s, says immigration policy group","The number of illegal immigrants removed from the United States under the Biden administration has fallen to its lowest level since the mid-1990s, according to a report.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation records reviewed by the Center for Immigration Studies show that removals dropped by a whopping 80% since last year's low-point during the COVID-19 pandemic, and by 90% since 2019, ""the last normal year for ICE operations."" CIS reports that the number of illegal aliens removed who had serious criminal convictions has also fallen by over 50% from 2020 and by 65% since 2019.

The report attributes the sharp decrease in deportations to President Joe Biden's immigration policies.

On his first day in office on Jan. 20, Biden ordered a 100-day freeze on deportations and implemented several restrictions on ICE that relaxed enforcement of immigration law. The restrictions had the effect of limiting immigration law enforcement to remove only known or suspected national security threats, aggravated felons, and recent illegal arrivals.

The deportation order and restrictions on ICE were both challenged in court. A court ordered the administration to reverse the deportation freeze in February after a Texas lawsuit, which alleged that the federal government committed grave fiscal and public safety harm to its citizens by suspending enforcement of immigration law. In August, the restrictions on ICE were blocked by a federal judge in Texas who found they were improperly enacted by the Biden administration, but that decision was reversed on appeal.

In September, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas solidified the restrictions on immigration enforcement with a new memo superseding the Biden administration's previous order. Under the policy, illegal immigrants can no longer be detained and deported from the U.S. simply because of their immigration status. ICE is directed to focus on the arrest and deportation of people suspected of terrorism, espionage, or serious violent crimes, and to migrants who illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border after Nov. 1, 2020.

CIS found that these policies have resulted in a dramatic decrease in deportations by ICE from prior years. Records from the first five months of the Biden administration show that from January 21 to July 9, 2021, ICE removed 18,713 illegal aliens. Over the same period in 2020, a time during which there was reduced activity because of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE still removed 93,247 aliens. In 2019, the last normal year for immigration enforcement, ICE removed 186,019 aliens, nearly 10 times the number of removals performed by the current administration.

The report says the records include information on each alien removed by ICE, including date of removal, criminal convictions, and the ICE field office that handled the removal. It cautions, however, that ICE did not provide information on whether the removed alien was arrested at the border or in the interior, but nevertheless said the records show ""just how dramatically the new Biden policies have reduced ICE enforcement activity.""

Arrest records from ICE Field Offices from parts of the country where ICE mostly handles interior arrests show a sharp decrease in cases. Removals from places such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Denver, Miami, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Salt Lake City, and Washington D.C./Virginia have all dropped dramatically.

For instance, there were 1,749 illegal immigrants removed from New York City in 2019, but only 146 removals two years later in 2021. Another sharp decrease happened in Atlanta, with 10,360 deportations made in 2019, then 5,235 in 2020, and finally just 982 in 2021.

CIS noted some cities recorded a ""shockingly low"" number of deportations. The field office in Baltimore, Maryland, which covers immigration enforcement for the entire state, including in Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties near Washington, D.C., removed just 32 illegal aliens during the first five months of Biden's administration.

The report also found that although a greater percentage of all aliens deported under Biden's watch had been convicted of serious crimes — which was the Biden administration's stated priority — a much smaller number of serious criminal aliens were removed than in previous years. ICE removed only 6,000 serious criminal aliens under Biden in 2021 compared to more than 175,000 removed under former President Donald Trump's administration during the same period in 2019.

“Biden officials claim that the new policies make ICE more efficient, but in fact, the result is simply less enforcement, and even enforcement against criminals, who should be the top priority. They have accomplished the near abolition of interior immigration enforcement by miring officers in red tape or taking them off the job. Not only is this approach a waste of government resources, it greatly undermines the integrity of our legal immigration system and ends up causing public safety problems to boot,” said CIS policy director Jessica M. Vaughan in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

She added that Biden's changes to immigration policy were made ""to protect noncitizens who don’t qualify to stay.""

""The rationalizations to avoid deporting criminal aliens are mind-boggling — homicide convictions are OK if they took place years ago, sex offense convictions are OK if the perpetrator has a family here, drug trafficking is OK if it was pleaded down to possession, don’t look in any databases to find out if vicious punks are gang members. It’s insulting to legal immigrants, it will be costly for communities, and there will be people who pay a terrible price because of Biden’s policies,” she said.

The Center for Immigration Studies is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that researches U.S. immigration policy and supports a ""pro-immigrant, low-immigration vision which seeks fewer immigrants but a warmer welcome for those admitted.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/deportations-under-biden-fall-to-lowest-level-since-mid-1990s-says-immigration-policy-group,2021-12-06
DeSantis accuses AG Garland of 'weaponizing the DOJ' against parents,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of ""weaponizing"" the Department of Justice against parents by directing the FBI to address nationwide alleged threats of violence against school boards and teachers.

""Attorney General Garland is weaponizing the DOJ by using the FBI to pursue concerned parents and silence them through intimidation,"" DeSantis tweeted.

""Florida will defend the free speech rights of its citizens and will not allow federal agents to squelch dissent,"" he said.

Garland on Monday issued a memorandum announcing that the DOJ is ""committed to using its authority and resources"" to investigate alleged threats of violence against school officials. The attorney general directed the FBI and U.S. attorney offices to meet with federal, state, and local law enforcement leaders within 30 days to develop strategies against an alleged ""increase in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school board members, teachers and workers in our nation's public schools.""

""Threats against public servants are not only illegal, they run counter to our nation's core values,"" Garland said in a statement. ""Those who dedicate their time and energy to ensuring that our children receive a proper education in a safe environment deserve to be able to do their work without fear for their safety.""

The attorney general's directions are a response to a letter the National School Boards Association sent to President Joe Biden declaring school leaders are ""under immediate threat."" The letter cited several instances of protesters against school mask or vaccine mandates confronting school officials and in some instances engaging in disorderly conduct or making threats against schools.

The letter cited more than 20 examples of disorderly conduct or protests at school board meetings that involved intimidation, threats, or violence, likening these incidents to ""domestic terrorism"" or ""hate crimes.""

Critics counter that the acts of violence or threats described are already illegal, and that local law enforcement is capable of handling such crimes, as demonstrated by arrests already made. They, like DeSantis, say that the NSBA's request for federal intervention and Garland's response are meant to intimidate parents and dissuade them from protesting over mask mandates, critical race theory, transgender policies, and more.

DeSantis has continually taken the side of parents in the debates over school mask requirements and other coronavirus restrictions. As governor, he required that schools that implement mask mandates give parents the ability to opt their kids out from face-mask requirements, an order that is being contested in court.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-garland-weaponizing-doj-against-parents,2021-10-05
"DHS will spend nearly $700,000 to investigate ‘radicalization in gaming’","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded a $699,763 grant to terrorism and security researchers to “study the cross section of extremism and gaming,” Vice reports.

“Over the past decade, video games have increasingly become focal points of social activity and identity creation for adolescents and young adults. Relationships made and fostered within game ecosystems routinely cross over into the real world and are impactful parts of local communities,” the grant announcement states. “Correspondingly, extremists have used video games and targeted video game communities for activities ranging from propaganda creation to terrorist mobilization and training.”

Vice explains that the money is going to a joint venture between the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism (CTEC) at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies; Take This, a nonprofit specializing in mental health in video gaming; and Logically, a company working to change online behavior.

The project will create a “set of best practices and centralized resources for monitoring and evaluation of extremist activities as well as a series of training workshops for the monitoring, detection, and prevention of extremist exploitation in gaming spaces for community managers, multiplayer designers, lore developers, mechanics designers, and trust and safety professionals,” the DHS announcement states.

The grant comes at a time when the federal government is increasingly concerned about the political radicalization of American citizens. While the DHS and other government agencies have spent the past several decades primarily concerned with terrorism in the Middle East, greater attention has been turned to perceived domestic threats. In a statement earlier this week, President Biden stated that “domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy is the greatest terrorist threat to our Homeland today.” The CTEC has long been an active researcher into this perceived threat.

This effort is the latest in a long-standing concern over the effects of video games on adolescents. While privacy experts have yet to weigh in on the impact of the DHS’s latest funding, pro-privacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have maintained that in recent months, gamers are facing “more threats to their freedoms than ever before.”

Still, groups like CTEC believe the latest iteration of video games pose a unique challenge. ""Games are becoming increasingly social ... those social hooks provide the structures and the infrastructure for extremists to organize, mobilize and spread their hateful and extreme ideologies,"" said Alex Newhouse, the deputy director at CTEC.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dhs-will-spend-nearly-700000-to-investigate-radicalization-in-gaming,2022-09-19
"DOJ dispatches FBI over alleged 'harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence' against school boards","Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Monday he has dispatched the FBI to help address an alleged ""disturbing spike"" of ""harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence"" against school administrators, school board members, and other school personnel.

What did Garland say?

In a memorandum, Garland said the Justice Department is ""committed to using its authority and resources"" to address the alleged threats and violence.

Garland, however, did not specify what threats existed or if any crimes had been committed.

In the coming days, the Department will announce a series of measures designed to address the rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.



Coordination and partnership with local law enforcement is critical to implementing these measures for the benefit of our nation's nearly 14,000 public school districts. To this end, I am directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with each United States Attorney, to convene meetings with federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial leaders in each federal judicial district within 30 days of the issuance of this memorandum.

What spurred this announcement?

Videos of parents confronting school officials have circulated on social media all year. Between battling for in-person instruction, against face mask and vaccine mandates, and voicing opposition to critical race theory, parents have prioritized voicing their concerns over a myriad of divisive issues.

Garland's action, according to the Associated Press, is a response to an ""urgent request"" from the National School Boards Association for assistance from President Joe Biden.

Last week, the NSBA wrote Biden and claimed school board members are ""under an immediate threat."" The organization requested swift action from the Justice Department, FBI, Homeland Security, U.S. Secret Service, the National Threat Assessment Center, and the U.S. Postal Service.

""Coupled with attacks against school board members and educators for approving policies for masks to protect the health and safety of students and school employees, many public school officials are also facing physical threats because of propaganda purporting the false inclusion of critical race theory within classroom instruction and curricula,"" the letter stated.

The NSBA even urged the government to classify the alleged threats and intimidation as ""domestic terrorism"" and ""hate crimes.""

""As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes,"" the letter stated.

The NSBA letter listed more than 20 instances to demonstrate the pattern of intimidation, threats, and violence they allege school boards nationwide are experiencing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-dispatches-fbi-harassment-school-boards,2021-10-05
DOJ hammered over double standard on threats to hospitals performing transgender operations and threats to pro-life birth centers,"The Department of Justice was hammered by critics over a perceived double standard on threats to hospitals performing child transgender operations and threats to pro-life birth centers.

The DOJ responded Wednesday to reports of threats made to the Boston Children's Hospital over videos they posted that advocated for gender reassignment treatments and surgeries for people younger than 18 years old.

“Today’s news about the alleged threats directed at Boston Children’s Hospital transgender health program is disturbing to say the least,"" read the statement from U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins.

""Children deserve an opportunity to thrive and grow as their own authentic selves,"" she added. ""Parents/guardians and health care providers who support them in that journey should be allowed to do so free of threats and harassment. I want to make it clear that the Department of Justice will ensure equal protection of transgender people under the law.""

The Boston Children's Hospital had also issued a statement denying that it performs gender surgeries on children, despite video evidence posted to social media.



""For hysterectomies and other genital surgeries performed as part of gender-affirming care, Boston Children’s requires a patient to be capable of consenting for themselves,"" the hospital's statement read. ""Age 18 is used to reflect the standard age of majority for medical decision-making. Boston Children’s does not perform genital surgeries as part of gender-affirming care on a patient under the age of 18.”

Many on social media berated the DOJ for jumping to defend hospitals based on the transgender agenda but doing nothing similar for pro-life birth centers facing threats from abortion activists.

""I must’ve missed the DOJ statements regarding domestic terrorism aimed at crisis pregnancy centers (i.e. actual, physical violence) as well,"" replied Becket Adams of the Washington Examiner.

""The Department of Justice acts within days to declare it’s intent to prosecute those criticizing pediatric gender surgeries. Contrast this with arson, vandalism, and violence against churches and pregnancy resource centers,"" tweeted the account for the Catholic Vote organization.

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Justice Department has not made a statement like this about the dozens of *actual attacks* on pro-life crisis pregnancy centers over the past couple months,"" tweeted Chuck Ross of the Washington Free Beacon.

While the DOJ did not publicly denounce the threats and violence against pro-life centers, FBI Director Christopher Wray did testify before Congress that the bureau had opened several ""domestic violent extremism investigations"" into those attacks.

"'An act of domestic terrorism': Olympia officials condemn leftist militants who used hatchets, knives, batons to take over hotel","Officials in Olympia, Washington, have condemned leftist militants who used hatchets, knives, and batons to forcibly take over a downtown hotel Sunday.

And Mayor Cheryl Selby went so far as to call their actions ""an act of domestic terrorism,"" the Olympian reported.

What's the background?

Those inside the Red Lion hotel began calling 911 around 11 a.m., saying a group was attempting to forcibly take over the hotel, the city's statement said. The group members were dressed in black and were threatening staff, KING-TV reported, citing court documents. Police were told that the employees felt threatened by the group — and the station said an employee was assaulted but didn't suffer injuries.

The group was identified as Oly Housing Now, a homeless activist outfit, and its members had gas masks, helmets, and goggles, apparently in preparation for a confrontation, the statement noted. Police estimated about 45 members of the group were inside and outside the hotel. The group had occupied the fourth and fifth floors and were placing black tarps on the windows as police arrived, cops told KING.

At the time of the occupation, about 40 hotel rooms were booked with guests — and those guests sheltered in their rooms during the occupation, the statement said. Hotel employees sheltered in the basement through the afternoon and part of the evening.

But before the occupation, a woman identified as its leader booked 20 hotel rooms saying they were for a wedding party, KING reported, citing court documents — which also said the takeover was meant to pressure the city to provide housing for homeless people staying in those booked rooms.

""We were going to say we're not leaving and see if we could get FEMA or whoever to start putting out and getting us housing,"" Chris Alford — one of those staying in the rooms — told KING. She added to the station that people she did not know paid for them.

Police added to the station that a Thurston County judge granted a search warrant for first-degree burglary, trespassing, and conspiracy to commit burglary. By 6:30 p.m., Olympia police with the Thurston County Sheriff's Office and Washington State Patrol's SWAT team entered the hotel and began making arrests, KING reported.

Here are a pair of clips showing the action outside the hotel. (Content warning: Language):

The station said the SWAT team conducted a room-by-room search and employees and guests were escorted safely out of the building.

Ten people were arrested Sunday night, KING said, citing police — who previously reported that 12 had been arrested. Seven of them appeared before a judge Monday and faced a number of charges including burglary and assault, the station said, citing court documents.

What did city officials have to say about the occupation?

City council member Dani Madrone said at Tuesday's meeting that she was ""appalled"" by the hotel occupation, the Olympian reported, adding that others used words such as ""reckless,"" ""uninformed,"" and ""infuriating.""



Council member Renata Rollins — who advocates for homeless people — called the group's actions ""short-sighted, ego-driven, and counterproductive,"" the paper said.

""The group's demands made no sense,"" she also said, the Olympian noted. ""They read like they were copied and pasted from some other community's struggle because whoever penned them had no context for what's actually going on in Olympia and Thurston County. This wasn't activism; this was nihilism. And it caused so much unnecessary preventable harm.""

Mayor Selby said the occupation organizers ""exploited and victimized the very group they claim to want to help"" and ""should be held accountable to the furthest extent of the law,"" the paper reported.

""This created an active crime scene that necessitated a police response appropriate to the scale of the actions of these terrorists,"" she added, according to the Olympian.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/domestic-terrorism-olympia-officials-condemn-leftist-militants,2021-02-04
Domestic terrorist group Jane's Revenge threatens escalated violence against pro-life ministries,"A radical pro-abortion group that has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on U.S. pro-life organizations in the past month has declared ""open season"" on pro-life ministries in a letter that makes more terrorist threats.

Days after a man was arrested outside U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home for allegedly planning to kill the justice, the pro-abortion anarchist group Jane's Revenge published a new ""communiqué"" threatening pro-life organizations with a campaign of violence if they do not cease their operations.

""Your thirty days expired yesterday. We offered an honourable way out. You could have walked away. Now the leash is off. And we will make it as hard as possible for your campaign of oppression to continue,"" Jane's Revenge states.

""We have demonstrated in the past month how easy and fun it is to attack. We are versatile, we are mercurial, and we answer to no one but ourselves. We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.""

Jane's Revenge has claimed responsibility for at least 16 acts of vandalism or arson that have targeted pro-life groups in the past month. The violent campaign began on May 8, when Jane's Revenge took credit for a Molotov cocktail attack on Wisconsin Family Action, a pro-life group headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin.

This initial attack and others followed the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that indicated the court has voted to uphold Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban and overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. An official court ruling for Dobbs is expected sometime this month or in early July.



After the attack in Wisconsin, Jane's Revenge demanded ""the disbanding of all anti-choice establishments, fake clinics, and violent anti-choice groups within the next thirty days"" and promised that ""the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive"" if their demands aren't met.



Now, the criminal group has promised to escalate violence against pro-life organizations beyond ""fire and graffiti.""

""From here forward, any anti-choice group who closes their doors, and stops operating will no longer be a target. But until you do, it’s open season, and we know where your operations are. The infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive. We will never stop, back down, slow down, or retreat,"" Jane's Revenge declared.

""Through attacking, we find joy, courage, and strip the veneer of impenetrability held by these violent institutions.""

More than 100 House Republicans have called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate the attacks and vandalism targeting pro-life groups as acts of domestic terrorism.

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) spearheaded a letter signed by at least 124 GOP lawmakers that urged the attorney general to act on the Biden administration's stated objective of combatting domestic extremism and investigate the attacks against pro-life groups.

""As you know, the Department of Homeland Security is anticipating further violence and unrest in the coming months upon the final release of the Dobbs opinion, stating that these threats are 'likely to persist and may increase leading up to and following the issuing of the Court’s official ruling',"" the letter states, referring to a leaked DHS memo warning of anticipated political violence surrounding the Supreme Court's abortion decision.

""With this warning made clear, the Department of Justice must act swiftly to investigate and prosecute recent domestic terrorist attacks against pro-life organizations and dissuade future perpetrators of such violence. These attacks have the intended effect of chilling the free exercise of religion and speech, undermining the constitutional rights of Americans.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) separately sent a letter to Garland demanding an immediate response to the terrorist threats from Jane's Revenge.

“Despite the damage that has already been done and even though these groups have kept their promise to raise the violent stakes, the DOJ has not been faithful to its promise of ensuring the public’s safety against these violent, radical activists,” Rubio wrote. “To date, there has not been a single charge brought against any individual or group despite the countless pro-life centers in America that have been firebombed and vandalized in recent months.”

Dozens of Mass. state troopers resign over vaccine mandate: Report,"Dozens Of Massachusetts state troopers have reportedly resigned over a vaccine mandate, the State Police Association of Massachusetts says, according to NPR.



What are the details?

Earlier this week, Michael Cherven, State Police Association president, said that troopers ought to have ""reasonable alternatives"" to COVID-19 vaccine requirements, including mitigation tactics such as mask-wearing and regular testing.

In August, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) signed an executive order mandating coronavirus vaccines for all department employees. All employees are required to show proof of vaccination by Oct. 17 or face disciplinary action up to and including termination.

""It is unfortunate that the governor and his team have chosen to mandate one of the most stringent vaccine mandates in the country with no reasonable alternatives,"" Cherven said in a statement on the governor's order.

""Many of these troopers are going to be returning to their previous municipal police departments within the state that allow for regular testing and masks. To date, dozens of troopers have already submitted their resignation paperwork,"" he added according to the Daily Mail.

He continued, ""Throughout COVID, we have been on the front lines protecting the citizens of Massachusetts and beyond. Simply put, all we are asking for are the same basic accommodations that countless other departments have provided to their first responders, and to treat a COVID related illness as a line of duty injury.""

Cherven noted that conditions will deteriorate if the departments become short-staffed.

""The State Police are already critically short-staffed and acknowledged this by the unprecedented moves which took troopers from specialty units that investigate homicides, terrorism, computer crimes, arsons, gangs, narcotics, and human trafficking, and returned them to uniformed patrol,"" Cherven added.

What else?

WBZ-TV reports that a Massachusetts state judge last week denied a request from the state's police union to block Baker's vaccine mandate for troopers.

""The union, which represents 1,800 members, argued that the state needed to bargain with workers before implementing the mandate,"" the station reported.

Judge Jackie Cowin of the Massachusetts Supreme Court denied the request, saying, ""The public interest is, unquestionably, best served by stopping the spread of the virus, in order to protect people from becoming ill, ensure adequate supply of medical services, and curtail the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the virus.""

In a statement, the police union's attorneys said that up to 20% of state police employees remained unvaccinated at the time.

A press release following the governor's order stated, ""Executive Department employees who are not vaccinated or approved for an exemption as of October 17, 2021 will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. The Administration will continue to work with its union partners regarding this policy, and specific ramifications of non-compliance for staff represented by unions will be discussed well in advance of October 17 with each employee union. Management employees not in compliance as of October 17, 2021 will also be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dozens-of-mass-state-troopers-resign-over-vaccine-mandate-report,2021-09-28
Drone strike kills suicide bombers heading to Kabul airport,"A drone strike destroyed a vehicle that was transporting ""multiple suicide bombers"" to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, according to U.S. officials.

""U.S. military forces conducted a self-defense unmanned over-the-horizon airstrike today on a vehicle in Kabul, eliminating an imminent ISIS-K threat to [Hamid] Karzai International airport,"" Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said.

""We are confident we successfully hit the target,"" according to Urban. ""Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.""

""We are assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time,"" he concluded. ""We remain vigilant for potential future threats.""

Sunday's airstrike arrived after President Joe Biden's Saturday warning of a ""highly likely"" attack coming ""in the next 24-36 hours.""

""The situation on the ground continues to be extremely dangerous, and the threat of terrorist attacks on the airport remains high,"" Biden said. ""Our commanders informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours. I directed them to take every possible measure to prioritize force protection, and ensured that they have all the authorities, resources and plans to protect our men and women on the ground. They assured me that they did, and that they could take these measures while completing the mission and safely retrograding our personnel.""

This is the second airstrike the U.S. has carried out against ISIS-K in Afghanistan since Thursday's suicide bombing, which killed 13 U.S. service members and as many as 170 Afghans.

On Friday, the U.S. conducted a drone strike in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan that eliminated ""a planner and a facilitator"" of ISIS-K. One other person from the terrorist group was reportedly injured.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the names of Friday's drone strike targets would not be released.

""The fact that two of these individuals are no longer walking on the face of the Earth, that's a good thing,"" Kirby said. ""It's a good thing for the people of Afghanistan, and it's a good thing for our troops and our forces at that airfield.""

On Saturday, Biden said, ""This strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drone-strike-kabul-airport-suicide-bombers,2021-08-29
Drunk driver who allegedly smirked as he repeatedly ran over 6-year-boy detained by devastated grandfather,"52-year-old Pedro Alberto Hernandez was arrested after allegedly running down and killing a 6-year-old boy in southwest Houston on Saturday. Hernandez has been charged with felony murder and driving under the influence. Authorities indicated that this is Hernandez's fourth DUI arrest since 2015 and that he was still serving probation for a 2020 DUI conviction.

Hernandez admitted to police that he had consumed four 16-ounce beers before driving his Chevrolet Tahoe to meet someone who owed him money.

At 5:55 p.m., Hernandez allegedly ran over the child, not once but thrice, stopping with his wheel atop the child's face as the victim's grandfather screamed out in terror: ""My grandson, my grandson.""

The victim's grandfather said that as he yelled for Hernandez to stop, the suspect smirked and attempted to flee the scene.

The grandfather managed to yank the suspect out of the car and hold him against the hood of the vehicle. With the help of other witnesses, he detained Hernandez until police arrived.

The Houston Police Department stated that Hernandez was found to be intoxicated at the time of his arrest.

The HPD indicated that the child and his family had been walking to a store near Leawood Boulevard and Bissonnet. The boy had run ahead of his family in the shopping center parking lot when the suspect ran him down. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sean Teare, with Harris County's Vehicular Crimes Division, noted that Hernandez is a repeat offender. ""This was his fourth, at least, DWI arrest."" He added that the victim's family ""is going to have to live with the actions of this defendant for the rest of their lives.""

Hernandez was previously convicted of drunk driving in Harris County in 2015, in Freestone County in 2016, and in Fort Bend County in 2020. KHOU11 reported that the district attorney's office has accepted a felony murder charge in this case.

Hernandez's court date was postponed until Tuesday to ensure he had access to a Spanish-speaking attorney.

Musk issues statement directed toward Twitter advertisers,"Billionaire business tycoon Elon Musk posted a statement to Twitter advertisers explaining his motivation for purchasing the company and his plans for the social media platform.

""The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence. There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society,"" Musk said in the statement. ""In the relentless pursuit of clicks, much of traditional media has fueled and catered to those polarized extremes, as they believe that is what brings in the money, but, in doing so, the opportunity for dialogue is lost.""

Musk, who has previously expressed support for allowing free speech within the confines of the law, said that the social media platform cannot turn into ""a free-for-all hellscape.""

""That is why I bought Twitter. I didn't do it because it would be easy. I didn't do it to make more money. I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love. And I do so with humility, recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal, despite our best efforts, is a very real possibility,"" he continued. ""That said, Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature.""

""Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise,"" Musk noted.

The tweet received scads of responses on the social media platform.

Nina Jankowicz, who was previously tapped to lead the Department of Homeland Security's ""Disinformation Governance Board,"" tweeted that she hoped ""Twitter's important work on content moderation and online abuse won't be scrapped (and ideally improved upon because the platform isn't currently warm and welcoming) but I'm not optimistic."" Ultimately, DHS paused the plans for the Disinformation Governance Board, Jankowicz resigned, and DHS scrapped the program.

""What's the point of being the richest man in the world if you can’t own free speech?"" tweeted Condé Nast legal affairs editor Luke Zaleski, who has previously used that exact same line in the past.

""Dude plans on letting the neo-Nazis and the MAGA seditionists back in. And he has the nerve to talk about creating some kind of middle ground for discussion,"" John Aravosis tweeted in response to Musk's post. ""Dear Twitter Advertisers: I've been on Twitter for 14 years. Until recently, it was a cesspool of neo-Nazis who routinely terrorized Jews, Blacks, gays, women, Muslims and more — with impunity. 'Free Speech' Elon is bringing that all back. Advertise here, and we'll destroy you,"" he wrote in another tweet.

'End anti-white bigotry': New ad denounces systemic racism against white people,"A new ad airing in various states around the country challenges the notion that so-called ""white supremacy"" is the biggest threat America faces today.

The new ad was created by a group called America First Legal, an organization established by Stephen Miller, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump.

The ad indicates that, in the last two years, the Biden administration has imposed a racist agenda which systemically discriminates against white people based on their skin color.

""When did racism against white people become OK?"" the ad opens. It then claims that Biden discriminated against white people when appropriating funds for COVID relief; that Vice President Kamala Harris called for ""communities of color"" to receive assistance for climate disasters ahead of their white counterparts; and that whites have faced racial discrimination in higher education, from global corporations, and from those in the health care and airline industries.

""Racism is always wrong,"" the ad notes at the closing. ""The left’s anti-white bigotry must stop. We are all entitled to equal treatment under the law.""

The ad also shows signs that read:

""Progressives discriminat[e] against white Americans,""

""Stop left-wing racism,"" and

""End anti-white bigotry.""





A TV version of the ad has appeared throughout Georgia in the run-up to the midterm elections. It has also reportedly appeared in radio form in various swing states, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, and Texas.

Since the ad first hit the airwaves, left-leaning groups have issued fact-checks attempting to demonstrate that it peddles misinformation. FactCheck.org claimed that ""Harris’ words were being lifted out of context."" The Root added that Biden's COVID relief policies did not discriminate against whites per se and that the ad had ""left out"" key context regarding women and veterans. Politico called the ad ""one of the most openly race-based spots of the cycle.""

However, those on the right insist that the information in the ad is true, even if it casts doubt on prevailing narratives about white supremacy.

Jesse Kelly stated in the tweet above that the ad presents ""facts.""



Jack Posobiec of Human Events added, ""Everything this ad says happened though.""

Townhall columnist Kurt Schlichter retweeted the ad and advised, ""Vote against racist Democrats.""

Miller rose to prominence during the Trump administration, advocating for strict enforcement of immigration laws and for a ban on immigrants from countries known to sponsor terrorism. Miller and the rest of America First Legal have already won a lawsuit on behalf of white restaurant owners in Texas. The group has also filed legal claims against Starbucks, some federal agencies, and several elite universities for discriminating against white people.

EU unveils new legislation aimed at protecting independent media,"European media could soon be subject to new rules that aim to protect journalism from government influence and spying.

The Media Freedom Act, adopted last week by the European Commission, bans the use of spyware and other surveillance tactics against journalists and their family members. The act also forbids the search and seizure of media offices. However, the act makes an exception to these rules “on the ground of national security…or in case of investigations of a closed list of crimes, such as terrorism, child abuse or murder.”

The law also addresses the “opaque and unfair allocation of state advertising” which the commission argues may influence public media or subsidize “media outlets that provide government-friendly views.”

The legislation is also intended to protect against “rogue media service providers…which may prejudice or pose risks of prejudice to public security and defense.” Earlier this year, the EU implemented a ban on the media outlet Russia Today over alleged disinformation.

Under the new law, media organizations will also have to disclose potential conflicts of interest by declaring who owns them.

A European Board for Media Services will be set up to oversee the act's implementation, monitor how regulatory decisions affect the European media landscape, and combat disinformation on online media platforms.

Several EU governments have been criticized for interfering with journalists over the past several months. The head of Greek intelligence recently revealed that his agency had spied on a journalist whose work has included investigative reporting on financial crimes.

In a joint statement, the European Magazine Media Association and the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association took issue with the law and called for its dismissal. ""It is not acceptable and highly problematic that in a proposal intended to protect media freedom the European Commission reveals plans to de facto override the principle of publishers’ editorial freedom…as well as the freedom to invest and conduct a business,"" the statement read.

Eurpean Commission Vice President Věra Jourová also stated that she was prepared for a clash with governments who oppose the legislation. ""This will be an uphill struggle,"" Jourová said.

Watch: Actress Evangeline Lilly challenges Justin Trudeau to listen to Freedom Convoy members and not treat protesters as 'terrorists' in impassioned plea,"Actress Evangeline Lilly delivered an impassioned plea for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to sit down and listen to the members of the trucker protests in Ottawa instead of classifying them as terrorists.

Lilly began the video addressing Trudeau, ""I want to speak to you today about your current approach and treatment of our fellow Canadians who are protesting your federal vaccine mandates.""

The ""Ant-Man"" and ""Lost"" star asked Trudeau why he has refused to meet with leaders of the Freedom Convoy.

""If you are so convinced of your own reasons for the mandates, sit down and walk the leaders of a group of 2.3 million protesters across the country who represent many millions more across the nation and explain it to them,"" Lilly said in the video. ""And ask them to listen with open hearts and minds and then reciprocate.""

""Listen to what they have to say with a mind open to hearing things that might go against the ideas you are entrenched in,"" the Hollywood actress proposed. ""Maybe there are solutions that could bring Canadians together right now that you have not considered.""

""You unify people by finding solutions together,"" she stressed. ""Not by vilifying those who say there is a better way. What we need right now from our leadership is unification and that requires being willing to see, recognize, and hear from the people sitting out in the cold at your door.""

Lilly challenged Trudeau to ""go outside and meet those protesters for yourself.""



""That is what a true leader would do,"" the 42-year-old actress said in a dig at Trudeau. ""They would go out and meet their constituents, look them in the eye and treat them with respect.""

Lilly noted that despite what the Canadian government and corporate media has said, the Freedom Convoy has been overwhelmingly peaceful with ""thousands of people singing, dancing, hugging, waiting, patiently speaking kindly, cleaning up the streets, and generally sharing the true Canadian spirit.""

""You as a group have gone from ignoring these protesters to dismissing them as a fringe minority, to smearing them as racist and misogynistic, to now attacking them as terrorists,"" she continued.



""When you became prime minister of Canada, you did not just become the prime minister of the people who agreed with you,"" Lilly pointed out. ""You became prime minister of every Canadian. You don't get to pick and choose who you will care about. It is your civic duty to care about all Canadians. Even those who you disagree with.""

Lilly said treating the protesters against vaccine mandates with ""prejudice, suspicion, and illegal repression is not care.""

""Protesting something that deeply, deeply concerns you in our society is not terrorism, it is the civic duty of every Canadian,"" she declared, and added, ""It is our job as the people to hold our leadership accountable. If they are infringing on our inalienable rights, if we suspect that they have become corrupted or compromised in any way, or simply if we think they're wrong in monumental decisions they are making on behalf of their people.""

""But you are treating my brothers and sisters, your constituents like terrorists without ever speaking to their leadership,"" the movie star proclaimed.

""There are no riots. This is not a violent protest,"" the celebrity actress said. ""There is only a mass of deeply concerned citizens at your doorstep who you refuse to acknowledge for what they are – your people.""

Lilly then gave a message for people on both sides of the vaccine mandate debate.

""If you think that the person on the other side of this divide is your enemy, please take time to get to know them,"" she said in the stirring video. ""Listen with an open heart to what they're really saying. And remember that we're all humans – who get scared and feel pain.""



""Most of us are just trying our best to build the brightest future for the next generation,"" she continued. ""And the happiest, most fulfilling, most peaceful, and healthy today.""

Lilly slammed the legacy media, ""Don't let the press brainwash you into division and hatred. The antidote to prejudice is knowledge.""

She acknowledged that Google algorithms can make it ""very hard to find good information on the other side,"" so she suggested, ""Ask someone you know.""

Lilly said, ""Listening is the only way out of the ideological mess the media has broiled us all into.""

""May cooler, wiser, more loving heads prevail right now. The future of our society depends upon it,"" the actress concluded.

In March of 2020, Lilly declared that she would not self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic because she valued her freedoms and believed the government could be attempting to encroach on her liberties.



""It's unnerving. ... Let's be vigilant right now. And kind. Watchful and gracious — keeping a close eye on our leaders, making sure they don't abuse this moment to steal away more freedoms and grab more power,"" she said at the start of the pandemic.

Last month, Lilly attended an anti-vaccine mandate in Washington D.C., where she called the mandates ""not safe.""

""I was in DC this weekend to support bodily sovereignty while Canadian truckers were rallying for their cross-country, peaceful convoy in support of the same thing,"" Lilly said in an Instagram video.

'Experts' warn against calling California crime spree 'looting' because of racial connotations,"Amid a spree of smash-and-grab robberies terrorizing businesses and shoppers in California's Bay Area, ""experts"" are warning against using the term ""looting"" to describe the crimes.

Dozens of storefronts and businesses in California were ransacked over the weekend in what local police are calling organized burglaries. In Walnut Creek, just 25 miles outside San Francisco, police said a ""criminal mob"" of 80 masked and armed robbers raided a Nordstrom department store, assaulting three employees and stealing thousands of dollars in expensive goods. Three suspects were arrested, but dozens more escaped with the merchandise.

San Jose police said thieves made off with an estimated $40,000 worth of merchandise stolen from a Lululemon store Sunday night. At the same time, a bigger attempted robbery took place at the Westfield Valley Fair Mall.

Another smash-and-grab robbery was caught on video at a jewelry store at Southland Mall in Hayward, California. Hayward police said no arrests were made and the suspects fled in several vehicles, making off with an unknown amount of loot.

And a San Francisco Louis Vuitton store was ransacked by robbers on Saturday.

Police have characterized these crimes as looting.

""The Louis Vuitton store was burglarized and looted. The Burberry in Westfield Mall was burglarized and looted,"" San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott told reporters on Saturday.

But others have shied away from using that term to describe the robberies, including experts who say ""looting"" is a term with racial connotations.

""We are talking about two incidents, we're not going to call this looting. This is organized robbery. That's what it is,"" said Sergeant Christian Camarillo with the San Jose police department, referring to the robbery at Lululemon.

KGO-TV reported Tuesday that under California Penal Code, the crimes committed do not meet the technical definition of ""looting.""

California law defines looting as ""theft or burglary ... during a 'state of emergency', 'local emergency', or 'evacuation order' resulting from an earthquake, fire, flood, riot or other natural or manmade disaster.""



A criminal justice professor at the University of New Haven said that the words police and journalists use to describe the crime matter.

""Looting is a term that we typically use when people of color or urban dwellers are doing something. We tend not to use that term for other people when they do the exact same thing,"" said Lorenzo Boyd, Ph.D., Professor of Criminal Justice & Community Policing.

KGO-TV observed that while there was no local emergency declared in the Bay Area cities where smash-and-grab crimes were committed this weekend, the identities and races of the majority of the suspects remain unknown.

Still, another expert who spoke to the local news station suggested the term ""looting"" has racial undertones.

Martin Reynolds, the co-executive director of the Robert C. Maynard Institute of Journalism Education, observed that after Hurricane Katrina, a large number of black New Orleans residents were labeled looters for ""crimes of survival"" — stealing water, food, and supplies before federal government aide arrived.

""This seems like it's an organized smash and grab robbery. This doesn't seem like looting. We're thinking of scenarios where first responders are completely overwhelmed. And folks often may be on their own,"" Reynolds told the local news station.

""People draw their own conclusions, if the terminologies that you use are tethered to people's understanding of how they have been used in the past,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/experts-warn-against-calling-california-crime-spree-looting-because-of-racial-connotations,2021-11-23
Facebook locks Ron Paul out of his account for violating 'community standards',"Former Republican Congressman and libertarian icon Ron Paul (Texas) was locked out of his Facebook account by the social media giant on Monday, after he shared a column blasting Big Tech for silencing Americans and accused platforms of a coordinated attack with government to stifle free speech.

What are the details?

""With no explanation other than ""repeatedly going against our community standards,"" @Facebook has blocked me from managing my page,"" Paul tweeted. ""Never have we received notice of violating community standards in the past and nowhere is the offending post identified.""

He explained, ""The only thing we posted to Facebook today was my weekly 'Texas Straight Talk' column, which I have published every week since 1976.""

The last post on the anti-war former congressman's Facebook account was from Monday morning, titled, ""The 'War on Terror' Comes Home.""

Within it, Paul began by arguing, ""Last week's massive social media purges – starting with President Trump's permanent ban from Twitter and other outlets – was shocking and chilling, particularly to those of us who value free expression and the free exchange of ideas.""

He goes on to write:

""Big Tech"" long ago partnered with the Obama/Biden/Clinton State Department to lend their tools to US 'soft power' goals overseas. Whether it was ongoing regime change attempts against Iran, the 2009 coup in Honduras, the disastrous US-led coup in Ukraine, 'Arab Spring,' the destruction of Syria and Libya, and so many more, the big US tech firms were happy to partner up with the State Department and US intelligence to provide the tools to empower those the US wanted to seize power and to silence those out of favor.

Paul concludes:

So what is to be done? Even pro-free speech alternative social media outlets are under attack from the Big Tech/government Leviathan. There are no easy solutions. But we must think back to the dissidents in the era of Soviet tyranny. They had no Internet. They had no social media. They had no ability to communicate with thousands and millions of like-minded, freedom lovers. Yet they used incredible creativity in the face of incredible adversity to continue pushing their ideas. Because no army – not even Big Tech partnered with Big Government - can stop an idea whose time has come. And Liberty is that idea. We must move forward with creativity and confidence!

Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity confirmed to The Washington Examiner that Paul had been locked out of his account, telling the outlet, ""They claim the lockout is temporary, but have provided no additional information as to the length of the suspension or the remedy.""

"Facebook removes pro-Israel page with over 75 million followers after 'cyber terrorism' campaign by Islamic radicals, page founder says","The founder of a pro-Israel Facebook page that had over 75 million followers says Facebook shut down the page after ""radical Islamic"" groups reportedly waged a ""cyber terrorism"" campaign targeting the page with hate speech.

Mike Evans, the founder of the ""Jerusalem Prayer Team"" page, told CBN News his Facebook page was the target of a harassment campaign that was orchestrated by radical Islamic organizations who posted fake comments and then reported those comments as spam to Facebook.

""There was an organized attempt by radical Islamic organizations to achieve this objective. They posted over a million comments on our site, and then had the people contact Facebook saying that they never posted to the site,"" Evans said. ""That was a complete scam and fraud. It was a very clever, deceptive plan by Islamic radicals.""

Evans, who is currently in Israel leading people around the world in prayer for the country amid renewed violence with Hamas and Palestinian terrorist groups, said his page was flooded with anti-Semitic comments — including photos of and quotes from Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. He also said the same groups that posted the comments directed people to report them to Facebook, flagging them as spam that violated the platform's terms of service.

Also, some users claimed Facebook made them follow the page without their consent.

On Friday, Facebook informed the Jerusalem Prayer Team that the page was suspended. Evans received a message from Facebook indicating the case was ""complete"" and that ""no further action"" will be taken.

""These Pages were deleted by our system due to being not Policy Compliant. Sadly, we can't review appeals at this time due to a shortage in reviewers caused by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Since you are unable to access the Page, this means that the appealing is no longer an option. There's no further action that we can take for these Pages.

""Please consider this decision final,"" Facebook reportedly told him.



Evans also says he cannot post content to his personal Facebook page and that multiple attempts to contact Facebook representatives have gone unanswered.

In a statement to the New York Post, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We removed Jerusalem Prayer Team's Facebook Page for violating our rules against spam and inauthentic behavior.""

""Facebook got caught with its pants down. Facebook has been accused of being biased towards conservative media sources. This is a prime example of bias on steroids. It's, in my opinion, cyber terrorism based upon racism,"" Evans told CBN News. ""I've contacted Senator friends, such as Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz, my dear friend, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Jared Kushner, and dozens of other political leaders to assist me with this fraudulent scheme to damage our good work.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-removes-pro-israel-page-with-over-75-million-followers-after-cyber-terrorism-campaign-by-islamic-radicals-page-founder-says,2021-05-19
"Facebook is 'proactively' removing Taliban content, other social media platforms respond to Taliban regime","Facebook is ""proactively"" removing content posted to its platforms that promotes the Taliban, a company executive told Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

As social media companies face scrutiny for how they treat the radical Islamist group that now controls Afghanistan, Facebook appears to have taken the lead by continuing to treat the Taliban as a dangerous organization whose content is banned on its platforms.

""We are relying on that policy to proactively take down anything that we can that might be dangerous or that is related to the Taliban in general,"" Adam Mosseri, the head of Facebook's photo-sharing app Instagram, said. ""Now this situation is evolving rapidly, and with it I'm sure the risk will evolve as well. We are going to have to modify what we do and how we do it to respond to those changing risks as they happen.""

In comments made to CNN, Facebook explained, ""The Taliban is sanctioned as a terrorist organization under US law and we have banned them from our services under our Dangerous Organization policies.""

The U.S. Treasury Department lists the Taliban on its Specially Designated Global Terrorists and a Specially Designated Nationals list.

The Taliban seized control of Kabul on Sunday, returning to the capital of Afghanistan for the first time in nearly two decades since U.S. forces drove the group into the countryside. According to the Washington Free Beacon, social media platforms like Twitter and WhatsApp were instrumental in spreading propaganda the Islamist group's leaders used to establish control over the city.

The Taliban reportedly used WhatsApp to provide Afghan regime officials and soldiers means by which they could negotiate their surrender. The Islamists also issued messages over social media warning against looting and the unauthorized intimidation of Afghan officials. A ""complaint commission"" set up by the Taliban posted WhatsApp numbers for city residents to call ""if they face threats from anyone"" and also set up an emergency broadcast system over the app.

A spokesman for Twitter told the Free Beacon that the company is ""proactively removing content that violates our policies,"" including bans on content that threatens or promotes terrorism.

CNN reported that Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen has an active, unverified Twitter account with 347,000 followers.

YouTube also says it will ""terminate"" accounts run by the Taliban, telling CNN in statement that the company ""complies with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws, including relevant U.S. sanctions. As such, if we find an account believed to be owned and operated by the Afghan Taliban, we terminate it. Further, our policies prohibit content that incites violence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-removing-taliban-content,2021-08-17
Facebook says the Instagram account of the mother of a fallen Marine was 'incorrectly deleted' but has been 'restored',"The Instagram account of a mother whose son was slain last week during a terror attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, was deleted but later restored, with Facebook explaining that the account had been ""incorrectly deleted.""

Shana Chappell, the mother of 20-year-old Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui who was one of the 13 U.S. service members killed last week during the attack, took to Facebook after her Instagram account had been deleted.

""It seems Instagram took it upon themselves to delete my account because i am assuming it was because i gained so many followers over my sons death due to Biden's negligence, ignorance and him being a traitor!"" Chappell wrote in part of a Facebook post on Monday.

The woman's post included an image of an Instagram notice which declared, ""Your account has been disabled. Follow the next steps within 30 days so you can request a review.""

""Keep in mind i only posted about my heart break over my son,"" she wrote in the Facebook post. ""Those of u who follow me on IG seen the post. My post was even shared on the news and now IG has disabled my account because of that post! Guess today I'll accept those interviews from newsmax,fox,etc…Instagram you can not silence me!!! You deleted my account because my sons blood is on Biden's hands!! 13 Heros blood is on Biden's hands!!!!""

Facebook indicated that the account has been restored

""We express our deepest condolences to Ms. Chappell and her family,"" a Facebook spokesperson informed Fox News in a statement on Tuesday. ""Her tribute to her heroic son does not violate any of our policies. While the post was not removed, her account was incorrectly deleted and we have since restored it.""



Chappell has issued scathing criticism of President Biden, who presided over what many have characterized as a botched Afghanistan withdrawal.

In another Facebook post earlier on Monday, the grieving mother alleged that during an exchange Sunday she had with Biden, the president rolled his eyes:



Remember i am the one who stood 5 inches from your face and was letting you know i would never get to hug my son again, hear his laugh and then you tried to interrupt me and give me your own sob story and i had to tell you ""that this isn't about you so don't make it about you!!!"" You then said you just wanted me to know that you know how i feel and i let you know that you don't know how i feel and you do not have the right to tell me you know how i feel! U then rolled your f**king eyes in your head like you were annoyed with me and i let you know that the only reason i was talking to you was out of respect for my son and that was the only reason why, i then proceeded to tell you again how you took my son away from me and how i will never get to hug him, kiss him, laugh with him again etc… u turned to walk away and i let you know my sons blood was on your hands and you threw your hand up behind you as you walked away from me like you were saying "" ok whatever!!!",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-says-instagram-account-of-the-mother-of-a-fallen-marine-was-incorrectly-deleted,2021-09-01
"Famed author Salman Rushdie attacked in New York, stabbed in neck as he was set to deliver lecture","Famed British-Indian author Salman Rushdie was attacked in western New York on Friday as he was about to give a lecture.

Witnesses saw a man storm the stage at the Chautauqua Institution and assault Rushdie as he was being introduced, the Associated Press reported. The 75-year-old author was reportedly stabbed several times and fell to the floor. The assailant was restrained and taken into custody.

Bystanders rushed to the author's aide and held up his legs, presumably to send more blood to his chest, the AP reported.

Hundreds of people in the audience watched in horror during the attack and were then evacuated from the scene.



Rushdie was flown to a hospital. His condition is unknown.

New York State Police said Rushdie suffered a ""stab wound to the neck, and was transported by helicopter to an area hospital.""

""On August 12, 2022, at about 11 a.m., a male suspect ran up onto the stage and attacked Rushdie and an interviewer. Rushdie suffered an apparent stab wound to the neck, and was transported by helicopter to an area hospital. His condition is not yet known,"" New York State Police Major Eugene Staniszewski said in a statement.

""The interviewer suffered a minor head injury. A State Trooper assigned to the event immediately took the suspect into custody. The Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office assisted at the scene,"" Staniszewski added.

Rushdie's novel, ""The Satanic Verses,"" is highly controversial among Muslims, as some consider it to be blasphemous. In 1988, Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers.



Iran has offered a bounty of over $3 million to anyone who kills Rushdie.

Though the Iranian government has since distanced itself from Khomeini's edict, the fatwa is still in effect to this day. Iranian leadership insists only the person who issued a fatwa may withdraw it, according to journalist Yashar Ali. Khomeini has been dead for more than 30 years.

In 2012, an Iranian religious foundation raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from $2.8 million to $3.3 million.

Rushdie downplayed the threat at the time, saying there was ""no evidence"" anyone was interested in claiming the reward.

That same year, Rushdie published a memoir, ""Joseph Anton,"" about the fatwa. The title was taken from the pseudonym he had used while in hiding.



The Chautauqua Institution, located about 55 miles southwest of Buffalo in a rural part of New York, is known for its summertime lecture series, the AP reports.

'I hope you burn in hell! That was my brother!': More anger unleashed at Biden by relatives of US service members killed in Kabul terror attack,"Grieving families of 13 U.S. service members killed in a terror attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, had just finished meeting Sunday with President Joe Biden at Dover Air Force Base and were watching the caskets containing their loved ones come off a C-17 plane, the Washington Post reported.

Mark Schmitz — whose 20-year-old Marine son Jared was among the slain — told the Post he got angry every time he saw Biden look down at his watch.

And then Schmitz told the paper he witnessed a grieving woman go off on Biden from across the tarmac.

""She said, 'I hope you burn in hell! That was my brother!' "" Schmitz recalled to the Post. ""I can't fault her for it. ... We all lost somebody.""

What's the background?

This was far from the only criticism of Biden stemming from his meeting with grieving families at Dover Air Force Base. TheBlaze on Monday reported that the pregnant widow of another Marine killed in the terror attack left her meeting with Biden distraught after he showed ""total disregard"" for her husband.

Jiennah McCollum — the widow of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum — reportedly said Biden told her about his late son, Beau, and his military service and death from cancer, all of which ""struck the family as scripted and shallow,"" according to a separate Post report.

And Schmitz's encounter with Biden was much the same.

How did Schmitz's meeting with Biden go?

He told the Post that Biden approached him and his ex-wife after speaking to all the other families — and Schmitz noted to the paper that he glared hard at the president. With that, Biden spent more time looking at his ex-wife, ""repeatedly invoking his own son, Beau, who died six years ago.""



More from Schmitz' account to the Post:

Schmitz did not want to hear about Beau, he wanted to talk about Jared. Eventually, the parents took out a photo to show to Biden. ""I said, 'Don't you ever forget that name. Don't you ever forget that face. Don't you ever forget the names of the other 12,'"" Schmitz said. ""'And take some time to learn their stories.'""



Biden did not seem to like that, Schmitz recalled, and he bristled, offering a blunt response: ""I do know their stories.""



It was a remarkable moment of two men thrown together by history. One was a president of the United States who prides himself on connecting with just about anyone in a moment of grief, but now coming face-to-face with grief that he himself had a role in creating. The other was a proud Marine father from Missouri, awoken a few nights before at 2:40 a.m. by a military officer at his door with news that nearly made him faint.

'It just didn't seem that appropriate'

""When he just kept talking about his son so much it was just — my interest was lost in that. I was more focused on my own son than what happened with him and his son,"" Schmitz added to the Post. ""I'm not trying to insult the president, but it just didn't seem that appropriate to spend that much time on his own son.""

He also told the paper: ""I think it was all him trying to say he understands grief. But when you're the one responsible for ultimately the way things went down, you kind of feel like that person should own it a little bit more. Our son is now gone. Because of a direct decision or game plan — or lack thereof — that he put in place.""

More from the Post:

Despite Schmitz's disenchantment with Biden, one part of the encounter did strike him favorably. The president at one point pulled out the card he keeps in his breast pocket showing the number of American service members who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan.



It's something Biden has talked about for years, but now the card had an addition that reflected the new toll that Biden was responsible for. ""At the end of it, it had 'Plus 13,' "" Schmitz said. ""I know it's just a number, but it was a simple reflective thing that he looks at. I'll give him kudos there.""

Schmitz added to the paper that in terms of offering consolation, the words of military leaders who came up to him Sunday were far more healing than Biden's.

""It had to be one of the hardest things he's ever had to do,"" he added to paper in regard to Biden's attempt to console grieving families. ""You make some calls, here's the aftereffect. It's got to be difficult. I'm not saying it was easy at all. But you can't run up and hug someone as if you had nothing to do with it. It's not going to work that way when you're commander in chief.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/family-members-of-troops-killed-in-kabul-angry-biden,2021-08-31
Father of slain Marine rages: ‘Biden turned his back on him. That’s it.’,"The devastated father of a young U.S. Marine slain in Thursday's terror attacks at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan vented his anger and frustration Friday, placing some of the blame for his son's death squarely on President Joe Biden's shoulders.

""They sent my son over there as a paper pusher and then had the Taliban outside providing security,"" Steve Nikoui told the Daily Beast through tears during an interview.

""I blame my own military leaders ... Biden turned his back on him. That's it,"" he said.

Nikoui, a Trump supporter, added that he wanted to ""respect the office"" of the president, but found it extremely difficult at the moment.



The grieving father's reaction is a pointed representation of the rage many Americans are feeling as they watch the Biden administration bungle withdrawal and evacuation efforts in Afghanistan. By failing to successfully depart the country before Taliban militants could sweep through, the administration has left many American service members and citizens trapped in the fray.

Nikoui's son, Kareem, was one of the 13 U.S. service members killed Thursday during a suicide bombing attack carried out by ISIS-K terrorists outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The attack also killed at least 90 Afghan nationals and wounded more than 150 others, including 18 U.S. service members.

Nikoui recalled that he feared the worst when he heard about explosions in Kabul, where his son was stationed.

""I stayed home from work yesterday because there was that attack and I knew he was there,"" the California carpenter told the Daily Beast. ""So all day, I was glued to the TV.""

Waiting all day to learn whether his son had survived was ""excruciating,"" he said. Then at around 7:15 p.m. PT, he saw a group of Marine representatives approach his door.

They were ""more choked up than me,"" Nikoui said. ""I was actually trying to console them. But at the same time, I just wanted them to get out as soon as possible so that no one from my family came back and saw them. I thought it appropriate that I be able to tell them.""

Nikoui added that he is still in shock and hasn't been able to sleep or ""grasp everything that's going on."" His next step is to go to Dover, Delaware, and pick up his son's remains.

Nikoui reflected on his son's time in the Marines. He noted that Kareem ""loved what he was doing [and] always wanted to be a Marine.""

Fortunately, too, while stateside, Kareem was station in nearby Camp Pendleton and was able to come home on weekends. Nikoui said that Kareem often brought along ""10 or 15 other Marines"" with him on visits home.

""My wife and I felt very honored that [since] these other boys weren't around their homes, that we were able to provide some sort of family life for them,"" he recounted. ""He really loved that [Marine Corps] family. He was devoted — he was going to make a career out of this, and he wanted to go. No hesitation for him to be called to duty.""

FBI admits GOP baseball shooting was domestic terrorism after previously deeming it 'suicide by cop',"The FBI has ""quietly"" admitted that the 2017 shooting by a far-left radical who tried to murder several GOP members of Congress at a baseball field was, indeed, domestic terrorism, The Washington Examiner reported.

Last month, current FBI chief Christopher Wray was confronted by Republican lawmakers over the agency classifying the shooting as ""suicide by cop"" under a previous director.

What are the details?

The Examiner found in an FBI-DHS report released Friday detailing 85 ""FBI-Designated Significant Domestic Terrorism Incidents in the United States from 2015 through 2019"" classified the shooting at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field by a supporter of former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as ""domestic violent extremism.""

The description of the event reads:

An individual with a personal violent ideology targeted and shot Republican members of Congress at a baseball field and wounded five people. The subject died as a result of engagement with law enforcement.

The shooting carried out by Illinois man James Hodgkinson left House GOP Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) fighting for his life after Hodgkinson shot him in the hip. The crazed Hodgkinson also shot lobbyist Matt Mika in the chest, and struck U.S. Capitol Police Officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey.

In April, GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), who was present at the shooting, revealed during a House Intelligence Committee hearing that the FBI classified the case as ""suicide by cop"" in 2017. Wenstrup took issue with the classification, and said Republican lawmakers were dismayed by it.

""Director, you want suicide by cop, you just pull a gun on a cop,"" Wenstrup told Wray. ""It doesn't take 136 rounds. It takes one bullet. Both the DHS and the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] published products labeling this attack as a domestic violent extremism event, specifically targeting Republican members of Congress. The FBI did not.""

Earlier this week, Wenstrup, Scalise, and several other GOP members signed a letter to Wray asking the director to conduct a review of how the ""suicide by cop"" designation was reached by the FBI, and to update the conclusions of the investigation.

The letter notes that were it not for Scalise's security detail (since he is a member of House GOP leadership), there would not have even been any law enforcement present during the GOP Congressional baseball practice. Further, the officers were wearing plain clothes inside an unmarked vehicle — casting immediate doubt on the ""suicide by cop"" theory.

The Republicans also noted that Hodgkinson had a ""potential 'hit list'"" in his pocket. The names on that list were GOP Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Trent Franks (Ariz.), Morgan Griffith (Va.), Scott DesJarlais (Tenn.), and Jeff Duncan (S.C.).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-admits-gop-baseball-shooting-was-domestic-terrorism-after-previously-deeming-it-suicide-by-cop,2021-05-15
FBI agent in Whitmer kidnapping plot arrested for assault,"A key FBI agent involved in the investigation into the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) was accused of brutally attacking his wife. Richard James Trask, an FBI agent since 2011, allegedly mauled his wife after the couple went to a swingers party.

Trask and his wife allegedly went to a swingers party at a hotel just west of Kalamazoo, where they had several drinks. ""She added that she did not like the party and they argued about it on the way home,"" according to the Detroit News.

When the quarreling couple returned home from the sex party, Trask got on top of her in their bed and ""then grabbed the side of her head and smashed it several times on the nightstand,"" according to the affidavit.

Law & Crime reported, ""According to the affidavit, Trask's wife initially grabbed at his beard to get free but he began choking her neck and throat in response to that defensive effort. The struggle eventually ended when she grabbed her husband's testicles, according to investigators.""

Trask's wife had bloody lacerations to the right side of her head and ""blood all over chest, clothing arms and hand,"" as well as ""severe"" bruising to her neck and throat, according to an affidavit filed by the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office in Kalamazoo County District Court.

Trask reportedly left their home in his wife's car, but was tracked down and arrested by Kalamazoo County Sheriff's deputies in a supermarket parking lot in Oshtemo Township, Michigan. Trask, 39, refused to provide law enforcement with a statement on the alleged incident.

Trask was released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond. As part of his bond conditions, he is prohibited from possessing a firearm.

The FBI agent faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of assault with intent to do great bodily harm.



FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider said in a statement, ""The FBI is aware of the recent charges brought by the Kalamazoo County, Michigan Prosecuting Attorney's Office involving an FBI Special Agent. We are fully cooperating with the prosecuting attorney's office on this matter. In accordance with FBI police, the incident is subject to internal review, and we cannot comment further at this time.""

Trask was at the center of the investigation into the Gov. Whitmer kidnapping plot that was revealed when the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced the arrests of 13 men involved in the domestic terror case on Oct. 8, 2020.

Trask's affidavit was used in charges against the people accused of plotting to kidnap Whitmer.

In an October hearing, Trask testified that the suspects were involved with paramilitary groups, such as the ""Wolverine Watchmen,"" according to the Associated Press. Trask said the group considered targeting Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D).

BuzzFeed News reported this week that FBI agents may have had a bigger role in the kidnapping scheme than previously believed. Some of the conspirators expressed reservations about going through with the kidnapping, but were coerced by FBI informants, according to the report.



An examination of the case by BuzzFeed News also reveals that some of those informants, acting under the direction of the FBI, played a far larger role than has previously been reported. Working in secret, they did more than just passively observe and report on the actions of the suspects. Instead, they had a hand in nearly every aspect of the alleged plot, starting with its inception. The extent of their involvement raises questions as to whether there would have even been a conspiracy without them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-agent-whitmer-kidnapping-assault,2021-07-23
FBI downplays religious connection of hostage crisis at Jewish synagogue. It does not end well.,"The FBI and Associated Press were slammed Saturday over a bizarre tweet from the AP addressing the hostage situation at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on Saturday.

What did the FBI say?

After law enforcement announced the hostage-taker's death, the FBI seemingly downplayed the religious aspect of the crime.

""BREAKING: The FBI says the Texas synagogue hostage taker's demands were specifically focused on issue not connected to the Jewish community,"" the AP tweeted.

The AP quoted FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt DeSarno as the FBI official behind the remarks.

""DeSarno said the hostage taker was specifically focused on an issue not directly connected to the Jewish community and there was no immediate indication that the man had was part of any broader plan, but DeSarno said the agency’s investigation 'will have global reach,'"" the news report said.

What was the reaction?

The AP's tweet immediately generated backlash for amplifying what DeSarno said. Critics questioned how law enforcement officials could arrive to such a conclusion when the investigation into the incident was in the earliest stages.

Others abruptly fact-checked the AP's tweet. In fact, despite attempts to downplay the religious aspect of the incident, the hostage-taker chose a synagogue on Sabbath where Jews were gathered and he allegedly demanded the release of a convicted terrorist known for being an adamant anti-Semite.

""I am sure the FBI will clean this up shortly, but until then, worth stating the obvious: The gunman did not travel thousands of miles to terrorize some Mormons. He sought out a synagogue and took it hostage over his grievances. That's targeting Jews, and there's a word for that,"" Yair Rosenberg said.

""[P]utting aside the absurdity of asking us to ignore the choice of venue, the choice of victims, that it was done on a Saturday specifically, and that it was apparently done on behalf of a rather outspoken anti-Semite ... this seems an unusually speedy determination by the FBI,"" Becket Adams said.

""A Muslim terrorist travels to a Synagogue on the Sabbath and takes a Rabbi and three other Jews hostage, while demanding the release of a convicted Antisemitic terrorist. Sorry @AP but I'm pretty sure that it's DIRECTLY connected to the Jewish community,"" one person observed.

""He was seeking the release of the virulent antisemite and convicted terrorist—Aafia Siddiqui. She blamed Jews for everything—likely he did too,"" Christina Sommers said.

""In a society where victimhood status confers prestige, it's very important that Jews never be seen as victims,"" one person observed.

""Islamic radical wandered into a synagogue in Texas by accident,"" David Harsanyi mocked.

""Yeah, the release of his sister who hates Jews and wants them dead. Feels like there might be some sort of connection there anyway,"" Noam Blum said.

""[O]h good I’m so glad to hear that a man who held four hostages in a synagogue for eleven hours after taking them during Shabbat services didn’t do it for any specific reason and this string of events was just a coincidence and not antisemitic at all. What a relief,"" another person mocked.

""Is this the same FBI that said the Bernie Bro who shot up the Republican baseball practice just chose a random field and had no political motives whatsoever?"" one person mocked.

Fortunately, all hostages were released without injury. The suspect was killed, but law enforcement did not say who fired the fatal shot.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-ap-tweet-downplay-religious-connection-synagogue-hostage-crisis,2022-01-16
"FBI backtracks, now says Jewish community was targeted in synagogue hostage situation","The Federal Bureau of Investigation has changed its story and now says that Saturday's synagogue 11-hour hostage situation in Colleyville, Texas, was an intended targeting of the Jewish community.

The FBI initially said that the incident — which left the hostage-taker dead — was not ""specifically related to the Jewish community.""

What are the details?

On Monday, CNN reported that the suspect, 44-year-old British national Malik Faisal Akram, ""spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States.""

Fox News host Shannon Bream tweeted the FBI's newest statement, which read, ""This is a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted, and is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.""

Following the incident, FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt DeSarno said, ""We do believe from our engagement with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community. But we’re continuing to work to find motive and we will continue on that path. In terms of the resolution of the incident, the hostage taker is deceased.”

Law enforcement on Saturday reported that at least four people — a Jewish rabbi and three synagogue congregants — were taken hostage at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville.

Previous reporting stated that the suspect claimed to be the brother of Aafia Siddiqui, a terrorist who is incarcerated at Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base. A judge in 2010 sentenced Siddiqui to 86 years in federal prison for conspiring to kill U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.

Akram during the hostage situation reportedly demanded Siddiqui's freedom in exchange for the four lives.

One hostage was released shortly before 5 p.m. local time, while the other three hostages were freed as the FBI executed a strike on Akram, killing him.

CNN reported that British authorities arrested two Manchester, England, teenagers in connection with the Texas incident.

The unnamed teenagers are being held for questioning at the time of this reporting, and it is unknown what role they may have played in planning the attack.

What else is there to know about this?

Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who was one of the hostages, said that the synagogue underwent ""multiple security courses"" in training to survive such incidents.



""In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,"" Cytron-Walker said in a statement. ""Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-backtracks-now-says-jewish-community-was-targeted-in-synagogue-hostage-situation,2022-01-17
FBI foils alleged 911-style terror plot by Kenyan man at the direction of al-Shabab jihadists,"Federal prosecutors say they foiled a plot by a Kenyan national who allegedly planned a 911-style terror attack at the direction of the al-Shabab jihadist group.

Cholo Abdi Abdullah was arrested in the Philippines in July 2019 but the federal indictment against him was unsealed on Wednesday a day after he arrived in Manhattan, New York, on Tuesday for prosecution.

Al-Shabab is an affiliate of al-Qaeda and has been blamed for numerous bloody attacks in East Africa.



Prosecutors allege that Abdullah received pilot training in order to attempt a terror plot to hijack a commercial airliner and fly it into a tall building of a major U.S. city. The city in the alleged plot was not identified.

""I plead not guilty to all the counts,"" Abdullah said at his arraignment.

The indictment further claims that Abdullah was allegedly under order from senior al-Shabaab leaders, that he obtained a pilot's license in the Philippines for the attack, and that he was in the process of seeking a U.S. visa. At the time of his arrest in the Philippines, local news reports said that he allegedly had in his possession a homemade bomb and a grenade.

Prosecutors filed 6 terror-related charges against Abdullah. He faces a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison if found guilty, but could receive a life sentence for the charges.

""This chilling callback to the horrific attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is a stark reminder that terrorist groups like al-Shabaab remain committed to killing U.S. citizens and attacking the United States,"" said acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in statement.



In 2013 the al-Shabab terror group called on all Muslims living in the West to launch terror attacks on non-Muslims.

"GOP rep says FBI privately told lawmakers 2017 baseball field shooting was 'suicide by cop,' not assassination attempt​","Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), a lawmaker who was at the scene of an attempted massacre of GOP politicians at a baseball field in 2017, revealed that the FBI designated the case ""suicide by cop,"" a characterization he disputed.

Speaking during a House Intelligence Committee hearing held last Thursday that featured testimony from FBI Director Christopher Wray, Wenstrup criticized the FBI's findings, noting that other federal law agencies determined the attack was politically motivated. He said that FBI agents privately briefed members of Congress about the shooting on Nov. 16, 2017.

""Much to our shock that day, the FBI concluded that this was a case of the attacker seeking suicide by cop,"" Wenstrup said, according to Politico. ""Director, you want suicide by cop, you just pull a gun on a cop. It doesn't take 136 rounds. It takes one bullet. Both the DHS and the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] published products labeling this attack as a domestic violent extremism event, specifically targeting Republican members of Congress. The FBI did not.""

On June 14, 2017, James Hodgkinson wielded two firearms and attacked members of the congressional Republican baseball team, shooting and seriously injuring Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, congressional staffer Zack Barth, and lobbyist Matt Mika. Wenstrup, a podiatrist and U.S. Army Reservist, was on the baseball field and provided medical aid to Scalise and others injured by the shooter.

Scalise underwent multiple surgeries and weeks of recovery before returning to Congress.

Hodgkinson, 66, died of injuries at the scene after the attack. He was later discovered to be a supporter of democratic socialist Bernie Sanders' campaign for president with a troubling history of violence and abuse. A behavioral review of Hodgkinson published by the U.S. Secret service noted that he ""openly shared his anti-Republican views with friends, family, and others; attended protests; wrote letters to his local paper expressing discontent with economic inequality and taxes,"" though he ""never made a threat"" against any public officials.

The FBI has never publicly disclosed its conclusions on the attack. In a June 21, 2017 update on its investigation, the bureau noted the gunman's support for left-wing causes and candidates and reported its findings that Hodgkinson had made no threats against Republican lawmakers prior to the attack.

The district attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, called the shooting ""an act of terrorism"" in its report.

In a supplemental letter to his testimony, Wenstrup wrote that the FBI's private ""suicide by cop"" conclusion ""defies logic and contradicts the publicly known facts about the perpetrator and the attack.""

""The shooter had an extensive social media record highlighting his hatred of President Trump and Republicans. He had a list of names — including Republican Members of Congress — in his possession. Before carrying out his attack, he asked if the Members at the baseball field were Republicans or Democrats. Furthermore, the shooter's operational movements during the attack demonstrate his murderous intent,"" Wenstrup wrote.

He requested that Director Wray order the FBI Counterterrorism Division to review the investigative findings, interview all relevant witnesses, and provide an update on how the FBI reached its ""suicide by cop"" conclusion to Congress.

""Although the agents were not part of that investigation, they did not agree that this was suicide by cop and it's my firsthand opinion that this was an attempt at assassination of many Republican members of Congress,"" Wenstrup said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-told-lawmakers-baseball-shooting-suicide-by-cop,2021-04-21
"FBI-SWAT veteran suspended after refusing to participate in allegedly politicized raid, claims FBI is exaggerating extremist threats","FBI Special Agent Steve Friend, a 12-year veteran of the agency and a SWAT team member, was reportedly suspended on Monday, stripped of his gun and badge, and marched out of the FBI field office in Daytona Beach, Florida. He had neither conspired against a national security adviser nor tampered with evidence, but rather refused to participate in an allegedly politicized and excessive raid or take actions he believed to contravene agency policy and trample citizens' rights.

This 37-year-old father of two is among 20 FBI whistleblowers who recently have come forward alleging that the FBI has become significantly politicized and engaged in various abuses, malpractices, and questionable tactics.

The whistleblower complaint



On Wednesday, Friend filed a whistleblower complaint with DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz. The New York Post, which obtained a copy of the complaint, reported that Friend outlined how investigations with which he was involved, related to the January 6 protests, had allegedly violated numerous FBI policies.

Some of these claims were echoed in a September 19 letter from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, to FBI Dir. Christopher Wray.

Friend had allegedly been told that so-called ""domestic terrorism was a higher priority"" than preventing the victimization of children and was taken off of active investigations into child sexual exploitation and human trafficking so that he could work on J6 cases forwarded from Washington, D.C..

In the investigations he subsequently participated in, he claimed that the D.C. field office was ""manipulating"" FBI case-management protocol.

""Cases are ordinarily characterized and labeled by the originating field office,"" noted Jordan, ""with leads 'cut' to other field offices for specific assistance in that geographic location."" The FBI was, however, said to have been engaged in a ""manipulative casefile practice"" whereby it disseminated J6 cases to local field offices around the country to generate ""false and misleading crime statistics.""

According to Friend's complaint cited by Jordan, ""Instead of hundreds of investigations stemming from a single, black swan incident at the Capitol, FBI and [Department of Justice] officials point to significant increases in domestic violent extremism and terrorism around the United States.""

Jordan wrote that ""the FBI's case categorization creates the illusion that threats from [""domestic violent extremism"" or DVE] are present in jurisdictions across the nation, when in reality they all stem from the same related investigation concerning the actions at the Capitol on Jan 6.""

A potential result of this alleged ""artificial case categorization scheme"" is that the FBI leadership could ""misleadingly point to 'significant' increases in DVE threats nationwide.""

Last year, the FBI indicated that it expected ""anti-government, anti-authority violent extremists"" would ""likely pose the greatest domestic terrorism threats throughout 2021, and in fact leading into 2022.""

Citing the doubling of domestic terror investigations launched by the FBI since March 2020, earlier this year, the DOJ launched a unit specifically assigned to tackle domestic terrorism. Matthew Olsen, the assistant attorney general for national security, reiterated previous claims that there was ""a growing threat"" from those ""who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies.""

In 2021, Wray had also suggested, on the basis of what Friend has suggested are altered statistics, that investigations into DVE had increased ""significantly"" — that it ""has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now.""

Friend claimed that, as part of this scheme, he had consequently been listed as lead agent in cases with which he had little to no involvement as an investigator. Also in contravention of FBI policy, Friend said that while he had been listed as lead agent, his supervisor had not signed off on his cases.



Besides allegedly cooking statistics to exaggerate a supposed threat, Friend claimed that the agency opened domestic terrorism cases on innocent American citizens who were nowhere near the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

FBI software, he reported in his complaint, collated ""guardians,"" which are investigative tools resulting from anonymous tips sent to an FBI tip line as well as from data shared from Facebook, which the social media platform allegedly scrapes from private conversations and messages.

The Post reported that the complaint also alleges that the FBI, sometime after January 6, designated an area outside the Capitol as a restricted zone in order to justify additional prosecutions.

Friend's complaint suggested that the FBI is not content just to add distant innocents and peaceful protesters to its roster of prospective suspects. It is allegedly keen to prosecute everyone even remotely linked to the protest. Friend claimed that those identified are referred to the FBI's Daytona Beach office for ""investigation and arrest.""

Additionally, at least one office is said to have conducted surveillance and home visits to persons who had neither been in Washington, D.C., nor inside the Capitol on the day of the protests.

On the basis of Friend's complaint and dozens of others, Jordan stated, ""It appears instead that the FBI is more focused on classifying investigations to meet a woke left-wing agenda"" and that the ""FBI is not immune to oversight or accountability.""

Keeping his oath



The Post reported that on August 19, Friend told his boss, Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Greg Federico, that he reckoned ""it was inappropriate to use an FBI SWAT team to arrest a subject for misdemeanor offenses and opined that the subject will likely face extended detainment and biased jury pools in Washington D.C.""

After Friend advocated for nonviolent and practical alternatives, Federico allegedly told him he'd be best off calling in sick before threatening ""reprisal indirectly by asking how long I saw myself continuing to work for the FBI.""

Friend claimed he was called in by more senior bosses in Jacksonville on August 23, namely Assistant Special Agents in Charge Coult Markovsky and Sean Ryan. They allegedly grilled Friend over his refusal to participate in the raid on alleged offenders wanted for misdemeanor offenses.

When Friend ⁠— who the Post indicated did not vote for former President Donald Trump in 2020 ⁠— said he did not believe all present near the Capitol on January 6 were guilty and that he ""believed some innocent individuals had been unjustly prosecuted, convicted and sentenced,"" Markovsky allegedly repeated false claims about the murder of police officers at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and deemed Friend a ""bad teammate.""

Friend claimed he was again threatened with reprisal.

When he refused to take part in the August 24 raid, Friend said that he was deemed away without leave and then docked pay.

Friend suspected he might be facing an ouster on the basis of subsequent conversations with supervisors.

Special Agent in Charge Sherri Onks, in Jacksonville, allegedly told Friend his ""views represented an extremely small minority of the FBI workforce.""

Friend, reportedly marched out of the FBI field office in Daytona Beach on September 19, regards himself as a ""conscientious objector"" and noted his refusal to participate in the August 24 raid was informed by his ""oath to uphold the Constitution.""

Keeping the FBI accountable

In his September 19 letter, Jordan demanded that the FBI turn over documentation and information relevant to Friend's complaint by October 3, such as ""the number of arrest and search warrants sworn out by agents from the [Washington Field Office], but executed in the geographic area of another FBI field office.""

He also emphasized that ""whistleblower disclosures to Congress are protected by law"" and that the House Committee on the Judiciary would ""not tolerate any effort to retaliate against whistleblowers for their disclosures.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-veteran-suspended-politicized-raid,2022-09-22
The FBI is investigating Jane's Revenge attacks on pro-life groups after Republicans demanded action,"The FBI has opened a domestic violent extremism investigation into recent attacks on pro-life organizations that have come as the Supreme Court is expected to issue a landmark decision on abortion rights, the bureau said Friday.



""The FBI is investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers and faith-based organizations across the country,"" the FBI said in a statement first reported by Fox News. ""The FBI takes all threats seriously and we continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners and will remain vigilant to protect our communities.""

The FBI’s statement comes after Republican lawmakers clamored for immediate action from the Justice Department to prosecute these violent acts as domestic terrorism.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to resign Thursday in a letter that blasted the Department of Justice for its perceived inaction after an anarchist terrorist group called Jane's Revenge claimed responsibility for several attacks against pro-life groups.

In his letter, Cotton urged the DOJ to investigate a string of firebombings and other acts of vandalism against churches, pro-life pregnancy centers, and other anti-abortion groups in recent weeks. He noted that the anarchist group Jane's Revenge has taken credit for at least 16 criminal acts targeting pro-life groups and has promised to escalate its campaign of violence.

""Houses of worship and pro-life pregnancy centers are under attack,"" Cotton wrote to Garland. ""The Family Research Council has compiled a list of more than 50 attacks against churches, pro-life pregnancy centers, and other pro-life groups in the past few weeks. A left-wing extremist group called 'Jane’s Revenge' has taken credit for many of these attacks, including firebombings and grotesque acts of vandalism.""



Cotton cited a terrorist threat Jane's Revenge published Tuesday that declared ""open season"" on so-called ""anti-choice"" groups and promised ""increasingly drastic measures"" that ""may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.""

""What is the Department of Justice doing to protect Americans from these violent attacks?"" Cotton asked. ""At a minimum, you should bring federal charges against the perpetrators, where appropriate, and investigate 'Jane’s Revenge' as a domestic terrorist organization,"" he demanded.

""If you are unwilling to protect Americans from these attacks, you should resign—although, in my opinion, you should resign in any case,"" Cotton wrote.

The letter included a list of more than a dozen attacks against churches and pro-life organizations that Jane's Revenge has claimed responsibility for:



May 7 - St. John XXIII Catholic Church in Ft. Collins, Colorado, has its windows smashed and is vandalized with the message, ""My Body My Choice,"" plus an anarchist symbol.

May 8 - Wisconsin Family Action in Madison, Wisconsin, is firebombed and vandalized with the threat, ""if abortions aren't safe, then you aren't either.""

May 8 - The Loreto House Pregnancy & Parenting Resource Center in Denton, Texas, is vandalized with the messages ""Forced birth is murder"" and ""Not a clinic.""

May 13 - The Alpha Pregnancy Center in Reisterstown, Maryland, is vandalized with the messages ""Jane's Revenge"" and ""If abortions aren't safe neither are you.""

May 14 - BirthRight pregnancy center in Frederick, Maryland, is vandalized with the messages ""Defend Roe"" and ""F-k Fake Clinic.""

May 21 - Four churches in Olympia, Washington, are vandalized with messages, including ""If abortions aren't safe then neither are you,"" ""Abort the church,"" and ""God loves abortion.""

May 27 - Next Step Pregnancy Services has its windows smashed and is vandalized with the threat ""If abortion isn't safe, you aren't either.""

May 30 - The Respect Life Office in Hollywood, Florida, is vandalized with the messages ""Jane's Revenge,"" ""If abortions aren't safe then niether [sic] are you,"" and anarchist symbols.""

May 30 - The Dove Medical Pregnancy Center in Eugene, Oregon, is vandalized with the messages ""From Jane,"" ""Not a clinic,"" ""Abortion is healthcare,"" and communist and anarchist symbols.

June 2 - Agape Pregnancy Center in Des Moines, Iowa, has its windows smashed and is vandalized with the messages ""God loves abortions"" and ""fake clinic.""

June 3 - The Capitol Hill Pregnancy Center in Washington, D.C., is vandalized with eggs, red paint, and a message stating ""Jane's Revenge.""

June 7 - Mountain Area Pregnancy Services in Asheville, North Carolina, has its windows smashed and is vandalized with the messages ""No forced birth"" and ""If abortions aren't safe, neither are you!""

June 7 - CompassCare pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, is firebombed and vandalized with the message ""Jane was here.""

June 8 - Options360 pregnancy center in Vancouver, Washington, is vandalized with red paint and the message ""Jane's Revenge.""

June 11 - The Gresham Pregnancy Resource Center in Gresham, Oregon, is firebombed.

More than 120 House Republicans have also called on Garland and the FBI to swiftly investigate and prosecute recent attacks on pro-life centers and work to prevent future violence.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) separately sent a similar letter to Garland Wednesday stating that ""the DOJ has not been faithful to its promise of ensuring the public’s safety against these violent, radical activists.""

The White House responded to Jane's Revenge's terrorist threat Wednesday afternoon in a statement provided to the Daily Wire.

“Violence and destruction of property have no place in our country under any circumstances, and the President denounces this,” White House assistant press secretary Alexandra LaManna said.

“We should all agree that actions like this are completely unacceptable regardless of our politics,” she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-will-investigate-janes-revenge-terrorism,2022-06-17
FBI's investigation into hundreds of attacks by pro-abortion terror group yields zero arrests so far,"The pro-abortion terror group ""Jane's Revenge"" began targeting pro-life institutions ahead of the Supreme Court's June 24 ruling, which overturned Roe v. Wade. A post attributed to the group and published by so-called Abolition Media on June 14 stated ""Through attacking, we find joy."" To date, the violent collective has taken credit for at least 18 of 100 attacks, some of which involved firebombings and resulted in injuries.

In June, the FBI launched a domestic violent extremism investigation into these leftist attacks committed not only against pro-life organizations and crisis pregnancy centers across the nation, but against pro-life individuals and churches as well.

Despite the group's ISIS-style assumption of credit, there have reportedly been no arrests made so far.

Fox News Digital reported that, according to police, there have been no arrests made in connection with the attacks perpetrated against:

Numerous other pro-life centers, churches, memorials, and persons were targeted by the terror group, yet those contacted by Fox News Digital indicated they too have not been informed of any arrests.

The FBI wrote to CBN News earlier this month stating that it was still ""investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the US Supreme Court.""

""The incidents are being investigated as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, FACE Act violations, or violent crime matters,"" the letter continued, ""depending on the facts of each case.""

While no member of ""Jane's Revenge"" has reportedly been arrested, the U.S. Attorney' Office for the Western District of Michigan announced on August 4 that 25-year-old Joshua Brereton had been charged with setting a fire to the bushes outside a Planned Parenthood in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Jim Harden, the CEO of CompassCare, whose center was attacked by ""Jane's Revenge"" on June 7, suggested to the National Review that swift arrests of those antipathetic to the pro-abortion movement, like Brereton's, demonstrate a double standard on the part of law enforcement. ""Compare that with what happened to us,"" he said. ""We had an arson attack, which in criminal code is just below murder, and nobody has been arrested.""

Pressure and promises

On Jun 15, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, criticizing the Department of Justice for not having been ""faithful to its promise of ensuring the public's safety against these violent, radical activists."" Then, just as is the case now, Rubio noted that ""To date, there has not been a single charge brought against any individual or group despite the countless pro-life centers in America that have been firebombed and vandalized in recent months.""

The following day, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.) similarly wrote to Garland demanding that the DOJ take action — to ""bring charges against the perpetrators ... and investigate 'Jane's Revenge' as a domestic terrorist organization."" Failing to do so, wrote Cotton, Garland should resign.

120 House Republicans also urged the DOJ to investigate and prosecute the attacks.

On June 17, the FBI told Fox News that it was ""investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers and faith-based organizations across the country."" It noted further that ""The FBI takes all threats seriously and we continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners and will remain vigilant to protect our communities.""

In an August 4 judiciary committee meeting, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Republican Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) that those investigations were well underway.

Notwithstanding the suggestion that those responsible might be brought to justice, over a month later, there is at present only an indication from a Blue Ridge spokesperson that ""The FBI is continuing to follow leads.""

Counter-terrorism

Republican Rep. Jody Hice (Ga.) tweeted on Wednesday that ""Jane's Revenge"" was a far-left domestic terror group, and highlighted the pro-abortion group's original threats, which read: ""The leash is off ... We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.""



On June 23, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced the ""Protecting Mothers and Babies from Terrorism Act"" to designate ""Jane's Revenge"" as a terrorist organization, which Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) cosponsored. An additional seven Republican congressmen have since cosponsored the bill.

Se. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the ""Pregnancy Resource Center Defense Act"" on July 14 to ""provide adequate penalties and remedies for attacks on facilities providing counseling about abortion alternatives and attacks on places of religious worship."" The bill, if enacted, would increase penalties on those carrying out attacks as the proponents of ""Jane's Revenge"" have claimed to, such that misdemeanors would be treated as felonies.

Facebook, too, internally designated ""Jane's Revenge"" as a terrorist organization. An internal memo circulated to moderators within the organization described the pro-abortion group as ""a far-left extremist group ... responsible for multiple arson and vandalism attacks on pro-life institutions.""

Cross purposes

While some Republicans are seeking to bring the violent pro-abortion forces responsible for these attacks to justice, the Justice Department has created a pro-abortion task force to go around the nation achieving what ""Jane's Revenge's"" could only hint at in its graffiti.

The DOJ announced on July 12 that Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta would lead a task force to take action against state and local governments that implement or enforce pro-life laws that affect federal employees' efforts to procure abortions.

Garland issued a statement on August 2 indicating that the DOJ would ""use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure that women could procure abortions.

Not only is the DOJ openly antagonistic to the cause of the pro-life movement, a number of Democrats have employed violent rhetoric and voiced their support for pro-abortion street action.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision ""illegitimate"" and called for people to get ""into the streets.""

Cortez also tweeted that ""People will die because of this decision. And we will never stop until abortion rights are restored in the United States of America.""

Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier (Ca.) stated in June that ""There is a war out there. And we need to recognize that we've got to armor up.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) suggested that the pro-life centers targeted by ""Jane's Revenge"" need to be shut down ""all around the country."" She tweeted on June 27, ""it's more important than ever to crack down on so-called 'crisis pregnancy centers'.""

When asked whether Democratic rhetoric was prompting or exacerbating violence against pro-life institutions, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded by saying ""politicizing all of this is uniquely American"" and that she wouldn't ""be talking about that anymore.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbis-investigation-into-hundreds-of-attacks-by-pro-abortion-terror-group-yields-zero-arrests,2022-09-14
Federal Judge extends injunction against Biden's deportation freeze,"A federal judge in Texas has extended his previous order temporarily preventing the Biden administration from beginning its 100-day pause on deportations of illegal immigrants.

Fox News reported that U.S. District Court Judge Drew Tipton in the Southern District of Texas lengthened his suspension of the White House's deportation freeze for another 14 days to give the Biden administration and the state of Texas more time to ""provide for a more fulsome record"" to assist the court in ""adjudicating Texas's motion for a Preliminary Injunction.""

Additionally, the judge warned of ""the irreparable harm that would accrue to Texas if an extension"" was not granted. Though he did acknowledge the Biden administration's argument that ""the 100-day pause on removals is necessary to allow"" them to take account of ""important immigration, foreign policy, and humanitarian considerations.""

""The Court may ultimately be persuaded by the Defendants' arguments, but any harm they might incur between now and then does not outweigh the potential for irreparable harm to Texas,"" Tipton wrote.



As one of his first acts in office, President Joe Biden ordered Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to cease deporting some illegal immigrants for a period of 100 days. Biden's order instructed these agencies within the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a ""review and reset"" of the former President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement policies, allowing time for the Biden executive branch to begin reversing those policies.

Immediately after Biden signed his executive order, Texas took legal action to sue the Biden administration, seeking a court injunction to block Biden's deportation moratorium. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton claimed Biden's executive order ""violates the U.S. Constitution, federal immigration and administrative law, and a contractual agreement between Texas"" and the Department of Homeland Security.

In response to Texas' lawsuit, Judge Tipton issued a nationwide injunction forcing Biden to continue deportations until the case is resolved.

On Jan. 22, Fox News reported an internal email sent to ICE officers in Texas that gives insight into how Biden's executive order was enforced. The internal email instructed ICE to ""stop all removals"" and went on to say, ""Release them all, immediately. No sponsor available is not acceptable any longer.""

Biden's executive order paused deportations and ordered the release of all illegal immigrants detained by immigration enforcement authorities for minor offenses. Non-citizens who were suspected to have engaged in terrorism or espionage were exempt from the order and could still be deported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-extends-injunction-against-bidens-deportation-freeze,2021-02-09
"Lawsuit: Indiana corrections officer sold male inmates keys to women's facility, stood by during 'night of terror' that included rape resulting in miscarriage","Nearly 30 current and former inmates in the women's detention facility in Clark County, Indiana, have sued a local sheriff, a corrections officer, and several other ""unknown jail officers,"" alleging that they either actively or passively permitted male inmates to access the female housing pod and inflict a ""night of terror"" on female detainees.

According to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in New Albany, Indiana, 28 women allege that David Lowe, a corrections officer at the Clark County Jail, sold male inmates the keys to the women's facility for $1,000. Then late in the evening of October 23, 2021, the men entered the women's facility and attacked female residents for hours, while Lowe and other guards stood by and did nothing.

""This federal civil rights action arises from a night of terror at the Clark County Jail ... On the night of October 23, and into the early morning hours of October 24, 2021, numerous male detainees used the keys obtained from LOWE to enter Pods 4(E) and 4(F) where they raped, assaulted, harassed, threatened and intimidated the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit, and other women, for several hours, resulting in significant physical and emotional injuries.""

According to the lawsuit, at least two women were raped during the attack, and one of the victims became pregnant as a result of the assault and later miscarried.

""Since she had been in custody for numerous months, there is no chance she was pregnant before she entered the Clark County Jail,"" said William McCall, an attorney representing 20 of the women in the lawsuit. ""My client had a miscarriage in December 2021.""

Not only were the women brutalized, the lawsuit alleges, but they were subsequently subjected to harsh treatment from jail officials. After the attack, which was captured on jail surveillance, officers revoked the women's ""dark"" or ""lights out"" privileges at night, placed the residents in lockdown, and confiscated some of their personal belongings, including hygiene items.

Sheriff Jamey Noel is also named in the lawsuit.

""This was a complete and utter breakdown of the one thing that you should be relying, that you should be able to rely upon jails to provide and that's security. The response should be immediate. There are cameras in those pods specifically for that reason,"" said attorney Bart Betteau, who represents one of the women. ""And when this happens, in the night, men crashing through the door and you have zero control from that moment on, maybe you can start to understand the damages these women went through.""

Lowe was arrested within days of the incident and faces felony charges of escape, official misconduct, and trafficking with an inmate. His hearing is scheduled for November 2022. He has pled not guilty and told the Washington Post that the inmates stole the keys and that he had been ""coerced and assaulted into making a false confession.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/female-inmates-sue-for-night-of-terror,2022-08-02
"Female reporter comes out with bullying, intimidation allegations against Gov. Andrew Cuomo","A former journalist said recently that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and his administration bullied and attempted to intimidate her, according to the New York Post.

What is a brief history here?

The woman, Lindsay Nielsen, is just one of several people who have come forward with allegations that the New York governor bullied and attempted to intimidate them.

Karen Hinton, a woman who once worked as Cuomo's press secretary, says that the New York governor is a master of ""penis politics"" and has a ""penchant for bullying."" She also insisted that Cuomo worked to undermine her and her experience on a regular basis while under his employ.

New York journalist Morgan Pehme claimed last week that Cuomo ""terrorized"" him for doing his job as a journalist.

Cuomo also reportedly threatened Assemblyman Ron Kim (D) for calling out Cuomo's ""BS"" as the state's ongoing COVID-19-nursing home scandal continues to unfold. During a phone conversation, Cuomo reportedly told Kim, ""You have not seen my wrath. I have been biting my tongue for months. I can tell the whole world what a bad person you are and you will be finished. You will be destroyed.""

A Cuomo senior adviser hit back at Kim's claims, alleging that the assemblyman was ""lying about his conversation"" with the governor, and insisted Cuomo never made those remarks.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that reports about Cuomo's purported conversation were not surprising, and that the alleged bullying was ""classic Andrew Cuomo.""

""A lot of people in New York state have received those phone calls,"" he added. ""I believe Ron Kim and it's very, very sad. No public servant, no person who is telling the truth, should be treated that way. The threats, the belittling, the demand that someone change their statement right that moment — many, many times I've heard that and I know a lot of other people in the state that have heard that.""

What are the details?

In a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday, Nielsen wrote, ""'You have a vendetta against him don't you!' That was the last time I allowed someone connected to Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration to harass and manipulate me. It was during one of the many accusatory and threatening phone calls I received by his staff members that I realized this behavior was never going to stop.""

""It was shortly thereafter that I decided to leave my job at News10,"" she continued. ""The late night phone calls from the administration, the constant threats to call my boss, the incessant bullying to try and get me to stop doing my job and reporting specific stories ... it would never end. The tactics used were deliberate yet evasive. They skimmed the line of inappropriateness ever so delicately as to make you feel like they were acceptable.""

Nielsen concluded the post, ""I am writing this today to make sure that those involved in this behavior back then now know that not only was it not acceptable but also that it was damaging. I applaud those who have come forward recently with reports of similar behavior by the same administration.""

What else?

Nielsen told the New York Post that what she went through felt like ""personal attacks"" though she was simply trying to do her job as a journalist.

""It was very harassing,"" she added.

The Post reported, ""Nielsen explained that when she'd reach out to Cuomo's office for comment on a story she often would not get a response — only to then get a barrage of phone calls demanding changes after it was published.""

She told the outlet, ""They would make it person, claiming I have this personal vendetta against the governor, which is absolutely bogus. I was doing my job as a journalist. All I was ever trying to do was report the story, report the facts.""

Nielsen said that she decided to come forward with the accusations after other women stepped forward with what she said were similar stories.

""I don't want another reporter to have to go through that,"" she explained. ""That's why I did it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/female-reporter-cuomo-bullying-threatening,2021-03-01
"(Updated) Film crew union accused  of 'mob type tactics' after strike disrupts production of Steve Deace book adaptation, 'Nefarious'","A film crew in Oklahoma City on the set of a movie adaptation of BlazeTV host Steve Deace's book, "" A Nefarious Plot,"" has gone on strike, demanding that the production company recognize union representation for its crew members. The moviemakers have accused the involved out-of-state union of making false claims about their conduct, and of using ""mob type tactics"" against non-union workers.

About 40 workers walked off the set and stopped production on ""Nefarious"" Monday, forming a picket line to get the California-based production company, Nefarious Film LLC, to recognize the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as a collective bargaining agent for the crew. The workers are also demanding health and retirement benefits in their contracts. The strike has continued into Thursday.

Additionally, IATSE on Monday filed an unfair labor practice claim with the National Labor Relations Board against the production company, alleging that multiple employees were fired for supporting unionization and that others were ""interrogated,"" ""surveilled,"" or otherwise coerced once word of unionization spread.

Union representatives said on social media that the workers want a ""fair contract"" that provides ""industry-standard working conditions and benefits.""

""Right now, they just want to be recognized as union members,"" said IATSE Central Region Business representative Winona Wacker, in an interview with KWTV-DT.

""We are super invested in making this movie. A lot of these people are super invested in making this movie but there's been ... no progress,"" said Wacker.

In an interview, ""Nefarious"" co-screenwriter and co-director Chuck Konzelman categorically denied the accusations made in the labor complaint.

""No one has been fired. No one has been interrogated,"" said Konzelman, who is best known for co-writing the faith-based mega-hit ""God's Not Dead.""

When asked about the allegations of other ""coercive actions,"" he told TheBlaze that the union would likely consider flying in replacements to take over for the striking workers as coercive, but objected to that characterization.

Federal law guarantees that employees have ""the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,"" as well as the right ""to refrain from any or all such activities.""

The National Labor Relations Board website lists various examples of what may constitute an illegal attempt to ""to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights"" to unionize. Those actions include threatening employees with adverse consequences for forming a union; promising benefits if they reject unionization; coercively questioning employees about their own or coworker's union activities or sympathies; spying on employee's union activities; and more.



Konzelman said the film's production has been troubled from the start. ""Nefarious"" is a low-budget project, with just under $2 million approved for the film. It's also a short-term production — filming is supposed to take roughly two and a half weeks.

When the crew arrived in Oklahoma last July to begin shooting, an outbreak of COVID-19 swept through core personnel management and production was forced to shut down for several months. The production company had already paid for a set to be built, and rather than have it torn down, Konzelman said the company continued to rent the soundstage for five months ""at great expense,"" even though nothing was filmed.



The crew returned to start up preproduction again in late October, with the first three days of shooting happening just last week. Then on Friday, Konzelman's unit production manager informed him there were ""rumblings"" of a strike being called.

""We were surprised because our crew seemed very happy,"" Konzelman said.



The first official threat of a strike was made on Sunday, Dec. 6, in an email from an IATSE attorney to Nefarious Film LLC's attorney announcing the demand for union contracts.

The email, which was shared with TheBlaze, states that IATSE will not provide the production company with signed authorization for representation cards, which would indicate the number of workers who legally asked IATSE to represent them. The union also said they would not agree to hold a vote before calling a strike, ""due to the brevity of this production.""

""If your client chooses not to voluntarily recognize the I.A.T.S.E. as the collective bargaining agent, we are within our legal right to strike for recognition. I would say your clients know the strength of the crew’s support for organizing given their unlawful questioning of them yesterday but a strike for recognition would also legally demonstrate our majority status,"" the lawyer wrote.

When asked what IATSE's lawyer was referring to by ""unlawful questioning,"" Konzelman said one of Nefarious Film LLC's production staff informally polled department heads on Friday, asking if they were aware of a possible strike and whether their departments as a whole were inclined to walk out.

""Since the questions were asked outside, in the open air, one or more union people heard the question and were offended, saying words to the effect of 'you can't do that'. To which the production person responded that they weren't part of the conversation, and the question hadn't been asked of them,"" Konzelman told TheBlaze.

Federal law prohibits employers from polling employees to determine the extent of their support for a union unless they comply with certain safeguards.



On Monday, when the production team arrived for work, they were greeted by a picket line.

""The strike was called without a strike vote and there was no negotiation, really. They just said send us your budget and we'll tell you what you owe us, which we weren't prepared to do,"" Konzelman said.

IATSE representatives say this dispute is about negotiating for a fair union contract with standard fringe benefits, similar to dozens of union contracts for ultra-low budget films each year. Konzelman disputes this claim, noting that this is a ""lousy two million dollar film"" and that the production company was upfront that they would not provide health and retirement benefits for a film with such an ""abbreviated schedule.""

""We made the rates as high as we could on an individual basis early, which by the way, was still not very impressive because we were a very low-budget film. But everybody shook hands and said, 'yeah, we'll do it for that.' And then three days into shooting, suddenly, they couldn't do it for that anymore and we had to become a union shoot,"" said Konzelman.

Konzelman suggested there were political motivations behind the strike and IATSE's involvement.

""This is partly about suppression of conservative and faith-based media,"" said Konzelman, noting that the last film he made in Oklahoma, ""Unplanned,"" received ""such resistance nationally"" that he was invited by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to testify in the Senate on big tech censorship of conservatives.

He also said that the state of Oklahoma and its Right to Work law were targets for the union. He explained that Nefarious Film LLC is one of several film production companies pre-qualified for incentives under the state's Filmed in Oklahoma Act of 2021 — an incentive program that provides a rebate of up to 20% for qualified film and television productions if they are made in Oklahoma. The state wants to attract major motion picture companies to make movies there, and the Right to Work law means that film producers do not have to hire union workers to get their films made.

As a condition of qualifying for this incentive program, a film production company must meet certain criteria as laid out by law. If at any time a project fails to meet the criteria for a certain rebate that it was initially pre-qualified to receive, the state may reduce the size of the incentive offered or cancel it. One of those criteria is the number of ""apprentices"" claimed — an apprentice is an Oklahoma resident that is supervised by an experienced ""Master Tradesperson"" and is working on the project.

Konzelman says that IATSE is ""terrorizing down into the college level"" by threatening the apprentices hired to work on the film that ""if you cross that picket line, you're dead to the unions forever."" He said the point of keeping the apprentices from working was to make Nefarious Film LLC lose the incentives it was pre-qualified for. He characterized the union's alleged actions as ""mob type tactics"" and said the production company has approached the Oklahoma State Attorney General's office for relief.

Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor's office said it was contacted by one of the film's producers about potential concerns by employees.

""We offered and stand ready to investigate any complaints filed with our office by their employees who feel their rights as employees under state law are violated,"" Press Secretary Madelyn Sheriff said.

""We have not received any complaints from employees at this time,"" Sheriff added. ""Oklahoma is a right to work state and this office will vigorously investigate and enforce those laws for employees who file complaints.""

Steve Deace, the author of the book ""Nefarious"" is based on and one of the producers of the film, said in a statement that: ""Out of state unions are attempting to violate Oklahoma’s right to work law, as well as hijack the state’s film incentive program.""

""I think they chose our movie to make an example out of because they thought we would be easy prey since we’re an independent film,"" said Deace. ""They thought wrong.”

A spokesman for IATSE denied that the workers had political motivations behind demanding a union contract.



""It is profoundly disappointing to see this employer and state politicians turn this into a nonsensical political conspiracy theory when it’s not,"" said IATSE Director of Communications Jonas Loeb. ""Our people have been hired to build stages for Trump rallies, set up Republican National Conventions, and they do so flawlessly when asked. The content itself is irrelevant. Workers who asked for our help in forming a union even protested Michelle Obama’s book tour in 2019 in a remarkably similar situation.

""At the end of the day, the workers want to finish this movie, they just want a union contract while doing it,"" he said.

While the strike is ongoing, and Oklahoma's government has yet to act, Konzelman said ""Nefarious"" will resume shooting at the end of this week with replacement workers. He emphasized that none of the striking workers have been fired, and that the union's claims of wrongful terminations are ""deliberately false and malicious.""

""Since we have returned here in October there have been no terminations of any kind. No terminations of any kind for any reason,"" said Konzelman. ""Even the strikers, if they walked on set today, would still have a job.""

He offered an apology to the employees whose jobs have been disrupted by the strike.

""I just want to apologize to all the innocent people who've gotten caught up in this mess, which is not of our making and not of their making either. There are a lot of people who would like to work on this production. We want to be able to be working on the production and this union action is preventing us from doing so.""

""Nefarious"" is written and directed by Konzelman and Cary Solomon. It stars Sean Patrick Flanery as a convicted serial killer slated for execution who claims to be a demon. On the day he is to be put to death, he undergoes a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he's mentally fit to receive his sentence.

Solomon and Konzelman are producing ""Nefarious"" with Chris Jones and Sheila Hart.

"'This isn't protest. This is terrorism': Five Antifa extremists charged with domestic terrorism, pulled down from their treehouses","Five leftist extremists have been arrested and charged with domestic terrorism in Georgia after law enforcement finally responded to their violent months-long campaign aimed at halting the construction of new police training center in Dekalb County's South River Forest.

Although some of the alleged terrorists sought refuge in their nearby treehouses during the counterterrorism operation, the strong arm of the law managed to pull them down.

What are the details?

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced that a task force composed of GBI agents, Atlanta police, the FBI, the DeKalb County Police Department, and other agencies executed a successful operation on Tuesday to remove leftist barricades from the entrances to Atlanta's new $90 million police training center and to clear the area of criminal activity.

The operation was prompted by ""ongoing criminal activity at the site location,"" including ""carjacking, various crimes against persons, destruction of property, arson, and attacks against public safety officials,"" wrote GBI spokesman Nelly Miles.

Leftist attacks and threats in the area have become a common occurrence in recent months.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in October that the extremists — keen on halting construction of what they called ""Cop City"" on city property — hurled Molotov cocktails at police.

The leftist extremists reportedly also threatened contractors, destroyed equipment, and vandalized offices.

Richard Porter claimed that when he stopped briefly in the area, he was set upon by people apparently living in the woods and wearing ""camouflaged stuff.""

The extremists allegedly threw a ""gas bomb"" at Porter and then torched his truck.

WXIA reported that on Saturday, firefighters were dispatched to the area to put out a fire apparently set by the leftists. However, when they attempted to extinguish the flames, they were struck by rocks and firecrackers.

While leftist extremists reportedly pelted police and first responders alike with rocks and bottles on Tuesday, police appear to have answered back with pepper balls.

The task force that addressed the extremist threat this week arrested 22-year-old Francis Carroll of Maine, 25-year-old Nicholas Olson of Nebraska, 25-year-old Serena Hertel of California, 20-year-old Leonardo Vioselle of Georgia, and 22-year-old Arieon Robinson of Wisconsin, each of whom have been charged with domestic terrorism.



Vioselle is the only local among the five charged with terrorism.

The domestic terrorism charges could mean up to 35 years in prison for those so convicted.

The leftist extremists, held in jail without a bond, were also hit with various other charges, including criminal trespass, aggravated assault, obstruction, and interference with government property.



The GBI indicated that police found ""explosive devices, gasoline, and road flares"" in their search of the ""area of concern.""



Not protest but terrorism

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) tweeted, ""We will not rest when it comes to bringing domestic terrorists to justice, and these arrests should serve as a strong reminder of that.""

District Attorney Sherry Boston said in a release, ""I strongly believe in the right to peacefully protest for what one believes is right and just. However, I draw the line at violence, destruction of property, and threatening and causing harm to others. ... The alleged acts of violence at the training facility site put the public in grave danger, and will not be tolerated.""

Activists intimated at a press conference in southwestern DeKalb County that the criminality in the area will not end with these arrests, reported the Journal-Constitution.

Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum underscored how the violent and undemocratic tactics employed by the leftist extremists are unacceptable.



""The discourse of opposition is in city halls, it is in the public square, it is on the sidewalks. That is where you note your displeasure or your disagreement,"" Schierbaum told the Journal-Constitution. ""It is not in Molotov cocktails. It is not in shooting fireworks at firefighters ... it is not throwing rocks at our squad cars. That is criminal activity.""

Kamau Frankin, founder of the black identitarian group Community Movement Builders, said, ""I don’t think people are defeated. ... I think there are forest defenders who will continue to defend the forest. That means civil disobedience, that means rallies, demonstrations. That means all the tactics that we can use.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/five-antifa-extremists-charged-with-domestic-terrorism-pulled-down-from-their-treehouses,2022-12-16
"4 arrested for allegedly terrorizing elderly woman while wearing clown masks to rob her, police say one suspect had worked as her caretaker","Four people were arrested for allegedly wearing clown masks to terrorize and rob an elderly Florida woman, and police said one of the suspects had worked as a caretaker for her late husband.

The despicable incident unfolded in East Orange County in December.

Police said that the four people used clown masks to disguise themselves, and they used a sledgehammer to break down the woman's door. She told police she was awakened by the sound of her door being broken down.

One of the assailants used the sledgehammer to try to break into the woman's safe but was unsuccessful. They instead took the safe and left the house.

The woman told police that the robbers had gotten away with more than $40,000 worth of family heirlooms and jewelry in the safe.

Investigators suspected 23-year-old Melissa Martinez might be involved in the robbery when the victim's daughter told them that Martinez had the only key to the home after she had worked as a caretaker for the victim's husband, who had died.

Detectives then ran a pawn search on Martinez and found that she had pawned numerous items of jewelry on Dec. 1, including a 14k gold ring with three diamonds on it and a 14k gold cross pendant. Martinez had provided the pawn shop a phone number that matched the one provided to them by the victim's daughter.

Investigators also said that they were able to locate her phone at the scene of the home invasion before, during, and after the robbery.

Orange County deputies arrested Martinez along with 26-year-old Shakira Rivera Colon, 24-year-old Jaydie Cintron-Mayoral, and 42-year-old Nelson Cruz-Medina. They were charged with grand theft and home invasion robbery.

Here's a local news report about the incident:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-elderly-woman-clown-robbery,2023-01-07
Florida man with explosives arrested at Jan 6 rally,"A Florida man with an active pipe bomb was caught by police near a Tampa Bay-area rally in support of a participant of the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol building. Garrett James Smith, 22, was wearing identity-concealing black bloc clothing and gear that is commonly associated with Antifa members.

There was a crowd of approximately 85 protesters gathered at the Pinellas County Justice Center in Clearwater on Thursday night. The rally was to show support of Jeremy Brown — a former U.S. Army special forces soldier, member of the right-wing Oath Keepers group, and one-time congressional candidate — who was arrested on Sept. 30 for ""knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority"" during the Capitol riot. Brown is currently being held at the Pinellas County Jail without bond on federal charges.

""At approximately 7:24 p.m., deputies in the area observed a male, later identified as Smith, dressed in all black clothing, a face covering, and carrying a black backpack, running away from the direction of the protest,"" the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said in a press release.

Deputies pursued Smith and caught him about a block away from the Jan. 6 protest. Law enforcement arrested Smith on a charge of loitering and prowling. Police then found a ""pipe-type explosive device"" in Smith's backpack.

Pinellas County Sheriff's Office

Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said there was a black helmet in the backpack that has ""logos that have been seen in protests by groups in Oregon and other places of the country.""

According to Smith's family, he traveled to Portland, Oregon, and returned several months ago, Gualtieri said.

The helmet appeared to have three red arrows with a circle around them painted on it.

Writer Chris Tomlinson explained the origin of the ""Three Arrows"" symbol:

The Three Arrows, the symbol of the Eiserne Front (Iron Front), originate in Weimar Germany and were adopted by the Social Democrats (SPD) to fight the Nazis, Communists (who they rightfully saw as puppets of the Soviet Union) and Monarchists who wanted the Kaiser to return. The Iron Front were a paramilitary organization that believed in violence. More recently the Three Arrows have been adopted by the US Antifa movement.

Pinellas County Sheriff's Office

There was also a ""Direct Action Checklist"" in the backpack. The handwritten checklist has three categories: ""Clothing,"" ""Armor,"" and ""Gear.""

The list recommended wearing all black clothing, a balaclava, gloves, a black helmet, shaded goggles, a gas mask, knee pads, elbow pads, a sports chest plate, and a personal shield. The checklist also listed other questionable items such as smoke rockets, zip ties, duct tape, a black umbrella, black balloons, flammable rags, matches, a slingshot, pepper spray, a collapsible baton, construction nails, laser pointer, road flares, and binoculars.

Many of these items are synonymous with what Antifa members have used during protests and anti-government riots.

Pinellas County Sheriff's Office

Authorities searched Smith's residence in Oldsmar, Florida, where he lives with his parents. The search found more explosive devices, as well as tape and nails for use in grenades.

""Bomb squad investigators from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office and the Tampa Police responded to the home and determined the devices were homemade IEDs,"" The Post Millennial reported.

Gualtieri said during a Friday press conference, ""Smith refused to give any information, he refused to talk to deputies, so we really have no idea as to what his political leanings are and whether he supported or opposed the protesters at the jail. We also don't know exactly what his plan was or why Smith was running away from the protest area when he was apprehended by deputies and before he had an opportunity to detonate the explosive device.""

However, The Post Millennial noted, ""The arrest affidavit lists 'ANTIFA' and anti-government violent extremism as aggravating factors in his arrest.""



Smith — who does not have a criminal history — was charged with three counts of making and possessing a destructive device and one count of loitering and prowling. He is being held on a $300,250 bond.

""Smith has no criminal history, no social media accounts that we can find, and there's no prior intelligence information about Smith,"" Gualtieri said. ""Smith is what we call a 'sleeper,' and these are the most concerning individuals because there's no opportunity to intervene and thwart their criminal activity until they actually act.""



""We're fortunate in this situation that something caused Smith to flee before he ignited the explosive device and the deputies were able to apprehend him,"" Gualtieri added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-man-antifa-jan6-rally,2022-01-09
Former Israeli PM warns Americans that new Iran nuclear deal formed under Biden is 'even worse than its predecessor',"Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the United States on Sunday against entering into a new nuclear deal with Iran.

What is the background?

The Biden administration joined negotiations last year to re-establish the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the ""Iran nuclear deal,"" after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord in 2018.

Two weeks ago, the State Department said a new deal was imminent. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has complicated the negotiation process, and now the deal could fall through. Russia has been a lead negotiator on the new deal.

What did Netanyahu say?

As Israel's top leader at the time, Netanyahu vehemently opposed the Iran nuclear deal when it was first negotiated under the Obama administration. Iran, after all, refuses to recognize Israel's sovereignty and funds terrorist groups that attack Israel.

In a video published Sunday — the same day Iranian missiles struck an area around a U.S. consulate in northern Iraq — Netanyahu explained why the forthcoming deal is ""downright dangerous.""

""The desperate rush to sign this flawed nuclear agreement with Iran is not only absurd — it's downright dangerous,"" Netanyahu said.

""Yesterday, Iran fired missiles in the vicinity of the American consulate in Iraq, and the U.S. continues to charge ahead along with the other powers to sign a nuclear agreement that will give the Ayatollahs a nuclear arsenal,"" Netanyahu continued. ""It would also relieve sanctions and give them hundreds of billions of dollars in order to continue the terror that they waged yesterday and wage every day throughout the Middle East and the world.""

Netanyahu, a staunch supporter of the U.S., said the new deal negotiated under Biden ""is even worse than its predecessor because in three years' time, under this agreement, Iran will be a threshold nuclear state. It will have enough enriched uranium to create dozens and dozens of nuclear bombs and it will have the ICBMs to deliver them to any place in the United States,"" he warned.

""That is ... unbelievable. It's not merely unacceptable, it endangers not only my country, Israel, but your country, the United States, and the entire world,"" Netanyahu continued. ""We should not let an aggressive, rogue, terrorist regime like Iran have nuclear weapons.""

""Have we learned nothing?"" he asked.

"Former police officer allegedly massacred dozens of toddlers at Thailand day care facility, at least 37 dead: Report","A former police officer has allegedly terrorized a day care center in Thailand, killing at least 37 people, including himself.

According to reports, former Sergeant Panya Kamrap, 34, entered the the Child Development Center in Nong Bua Lamphu province around noon, perhaps searching for his 2-year-old stepson, who was often placed in care there, but who was not there that day. However, rather than leaving, Kamrap immediately began attacking teachers and children, witnesses said.

""I suddenly heard the sound, just sounded like firecrackers. So I looked back [and] the two staffs just collapsed on the floor,"" recalled one unidentified employee.

""Then he pulled another gun from his waist,"" the person added. ""…I didn’t expect he would also kill the kids.""

But, according to reports, that's exactly what he did. Police say that he then shot and stabbed nearly two dozen napping children, most of them age 3 and younger.

Kamrap opened ""fire while the kids were sleeping,"" claimed Maj. Gen. Jirapob Puridet of the Thai Central Investigation Bureau. Every child in that room except one died in the attack.

Witnesses claimed that Kamrap did not say anything before or during the ambush.

After he left the Child Development Center, police say he returned to his home, where he then murdered his wife and stepson before turning a gun on himself. In all, police estimate that 37 people have died in the attack, 24 of whom were children. One of the care workers at the facility who died was a woman who was eight months pregnant. Most of the deaths were the result of ""stabbing wounds,"" police said. The suspect's wife and stepson have been included in the death toll, but it is unclear whether Kamrap has as well.

Kamrap was a former policeman who was dismissed from his duties last year under suspicion that he was selling narcotics. Kamrap had been charged with selling narcotics and appeared in court earlier Thursday morning. The purpose of the court hearing and what happened during it are both unclear.

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who called the deadly incident ""shocking,"" is expected to visit the area on Friday to express his condolences and to assist the devastated community. CNN has described the province, located about 335 miles northeast of Bangkok, as ""a largely peaceful and quiet area"" where mass murders are ""rare.""

Former President George W. Bush will reportedly participate in an October fundraiser for Rep. Liz Cheney,"Former President George W. Bush is slated to support Republican Rep. Liz Cheney at a fundraiser in Dallas, Texas next month, according to reports.

Various other figures are listed for the event as well, including Karl Rove, and former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison who served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO during the Trump administration.

Cheney, who represents Wyoming's at-large Congressional District, was one of 10 GOP House members to vote in favor of impeaching then-President Donald Trump earlier this year in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The Senate, which voted on the matter after Trump had already departed from office, failed to clear the threshold necessary for conviction.

The House GOP ousted Cheney from her role as House Republican Conference Chair in May and then elected Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York to fill the vacancy.

Cheney, who has occupied the Wyoming congressional seat since 2017, is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney who served alongside President Bush for eight years.

She was tapped by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, to serve on the House select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

Earlier this month Trump issued a statement endorsing Harriet Hageman, who is aiming to defeat Cheney during the GOP primary.

""I strongly endorse Republican House of Representatives Candidate Harriet Hageman from Wyoming who is running against warmonger and disloyal Republican, Liz Cheney,"" Trump declared. ""Unlike RINO Liz Cheney, Harriet is all in for America First. Harriet has my Complete and Total Endorsement in replacing the Democrats number one provider of sound bites, Liz Cheney. Make America Great Again!""

Cheney responded on Twitter, ""Here's a sound bite for you: Bring it.""

Former President Bush delivered a speech earlier this month on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.

""And we have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within. There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home,"" Bush said. ""But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit. And it is our continuing duty to confront them.""

Trump lambasted Bush in a statement issued on Sept. 13.

""The World Trade Center came down during his watch. Bush led a failed and uninspiring presidency. He shouldn't be lecturing anybody!""

Former state senator is behind Pennsylvania billboards slamming Biden for 'Making the Taliban Great Again',"Former Pennsylvania state senator Scott Wagner is behind billboards in the Keystone State that prominently display the phrase ""Making the Taliban Great Again!"" alongside a graphic that looks like President Biden wielding a rocket launcher.

Wagner is a Republican who entered office on April 2, 2014 and resigned on June 4, 2018. He mounted an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid, losing to Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf during the 2018 election.

""The pull out rushed through by President Biden had made us the laughing stock of the world,"" Wagner wrote in an email, according to Fox News. ""The Taliban are openly stating that they ran the United States out of Afghanistan – they are now very emboldened.""



He said that the liberties ""young people have experienced since we landed in their country will be taken away now that the Taliban is in control.""

""What do we say to families who lost loved ones in the Middle East – the country these people served and died for left Afghanistan with its tail between its legs,"" he told the outlet. ""It seems that President Biden was hell bent on rushing out of Afghanistan – his ego and lack on information is going to prove to be very bad for the United States.""

The Biden administration has been widely criticized for bungling the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan.

The Taliban swiftly swept control in the country, seizing the capital city of Kabul last month. Billions of dollars of weaponry supplied to Afghanistan by the U.S. has been seized by the Taliban. U.S. troops and other individuals were killed during a terror attack in Kabul last month. The U.S. announced the completion of its pullout even as American citizens and Afghan allies remained stranded in Afghanistan.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified on Monday that as of the end of last week there were still Americans in Afghanistan who wanted to get out.

""So as of the end of last week, we had about a hundred American citizens in Afghanistan who told us that they wish to leave the country. And I want to emphasize that this is a snapshot in time. It's more accurately a moving picture, as you know, stepping back for a minute to know precisely at any given moment of time exactly how many American citizens are in any country,"" Blinken said to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, according to Fox News.

""It's something we can't and don't know. Americans are not required to register when they go to a foreign country or if they reside there. And so from the start of this effort, we've been engaged in an intense effort to identify every American citizen that we could in Afghanistan, to be in touch with them, in contact with them and to work with them if they wanted to leave,"" Blinken said, according to the outlet.

A recent Quinnipiac University national poll of adults found that while 31% approve of the way the president handled withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, a whopping 65% disapprove. And while 62% believe American troops will need to return to Afghanistan to combat terrorism, just 28% do not think so.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-state-senator-is-behind-pennsylvania-billboards-slamming-biden-for-making-the-taliban-great-again,2021-09-15
Fort Hood shooter congratulates Taliban for Afghanistan victory. Lawyer says killer is happy Biden capitulated to and is working with group that shielded al Qaeda.,"Former Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Islamic radical who murdered 13 people and wounded more than 30 at Fort Hood in 2009, is now celebrating the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan after President Joe Biden's botched pullout of U.S. forces and lauding the opportunity to install Sharia law in the region.

In a letter obtained by the Washington Examiner, the man who called himself a ""soldier of Allah"" and shouted ""Allahu Akbar!"" while murdering fellow troops and currently sits behind bars on death row at Fort Leavenworth, declared ""We Have Won"" and congratulated Taliban leaders for their victory after 20 years of American and international forces keeping the organization out of power following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

What did the letter say?

Hasan — whose horrific actions the Obama administration refused to treat as an act of terrorism and instead infamously called ""workplace violence"" — sent his letter to his attorney, retired Army Col. John Galligan, on Aug. 18 with instructions for the lawyer to ""communicate to the Taliban an leadership"" a personal message.

""All Praises be to All-Mighty Allah!"" Hasan began in his love note to the Taliban, extolling the greatness of their re-taking of control in Afghanistan.

His celebration was not solely because fellow Muslim radicals were in charge, but also because he saw the Taliban victory as another chance for Sharia law to get a foothold.

""Congratulations on your victory over those who hate for the Laws of All-Mighty God to be supreme on the land,"" he wrote. ""I pray to Allah that He helps you implement Shariah Law fully, correctly, and fairly.""

""We must learn from the nations of the past and not let our wretchedness overcome us thus earning His (God's) wrath. It is to All-Mighty God we give thanks,"" Hasan concluded.

Galligan, the Examiner reported, said that he was ""not at all surprised"" by Hasan's statement, since the convicted killer has ""always been consistent in the terms of his support for the governments to be rooted upon Sharia law.""

""Given the Taliban victory in Afghanistan and President Biden's apparent capitulation on many fronts, Nidal Hasan and I are anxious to see what, if any, action will be taken with respect to the individuals still incarcerated at Guantanamo,"" Galligan said, according to the Examiner.

The attorney echoed those sentiments in a statement to Fox News, adding that Hasan ""is pleased to see that the Biden Administration is now seemingly willing to engage with the Taliban as de facto government in Afghanistan.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fort-hood-shooter-nidal-hasan-congratulates-taliban,2021-09-09
French authorities arrest suspect in brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"French authorities have arrested a Saudi man who is suspected of being involved in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to reports from the BBC and The Washington Post.

What's a very brief history here?

Khashoggi, a former Washington Post journalist, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, sometime during October 2018 after having gone missing.

The journalist became a target after criticizing Saudi Arabian de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his country.

Assassins were said to have dismembered Khashoggi while he was still alive.

A Saudi Arabian court convicted eight people in connection with the 201 murder, sentencing five people to death and three to jail.

The death sentences were later overturned.

What are the details?

Authorities arrested 33-year-old Khaled Aedh Alotaibi at Charles-de-Gaulle airport on Tuesday, according to the report. He was reportedly trying to board a plane to Riyadh when he was detained.

Alotaibi is one of at least 26 Saudis wanted by Turkey in connection with Khashoggi's murder.

Alotaibi, a former Saudi royal guard, was said to be traveling under his own name upon detention.

Saudi Arabian officials initially said that agents killed Khashoggi in a ""rogue operation"" meant to persuade him to return to the kingdom. Turkish officials, however, said that agents acted on orders from above.

Bin Salman has denied any role in the death of the famed journalist.

CNN reported that Alotaibi was also one of at least 16 individuals who were banned from the United States by the State Department in April 2019 for what was said to be ""their roles in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.""

By 2020, the British government placed Alotaibi under sanctions, saying that he was ""involved in the unlawful killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul ... as part of the 15 man team sent to Turkey by Saudi authorities"" and ""involved in the concealment of evidence at the Saudi General Consul's residence following the killing.""

According to reports, proceedings for Alotaibi's extradition to Turkey have begun.

Anything else?

Hatice Cengiz, the late Khashoggi's fiancee, told CNN that the arrest appeared to be ""a very significant first step for justice for Jamal"" and said that justice should ""be allowed to take its proper course.""

""Those who executed the plan must not be used to shield those much higher up who gave the order for Jamal's brutal killing,"" Cengiz added in her statement to the network.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/french-authorities-arrest-suspect-in-brutal-murder-of-journalist-jamal-khashoggi,2021-12-07
French citizens in majority-Muslim countries warned to take precautions as Muslim anger boils over display of Mohammad cartoons,"In a sign of the growing tensions between France and much of the Muslim world, French citizens were warned by the French government on Tuesday about traveling abroad, particularly in some majority-Muslim countries where anger against France is running particularly high after French citizens displayed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in solidarity with schoolteacher Samuel Paty.

The controversy flared when Paty, a history teacher, displayed the cartoons of Muhammad to his class in October in order to make a point about free expression. The father of one of his students began an internet campaign against Paty, uploading videos to YouTube and Facebook, blasting the teacher, and claiming that he showed cartoons of Muhammad with his genitals exposed. The campaign caught fire in the Muslim world, with worldwide calls for reprisal against Paty and against the French government, who naturally refused to take action against Paty.

Ultimately, Paty was murdered and beheaded on Oct. 16 by an 18-year-old Chechen Muslim refugee named Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov, who was himself caught and killed by police as he attempted to flee the scene.

Paty's brutal murder, which was condemned as an act of Islamic terrorism by French President Emmanuel Macron, galvanized the French population and caused huge numbers of French citizens to publicly display cartoons of Muhammad in solidarity with Paty and principles of free expression.

This has served to further enrage the Muslim world, which has called for boycotts of French goods. Macron, for his part, has responded by condemning the ""separatism"" of France's large Muslim community, which he views as a threat to national security.

The anti-France anger has become so acute in some countries that France's foreign ministry warned its citizens traveling there on Tuesday to avoid all public gatherings and to specifically avoid dangerous protests occurring in those countries. Those countries include Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Mauritania. A statement released by the foreign ministry stated, ""It is recommended to exercise the greatest vigilance, especially while travelling, and in places that are frequented by tourists or expatriate communities,"" according to Reuters.

In addition to violent protests and calls for boycott, Turkish thug dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly questioned Macron's health for his refusal to crack down on displays of the cartoon, which led the French government to recall its ambassador from Turkey.

French President Macron accuses American media of 'legitimizing' Islamist violence,"French President Emmanuel Macron accused American media of ""bias"" and of ""legitimizing"" Islamic violence in a phone call with a New York Times columnist, the paper reported Sunday.

Macron called Times media columnist Ben Smith to complain about how American media has covered the French government's response to terrorism. During the call, Macron argued that English-language coverage of recent Islamic terror attacks in France and the French government's crackdown on Islamic extremism in response has been unfairly characterized as racist or Islamophobic by the media.

""When France was attacked five years ago, every nation in the world supported us,"" President Macron said, referring to the Nov. 13, 2015, coordinated terrorist attacks at the Bataclan theater, outside a soccer stadium, and at Parisian cafes.

""So when I see, in that context, several newspapers which I believe are from countries that share our values — journalists who write in a country that is the heir to the Enlightenment and the French Revolution — when I see them legitimizing this violence, and saying that the heart of the problem is that France is racist and Islamophobic, then I say the founding principles have been lost,"" he continued.

The Times reports that more than 250 people have died in terror attacks in France since 2015. Last month, a French teacher was beheaded by a Chechen refugee in apparent retaliation for showing his class a cartoon of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Following that attack, three more people were brutally assaulted and one of them was beheaded inside a church in Nice.

In response to the threat of Islamic terror, Marcon's administration ordered a crackdown on extremism, initiating raids of suspected terrorists' homes, dissolving associations accused of spreading Islamic propaganda, and targeting terrorist funding. Macron has also denounced what he calls ""Islamist separatism."" In a major speech delivered in October, Macron said Muslims living in France under their own religious laws and within their own religious communities present a danger to the country by forming a ""counter-society."" He announced several policies that are intended to make Islam in France inclusive of French citizenship, including strictly monitoring sports organizations and other associations to stop the spread of Islamist teaching; ending the practices of imams being sent to France from abroad; increasing oversight of funding for mosques; and restricting homeschooling. The goal, as Macron states, is to craft a modern ""Islam of the Enlightenment.""

Muslims around the world have called for boycotts against French goods and responded with outrage to the French government's policies. An opinion article published by the Financial Times on Nov. 3 declared, ""Macron's war on Islamic separatism only divides France further,"" arguing Macron's policies were alienating peaceful Muslims.



Macron's critics in the media have accused him of implementing policies that discriminate against the Islamic faith, but Macron says American media doesn't understand the French policy of ""laïcité,"" or ""secularism."" The French government maintains an active separation of church an state, and the purpose of these policies is to ensure that the practice of Islam in France respects French law and French citizenship.

""We don't believe in political Islam that is not compatible with stability and peace in the world,"" Macron said in October. He defined ""Islamist separatism"" as ""a conscious, theorised, politico-religious project, which is materialised by repeated discrepancies with the values of the republic, which often results in the creation of a counter-society and whose manifestations are the dropping out of school of children, the development of sports, cultural and communal practices which are the pretext for the teaching of principles which do not conform to the laws of the republic""

Macron believes America's experience with racism has biased the media's judgement and caused a misunderstanding of what the French government is trying to accomplish.



""There is a sort of misunderstanding about what the European model is, and the French model in particular,"" Macron told the Times. ""American society used to be segregationist before it moved to a multiculturalist model, which is essentially about coexistence of different ethnicities and religions next to one another.""

""Our model is universalist, not multiculturalist,"" he continued. ""In our society, I don't care whether someone is black, yellow or white, whether they are Catholic or Muslim, a person is first and foremost a citizen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/french-president-macron-accuses-american-media-of-legitimizing-islamist-violence,2020-11-16
"French schoolgirl's accusations got her teacher beheaded, sparked violent riots. Now she admits she made it all up.","In a shocking development in a case that stunned France last year, a schoolgirl has admitted she made up accusations against her former teacher that sparked a hate campaign, which led to his gruesome murder and sparked violent riots in the country.

What are the details?

Samuel Paty, a history teacher in west Paris, was beheaded last October by an 18-year-old Chechen Muslim refugee named Abdoullakh Anzorov, after controversy erupted over his alleged anti-Muslim classroom presentation during a lesson on free speech.

The 13-year-old student, whose identity has been protected, reportedly told her father that Paty showed degrading images of the Muslim prophet Muhammed in class. After learning of Paty's alleged behavior, the student's father filed a legal complaint and launched an internet campaign against the teacher, slamming Paty in Facebook and YouTube video uploads, claiming that the teacher showed cartoons of Muhammed with his genitals exposed.

The campaign set off a firestorm in the Muslim world, fomenting widespread anger towards Paty, who was murdered a mere 10 days after the accusations were first made. In addition to resulting in Paty's murder, the accusations also sparked violent riots across the country that led to the deaths of at least three others.

But now, the girl has reportedly confessed to police that she lied.

The girl's lawyer, Mbeko Tabula, confirmed on Monday that her client was not even in attendance at the class during which she alleged the incident took place.

""She lied because she felt trapped in a spiral because her classmates had asked her to be a spokesperson,"" Tabula further told the AFP news agency.

According to the French newspaper Le Parisien, the girl lied to her father to keep him from knowing that she had been suspended by the school for cutting class.

""She would not have dared to confess to her father the real reasons for her exclusion shortly before the tragedy, which was in fact linked to her bad behavior,"" the newspaper reported.

What else?

According to BBC, shortly after Paty's murder, prosecutors alleged that there was a ""direct causal link"" between the online hate campaign against the teacher and his eventual murder.

Now, the 13-year-old has been charged with slander and her father with being ""complicit in a terrorist killing,"" the Independent reports. Though Tabula argues the girl should be protected and her father blamed for ""excessive and disproportionate behavior.""

The perpetrator, Anzorov, was tracked down by police and shot dead as he attempted to flee the scene. The French government characterized the incident as an Islamic terrorist attack.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/french-schoolgirl-lied-samuel-paty,2021-03-09
Fresno law enforcement rages at Calif. Gov. Newsom: 'The blood of the children being shot by out-of-control gang members in our city is on your hands',"Local law enforcement officials in San Quentin, California, blamed an increase in violent crime in Fresno County on Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and his progressive bail policies, slamming the state for prioritizing a ""political agenda"" over the lives of California citizens.

Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Fresno County District Attorney Lisa Smittcamp called on Newsom to stop releasing criminals from prison because of the coronavirus and end zero-dollar bail policies she says are leading to increases in violent crime.



""Stop using COVID-19 to promote your political agenda. The blood of the children being shot by out-of-control gang members in our city is on your hands, and on the hands of every person who does not make public safety a priority,"" Smittcamp said.

The press conference took place on the same day that San Quentin Officials weighed a decision to appeal the state's release of more than 1,100 inmates, KMJ reported. On Wednesday, a California appeals court ordered state corrections officials to parole or transfer the inmates serving time in San Quentin State Prison, citing officials' ""deliberate indifference"" to the health and safety of the convicted criminals during the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year the prison experience an outbreak of the coronavirus, leading to 2,200 infections at its peak and the deaths of 28 inmates.

Labeling the outbreak ""the worst epidemiological disaster in California correctional history,"" the court ruling blasted the prison's decision not to cut the inmate population by half, as recommended by experts, as ""morally indefensible and constitutionally untenable.""



But from the perspective of Smittcamp and law enforcement agencies in San Quentin, it's releasing violent criminals and endangering public safety that's morally indefensible.



""The law enforcement agencies represented behind me are the ones fighting on the front lines to bring peace to our community. We are in some of the most violent times that we have ever seen. … In the midst of this, our last two governors vowed to close state prisons. Governor Newsom announced that he will close the state prison facility in Tracy, California, on September 30, 2021,"" Smittcamp said.

""Why is this relevant to why we are here today? It is relevant because we are lacking bed space to house local criminals who are shooting up our cities and killing our children and each other,"" she continued.

""[Governor Newsom's] solution to COVID protection and prevention is letting them out of prison with no regard for their victims and the communities they will return to terrorize,"" Smittcamp declared. ""So I just said it: Governor: open up the prisons. Do your job. Manage.""

Local officials in Fresno County say that since zero-dollar bail and early release policies went into effect in April, gang activity and violent crime have surged.

Zero-dollar bail was a policy put in place by the California Judicial Council to reduce the bail requirements for most misdemeanor and lower-level felonies to $0. Most violent crimes are exempted from the policy, meaning bail remains for charges of sexual assault, gun crimes, domestic violence, or people under court-ordered restraining orders. The policy was intended to reduce the strain on the court system during the pandemic and lower the spread of coronavirus in jails.

But police say that shootings are up 126% and murders rose 55% since the policy was implemented. According to police, 80% of the homicides are gang-related, KGPE reports.

""This is a crime wave that's happening in our city,"" Fresno City Council member Mike Karbassi said on Oct. 7.

Smittcamp explained that in response to the surge of crime, more exemptions are being added to the zero-dollar bail policy.



""The court has slowly started here in Fresno to exempt certain crimes from zero-dollar bail,"" Smittcamp said. ""What we just did last week was not only add to the list, which had already been amended earlier, a few weeks earlier, about six weeks earlier, we added further zero-dollar bail exemptions, meaning exempted crimes that were not set from zero-dollar bail, but we also were able to request, and that request was granted by the court, to increase the bail amounts for gang and gun crimes.""

Still, the reality of violent crime is affecting the very communities progressives say are most important.



""The last four or five women in this community, and the last four or five victims in this community that have been killed and shot — innocent women, innocent people caught in gunfire — have been women of color. It is enough. Enough is enough. It's time for it to stop,"" the district attorney concluded.

Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims also spoke at the press conference, adding, ""Pointing the finger at the state is the absolute right thing to do because nearly 20% of our jail population is comprised of state inmates that are sentenced that are ready to go on to state prison. However, the reception centers are closed. They're actually timing out in local custody and being released and never moving on to state prison because they've been there so long.""

"Gen. Milley admits Afghanistan 'very likely' to become safe haven for terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, ISIS","Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley admitted Saturday that Afghanistan, in the hands of the Taliban, is ""very likely"" to become a safe haven for terrorist groups, like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.

What did Milley say?

While speaking with Fox News, Milley said the resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan could happen ""within 12, 24, 36 months.""

""My military estimate is that the conditions are likely to develop [into] a civil war,"" Milley said. ""I don't know if the Taliban is going to able to consolidate power and establish governance.""

""But I think there's at least a very good probability of a broader civil war and that will then in turn lead to conditions that could, in fact, lead to a reconstitution of Al-Qaeda or a growth of ISIS or other myriad of terrorist groups,"" he added.

Milley explained the current ""challenge"" for the U.S. is conducting counter-terrorism operations without a military presence in Afghanistan. However, Milley said such operations would continue in an effort to protect the U.S. and its allies.

The top military commander later said ""it is too early"" to say whether American forces would return to Afghanistan, but he did not discount the possibility.

Milley's comments mirror what he told lawmakers last month immediately following the collapse of Kabul. Milley told Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) the Taliban's swift victory would accelerate the threat of terrorist groups reconstituting in Afghanistan.

The Taliban, in fact, freed top Al Qaeda terrorists and ""thousands"" of ISIS-K fighters from Afghanistan prisons.

What is the significance of Milley's admission?

If Milley is correct about the future of Afghanistan, then it would essentially nullify the American military campaign there that spanned nearly two decades, cost trillions of dollars, and resulted in the deaths of thousands of U.S. service members and more than 100,000 Afghans.

In fact, the stated reason for invading Afghanistan in Oct. 2001 following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was to uproot the Taliban-controlled government, which had provided terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, with a safe haven to plot terrorist activity.

What, then, was the point of the war if Afghanistan once again becomes a base of operation for international terrorists? That is a question President Joe Biden will be forced to answer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gen-milley-afghanistan-very-likely-terrorism-safe-haven,2021-09-05
2 dead after gender reveal party in Cancun ends in plane crash,"Two people are reported dead after a gender reveal party in Cancun, Mexico, ended with a plane — streaming a sign that the baby would be a girl — nosediving into the ocean.

What are the details?

An expectant couple and their guests were filming the small propeller plane on a boat in the Caribbean Ocean when the tragic incident took place, the Daily Mail reported. In a video of the reveal, people can be heard shouting in celebration, ""It's a girl!"" before the camera catches the plane plunging into the water.

The plane, reportedly a Cessna 206, made a swooping turn over the party boat before appearing to lose speed and begin a rapid descent. The Spanish-speaking spectators could be heard shrieking in terror after seeing the plane crash.

Two individuals, a pilot and co-pilot, were onboard the plane at the time of the crash. One had reportedly died by the time medical first responders arrived on the scene while the other died as paramedics conducted an operation on dry land.

Mexican authorities are said to be investigating the incident.

According to the Daily Mail, the plane, which had been rented for the party from a company called Xomex, took off from a location around 40 miles northwest of Cancun before making its flyby in the Nichupte lagoon.



Right as the plane was approaching, a spectator on the boat reportedly said, ""It's all good as long as it doesn't end up crashing into us.""

What else?

The incident quickly garnered international attention because it happened during a gender reveal party. Such parties, which have become wildly popular in recent years, have also sparked significant backlash for the unintended consequences that continue to happen as a result.

In February, a father-to-be in New York died while trying to put together an explosive device for the celebration. The device was supposed to explode in a cloud of colorful powder but instead sent a piece of shrapnel flying.

Earlier in the same month, a gender reveal party in Michigan similarly claimed the life of an attending friend who was fatally struck by a piece of shrapnel.

Perhaps the most well-known disaster attributed to a gender reveal party occurred last year in California when a couple shot off a pyrotechnic device that sparked the massive El Dorado Fire.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gender-reveal-plane-crash-kills-two,2021-04-01
George W. Bush compares 9/11 terrorists to 'violent extremists at home' in commemorative speech,"Former President George W. Bush on Saturday seemingly compared ""violent extremists at home"" to the Al Qaeda terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

The comparison was widely reported as a thinly veiled allusion to those Americans who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

What did Bush say?

While commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, which happened during his first presidential term, Bush warned of ""growing evidence"" that terrorism threats do not only come from abroad.

""We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within,"" Bush said. ""There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home.""

""But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit. And it is our continuing duty to confront them,"" he continued.

The Washington Post reported that Bush, [w]ithout naming it, Bush seemed to condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol."" CNN agreed, publishing a story with the headline, ""Bush alludes to US Capitol rioters when condemning violent extremists behind 9/11 attacks.""

Bush delivered his speech at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Forty people — 33 passengers and seven crew members — were aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when it was hijacked by terrorists. Those passengers and crew members bravely thwarted the terrorists' plan to fly that plane into the U.S. Capitol building or White House. After storming the flight deck, United 93 crashed in rural Pennsylvania.

What did Bush say about the Capitol Riot?

Bush vocally condemned the events of Jan. 6, releasing a statement that called the riots ""sickening and heartbreaking.""

""This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic — not our democratic republic,"" Bush said.

""I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,"" Bush continued. ""The violent assault on the Capitol — and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress — was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes. Insurrection could do grave damage to our Nation and reputation.""

""In the United States of America, it is the fundamental responsibility of every patriotic citizen to support the rule of law,"" Bush added. ""To those who are disappointed in the results of the election: Our country is more important than the politics of the moment. Let the officials elected by the people fulfill their duties and represent our voices in peace and safety.""

Gina Carano wonders why there's no backlash to Susan Sarandon's Holocaust post that is nearly identical to the one she shared that got her fired from Disney,"Avowed leftist Susan Sarandon posted a message on social media that compared the current political climate to Nazi Germany. Conservative-leaning Gina Carano shared an image similar to the one Sarandon posted. However, only Carano suffered so much backlash that she lost a major Hollywood.

In February 2021, Carano posted a message on her Instagram with a photo of people living in terror during the Lviv pogroms of 1941.

The post read: “Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors…even by children.”

“Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews,” the post said. “How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?”

The post warning about dehumanizing other human beings because of their political leanings drew outrage.

The next day, Lucasfilm issued a statement that said, “Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future. Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.”

The same day, the influential United Talent Agency (UTA) dropped Carano as a client.

At the time, Carano was a star on the massively popular Disney series ""The Mandalorian."" Being fired from the Disney+ ""Star Wars"" TV series was a major blow for the MMA fighter turned actress.

Carano believed the message ""would bring people together.""

""But now after hearing so much, I actually have grown through the experience of [realizing] it’s not fair to the Jewish community to just throw this out here so much,"" Carano said. ""When you say the word ‘Nazi’ and when you call someone a ‘Nazi,’ you need to have a little bit more respect on it. So, I understand that. But it was in no way my intention.""

This week, Susan Sarandon posted a similar post on social media that read:

It didn’t start with gas chambers. It started with one party controlling the media. One party controlling the message. One party deciding what is truth. One party censoring speech and silencing opposition. One party dividing citizens into ‘us’ and ‘them’ and calling on their supporters to harass ‘them.’ It started when good people turned a blind eye and let it happen.



Sarandon's tweet racked up nearly 200,000 likes.

Carano reacted to Sarandon's post with a snarky GIF questioning the apparent double standard.

Sarandon currently stars in the TV series ""Monarch"" that airs on Fox and Hulu – which Disney both owns. Since posting the Holocaust meme on Monday, Sarandon has yet to face any real backlash or cancel culture pressure.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gina-carano-susan-sarandon-holocaust,2022-10-30
Violent 11-year-old girl is terrorizing unsuspecting people in Boston. Cops know all about her — but can't do much because of her age.,"A violent 11-year-old girl has been terrorizing unsuspecting people in Boston, roaming the streets with a crew of other violent juveniles — but while police know all about the young girl, authorities can't do much because of her age.

Say what?

A particular group of juveniles has been responsible for several violent, unprovoked attacks in the city in recent weeks, WFXT-TV reported. Last month the group attacked an 81-year-old man and covered him with whipped cream inside a Downtown Crossing McDonalds, WFXT said. Also last month, the same juveniles kicked and punched a woman — calling her a ""white b***h with braids"" — in the same area.

Toward the end of its video report, WFXT said several teens were charged in both incidents — except for a girl who is only 11 years old.

Then on Wednesday night, two students from Suffolk University in Boston were physically attacked on Boston Common by the same group of teens, WFXT said.

Police believe the main instigator in the attack was that same 11-year-old girl, the station said.

What are the details?

At 6:30 p.m. the teens were harassing a woman and her child near the Earl of Sandwich shop on the common, and two Suffolk students tried to help, WFXT said.

“As the woman walked away the group began swearing at her,"" according to a police report, the station said.

With that, the Suffolk students told the teens to leave the woman alone — and then the teens took aim at the students, WFXT reported.

“At this point the slim, black juvenile female began punching [her] and knocked her glasses off her face,"" the police report said, according to the station. ""She then stepped on her glasses before punching her again.""

One of the students shot video of the incident, WFXT said, adding that police identified the main instigator as an 11-year-old and said she's well known to officers and is responsible for terrorizing unsuspecting citizens of downtown Boston. WBZ-TV reported that police identified the girl because of the recorded video.

But because of her age, the 11-year-old girl won't be formally charged — just issued a summons, WBZ-TV reported. Investigators said they cannot prosecute anyone under the age of 12, WBTS-CD said.There were were five juveniles in the attacking group on the commons consisting of kids no older than 14, WBZ said.

As you might guess, Suffolk students and local business owners are nervous.

“This is my first semester in Boston,"" Emma Fairfield, a new sophomore at Suffolk, told WFXT. ""So, hearing about some of this stuff is kind of scary.""

Christopher Tinney, general manager of Earl of Sandwich, added to the station that knowing the time that this latest incident occurred on a Wednesday evening, it could easily ""happen on a Friday or a Saturday night or any week from now on, and that is kind of scary.""

Madison Amaral, also a Suffolk sophomore, also told WFXT that he and other students ""walk home in groups and stuff, always ready with our phones.""

Yet another attack by the same group

The station said new video shows the same group of juveniles terrorizing the Silvertone Bar & Grill in Downtown Crossing in late March. Citing a police report, WFXT said the teens demanded drinks and shouted at customers — and one teen even pulled a knife on a witness.

While the owner got the teens out, they returned and smashed the front doors, leaving shards of glass all over the floor, the station said.

"Glenn Beck travels to Middle East, shares updates from Afghanistan rescue efforts and photos featuring scores of Afghan Christians boarding private planes","Conservative firebrand Glenn Beck's and the Nazarene Fund's incredible efforts in rescuing Afghan Christian refugees are paying off, and Beck and the Nazarene Fund together have been able to free scores and scores of people from war-torn Afghanistan.

At the time of this reporting, the Nazarene Fund has raised more than $30 million to aid in the rescue of Afghan refugees.

What are the details?

In an early Wednesday morning Instagram update, Beck wrote, ""I cannot specify for international relations and security reasons exactly where I am today, but I am in the Middle East at the home base of operations for @thenazarenefund. I will try to join radio/podcast right at the top 9amE on @theblazetv.""



Later Wednesday morning, it was reported that the Nazarene Fund had already rescued hundreds of Afghan Christian families after having arrived there earlier this week.

Late Tuesday night, Beck shared video of himself from what appeared to be a plane, in which he said, ""Just got a briefing a few minutes ago on what's been happening today and what's been going on overseas. We are still moving people at this point, it's like you're a Christian, you're a female judge, I don't care, get on the plane, from Afghanistan. It is horrible, horrible to hear that we are now cutting our time short — 72 hours — why is the United States now making a bad situation much, much worse by having them cut our deadline?

""And now ISIS and the Taliban are outside of the gate and they're fighting with each other,"" Beck continued. ""All that has to happen is for the Marines to go through the gate and say, 'Back your ass up and get out. We'll see you on the 31st.' But for some reason we're not doing it. I don't understand it. America — we are not these people. We do not leave people behind — ever. Ever.

""Call your senator, call your congressman, tell them to put the heat on the State Department,"" he urged. ""This is not the military; this is the administration and the State Department. Call them. Believe me. They need to hear from you right now. This is an abomination, what is happening. So you know, there is a lot of good that is happening as well. Mainly from other countries, but also from private citizens.""



He continued, ""The last update I have we were at $30 million. We are doing our best to make sure that every dime goes to the people who need it. Right now it's just paying for airplanes. Unfortunately, some of those airplanes — far too many of them — are sitting on a tarmac waiting for the State Department clearance. Please pray for all of those people who are in harm's way. Lord, we ask that you would just watch over them, keep them safe, if they are at the gates, Lord, let those gates open up for them, find a way in to the tarmac and for our planes to get off the ground and get to someplace safe. We also are very, very grateful for all of the countries that now want to remain nameless because they don't think the United States will support them — what does our support even mean anymore? They are afraid of being outed as a country that's taken some of these refugees because they know that the world has fallen to terror.""

That same night, Beck shared an update on Facebook, writing, ""Operation Nazarene Rescue: flight three has just taken off. Now 1200 Christians evacuated and flown to safety. It has been a good day! Thank you for the outpouring of prayers and support! Because of The Power Of One people will LIVE. Wow! Thank you for donating to @mercuryone.org and @thenazarenefund. America does care! America does not leave her own and the most vulnerable behind. WE CAN DO IT AS THE POWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE. We are America not our government. When they can't do it, private citizens step to the plate.""

Beck previously stated that by the end of a week, the Nazarene Fund will be able to move at least 7,000 Christians out of Afghanistan and into safety as the Taliban continues to exact dangerous treatment on those in Kabul and across the country.

In an Instagram video taken last week before he departed for the Middle East, Beck said that ""chaos at the airport"" was creating incredibly frustrating conditions at the time.

""However,"" he countered, ""we have lots of people on the tarmac now, these Christians we told you about, and more coming. We have engaged 20 757s minimum all lined up, ready to go. Because you donated to the Nazarene Fund, we can do this.""

He added, ""By the end of the week, we will be able to move 7,000 Christians. It's pretty remarkable.""

Earlier Tuesday, Beck took to Facebook where he wrote, ""Oh happy day! While we slept, @thenazarenefund was busy loading planes. This was the second plane load of Afghanistan Christian refugees leaving Kabul. More to come! Thank you for your prayers and kindness. We heal ourselves when we heal others.""

Glenn Greenwald calls out Democrats for 'absolute lie' about Pulse Nightclub massacre,"Journalist Glenn Greenwald called out Democratic senators on Saturday who he said were spreading an ""absolute lie"" about the tragic Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people in June 2016.

What are Democrats saying?

To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragedy, which came on Saturday during Pride Month, Democratic senators posted messages to social media claiming the victims of the Pulse Nightclub massacre were targeted because of their sexual orientation.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.): ""5 years ago, we lost 49 people in a deadly, hate-filled shooting at the Pulse nightclub. The LGBTQ+ community was targeted and killed—all because they dared to live their lives. Once again I say: hate has no place here. And we must end the gun violence epidemic.""

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.): ""Today we #RememberPulse. 49 lives lost to senseless gun violence and anti-LGBTQ hate. A tragedy that is still hard to comprehend. But tomorrow, with Pulse always in our minds, we continue the fight to end gun violence and hatred. We will not rest until we do.""

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.): ""5 years ago we lost 49 beautiful souls at Pulse nightclub. I continue to hold in my heart those who were killed, their loved ones & the survivors of this unspeakable act of hate toward the #LGBTQ+ community. We must #EndGunViolence & build a nation based on love for each other.""

What did Greenwald say?

Greenwald called out the senators for misrepresenting the motive behind the Pulse Nightclub massacre. It was not, in fact, anti-LGBT animus, but the perpetrator was a terrorist who sworn allegiance to the Islamic State and chosen Pulse Nightclub at random.

""Democratic Senators and activist groups promoting a false, conclusively disproven narrative about the Pulse shootings for their own benefits. Anti-LGBT animus was not part of that massacre. It dishonors the memory of the victims — & the LGBT cause — to lie about what happened,"" Greenwald said.

He then called out Duckworth, specifically.



""This tweet is an absolute lie. Every journalist who covered the PULSE shootings and trial will tell you this. It's infuriating to watch Senators blatantly lie this way,"" Greenwald said. ""[The killer] had no idea PULSE was a gay club. He spent the prior day looking at Disney locations, but they were too secured. He entered 'Club, Orlando' in Google — not 'gay club' — to find it. He never uttered an anti-LGBT syllable, saying his motive was US bombing in Iraq/Syria.""

""Even NBC News has acknowledged that the PULSE massacre was not motivated by anti-LGBT sentiment. Their article is definitive as it should be. The evidence leaves no doubt. There's no excuse for Senators and LGBT groups perpetuating this lie,"" Greenwald continued, linking to NBC News' story about the massacre.

The NBC News story explained:

[D]uring the trial of [the killer's] widow, Noor Salman, all forensic evidence suggested that up until the moment he turned into the Pulse parking lot, [the killer] had been considering other venues, rejecting them because they were more heavily guarded. In their closing statement, government prosecutors admitted that there was no evidence to suggest that [the killer] knew that Pulse was a gay club.



Indeed, during the massacre, the killer phoned 911 and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, solidifying what prosecutors said was the real motive behind the crime.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/glenn-greenwald-calls-out-democrats-for-absolute-lie-about-pulse-nightclub-massacre,2021-06-13
Gold Star family denies audience with Biden after son’s Kabul murder: ‘Everything he has done was completely wrong’,"A Gold Star family said that they refused to meet with President Joe Biden after their loved one's murder in Kabul, Afghanistan, in a suicide bombing last week.

What are the details?

In a Thursday evening interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, fallen Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum's father Jim McCollum and sister Roice McCollum said that Biden offered no sympathy following Rylee's sudden death and made it about his own loss instead.

Hannity began the segment with the McCollums by lauding Rylee's sacrifice for the country, calling him and his 12 fellow service members who were killed in the attack ""the best America had to offer"" and the country's ""national treasure.""

""Young, bright, selfless people willing to put their lives on the line for all of us to serve their country,"" Hannity added. ""I don't know how you recover. ... I don't know how you deal with something as tragic as this. What angers me the most is that this was preventable. Because we saw that they were on the march, he knew that they were on the march, and he didn't lift a finger. And when we had control of Kabul, we could have withdrawn our troops, our allies, taken our equipment home with us or destroyed it — something but give it to them. I don't know, I'm having a hard time absorbing the circumstances.""

In remarks, the family agreed and detailed why they decided against a personal meeting with the president following the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan.

""That's one of the reasons I chose not to speak with President Biden,"" Jim responded to Hannity. ""Everything he has done was completely wrong. We had opportunities to do this the right way, and we absolutely failed miserably as an administration. I can't blame the entire thing on one administration; it goes back ... we're 20 years into this, but when it came down to pulling people out and pulling troops out and leaving the country, there was no — you couldn't have picked a worse way to go about it.""

Roice also recalled the moment when she and her sister-in-law attended the president's meeting with other Gold Star families impacted by last week's terror attack. She abruptly left after Biden ""insisted on speaking only of his late son Beau and neglected to mention any of the fallen service members' names,"" Fox reported.



""He didn't even mention Rylee,"" she said. ""Never said their names to any parent, as far as I'm aware. ... [Biden] came in with his story about his son who served, and it's like, that is not even remotely the same thing. ... It's still tragic, [Beau Biden] died of cancer, and that is sad, but it is not even close to the same situation, and there was, again, no mention of Rylee, no 'I'm sorry for your loss,' it was 'My son died, too.' He tapped her on the leg and she pulled away twice, and then he got up and went and talked to another family. A lot of the other families that he talked to, he spoke with a lot longer, but only because they carried on the conversation to really share their thoughts with him. Otherwise, I am pretty sure it probably would have been a two-minute conversation to each family, mostly about his son.""

Rylee, just 20 years old, was weeks away from becoming a first-time father with his new wife.

Jim told KSWB-TV that his son was in the process of ""pulling people to safety when the explosion went off.""

""He's a hero,"" Jim added. ""Without question. Without fear. That's just him.""

A GoFundMe page to benefit Rylee's unborn child has received more than $626,000 in donations at the time of this reporting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gold-star-family-denies-audience-with-biden,2021-09-03
"Gold Star mom of fallen Marine erupts at Biden, alleges he 'rolled' his 'f***ing eyes' when she confronted him","Shana Chappell — whose son, Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui, was killed in the terrorist attack at the Kabul airport — excoriated President Joe Biden in a Facebook post after meeting with Biden.

Chappell adds her name to the list of new Gold Star families who have harshly criticized Biden after learning their children died in the ISIS-K attack.

Chappell wrote on Facebook that while meeting with Biden on Sunday, the president allegedly rolled his eyes at her when she rebuffed his attempts to sympathize with her, and claimed Biden walked away from her when she expressed that she believed he was responsible for her son's death.



""Joe Biden This msg is for you! I know my face is etched into your brain! I was able to look you straight in the eyes yesterday and have words with you,"" Chappell began.

The grieving mother continued:

Remember i am the one who stood 5 inches from your face and was letting you know i would never get to hug my son again, hear his laugh and then you tried to interrupt me and give me your own sob story and i had to tell you ""that this isn't about you so don't make it about you!!!"" You then said you just wanted me to know that you know how i feel and i let you know that you don't know how i feel and you do not have the right to tell me you know how i feel! U then rolled your f***ing eyes in your head like you were annoyed with me and i let you know that the only reason i was talking to you was out of respect for my son and that was the only reason why, i then proceeded to tell you again how you took my son away from me and how i will never get to hug him, kiss him, laugh with him again etc… u turned to walk away and i let you know my sons blood was on your hands and you threw your hand up behind you as you walked away from me like you were saying "" ok whatever!!!

Chappell called Biden a ""weak human being,"" a ""traitor,"" and said Biden turned his back on American service members.

""MY SONS BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS!!! All 13 of them, their blood is on your hands!!!!"" Chappell wrote.

What have other families said?

The wife of fallen Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum also said that Biden amplified their pain by not being respectful and only offering a ""scripted and shallow"" response to McCollum's death. She, too, claimed that Biden brought up his own family.

""You can't f*** up as bad as he did and say you're sorry,"" McCollum's sister, Roice, said afterward. ""This did not need to happen, and every life is on his hands.""

Two Gold Star fathers — Mark Schmitz and Darin Hoover — also bashed Biden for allegedly looking at his watch during the dignified transfer of the fallen U.S. service members at Dover Air Force Base on Sunday.

Hoover — who lost his son, Marine Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, in the terrorist attack — told Fox News host Sean Hannity that his family wanted nothing to do with Biden.

""We didn't want to deal with him,"" Hoover explained. ""We didn't want him anywhere near us. We as a family decided that that was the way it was going to be.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gold-star-mother-of-fallen-marine-erupts-at-biden-alleges-he-rolled-his-f-ing-eyes-when-she-confronted-him,2021-08-31
Goldie Hawn says mental health of children suffering from pandemic,"Goldie Hawn warned that the national trauma inflicted on children by the COVID-19 pandemic is approaching and ""could very well surpass"" the dread brought on by the 9/11 terror attacks and the Cold War.

In an op-ed for USA Today, Hawn described how she saw her ""entire world get ripped apart"" by the threat of all-out nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1956 when she was in the fifth grade.

After being shown a graphic and grim educational film about the dangers of nuclear war, the then-11-year-old Goldie Hawn ran home during lunch to call her mother at work and told her, ""Mommy, come home quick! We’re all going to die!""

Hawn said the threat of nuclear holocaust inflicted trauma on her for years.

""Even in high school, I’d hear a siren in the morning and be too terrified to go to school that day,"" Hawn wrote. ""This was a specific trauma that affected me, but it was a collective trauma, too – an entire generation of American children was, in some form or another, taught to think of nuclear holocaust as a real threat.""



Hawn compared the collective trauma endured by her generation to the upheaval other generations experienced – such as children who watched the Challenger space shuttle disaster happen live on Jan. 28, 1986, the kids who witnessed the Twin Towers collapse from the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the youngsters who have had their lives turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We all know how magical a child’s imagination can be – the wonderful worlds they create in their minds. But there’s a flip side to the joyful creativity that can turn a big cardboard box into a spaceship,"" the ""Overboard"" actress articulated. ""A child’s mind exposed to real-world fear, without the ability to properly process it, can go down dark passages leading to nothing less than existential dread.""



Hawn explained that the COVID-19 pandemic has robbed adults and children of critical ""support structures that all humans depend on for perspective, encouragement, and love.""

""The COVID era has changed our children’s lives in far more real, tangible ways — social distancing, school closures, daily mask use,"" she added. ""Kids are afraid of people, spaces, even the air around them – a level of constant fear not seen in decades.""

Hawn cited a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found emergency room visits for suspected suicide attempts by adolescent girls spiked nearly 51% in 2021 and almost 4% for boys.

The movie star noted that U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy cautioned in December that the COVID-19 pandemic has had ""unprecedented impacts on the mental health of America’s youth and families.""

She also linked to a declaration of national emergency in child and adolescent mental health by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Children’s Hospital Association.

""As health professionals dedicated to the care of children and adolescents, we have witnessed soaring rates of mental health challenges among children, adolescents, and their families over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating the situation that existed prior to the pandemic,"" the declaration stated in October. ""Children and families across our country have experienced enormous adversity and disruption.""

Hawn commented on the alarming concerns about the mental health of America's youth, ""This tells us that as a nation, we have failed our children.""

""We are not properly funding preventive care and early interventions that normalize the mental struggles every individual has at some level,"" the Academy Award-winning actress wrote. ""There are everyday tools for mental fitness, just as there are for exercise and healthy eating; we just don’t teach them in any systematic way to our nation’s children.""

Hawn called for ""helping children understand the chemical reactions that occur in their mind"" when they hear the ""latest horrifying statistic or headline on the evening news."" She said that understanding how the brain works will provide children with ""the patience and confidence to put things in perspective, rather than fall victim to the emotions of the moment and end up in a helplessness that leads to depression and sometimes self-harm, the kind we are seeing in record numbers among children.""

She warned that the answer is not to allow kids to ""be over-diagnosed or shuffled through a system that screens and treats extreme cases after they are too late.""

""We will survive the COVID-19 pandemic, but I’m not sure we can survive an entire generation whose collective trauma sends them hobbling into adulthood. We need more research, more preventative care and more early intervention. And there’s still time,"" Hawn concluded. ""If we get it right, today’s kids could emerge as the strongest generation America has ever produced.""

Hawn also made headlines this week when she appeared on ""The Megyn Kelly Show"" and proclaimed that Hollywood celebrities need to entertain the public no matter what political affiliations they have.

""I stay in my lane,"" Hawn declared when it comes to spouting political opinions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/goldie-hawn-children-covid-mental-health,2022-01-28
Good news America: Scientists found the first ever 'murder hornet' nest in the U.S. and will destroy it,"Weeks of searching have finally paid off as scientists in Washington state located the first Asian giant hornet nest in the United States.

The Washington state Department of Agriculture confirmed on Friday that the nest of ""murder hornets"" was discovered in a tree on a property east of Blaine, Washington, in Whatcom County, KOMO News reports. The nest was found after entomologists captured one of the hornets and equipped it with a radio tag to follow it back to the nest.

The entomologists intend to destroy the nest on Saturday in an effort to eradicate the invasive species before they have chance to spread their reign of terror first throughout Washington and then the rest of the United States.

Officials told KOMO that the successful discovery of the nest came after a trapper captured two live Asian giant hornets on Wednesday using a new kind of trap the state agency deployed in the area.

Two more living hornets were found in another trap on Thursday morning, when scientists returned to attach a radio tracker to the first hornet. All three were outfitted with the transmitters and one of them led entomologists back to its nest Friday.

Video from the Washington Department of Agriculture shows the massive deadly hornets, which can grow as big as 2 inches long, entering and exiting their nest.



More from KOMO:

The nest is inside the cavity of a tree located on private property near an area cleared for a residential home. While Asian giant hornets normally nest in the ground, they are occasionally found nesting in dead trees. Dozens of the hornets were seen entering and exiting the tree.



The discovery of the nest follows two previous unsuccessful attempts to live-track hornets captured in the same immediate area just south of the Canadian border. It's believed there may be at least one other murder hornet nest in the same area of Whatcom County.



The first confirmed detection of an Asian giant hornet in Washington state was made in December 2019 and the first hornet was caught in July after agents spent months placing traps in the area. Several more were subsequently caught, all in Whatcom County.

Beekeepers in Washington have lived in terror of the invasive giant hornets since their discovery was first reported in Washington state in late 2019. The hornets prey on honey bees, using their lethal mandibles to decapitate up to 40 bees per minute, devastating colonies and ruining the fortunes of beekeepers.

Their sting is also deadly to humans. Over just three months in 2013, Asian giant hornets killed 42 people and injured 1,675 more in China. The hornets kill about 50 people annually in Japan.

Scientists believe there is at least one other nest somewhere in Whatcom County.

Who knows where else they might be in America?

Google bars Truth Social from its Play store,"Google notified Truth Social on August 19 that former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, as it now stands and operates, is inadmissible to the Google Play store.

What is Truth Social?



Truth Social is a social media platform created by Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), an American company founded in October 2021 by former President Donald Trump.

Trump announced on October 20, 2021, his intention to publicly list TMTG with the aim of ""creat[ing] a rival to the liberal media consortium and fight[ing] back against the 'Big Tech' companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.""

It launched on February 21. On the day of its release, it was #1 in the App Store.

Truth Social's U.S. ranking as of August 30 in Apple's App Store was #148 overall and #25 in the social networking category.

The former president stated: ""I created TRUTH Social and TMTG to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech. We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced.""

Why specifically did Google bar it from the Google Play store?



The reason for this rejection, according to the tech giant, is that Truth Social's current app submission violates the Google market's standard policies and lacks ""effective systems for moderating user-generated content.""

Axios first reported that Google's concerns relate to unmoderated content such as physical threats and incitements to violence. Unlike other approved platforms, Truth Social does not apply ""sensitive content"" banners on or before posts that some might find objectionable, violence-inciting, or misleading. It also is alleged not to have as stringent an approach to moderation as other approved apps.

An example of a reply on Truth Social that would constitute infringement, cited by Axios, read: ""It's be nice if you people weren't just okay with the military and police stage a rebellion and framing civilians. Zero people trust the police and if the military comes in, we'll kill them. Someone admit this nation needs to be nuked because it's satanic.""

The post, by Google's standards, would have at least required a label such as ""This content may not be suitable for all audiences.""

Truth Social acknowledged Google's grievances and reportedly indicated it would work to address these issues. TMTG is working with a San Francisco-based company called Hive to develop AI-based content moderation tools to flag pornographic content along with hate speech and violent rhetoric.

Parler, another free speech-oriented social media app, was banned from the Google Play store in 2021 for reasons similar to those now being cited by Google for barring Truth Social.



Does the same standard of moderation apply to Facebook and Twitter?

In May 2022, the video filmed by the gunman who perpetrated a ghastly mass shooting in Buffalo was widely circulated on Twitter and Facebook, despite the company's moderation teams and policies. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the social media platforms responsible, without naming any one in particular: ""They can be in a sense an accomplice to a crime like this. Perhaps not legally, but morally. They created the platform to allow this hate to be spewed.""

Elon Musk suggested earlier this year that Twitter was biased in its moderation, permitting what some have characterized as terroristic incitements and hate speech from leftist accounts.

Twitter also remained in the Google Play store despite permitting Taliban accounts on its platform.

Politico Europe reported last year that Islamic extremists manage to stay on Facebook, spreading extremist propaganda, photos of beheadings, and violent hate speech. Nevertheless, Facebook remains in the Google Play store.

What will the impact be?



Google's barring of the app from its store may have financial and political consequences.

This setback could affect the platform's momentum as TMTG is simultaneously being bogged down elsewhere.

Fox Business reported that one of TMTG's vendors, RightForge, is pressing the company for $1.6 million for hosting services, which it allegedly has been due in installments since March.

Truth Social's parent company, which filed a $6.5 million loss with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the first half of 2022, opens voting Tuesday on a potential yearlong delay for the merger between TMTG and the SPAC Digital World Acquisition Corp., which if successful, would have taken it public on September 8.

The platform also had its application for a trademark turned down earlier this month.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned issues, the company has suggested that dire pronouncements on Truth Social's wellbeing are ""knowingly false bar talk,"" and that it has raised over $15 million and boasts enough operating capital to operate into the first quarter of 2023.

As for being denied access to the Play store, Truth Social may lose out on a massive influx of users. Approximately 44% of U.S. smartphone users won't be able to download the app as a result of Google's decision. Android users can, however, still access Truth Social directly through the platform's website.

In 2021, Trump was banned from Twitter, where he had roughly 88 million followers, and was suspended from Facebook, where he has 34 million followers. He was also banned from Google's YouTube, where he had over 2.77 million subscribers, on January 12, 2021. All three companies insinuated Trump had a role in the January 6 Capitol protests.

Trump presently has approximately 4 million followers on Truth Social.

GOP lawmaker says national security officials confirmed to him that the Kabul suicide bomber had previously been held in Bagram prison,"Republican Rep. Ken Calvert of California says that national security officials have confirmed to him reports that the terrorist who killed 13 U.S. service members and others in Afghanistan last month had been incarcerated in Bagram prison until shortly before the attack.

""U.S. national security officials have now confirmed to me the reports that the August 26th Kabul bomber was a known ISIS-K terrorist that was previously detained at the Bagram prison and was released along with thousands of others just days before the deadly attack,"" Calvert said, according to a news release.



The lawmaker told Fox News that Indian intelligence sources are reporting that the terrorist was among the incarcerated individuals that the Taliban released from the prison. All American forces were yanked from Bagram Air Base in July, according to the outlet.

""It is my belief that the Indian intelligence services are correct in their assumptions, and I have good reason to believe that the intelligence is correct in their assessment,"" Calvert said, according to the outlet.



The individual who perpetrated the suicide bombing had previously been locked up in the Bagram prison for several years, the Indian outlet Firstpost has reported, citing ""credible intelligence sources.""

Calvert, who has served in Congress since 1993, is the ranking member on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.



""Why didn't we move or secure those prisoners in the first place? And who is going to take responsibility for this miscalculation?"" Calvert queried, according to the outlet.



Fox News reported that U.S. Central Command Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie said on Wednesday said that America is ""still waiting to find out"" whether the bomber had previously been imprisoned at Bagram Air Base.

One of the U.S. service members killed in the terror attack was from Calvert's district.

In the statement included in his news release, the congressman lambasted President Joe Biden, who has been heavily criticized for botching the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

""President Biden's disastrous handling of our withdrawal from Afghanistan led to a series of events that culminated with the tragic loss of life on August 26th outside of the Kabul airport,"" Calvert said. ""Thirteen Americans, including one of my constituents, were killed because of the poor judgement and execution of our troop withdrawal. The Biden Administration needs to explain why these prisoners were not transferred and secured at another location. Those responsible for these grave errors not only put our brave service members in harm's way but have now – by our military's own admission – placed Americans in greater danger than they were before.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-lawmaker-says-suicide-bomber-in-kabul-terror-attack-had-been-freed-from-bagram-air-base-after-taliban-took-facility,2021-09-30
"Florida sheriff debunks theory pushed by gun control advocates after Uvalde, warns active shooters what will happen to them","Florida Sheriff Grady Judd, the top cop in Polk County, pushed back on Tuesday against those who claim the Uvalde massacre proves more armed personnel on school grounds do not thwart active shooters.

What is the claim?

Proponents of gun control have seized on the Uvalde atrocity to advance their opposition to arming teachers and beefing up security personnel at schools.

In the case of Uvalde, the killer was inside the school for more than one hour before police killed him. The school had a resource officer (who was not present at the school when the killer first attacked), and dozens of law enforcement personnel stood outside the school while the gunman was inside on his killing rampage.

MSNBC columnist Zeeshan Aleem, for example, argued that because police officers failed to stop the killer before he murdered nearly two dozen people, teachers definitively could not have stopped him.

How could we expect a teacher — whose job it is to educate children, not protect them from highly motivated armed murderers — to handle the job more effectively in a moment of shocking chaos and terror? At best, supplying a teacher with a gun to confront a shooter is a mandate to have them sacrifice themselves while likely doing little to stop the attack; at worst, the teacher could accidentally harm or kill children, or even be mistaken for the shooter by responding officers.

What did Judd say?

Speaking on Fox News, Judd bashed the idea and MSNBC's advancement of the theory.

""MSNBC doesn’t know so much about what they’re talking about, but that’s not unusual. If they did, they could create the training program, and we’d never have another active shooter,"" Judd said.

""But at the end of the day, as simple as it may sound, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he added. ""There needs to be multiple people on that campus in advance, well trained, who are prepared to and can go in and stop the threat. And why those 19 police officers did [not do] that, I don't know.""

Earlier in the interview, Judd made it clear how he trains his officers to deal with active shooters.

""At the end of the day we know that shootings, these active shooters, are done between zero and 5 minutes,"" he explained. ""The police response is plus five minutes. We also know that active shooters don’t get to change it to a barricade situation.

""When you go in shooting, even though you pause, it doesn’t mean there aren’t injured children or people lying there. Once an active shooter, always an active shooter,"" he continued. ""Push in, save lives, neutralize the threat. We train for that. We expect that.

""I can tell you this: I want them to shoot them, shoot them so much that you can read the local newspaper through them,"" Judd added bluntly. ""Neutralize the threat.""

The long-term solution to preventing mass killings at schools, Judd later said, is to ""find people long before they show up on the campus."" He said communities must work together and report suspicious activity to law enforcement.

""If you see something, you hear something, you say something,"" he said.

Greg Gutfeld: Sending Kamala Harris to campaign for Gavin Newsom before recall vote is like 'asking Charlie Sheen to be your sponsor at AA',"Fox News' Greg Gutfeld on Tuesday declared that sending Vice President Kamala Harris to campaign for Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom prior to the state's recall election is not a wise choice.

Well, Gutfeld was a bit more pointed than that: ""Sending Kamala to help Gavin is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your sponsor at AA. This is not a good decision.""

What are the details?

During a segment on ""The Five,"" co-host Dana Perino had been discussing with the panel President Joe Biden's withering poll numbers when she turned to Gutfeld for his take.

""Greg, it used to be for a few months the president's worst [poll] numbers were on immigration — and they were really bad, like in the 30s — but now he's upside down on Afghanistan, COVID, economy, crime, and immigration,"" Perino observed. ""So that's not a good trajectory.""

""Yeah, everything he touches turns to poop,"" Gutfeld answered before apparently losing interest and heading right for the California recall election on Sept. 14 — and specifically Harris helping Newsom. ""I want to talk about the recall. That excites me.""

Gutfeld continued, saying that ""Kamala is going to help him out"" before asking ""The Five"" panel whether Harris is ""the worst vice president in the history of vice presidents.""

""Well, we've had some bad ones,"" co-host Jesse Watters jumped in.

And that's when Gutfeld went for the comedic kill shot: ""Sending Kamala to help Gavin is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your sponsor at AA. This is not a good decision.""

He added that Harris ""has the persuasive skills of gout. She's able to do two things that no person could possibly do: Be invisible and unpopular. Like flatulence. She's political flatulence.""

Gutfeld's merciless ribbing of Harris elicited much laughter around ""The Five"" table, after which co-host Jeanine Pirro went further, saying Harris hadn't been ""present"" and was merely the ""cackler-in-chief.""

Anything else?

Harris was set to assist Newsom late last month in his bid to stay in office but canceled a planned rally after the deadly terror attack in Afghanistan.

A Harris spokesperson said the vice president instead would return to Washington, D.C., after visiting the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii rather than going to the California rally.

But Harris on Wednesday was headed back to her home state for a campaign event in San Leandro to support Newsom during the final week of the gubernatorial recall campaign, KCRA-TV reported.

Leading Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder last month picked up a major endorsement from Gloria Romero, the former Democratic majority leader of the California state Senate.

And left-wing billionaire George Soros has donated a total of $1 million to an organization backing Newsom.

Hamas militants fire rockets at Israel following violent clashes in Jerusalem,"Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip fired rockets at Israel on Monday following violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and police in Jerusalem.

The Israeli military retaliated, issuing airstrikes on Gaza military sites. Reports say several Palestinians are dead in Gaza following the strikes.

What are the details?

The Associated Press reported that Hamas fired ""dozens"" of rockets into Israel, ""including a barrage that set off air raid sirens as far away as Jerusalem.""

StopAntisemitism.org shared video on Twitter purportedly from Israel, writing, ""Shocking footage out of Israel - children and their mothers scramble for shelter as rocket sirens go off. In the last hour alone, more than a dozen rockets have been fired from Gaza, including at Jerusalem.""

Further footage posted online showed Israel's Iron Dome intercepting the rockets fired upon their country by Hamas from the Gaza Strip.

In reaction to the news, Rep. Kathy Manning (D-N.C.) issued a statement condemning Hamas, writing, ""Hamas has fired more than 50 rockets into Israel, including six rockets aimed at Jerusalem. These acts of terrorism fan the flames of hate, threaten Israeli and Palestinian civilians, and are a violation of international law. We condemn these deadly attacks, and are grateful that the Iron Dome missile defense program has prevented mass casualties.""

Another Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar (Minn.) reacted by blaming Israel for defending itself, tweeting, ""Israeli air strikes killing civilians in Gaza is an act of terrorism. Palestinians deserve protection. Unlike Israel, missile defense programs, such as Iron Dome, don't exist to protect Palestinian civilians. It's unconscionable to not condemn these attacks on the week of Eid.""

According to the AP, ""the rocket fire drew heavy Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip,"" and ""health officials said at least 20 people, including nine children, were killed in fighting, making it one of the bloodiest days of battle between the bitter enemies in several years.""

What prompted Monday's violence?

According to CBS News, ""confrontations between Israeli security forces and [Palestinian] protesters have been escalating for weeks,"" and the ""clashes started at the beginning of Ramadan, almost a month ago.""

But things came to head on Monday, after Hamas issued an ultimatum demanding Israeli security forces abandon the al Aqsa mosque area in Jerusalem or face rocket fire.

Reuters referred to al Aqsa as ""another flashpoint in the holy city,"" and reported:

As Israel celebrated ""Jerusalem Day"" earlier on Monday, marking its capture of eastern sections of the holy city in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, violence erupted at the mosque, Islam's third most sacred site.



The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said more than 300 Palestinians were injured in clashes with police who fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas in the compound, which is also revered by Jews at the site of biblical temples.



The skirmishes, in which police said 21 officers were also hurt, at al Aqsa had died down by the 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) deadline Hamas had set.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hamas-militants-fire-rockets-at-israel-following-violent-clashes-in-jerusalem,2021-05-10
"Hamas says it 'highly appreciates' Rep. Ilhan Omar's remarks condemning US, Israel — then rebukes her","Hamas, the Gaza-based terrorist organization that controls the Gaza Strip, released a statement Friday thanking Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) for ""defending justice and the rights of the oppressed.""

What did Omar say?

The Minnesota Democrat found herself in hot water this week after she lumped together the United States, Israel, Afghanistan, Hamas, and the Taliban as countries and organizations guilty of committing ""unthinkable atrocities.""

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,"" Omar said Monday.

How did Hamas respond?

Hamas, which is officially classified by the U.S. government as a ""foreign terrorist organization,"" released a statement Friday both thanking and condemning Omar.

Despite approving of Omar's pro-Palestine stance, Hamas rebuked Omar for equating Israel and ""U.S. aggression"" to ""the resistance of the Palestinian people,"" suggesting that Hamas is on the side of good and they should not be conflated with their enemies.

The statement read, in part:

The remarks made by US congresswoman Ilhan Omar are very peculiar; she equated between the victim and the executioner when she treated the resistance of the Palestinian people, the Israeli crimes in Palestine, and the US aggression in Afghanistan as an equal footing.



Hamas highly appreciates Omar's stances in support of justice and the rights of the oppressed around the world, foremost among them is the just rights of the Palestinian people. However, it is unacceptable to make such an unfair comparison, which contradicts with basic norms of justice and international law.

Anything else?

Not only did Omar's comments invoke condemnation from Republicans and, ironically, an actual terrorist group, but even Democrats — including party leadership — believe Omar's conflation of Israel and the U.S. with terrorists was unacceptable.

Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.) released a statement Wednesday along with 11 other House Democrats rebuking Omar's comparison.

""Equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided. Ignoring the differences between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one's intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice,"" the statement said. ""The United States and Israel are imperfect and, like all democracies, at times deserving of critique, but false equivalencies give cover to terrorist groups. We urge Congresswoman Omar to clarify her words placing the US and Israel in the same category as Hamas and the Taliban.""

In response, Omar accused her colleagues of engaging in islamophobia.

""It's shameful for colleagues who call me when they need my support to now put out a statement asking for 'clarification' and not just call,"" Omar said. ""The islamophobic tropes in this statement are offensive. The constant harassment & silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable.""

Omar later clarified her remarks.

""On Monday, I asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken about ongoing International Criminal Court investigations,"" Omar said Thursday. ""To be clear: the conversation was about accountability for specific incidents regarding those ICC cases, not a moral comparison between Hamas and the Taliban and the U.S. and Israel. I was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that no disciplinary action will be taken against Omar.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hamas-statement-ilhan-omar,2021-06-12
Hate hoax: Racist letters revealed to be Georgia black woman,"A Georgia neighborhood was terrorized by a person claiming to be a white male member of the Ku Klux Klan. However, police now say that the person making racially motivated threats to burn down houses in the neighborhood and kill people is actually a black woman.

Last December, residents of the Brookmont subdivision of Douglasville began receiving racially charged letters in their mailboxes. The handwritten notes claimed to be from a 6-foot tall, white male with a long, red beard, who was a member of the KKK.

""The notes threatened to burn their houses down and kill them and said that they didn't belong in the neighborhood,"" said Detective Nathan Shumaker.

The notes – which used the N-word and talked about hanging people – were received by at least seven black residents in the suburb about 25 miles from Atlanta, according to WGCL-TV.

The Douglasville Police Department said the investigation started by detectives going ""door-to-door to check doorbell cameras and gather whatever information they could from the residents."" They also handed out flyers to residents about the racially motivated threats.

The letters – which were delivered in the middle of the night – stopped in January, but picked up again in February and March.

An alarmed resident alerted local media to the story, and the letters stopped again until the final letter was delivered on Sept. 6.

Detectives Andre Futch and Shumaker determined that the letters had ""similar handwriting, tone and verbiage with some distinctive letters that were consistent throughout.""

On Sept. 6, law enforcement found evidence linking the terroristic letters to the home of Terresha Lucas – a 30-year-old black female. The detectives gathered enough evidence to obtain a search warrant. During the search, detectives found other evidence that tied the suspect to the threatening notes, Shumaker said.

Lucas was charged with eight counts of making terroristic threats. The motive behind the hate hoax was not immediately released by authorities.

Police Chief Dr. Gary Sparks commended the detectives, ""Our investigators had the drive to stick with this case and see it all to the end. That's what we're all about and this reflects the professionalism and integrity of the department.""

""They stayed with it and put in a lot of hours. Even when some people went to the media, which could have hampered our investigation, we still stuck with it to the end,"" Sparks added.

This is the second hate hoax incident near Atlanta to garner national headlines in as many weeks.

Last week, a black former Emory University employee was arrested and suspected of writing the N-word and drawing swastikas on the university's autism center.

Another race hate hoax was exposed this week in Missouri, where racist graffiti was painted in a high school bathroom that ignited a student walkout. However, the school district revealed that the culprit was a black student.

In May, a ""person of color"" created an Instagram account that spewed hateful, racist messages. The incendiary posts sparked a school walkout in Minnesota, but later was revealed to be ""a hoax sent under false pretense.""



In April, racist and anti-Semitic graffiti featuring references to the Klu Klux Klan was found at Michigan's Albion College, which prompted students and staff members to walk out of the school. The perpetrator, who is black, admitted to writing the racist messages.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hate-hoax-racist-letters-georgia,2021-10-02
Hillary Clinton: Islamic terrorism and 'huge refugee outflow' could be consequences of Biden leaving Afghanistan,"Former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee for president Hillary Clinton raised concerns over President Joe Biden's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, warning of ""two huge consequences"" of leaving the war-torn region in an interview Sunday.

The first consequence is ""the potential collapse of the Afghan government and a takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban,"" Clinton said.

She warned that civil war might resume in the country if American troops leave, a concern shared by U.S. commanders in the region who opposed the withdrawal over fears the Taliban could overrun Afghan armed forces without American military support.

Clinton added that the United States has an obligation to protect ""many thousands of Afghans"" who worked with the U.S. and NATO, those who ""stood up and spoke out for women's rights and human rights.""

""I hope that the administration in concert with the Congress will have a very large visa program and will begin immediately to try to provide that channel for so many Afghans to utilize so that they are not left in danger,"" she said, predicting a ""huge refugee outflow"" if Afghanistan spirals into civil war.

The second major consequence of U.S. withdrawal, according to Clinton, is the ""resumption of activities by global terrorist groups, most particularly Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.""

Acknowledging that there has been a ""sharp drop in both capacity and action on behalf of Islamic terrorist groups,"" Clinton said she wouldn't count on that ""downward spiral"" lasting if the Taliban retakes power and provides refuge for Islamic terrorist groups.

""The Taliban has never been willing to separate itself from Al-Qaeda,"" Clinton pointed out.

""It's one thing to pull out troops that have been supporting security in Afghanistan, supporting the Afghan military, leaving it pretty much to fend for itself, but we can't afford to walk away from the consequences of that decision,"" Clinton concluded.

The United States officially began to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan last week, with President Joe Biden's ultimate goal being a complete exit from the country by Sept. 11 — commemorating the 20-year-anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.

Biden's timetable for withdrawal broke an agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban to have American military forces leave Afghanistan by May 1. In response, the Taliban said Friday it will ""take every counteraction it deems appropriate against the occupying forces,"" possibly signaling new attacks on U.S. forces as they attempt to leave the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-afghanistan-islamic-terrorism-refugees,2021-05-03

Historically black Mississippi churches set aflame on Election Day. Democrat candidate calls it 'terrorism' to 'suppress our right to vote' — then suspect is arrested.,"Two historically black churches in Jackson, Mississippi, were deliberately set on fire early Tuesday morning — Election Day — authorities told USA Today.

There were five additional suspected arson cases in the city — and all seven occurred in the area of Jackson State University, a historically black public university, the paper said.

'We will not allow domestic terrorists to suppress our right to vote'

Mississippi Democrat congressional candidate Shuwaski Young released a statement early Tuesday morning calling the fires acts of ""terrorism,"" USA Today reported.

""This morning several churches were burned in Jackson, Mississippi on Election Day,"" the statement reads. ""These cowardly actions invoke historical acts of terrorism when people are fighting for their right to vote and live peacefully as Americans and Mississippians. We will not be deterred and will not be intimidated. We will not allow domestic terrorists to suppress our right to vote. I ask all Mississippians to GO VOTE regardless of this decades-old intimidation tactic to suppress our votes today. Just go VOTE.""

Suspect arrested

Suspect Delvin McLaurin was arrested Tuesday, USA Today said. The Hinds County Sheriff's Office said deputies arrested McLaurin in the evening after a tip from citizens in Terry near the Hinds-Copiah County line. Authorities said McLaurin will be transferred to the Jackson Police Department for further questioning.

A Jackson Police Department spokesperson said McLaurin is being charged with felony malicious mischief, USA Today reported, adding that the FBI is questioning him and McLaurin may face additional charges.

Officials began receiving calls about several fires starting around 2:45 a.m., the paper reported, adding that Jackson Police spokesman Sam Brown said McLaurin was in the area of the fires during the hours they were set.

House of cards tumbles

Young wasn't alone in his ""suppress our right to vote"" post following the suspected arsons. Other commenters underneath his post concurred — and took things a lot further:

""The layers of racist symbolism associated with burning churches… in Mississippi… on Election Day. When will this country wake up? This makes me incredibly sad…"" one commenter added. ""I’m guessing the terrorist/arsonist who did this thinks they’re a Christian and a patriot.""

""... this what the SCLC fought against, the same white-hooded cowards are a product of 45's GOP, the most racist, corrupt treasonous administration in White House, anti-[Semitism], racism is their platform,"" another user said. ""This act today says it all.""

""This is beyond hideous. The hypocrisy is off the charts, too,"" another commenter said. ""The burning was probably carried out by people who profess to be Christians.""

""Domestic white supremacist terrorists will not suppress Democratic voters from voting!"" another commenter declared. ""But Still, Like Air We Rise ...""

Oh, and:

However, one commenter couldn't help pushing back against Young in light of McLaurin's arrest, saying ""…except the suspect is a black man. You can stop the racial narrative now.""

Incidentally, Young lost his congressional bid to incumbent Republican Michael Guest, the Clarion Ledger reported, adding that Guest was ahead of Young by more than 40 points with 94% of the votes in Wednesday.

The rest of the story

USA Today said fires were reported at Greater Bethlehem Temple Church, Epiphany Lutheran Church, the baseball field at Jackson State, a gas station, a location at Central Street and Dalton, a location in the 1100 block of Pascagoula St., and a location at Terry Road and Cherry Street.

Epiphany Lutheran, one of the oldest predominately black Lutheran churches in Mississippi, burned for more than four hours before the fire was put out, USA Today said.

Lloyd Caston, 73, an elder at Epiphany, was awakened around 4 a.m. by a call from a family member who lives in the neighborhood where the church is located, the paper said. Caston then headed to the church around 4:30 a.m. to find the building “fully enflamed,"" USA Today reported.

“I was hurt,” Caston told the paper of his emotions upon seeing his church on fire, adding that ""it destroyed the church and everything in it.""

Epiphany is 85 years old, USA Today reported, adding that renovations to the building’s interior were completed in March.

Fire also damaged Greater Bethlehem Temple Church, the paper said.

Life wins as Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade,"In a historic decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned its controversial Roe v. Wade opinion, which established a constitutional right to abortion in 1973.

“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case concerning a Mississippi law that, with few exceptions, bans abortions after 15 weeks.

The court upheld the Mississippi law, which was challenged as unconstitutional under the Supreme Court precedents established in Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).

Emphasizing that abortion ""presents a profound moral question,"" Alito's opinion finds that the Constitution ""does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating and prohibiting abortion.""



“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division,"" Alito wrote.

""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives,"" he added.

His words were unchanged from a draft of this opinion that was leaked to Politico in May. That unprecedented leak sent shock waves through the nation and prompted an investigation ordered by Chief Justice John Roberts.

Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh filed concurring opinions. Roberts filed an opinion concurring in the judgement. The three liberal justices dissented.



Abortion rights activists rallied against the draft opinion throughout May and June, even protesting outside the homes of Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices in an effort to get them to back down and change their votes.

Acts of violence were also committed against pro-life ministries and organizations in the name of protecting abortion rights. An anarchist group called Jane's Revenge firebombed at least two pro-life pregnancy centers, claimed responsibility for the vandalism of several more, and made terrorist threats of more violence to come. The FBI has opened an investigation into these threats and others.

It is nearly impossible to overstate the importance of the court's landmark decision in Dobbs.

Where previously, state regulations on abortion had been ruled unconstitutional under Roe's and Casey's precedents, now state legislatures are free to enact limits or even outright bans on abortion according to the will of the people.

Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws that will now go into effect and criminalize abortion procedures.

87-year-old Holocaust survivor goes viral for heartbreaking NYT op-ed: 'Holocaust stole my youth. Covid-19 is stealing my last years.',"Toby Levy, a retired accountant, has gone viral for her story of surviving both the Holocaust and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Levy, an 87-year-old New York resident who is also a volunteer docent for the Museum of Jewish Heritage, explained that the Holocaust stole her youth — and now the coronavirus pandemic is stealing her final years.

What are the details?

In a Monday op-ed published in the New York Times, Levy explained that she was relatively active for an 87-year-old woman in New York.



""These days, I'm a little bored,"" Levy writes. ""The boardwalk is my lifesaver. I'm two blocks from the boardwalk. I can walk to Coney Island if I want to. I go alone. I have some friends here. We used to play canasta once a week. But when Covid arrived, my daughter insisted, 'You can't sit in one room!' So I talk on the phone. I read. The grandkids call in by Zoom. I also do a little bit of Zoom lecturing for the Museum of Jewish Heritage.""

In the op-ed, Levy says that she's busy keeping herself busy these days, and is ""trying not to give up."" It's becoming harder and harder, however, because she has faced the fact that she has essentially lost a year of her life.

""[T]his bothers me terribly,"" Levy admits. ""I'm 87 years old, and I lost almost a full year.""



Levy continues, pointing out just how much time she lost as a child in Chodorow, Poland (which is now Khodoriv, Ukraine) amid the height of the Holocaust. She recalled her family going into hiding and relocations to avoid being picked up by Nazis.

""[M]y father built a place to hide in the cellar,"" Levy recalls. ""My grandfather didn't want to go. He was shot in the kitchen; we heard it.""

Levy says that she and her family later spent time with a family friend who housed them in a barn on her property.

""My father built a wall inside the barn and a hiding place for nine people, where we slept like herrings,"" she recalls. ""It was just four feet by five feet. Pigs and chickens were on one side, and we were on the other: my parents, my aunt and uncle, my maternal grandmother, and four children, ages 4, 6, 8, and 12.""

Levy says that even though the family lived and slept among lice and rats, every day outside Nazi capture was a miracle.

""I'm not a regular person. I'm a miracle child. Most of the Jews of Chodorow never returned,"" she reveals. ""So when the coronavirus came, I thought, 'I'm a miracle. I will make it. I have to make it.'""

Levy has made it this far and says that she has more hope for the future when compared to how she felt during the war.

""During the war, we didn't know if we would make a day. I didn't have any freedom. I couldn't speak loudly, I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry,"" she writes. ""But now, I can feel freedom. I stay by the window and look out. The first thing I do in the morning is look out and see the world. I am alive. I have food, I go out, I go for walks, I do some shopping. And I remember: No one wants to kill me. So, still, I read. I cook a little bit. I shop a little bit. I learned the computer. I do puzzles.""

What now?

Levy says that despite having her life, she does still feel like she is missing out on her final years.

""A full year is gone. I lost my childhood, I never had my teenage years. And now, in my old age, this is shortening my life by a year,"" she continues. ""I don't have that many years left. The way we have lived this year means I have lost many opportunities to lecture, to tell more people my story, to let them see me and know the Holocaust happened to a real person, who stands in front of them today. It's important.""



Levy says that though she sometimes feels trapped, she hopes to outlive the pandemic and is making plans for the rest of her life.

""I understand the fear people have, and I understand you have to take care,"" she concludes. ""But there is no comparison of anxiety, of the coronavirus, to the terror I felt when I was a child. That was a fear with no boundary. This is going to end, and I am already thinking, planning where I am going first, what I will do first, when this ends.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/holocaust-survivor-covid-final-years,2021-01-04
"Homeland Security warns of trucker protest at Super Bowl, DC","The Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about a potential truck protest developing at Sunday's Super Bowl LVI in California. The DHS acknowledged that the possible event appears ""purely aspirational"" at this time. Still, the agency noted that it will monitor potential vehicle-oriented protests, including a prospective trucker convoy heading to Washington, D.C.

The DHS is concerned about a possible protest this Super Bowl weekend in the Inglewood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Authorities are wary of an Ottawa-like ""Freedom Convoy"" trucker protest near the SoFi Stadium — the site of Super Bowl LVI.

On Tuesday, the DHS said it had “received reports of a convoy of truckers planning to potentially block roads in major metropolitan cities in the United States in protest of, among other things, vaccine mandates for truck drivers,” according to Yahoo News.



""While there are currently no indications of planned violence or civil unrest, if hundreds of trucks converge in a major metropolitan city, the convoy could potentially severely disrupt transportation, federal government and law enforcement operations, and emergency services through gridlock and potential counterprotests,"" the DHS said, according to ABC News.

""However, as of the release of this notice, this event appears to be purely aspirational because the event is only being discussed online and we lack any information indicating the event is actually being organized,"" the bulletin said, but added that the situation could ""change quickly however, particularly since there are online discussions that suggest holding an event at a specific location near the Super Bowl on game day.""

At a press conference Tuesday, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said there are no credible threats to the upcoming Super Bowl.



""We have no information of a specific credible threat against the Super Bowl,"" Mayorkas told reporters at the Los Angeles Convention Center. ""What this is all about, is planning and preparation to prevent any incident from occurring.""

Homeland Security stated in the notice, “The group intends to start in California as early as mid-February and travel to Washington, D.C., as late as mid-March, reportedly gathering truckers as they travel across the country.""



""At this time, we have no indication that individuals discussing participating in these activities in the United States are engaged in anything other than First Amendment-protected activity,"" said in the ""unclassified and for official use only"" DHS document. ""Nonetheless, DHS remains concerned that these events could have significant public safety implications or potentially be exploited by ideologically motivated actors to potentially act or encourage others to act violently.""

A DHS source told Yahoo News that the U.S. trucker convoy ""is absolutely a real concern.""

""They are definitely going to follow the Canadian model and shut down Washington,” the Homeland Security source explained.

Facebook has already banned the ""Convoy to DC 2022"" page on the social network, which had roughly 137,000 members before it was deleted.

In Canada, the Freedom Convoy of a group of truckers who drove from various areas to converge on the capital city of Ottawa. The convoy of trucks from across Canada and the U.S. began arriving in Ottawa on Jan. 28 and have vowed to park their vehicles near Parliament Hill until all COVID-19 restrictions and mandates have been repealed.

The Freedom Convoy has been supported by many, including several celebrities. However, the peaceful protest has also been compared to ""fascism.""

Ottawa Police have confiscated fuel, and the city's mayor has declared a state of emergency.

GoFundMe took down a fundraising campaign for the truckers, which prompted Republican lawmakers to threaten an investigation.

On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a terrorism threat bulletin that warned against ""false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, and other forms of mis- dis- and mal-information (MDM) introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors.""

""These threat actors seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest, which could potentially inspire acts of violence,"" the DHS cautioned. ""Mass casualty attacks and other acts of targeted violence conducted by lone offenders and small groups acting in furtherance of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances pose an ongoing threat to the nation.""

The warning is in effect until at least June 7.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeland-security-trucker-protest-super-bowl,2022-02-10
Suspect in lethal attacks on homeless people arrested. He previously had a sentence suspended after being released from a psychiatric facility.,"A 30-year-old man has been arrested as a suspect in lethal attacks on homeless people in New York City and Washington, D.C.

Gerald Brevard was arrested in Washington on Tuesday morning after a multi-state manhunt for the attacks on homeless people.

NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Brevard was a ""strong person of interest"" after numerous tips were sent to law enforcement.



Essig said that Brevard was taken into custody by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). No weapon was found, but he said that the suspect was wearing similar clothing to that captured by security cameras on Saturday in two shootings.

One of two attacks on Saturday was captured on video that showed a man nudging a sleeping homeless man, looking around, and then pulling out a gun and shooting him. That man died.

A previous attack was discovered on March 9 when a homeless person was found dead inside a burning tent. Investigators later concluded that he had died of multiple stab and gunshot wounds.

D.C. police said that ballistics evidence linked five attacks on homeless people to the same gun.

WNBC-TV reported that Brevard had previously pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon. He was admitted into a psychiatric facility in 2019 and found incompetent to stand trial a month later. He was sentenced to a year in prison but had that sentence suspended.

Brevard's father said in a statement to the New York Times that his son suffered from an untreated mental illness.

""I cannot speak to the details of the case,"" the father said. ""I can only speak to the issue of the failure of the judicial system identifying that my son suffers from mental illness but not treating it.""

Brevard is being questioned by homicide detectives in Washington, D.C.

Hong Kong pushes plan to start censoring films — all in the name of safeguarding 'national security',"Hong Kong used to enjoy a lot of autonomy, even after the British turned it over to Communist China in 1997, but that all began to seriously change a couple years ago when Chinese dictator Xi Jinping's government began cracking down on the city's freedoms.

On Monday, as the ChiComs continue to implement more limitations on personal freedoms and freedom of the press, Reuters reported that Hong Kong's pro-China government is pushing for power to censor films.

What's going on?

For more than 20 years, the people of Hong Kong had pretty free lives following Great Britain's pullout. But in 2019, the Xi regime truly began to push its allies in the local government to stifle the people's liberties, and in that summer, protests broke out in response to the city's planned extradition agreement with China.

After a year of fighting the people's protests, the communist nation announced in May 2020 that it would be stepping up its abuse of Hong Kong citizens with a massive new national security law outlawing ""foreign interference"" and quashing pro-democracy forces — and that it would do so by fiat, bypassing the Hong Kong legislature.

According to the Xi regime, the new law was necessary to battle the ongoing freedom protests.

Just last month, pro-China authorities arrested an editor and multiple journalists of the Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper that the government forced to close in June. The editor and writers were charged with ""collusion with foreign forces,"" a violation of the aforementioned security law.

Now the ChiComs of Hong Kong want to impose a new law to censor films — all because they want to ""safeguard national security.""

The new legislation would empower greater state regulation of film in order to battle what the nation sees as ""subversion, secessionism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces,"" according to Reuters.

Under the planned bill, Hong Kong's chief secretary, the outlet said, would have the power to revoke a movie's license if the state found it to be ""contrary to the interests of national security.""

Violators would face up to three years in prison and a massive fine, equivalent to $128,400, Reuters said.

The move came after the government canceled several screenings of protest-related documentaries and movies in the city's theaters and art centers.

The goal, the government said, is ""ensuring more effective fulfillment of the duty to safeguard national security.""

""The main reference is the national security law ... for instances, acts or activities which might endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite such activities that might endanger national security,"" Edward Yau, Hong Kong's commerce secretary, explained, Reuters reported.

The city's legislative council is scheduled to vote on the bill next Wednesday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hong-kong-censoring-films-national-security,2021-08-24
Bodycam video shows hostage situation in San Diego,"Unnerving police body cam video shows the moment police officers thwarted an armed hostage situation in San Diego, California.

In the early hours of April 8, a prowler broke into five different homes, and had failed attempts at burglaries at two other residences. His alleged getaway vehicle was reportedly a white minivan that had previously been reported stolen in a carjacking.

The homeowner of the fifth home burglarized contacted 911 around 2:20 a.m. to inform authorities that a man had broken into her home. She told the 911 dispatcher that the home intruder was nearly nude and ""masturbating in the bathroom.""



Police arrived at the crime scene and made ""verbal contact"" with the homeowner's elderly father – who was also at the residence during the break-in.

Suddenly, a loud bang rang out, followed by screams by a female. Police immediately smashed the sliding glass door of the rear of the home. With guns drawn, several cops entered the home.

As the police officers began to go up the stairs, the intruder emerged out of a room with a gun to the head of the 53-year-old homeowner.

Officers confronted the gunman and commanded, ""Let me see your f***ing hands! Let me see your hands!""

In the video of the hostage situation shared by the San Diego Police Department, there were apparently 10 minutes where the home invader pointed the barrel of the gun towards the woman's temple.

Police identify the gunman as 40-year-old parolee Demetrius Trussell. The police say that Trussell exposed himself and sexually battered the homeowner several times.



""We have a Mexican standoff,"" Trussell told the police in the chilling body cam video.

When asked why this is a hostage situation by a police officer, Trussell responded, ""Cause I don’t have no way out, so I gotta take a hostage with me.""

The cop replied, ""No, no you don’t.""

The gunman told authorities that they're ""going to have to send a SWAT team.""

An officer asked what will happen then, and Trussell said, “I want you to back out ... before I shoot her. I'm going to shoot her in the kneecap.""

The woman screamed, ""No! No! Please, God. Please, God, no!""

Then a round was fired by Trussell, but the woman told police that the gun accidentally went off and she was unharmed.

During the standoff, an officer climbed to a rear balcony to protect the woman's elderly father.

Meanwhile, another officer scaled a nearby roof to get a better vantage point of the hostage situation. Once in a position where the officer could see Trussell and the hostage through a window, the officer fired multiple shots at the gunman.

Trussell is startled by the gunfire and dropped his firearm. The woman quickly fled downstairs toward the officers.

In the dramatic footage, officers advanced towards Trussell who dropped to the floor and surrendered.

The woman, the suspect, and the police were unharmed during the shooting

Trussell was charged with 18 felonies, including suspicion of hot prowl burglary, kidnapping, false imprisonment with a hostage, negligent discharge of a firearm, possession of a stolen vehicle, indecent exposure, assault with the intent to commit a sex crime, sexual battery, multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and a parole hold, according to Lt. Jud Campbell of the San Diego Police Department.

Deputy District Attorney Meghan Buckner said Trussell was on parole at the time of the break-ins. Trussell was convicted of a 2019 robbery in North Carolina and convicted of a 2018 hot prowl residential burglary in San Diego, according to the complaint.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hostage-situation-bodycam-video-san-diego,2022-04-15
Four House Democrats call out progressive House Dems for 'inflammatory' statements on Israel and Jews: 'Antisemitic at their core',"Members of the group of uber-leftist, progressive U.S. House Democratic lawmakers affectionately known as ""The Squad"" by their liberal enablers in the U.S. media have really outdone themselves lately. They have gone all-in in making themselves the anti-Israel attack brigade as acts of violence against Jews are on the rise in America during what was nearly two weeks of rocket attacks between Hamas terrorists and Israel.

And now some of these congresswomen's fellow Democrats in the House are calling them out and accusing them of making statements that are ""antisemitic at their core"" and contributing to the ""climate"" of hate against Jews, CNN reported Wednesday.

What happened?

With antisemitic verbal and physical attacks spiking around the world and in the U.S. — from Vienna and London to Los Angeles and New York City to the offices of CNN — the ongoing smears and rhetoric against Israel coming from Democratic members of the Squad and ringing through the halls of Congress have done nothing but increase tensions in the country.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) labeled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ""ethno-nationalist"" on the House floor and took to Twitter to accuse Israel of war crimes and ""acts of terorism.""

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) declared that Palestinian ""babies, children and their parents"" were ""being massacred"" by Israel.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) famously described Israel as an ""apartheid state.""

Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) accused Israel of ongoing ""ethnic cleansing"" and demanded the U.S. government ""stop funding the apartheid status quo.""

Four House Democrats — Reps. Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Elaine Luria (Va.), Kathy Manning (N.C.), and Dean Phillips (Minn.) — have had enough of the Squad's antics.

In a letter to President Joe Biden urging his administration to prioritize combatting antisemitism in the U.S., the four Democrats called out the anti-Israel, anti-Jew rhetoric they've been hearing among fellow lawmakers.

After first alluding to recent Holocaust-related comments made by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), the quartet lit into the Squad — though without naming them:

We also reject comments from Members of Congress accusing Israel of being an ""apartheid state"" and committing ""act[s] of terrorism."" These statements are antisemitic at their core and contribute to a climate that is hostile to many Jews. We must never forget that less than eighty years ago, within the lifetime of our parents and grandparents, six million people were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust because they were Jews. Israel has long provided the Jewish people with a homeland in which they can be safe after facing long centuries of persecution.

The lawmakers went on to remind the president that history shows that ""when this type of violence and inflammatory rhetoric goes unaddressed, it can fuel increasing hatred and violence.""

Their letter included a clear hint to the Squad: ""Antisemitism is wrong, and it deserves to be unequivocally condemned by all.""

However, as HotAir's Ed Morrissey pointed out, some observers were none too impressed by the fact that no one in the Squad was called out by name. But at least ""the rift over The Squad's hateful rhetoric is now out in the open,"" Morrissey noted.

'He has violated the law and it is time for him to go': House Republican files articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Mayorkas,"Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon filed articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Monday evening, accusing the Biden pick of ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""



The articles have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, now chaired by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), which will determine how and whether to proceed.



Fallon summarized the rationale behind the action, which House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other Republicans have threatened for months: ""Secretary Mayorkas's willful actions have eroded our immigration system, undermined border patrol morale, and jeopardized American national security. He has violated the law and it is time for him to go.""

What are the details?

The articles of impeachment accuse Mayorkas of violating his constitutional oath and engaging in a pattern of conduct incompatible with his duties as an officer of the United States.

“It is unfortunate that we have gotten to this point, but it is necessary,"" Fallon said in a statement. ""Secretary Mayorkas’s potential impeachment is not an accident. He has willfully abdicated his duties as Secretary of Homeland Security and actively misled Congress and the American people. To make any progress at our southern border, he must go.”



In the impeachment documents, Fallon cited the Secure the Fence Act of 2006, which requires the DHS secretary to ""maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States,"" noting that operational control is defined as ""the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""

Fallon noted that Mayorkas, who previously helped implement the DACA program during the Obama administration, has ""presided over a 180-percent increase in encounters at the southern border compared to the previous administration"" and stood by while over 5.5 million criminal noncitizens stole into the United States.

Extra to an unprecedented number of illegal aliens crossing the border and 1 million known ""gotaways"" escaping into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that 98 persons with records in the Terrorist Screening Data Set crossed America's southwestern border in fiscal year 2022. Fifteen crossed last year, five times more than in the previous year. There were zero reported in 2019.

The articles of impeachment further note that ""more fentanyl has crossed the border in the last 2 months than in all of fiscal year 2019 under President Trump's leadership. In fiscal year 2022, over 14,000 pounds of poisonous fentanyl was seized at the southern border. Fentanyl overdoses are the number one cause of death for individuals ages 18 to 45 nationwide.""

In addition to facing accusations that he failed to uphold his oath, Mayorkas is accused of violating the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires the DHS to detain inadmissible and uninspected illegal aliens in or entering the U.S. until processed.

""Secretary Mayorkas has violated the law and gravely endangered the national security of the United States,"" the articles claim, for these reasons and for:

""Terminating contracts for additional border wall construction, in contradiction of Congressional appropriations"";

""Ending the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as 'Remain in Mexico', which was an indispensable tool to address the border crisis and restore integrity to the immigration system""; and

""Attempting to eliminate title 42 authority, a critical tool enabling the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to quickly expel illegal aliens.""

Fallon further contends that Mayorkas both lied to Congress, having claimed in recent testimony that the southern border is secure, and ""slandered his own hardworking Border Patrol agents,"" having knowingly advanced a bogus narrative that agents whipped Haitian migrants.

Ahead of Fallon's filing, Mayorkas, who maintains the border is ""secure,"" told ABC's ""This Week"" that he has no intention of resigning.



""I've got a lot of work to do,"" Mayorkas said Sunday night, adding that he entertained hopes that a ""regional solution"" might come out of this week's North American Leaders' Summit in Mexico.

In lieu of solutions, at the summit in Mexico City, leftist Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador celebrated President Joe Biden's refusal to build ""even one meter of wall"" and called for Mayorkas' boss to confer amnesty on millions of illegal aliens.

Mayorkas also told ""This Week"" that he was prepared for possible investigations by House Republicans and that he would ""work throughout them.""

The Texas Tribune reported that Fallon originally filed the articles of impeachment on Jan. 3, but they were delayed on account of the protracted House speaker vote.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) introduced a similar resolution to impeach, try, and remove Mayorkas from office on Aug. 10, 2021, which Fallon and over a dozen other Republicans cosponsored.

The previous resolution claimed that the DHS secretary presided ""over a reckless abandonment of border security and immigration enforcement, at the expense of the Constitution and the security of the United States.""

"House Republicans release 'Commitment to America,' finalizing midterm messaging","House Republicans are readying for midterm elections in November. Media buys in the intervening months will only be as effective as the messages they permit politicians to transmit to voters. For this reason, and in hopes of achieving cohesion in the party's communications, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will officially unveil a four-piece ""Commitment to America"" on September 19 in Pittsburgh.

This package of commitments will indicate to voters not only what the GOP intends to combat in the way of Democrat policies, pernicious trends, and perceived corruption, but what it intends to deliver instead to the electorate. The latter is regarded by some as more important — communicating a positive message along with solutions rather than negative messaging.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) told Axios: ""If you're just running on anti-Biden, well, that's not going to get you over the finish line.""

When responding to President Joe Biden's claim that the Republican philosophy is ""semi-fascist,"" McCarthy hinted at the party's forward-looking thematics: ""Our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. Our nation can flourish again, and under a new historic Republic majority, it will.""

Axios reported that McCarthy's latest iteration of the House Republicans' ""Commitment to America"" is the product of the work of seven issue-specific task forces assigned to identify and develop policy solutions to the problems confronting the American people.

The issues tackled by the task forces were: jobs and the economy; big tech censorship and data; the future of American freedoms; energy, climate, and conservation; American security; a healthy future; and China accountability.

A communications kit disseminated by McCarthy last month hinted at the contents of the September 19 release as well as the task forces' determinations. The kit divided Republicans' commitment to America into four documents, detailed below.

""An economy that is strong""

The first document attributed an estimated 550% increase in inflation to Democrat spending and noted the impact of a 12% spike in food prices. It also emphasized American energy dependence, the high price of gasoline, and U.S. reliance on a hostile supply of critical goods (i.e. particularly on communist China).

The proposed remedies:

eliminate wasteful government spending;

reduce the cost of living and boost business with ""pro-growth tax policies"";

reconnect workers with jobs while also disincentivizing remote work;

end Biden's ""anti-energy policies"" and increase the production of American-made energy;

onshore supply lines and manufacturing; and

strengthen and modernize the U.S. stockpile of supplies and medicines.

""A nation that is safe""

The second document pointed to the fallout of the Biden administration's border policies, including the crime and drug deaths resulting from unchecked illegal immigration. It also noted the connections between ""Defund the Police"" initiatives and skyrocketing murders and between failed border policies and the unprecedented number of opioid overdoses.

The southern border and Democrat deference to criminals were not the only focuses, however; foreign policy concerns were also raised. The document stressed the geopolitical threat of communist China amid waning confidence in the U.S. military, particularly after Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The proposed remedies:

require proof of legal status when applying for a job;

restrict welfare benefits that incentivize illegal immigration;

end catch-and-release at the southern border;

finish building the border wall while also fully funding Border Patrol;

make violent crime against police officers a federal offense;

fully fund hiring bonuses to recruit more cops;

deny funding to ""woke district attorneys"" and prosecutors who refuse to prosecute crimes;

invest in the lethality of the U.S. military;

hold the Biden administration responsible for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal;

stand with Israel against Iran and terrorism; and

counter communist Chinese aggression.

""A future that is free""

The third document homed in on three fronts: education, health care, and free speech. On the first front, it underlined a dearth (28%) of confidence in public schools, the Department of Justice's efforts to target parents, and the pandemic's deleterious impact on children's academics. For health care, the document noted Americans' decreasing life expectancy and the possible negative impact of an increasingly socialized approach to medicine. Finally, the document touched both on the addictive and censorious nature of social media.

The proposed remedies:

take action to protect parental rights and expand school choice;

ensure that transsexuals do not ruin girls' school sports;

invest in lifesaving cures;

modernize personal health care and expand access to telemedicine;

scrap Section 230 protections for big tech companies;

provide greater data security protections for citizens; and

counter the cartelization of and collusion between big tech organizations.

""A government that is accountable""

The final document in the communication kit suggests the Democrats have: been opaque in their dealings; worked to silence their critics; applied the law unevenly; and run roughshod over the liberties of conservatives.

The proposed remedies:

promote government transparency and accountability;

uphold free speech and religious liberty;

defend the unborn and protect pro-lifers targeted by bad actors;

safeguard the Second Amendment; and

ensure safe and free elections.

House Republicans previously issued a ""Commitment to America"" in 2020. The 2020 commitment was more geared toward helping then-President Trump continue to execute his mandate and to helping America gain its footing after the pandemic, hence the language of ""restore,"" ""rebuild,"" and ""renew.""

Since Afghanistan had not yet been withdrawn from in a botched manner and nearly 2 million illegals had not yet stolen into the country, geostrategy and the border were not top priorities as they are now. Policing was, however a concern, considering that year the ""Defund the Police"" rhetoric had kicked off, along with the BLM riots.

In March, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich likened McCarthy's recent efforts and his forthcoming ""Commitment to America"" to past Republican efforts, particularly former President Ronald Regan's successful work in 1980 and the GOP's game-changing 1994 Contract.

Gingrich suggested that the House Republicans, by following up on these commitments, will ""replace Pelosi's despotic perversion of the House of Representatives and turn it once again into the 'people's House.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-midterm-agenda-crystallized,2022-09-07
"'Politicized bureaucracy': House Republicans release 1,000-page report against FBI – whistleblowers claim agency is 'rotted at its core' with 'rampant corruption, manipulation, and abuse'","On Friday, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee released a damning 1,000-page report detailing alleged political bias within the FBI and the DOJ.



Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) told Fox News on Friday morning, ""America is not America if you have a Justice Department that treats people differently under the law. It's supposed to be equal treatment under the law. That's not happening. And we know it's not happening because 14 brave FBI agents came to us as whistleblowers and told us exactly what's going on here.""

The report serves as a road map for future investigations into the law enforcement agency should Republicans win back the House in the upcoming midterm elections.

""Whistleblowers described the FBI's Washington hierarchy as 'rotted at its core,' maintaining a 'systemic culture of unaccountability,' and full of 'rampant corruption, manipulation, and abuse,'"" the report stated.

Building on whistleblower claims, the report highlights how the FBI allegedly weaponized its law enforcement power against political opponents and parents who spoke out against far-left idealogy taught in public schools.

The report cited the FBI raid on former President Donald Trump's home and another instance when the agency followed Republican Rep. Scott Perry (Penn.) on a family vacation to seize his personal cell phone.

House Republicans accused the FBI of displaying a political bias against conservatives by purging right-leaning employees from the agency, artificially inflating domestic violent extremism statistics, and aiding social media platforms in censoring conservative political speech online.

The damning report alleged that the FBI provided Hunter Biden ""preferential treatment"" by intentionally burying stories about his business dealings with foreign nationals.

GOP lawmakers also accused the Justice Department and the FBI of selectively neglecting to enforce the law against radical activists who repeatedly attacked pro-life clinics and churches. The report cited 69 separate attacks on pro-life facilities from May 3 to October 8, 2022.

""Equal justice under the law is a cornerstone of American rule of law,"" the report stated. ""By 'purg[ing]' its ranks of conservative employees, shaping big tech's censorship of conservative viewpoints, and uneven law-enforcement actions and litigation targeted against conservative states, the FBI is failing to live up to this standard. In doing so, the FBI is carrying out the Biden Administration's plan to suppress dissent to its woke, leftist agenda.""

Ranking member of the judiciary committee Jim Jordan posted on Twitter, ""The Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the stewardship of Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland, is broken.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-report-fbi-rotten,2022-11-04
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that President Joe Biden 'knows his foreign policy',"During remarks at the Cambridge Union in the U.K. on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that President Biden ""knows his foreign policy.""

The California Democrat said, ""We're so fortunate that he did not win for president before when he ran because we needed him now. He's perfect for now. He knows his foreign policy,"" she said, noting that Biden previously chaired ""the foreign policy committee."" Pelosi said that ""as president, he doesn't come into this learning on the job.""

Biden previously spent several years as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during portions of his more than three-decade career as a U.S. senator. He later spent two terms serving as vice president alongside Democratic President Barack Obama.

Nancy Pelosi | Cambridge Union youtu.be

Pelosi, who is the first and only woman ever to serve as House speaker, has spent more than three decades serving in the House of Representatives. She is currently serving her fourth term as speaker.

The lawmaker's comments about President Biden's supposed foreign policy prowess come at a time when many have been heavily criticizing the Biden administration for botching the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The Taliban swiftly took control in the country, seizing the capital city of Kabul last month. Billions of dollars of weaponry supplied by the U.S. to Afghanistan has fallen into the hands of the Taliban. U.S. service members and others were killed last month during a terror attack in Kabul. And the U.S. announced the completion of its military withdrawal last month even as American citizens and Afghan allies remained stranded there.

A recent Quinnipiac University national poll of adults found that a whopping 65% disapprove of the way the president handled withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, while just 31% approve. The survey also found that 62% believe U.S. troops will need to go back to Afghanistan to combat terrorism, while 28% do not think so.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-claims-that-president-joe-biden-knows-his-foreign-policy,2021-09-16
House votes to repeal 2002 Iraq War authorization in effort to reclaim congressional war powers,"The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of revoking the 2002 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) on Thursday, in a move aimed at returning war powers to Congress that were ceded to the president following 9/11.

What are the details?

The effort, led by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), passed 268-161, with 49 Republicans joining all but one Democrat in voting for the repeal. Proponents argue that the authorization granted under President George W. Bush — for the purpose of military engagement in Iraq — has been abused by occupants of the Oval Office since its passage 19 years ago and utilized to extend far beyond its original purpose.

""Three presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used this permission to drag out conflicts that will get us into new ones,"" Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) said on the House floor prior to voting in favor of the legislation, The Washington Post reported.

Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), another proponent, argued, ""Repeal is crucial because the executive branch has a history of stretching"" [the authorization's legal authority], the Chicago Sun-Times reported. ""It has already been used as justification for military actions against entities that had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist dictatorship simply because such entities were operating in Iraq.""

The New York Post reported that Lee told her colleagues, ""Once we pass a repeal of the 2002 AUMF, we must keep up our fight to repeal the 2001 AUMF so that no future president has the unilateral power to plunge us into endless wars.""

""We can't afford to leave this in place indefinitely,"" she added. ""For two decades, it has been in place. This is our opportunity to restore our constitutional role.""

The New York Post reported that opponents of the measure argued that repealing the 2002 AUMF ""could hinder US counterterrorism efforts, noting it was used as part of the legal rationale that allowed President Donald Trump's administration to move forward with the January 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.""

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said on the floor, ""This feels like yet another political effort to undo one of President Trump's boldest counterterrorism successes: using the 2002 AUMF to remove Soleimani from the battlefield. Soleimani was Iran's mastermind of terror for decades.""

President Joe Biden voted in favor of the AUMF as a senator in 2002, but has since expressed his regret for doing so.

Houston man arrested for abducting a 3-year-old girl from an apartment complex and checking into a motel,"On Sunday, Houston police arrested 50-year-old Holman Hernandez for the alleged abduction of a 3-year-old girl, Lincy Guity.

Yesterday morning, Guity's parents called the police and reported that their daughter was nowhere to be found. They stated that they had gone to bed around 11 p.m. When they woke up, their daughter was missing and the front door to their apartment was left ajar.

The parents attempted to locate the child in the apartment complex but could not find her.

According to KPRC-TV, the child left the apartment in the middle of the night and walked to a neighbor's home, where a gathering was taking place.



When police arrived on the scene, they talked to neighbors and canvassed the area. One witness recalled seeing the child leaving with a man the witness recognized from the gathering. The witness was able to identify the suspect as Homan Hernandez.

Authorities responded by putting out an Amber Alert for Guity and the suspect. Hernandez's vehicle, a Nissan Sentra, was observed in the parking lot of a nearby hotel.

Hernandez's wife contacted the police and told them that her husband had called her to tell her that his vehicle had been stolen. The wife informed authorities that she could hear a little girl's voice in the background during the call.

When police arrived at the hotel, the suspect refused to answer the door. Authorities forced their way into the hotel room. Inside they found Hernandez and the child.

""Officers spoke to management. Management informed officers that they rented a room at approximately 7:30 to the suspect,"" stated Police Chief Troy Finner.

Finner stated that Lincy appeared to be okay. She was taken to a local hospital to be evaluated.

Oneida Hernandez, Guity's mother, stated that she saw a video of the suspect luring Guity into his vehicle with a cat, reported KPRC-TV. She stated, ""Give him the maximum time for taking my daughter.""

""The suspect is in custody. I want to say that he did put up a little bit of a resistance before they took him into custody,"" said Finner.

At this time, authorities do not believe that there is a connection between Hernandez and the child.

Hernandez has been arrested and booked into jail. He was charged with aggravated kidnapping, super aggravated sexual assault of a child, intent to inflict bodily injury, and intent to terrorize. The state recommended that Hernandez's bond be set at $1 million.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/houston-man-arrested-for-abducting-a-3-year-old-girl-from-an-apartment-complex-and-checking-into-a-motel,2022-08-22
"Tucker Carlson reveals email sent to ICE officers after Biden's deportation order: 'Release them all, immediately'","Fox News host Tucker Carlson revealed Friday that his team exclusively obtained an email showing how Immigration and Customs Enforcement was directed to carry out one of President Joe Biden's executive orders on immigration.

What's the background?

After entering office on Wednesday, Biden signed numerous executive orders, many of which reversed the policies of his predecessor, now-former President Donald Trump.

One of the executive orders enacted ""a 100-day pause on deportations for some undocumented immigrants,"" according to the Texas Tribune.

More from the Texas Tribune:

The pause in deportations, which begins Friday, is part of a review and reset of enforcement policies within Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agencies as the Biden administration ""develops its final priorities,"" according to a DHS statement.



The moratorium applies to ""certain noncitizens ordered deported to ensure we have a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety"" according to the DHS. That category excludes any immigrant who is ""suspected of terrorism or espionage, or otherwise poses a danger to the national security of the United States,"" those who entered after Nov. 1 and those who have voluntarily waived any rights to remain in the country, according to a DHS memo.

What did the email say?

Carlson said that his team obtained an internal email sent to ICE officers in Texas.

The email read, ""As of midnight tonight, stop all removals. This includes Mexican bus runs, charter flights and commercial removals (until further notice) ... all cases are to be considered [no significant likelihood of removal in foreseeable future].""

""Release them all, immediately. No sponsor available is not acceptable any longer,"" the message added.

According to Carlson, the directive is the ""result of the complete chaos"" that resulted from Biden's sweeping executive order.

The official who sent the email noted that he was just ""the messenger"" explaining the directive. In other words, It wasn't his idea. It was Joe Biden's. Now, this email was news to us. The memorandum from the Biden administration to halt deportations did not call for people here illegally to be released from detention. So we made some calls, and we learned that the Department of Homeland Security is currently hammering out how to enact the memorandum. It does not specifically call for the instant release of all migrants in detention.



So what was this memo about? Just the result of the complete chaos that resulted when the incoming administration changed a policy this big on its first day without explaining what it means.

As TheBlaze reported, Biden is expected to introduce comprehensive immigration reform within the beginning months of his administration in a massive package that will include a ""pathway to citizenship"" for illegal immigrants.

"Ignoring critics, Tom Cotton doubles down on demands to know what the AP knew about Hamas terrorists in their Gaza building","Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) doubled down on his criticism of the Associated Press Tuesday for allegedly operating its Gaza press bureau in a building shared by Hamas intelligence forces.

Journalists have rebuked Cotton after he defended an Israeli Defense Forces airstrike that destroyed the building housing the AP and other media outlets like Al Jazeera in a speech on the Senate floor Monday.

Israel said it obtained intelligence that Hamas forces were operating there and had alerted journalists and residents that the strike was imminent, allowing for the building to be evacuated before it was destroyed.

Cotton, in his speech, expressed skepticism of the AP's claims of having no knowledge of Hamas' presence in the building despite operating its bureau there for 15 years.

""Why is the Associated Press sharing a building with Hamas?"" Cotton asked Monday. ""Surely these intrepid reporters knew who their neighbors were.""

""Did they knowingly allow themselves to be used as human shields by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization? Did the AP pull its punches and decline to report for years on Hamas' misdeeds?""

HIs questions drew widespread condemnation from members of the media, who accused him of making baseless accusations.

But the fiercely pro-Israel senator from Arkansas fired back at his critics in a follow-up speech on the Senate floor Tuesday.

""One would think that these are simple and reasonable questions, but I directed them to a media organization, so the usual suspects circled the wagon expressing more outrage at my audacity to question the AP's leadership than they do at Hamas for trying to kill Jews by the thousands,"" Cotton said, listing some of the disparaging remarks he's received from journalists on social media.

""The constant refrain of their criticism was that I was attacking the brave reporters of the Associated Press Gaza bureau. My claims were 'baseless', 'reckless', 'without evidence', they claimed. But in fact there's plenty of evidence that some media outlets stationed in Gaza allowed themselves to be used as pawns by Hamas.""

Cotton cited a 2014 article written by a former AP journalist and published in The Atlantic that revealed AP journalists knew about Hamas occupying their Gaza building and had witnessed rockets being fired into Israel from just outside their office. The article's author, Matti Friedman, wrote that Hamas fighters had once burst into the AP's office and threatened the staff, but the AP never reported the incident.

""The AP instead turned a blind eye to terrorism and embraced a culture of silence on behalf of murderers who actively endangered its own reporters and staff,"" Cotton charged. ""What's equally scandalous is the AP continued to locate their offices in a building they knew was dangerous.""

""I'm not sure what's worse, that the AP knew they shared the building with Hamas or that they didn't know,"" he added, before going on to slam the Associated Press.

""Instead of uncovering the truth the AP concealed it. Then, when the IDF carried out its fully justified and wholly appropriate air strike, the AP condemned Israel in one final parting gift to their neighbors, Hamas,"" Cotton said.

""Would the AP allow its reporters to share a building with Al Qaeda? What about ISIS? Because there's little differences between these U.S.-designated terrorist organizations and Hamas.""

'This is wildly immoral': Ilhan Omar is outraged that Biden is considering asking Saudis to pump more oil,"Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was outraged at a report saying President Joe Biden, also a Democrat, is considering asking Saudi Arabia to pump more oil as gas prices skyrocket at home.

Axios reported that Biden may make a trip to Saudi Arabia in spring to ask for increased gas production as energy prices jump skyward as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Omar lashed out at Biden over the suggestion.

""Our response to Putin’s immoral war shouldn’t be to strengthen our relationship with the Saudis who are currently causing the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet in Yemen,"" tweeted Omar.

""Yemenis might not matter to some geopolitically but their humanity should,"" she added. ""This is wildly immoral act.

Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has helped the Yemeni government fight against an insurgent movement by the Houthi Islamists, a group which has been labeled as a terror group.

Others criticized the report for different reasons. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas excoriated the Biden administration for seeking foreign sources of oil after shutting down domestic production.

""Two weeks after Biden banned new drilling on federal lands he's begging Saudi Arabia to drill for more oil. Does he think that only American energy is bad for the environment?"" tweeted Cotton.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that there was no plan yet for Biden to visit Saudi Arabia. She also went on to say that they would not be increasing domestic oil production to ease the oil crisis but instead spun the crisis to validate their anti-oil policies.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” she claimed.

Also on Monday, the stock market continued to tank in response to high oil prices and the escalating war in Ukraine from Russian invasion.

"Ilhan Omar shared video from anti-Israel group, FBI investigated","One day after Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) compared the United States and Israel to Hamas and Taliban terrorists, she retweeted a video from an anti-Israel group that was investigated by the FBI for possible terrorist ties.

The Democratic representative from Minnesota retweeted a video created by the anti-Israel organization International Solidarity Movement on Tuesday, according to Fox News. The video was filmed by activists associated with the organization.

The video was posted on Twitter by Marwa Fatafta, a self-proclaimed ""Palestinian feminist."" The tweet was captioned, ""This Palestinian child carrying his Spider-Man school backpack violently snatched and detained by Israeli forces. His wriggling is too painful to watch, but sure tell this brutalized child that [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] says he can claim justice from his abusers.""

""In 2010, ISM was deemed by the Anti-defamation League (ADL) as one of the top 10 anti-Israel organizations in the country,"" Fox News reported.

The International Solidarity Movement was previously investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to a 2020 report from The Intercept.

""It is clear, however, that the FBI conducted at least two major investigations into ISM,"" the report stated. ""In addition to the international terrorism investigation into the two St. Louis activists, the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office initiated a domestic security investigation into ISM as an organization.""

The documents obtained by The Intercept hinted, ""Nothing in the documents suggests any of these investigations ever resulted in criminal charges.""

The day before Omar retweeted the video questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken, she challenged Blinken on Monday when he appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a panel on which Omar sits.

Omar asked the secretary of state about the Biden administration's opposition to the International Criminal Court pursuing investigations into alleged human rights violations by Israel and the U.S.

""I haven't seen any evidence in either cases that domestic courts both can and will prosecute alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" Omar said to Blinken. ""So in both of these cases, if domestic courts can't or won't pursue justice and we oppose the ICC, where do we think the victims of these supposed crimes can go for justice?""



Blinken responded, ""I believe that we have, whether it's the United States or Israel, we both have the mechanisms to make sure that there is accountability in any situations where there are concerns about the use of force and human rights.""

Following the hearing, Omar tweeted a video questioning Blinken during the hearing with the caption, ""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the US, Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban.""

The comment ignited a firestorm, and even House Democrats slammed Omar for equating the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and Taliban terrorists.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ilhan-omar-israel-terrorism-fbi,2021-06-13
Ilhan Omar calls fatal police shooting of black man 'state sanctioned murder.' But police say he fired first.,"Justice advocates are once again fighting for answers after Minneapolis police fatally shot 23-year-old Dolal Idd on Wednesday.

According to ABC News, Idd was killed in the same neighborhood where George Floyd died in police custody in May. Idd's untimely death is also the first to come at the hands of Minneapolis police officers since Floyd.

In response, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who represents most of Minneapolis, called Idd's death ""state sanctioned murder.""

""A man was killed, his family terrorized & robbed of a son and all they are left w/ is more questions than answers,"" Omar tweeted. ""Let's stop normalizing + justifying state sanctioned murder by those who take an oath to uphold the law.""

What does the bodycam footage show?

According to law enforcement, who have since released brief footage from one of the officers involved in the fatal shooting, police officers only shot and killed Idd after he fired on officers first.

Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said that officers on the scene, nearby witnesses, and the released body cam footage confirm that Idd shot first.

""When I viewed the video that everyone else is viewing... it appears that the individual inside the vehicle fired his weapon at the vehicle first,"" Arradondo said, according to ABC News.

(Content Warning: The following video contains graphic footage):

According to WCCO-TV, police said they were attempting to stop Idd because he was a suspect in a felony gun investigation. ABC News reported that officials said a weapon was recovered at the scene.

Still, Idd's family is demanding answers.

Bayle Gelle, Idd's father, accused police of killing his son for ""no reason.""

""We need justice, we need justice. They don't want to give us any answers,"" Gelle told WCCO. ""He was just sitting in the car, and bullets were shot at him, and no reason. Why are we here?

"Ilhan Omar compares US to Hamas and Taliban terrorists, says all are guilty of 'unthinkable atrocities'","Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) on Monday seemingly compared the United States and Israel to Hamas and Taliban terrorists.

Hamas, the Gaza-based terrorist group, is officially classifiedby the U.S. government as a ""foreign terrorist organization."" However, Taliban soldiers who terrorize Afghanistan are not technically part of a U.S.-designated terrorist group.

What are the details?

Omar, one of the most far-left members of Congress, claimed the U.S. and Israel — along with Afghanistan, Hamas, and the Taliban — have committed ""unthinkable atrocities"" and human rights abuses.

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity,"" Omar said.

The context of Omar's inflammatory claim included her questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday about how perpetrators of human rights abuses — she cited the Israeli security forces and Hamas, the Afghanistan government and the Taliban — will be held accountable, especially because the U.S. government opposes the International Criminal Court, the global tribunal tasked with prosecuting war crimes.



Why exactly, then, Omar invoked the U.S. in her tweet and lumped America into a group with terrorist organizations is unclear — unless she is also publicly accusing the U.S. of committing war crimes and human rights abuses.

Omar did not elaborate on what crimes against humanity she thinks the U.S. is guilty of committing. Interestingly, Omar did not cite the U.S. when she questioned Blinken.

What about Israel?

During military tensions between Israel and Hamas last month — which started when Hamas terrorists began launching rockets from Gaza into Israel — Omar accused Israel of committing war crimes.

""We need accountability for every war crime committed. And we need to stop underwriting crimes against humanity while doing nothing to end the occupation,"" Omar said.

Omar also criticized President Joe Biden for moving forward with a proposed arms sale to Israel, saying, ""The United States should not stand idly by while crimes against humanity are being committed with our backing.""

Despite accusations of war crimes, human rights abuses, and even claims that Israel is operating an ""apartheid"" state, Israeli leaders take special precautions to prevent civilian causalities during military campaigns against Hamas, even calling off military strikes if it means saving innocent lives.

The reason many non-military Gaza residents are killed when military tensions flare is because Hamas operates from residential areas, knowing their strikes will prompt a response from Israeli forces. By locating themselves in residential and civilian areas, Hamas allows Gaza civilians to become causalities knowing international media will provoke empathy for the Palestinian cause.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ilhan-omar-us-hamas-taliban-terrorists,2021-06-08
Rep. Ilhan Omar issues clarification on her divisive comments after blasting Democrats for demanding a clarification,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) issued a clarification on her offensive comments about the U.S. and Israel after lambasting her critics, including other Democrats, for demanding she issue a clarification on her offensive comments.

Omar has been under renewed criticism after she compared the U.S. and Israel to terror groups Hamas and the Taliban.

Some Democrats recoiled from the comments and called on her to publicly retract her own comments. Omar responded with a defiant statement denouncing them for ""silencing"" her.

""It's shameful for colleagues who call me when they need my support to now put out a statement asking for 'clarification' and not just call. The islamophobic tropes in this statement are offensive. The constant harassment & silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable,"" she tweeted on Thursday.

Despite claiming she could not bear their ""offensive"" request, she issued a clarification hours later.

""On Monday, I asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken about an ongoing International Criminal Court investigations [sic],"" she said in the written statement.

""To be clear: the conversation was about accountability for specific incidents regarding those ICC cases, not a moral comparison between Hamas and the Taliban and the U.S. and Israel,"" she claimed.

""I was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems,"" she concluded.

The letter from 12 Democrats members of Congress sent on Wednesday made it clear that they believed Omar had made the comparison she later denied making.

""Equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided,"" read the statement from Democrats.

""Ignoring the differences between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one's intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice,"" they added.

"'Sadistic' illegal alien involved in multiple armed robberies, home invasions, and murders receives 29-year sentence","27-year-old Honduran national Denis Matute has been sentenced to 29 years in jail, after which time he will deported. Matute, in the United States illegally, was a member of a gang of robbers who perpetrated numerous crimes in Texas dating back to 2017.

On August 16, now-retired U.S. Circuit Judge Gregg Costa handed Matute a 9-year sentence for two counts of interference with commerce by robbery and two 10-year sentences for a pair of counts of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.

According to the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of Texas, the court was made aware of ""the details surrounding three additional murders and two home invasions Matute had committed."" Extra to murders, assaults, and home invasions, he had also hijacked a vehicle on his way to rob other American citizens.

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement press release characterized the approach taken by Matute to his victims as ""sadistic.""

In one instance exemplifying his cruelty, he and his gang handcuffed a security guard at Houston's A1 Flea Market. They kicked the victim repeatedly while he was down and defenseless.

While never reluctant to physically terrorize his victims, Matute also utilized psychological torments. He routinely aimed guns at those he was robbing.

When robbing the R&R Pawn Shop in January 2017, for instance, he pointed his weapon at employees' heads while smashing glass and snatching up expensive watches.

Matute is one of many illegal aliens who have stolen into the United States and committed crimes in recent years.

In Texas, between June 1, 2011, and July 31, 2019, over 297,000 non-citizens were booked into local jails for crimes not including immigration violations. Two-thirds of those non-citizens were confirmed by the federal government to be illegal aliens. Of the convictions meted out, there were 500 for homicide, 23,954 for assault, 8,070 for burglaries, 297 for kidnappings, 14,178 for thefts, 2,026 for robberies, and 3,122 for sexual assaults, along with various others.

These numbers do not reflect the surge in crimes committed by illegal aliens that took place more recently in 2021.

Last year, illegal immigrants committed 1,178 assault and domestic violence crimes nationwide. There was also a 1,900% increase in murders committed by illegal aliens across the United States.

In the way of convictions for illegal aliens in 2022, there have so far been 892 for assault and battery; 693 for burglary; 53 for homicide; 1,241 for driving under the influence; 249 for illegal weapons possession; and 283 for sexual offenses.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) noted earlier this year that roughly 2,000 Americans are killed annually by illegal aliens. Murders of citizens by illegal aliens are one “of the dozens of negative effects of illegal aliens in America, aided and abetted by Socialist Democrats who seek political power via a tsunami of illegal aliens.”

Nearly 2 million illegal aliens have stolen across the U.S. southern border in 2022, breaking previous records.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illegala-alien-criminal-sentenced-29-years,2022-09-06

FBI: 2021 had most police officers intentionally killed since 1995,"Intentional killings of police officers spiked by an alarming 59% in 2021 compared to the previous year, according to newly released FBI data.

There were 73 law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2021, according to preliminary year-end data from the FBI. The deaths marked the highest number of cops who were intentionally killed since 1995, when there were 74 police officers murdered. In 2001, there were 70 cops intentionally killed, plus another 72 law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the 9/11 terror attacks.

The FBI defines ""feloniously killed"" as: ""Incident type in which an officer, while engaged in or on account of the performance of their official duties, was fatally injured as a direct result of a willful and intentional act by an offender.""

There were at least eight police officers who were murdered in premeditated, ambush-style attacks last year, according to the FBI. There were 25 cops killed in ""unprovoked"" attacks through December 27 of last year, CNN reported.

Through the end of November 2021, there were reportedly 55 police officers who were killed by gunfire from criminals – up from 39 in the same time frame in 2020 and 2019.

In addition, the number of accidental on-duty police deaths increased last year – with 56 officers being accidentally killed on the job, up from 46 in 2020.



The National Fraternal Order of Police – the oldest and largest police union in the United States – reported that 2021 was the deadliest year for American law enforcement officers in history.

The National Fraternal Order of Police noted that there were 346 officers shot in the line of duty in 2021 – 63 of whom were killed by gunfire. The organization said there were 103 ambush-style attacks on law enforcement officers in 2021 – a 115% increase from the year before.

Last year, the most dangerous states for police officers were Texas with 43 officers shot, Illinois with 29, and California with 23 cops shot.

The attacks on police coincide with record numbers of homicides in at least 16 U.S. cities, including Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Baton Rouge, Columbus, Indianapolis, Jackson, Louisville, Macon, Milwaukee, New Haven, Philadelphia, Portland, Rochester, St. Paul, and Tucson.

Over two-thirds of the most populated cities in the U.S. experienced more homicides in 2021 than in 2020, according to CNN.

""When homicides go up, more shootings go up, and it contributes to an overall increase in violence and police officers find themselves in the middle of that environment,"" Chuck Wexler – the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum – told CNN.

Maria Haberfeld – chair of the Department of Law, Police Sciences, and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College – explained to the outlet, ""There is an overall climate now that is very anti-police, which adds a different angle to what used to happen periodically to police in the past years. The anti-police climate would surge after a high-profile case, and usually after a month or so it would subside. But right now, we're talking about over a year of high-profile, anti-police coverage.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/intentional-killings-police-officers-record-fbi,2022-01-14
"Iowa teacher wrote threatening notes about 'committing gun violence' at school, police say","A high school teacher in Iowa was arrested and charged with making terroristic threats. The teacher allegedly made threats of gun violence by leaving notes around Abraham Lincoln High School, police said. However, the teacher said she had no intention of carrying out the threats, but may have been attempting to bring attention to safety in schools, according to authorities.

Katrina Phelan, 37, reportedly turned herself in after a warrant was issued for her arrest.

""Council Bluffs police detectives conducted an investigation into a series of anonymous handwritten notes found inside the school, all making reference to committing gun violence upon school property,"" a press release from the Council Bluffs Police Department read. ""Each of the notes were reportedly either found in Phelan's classroom or found by Phelan herself, in various locations within the school.""

Once the threatening notes were discovered, the school increased security.

The teacher allegedly penned threatening notes, where she pretended to be a bullied student.

""When interviewed, Phelan admitted to writing the notes,"" police said. ""It was determined that she had no intentions or means of carrying out these threats. In at least one of the notes, Phelan, posing as an unnamed student, wrote that she was tired of being made fun of.""

Citing the affidavit, KETV-TV reported, ""Phelan admitted to writing three of the notes and said they were written on paper from her classroom. Police said she confirmed the handwriting on the note was hers, but couldn't recall writing them.""

Phelan said she wrote the threatening notes ""out of concern, worry, and frustration over the lack of control of her classroom,"" according to the affidavit.

When investigators asked the teacher what she attempted to accomplish with the notes, Phelan allegedly responded that it may have been done to bring attention to her opinion that the school is ""not a safe place.""

Phelan was charged with three counts of making ""threats of terrorism,"" which is a Class D felony punishable by up to five years in prison for each count.

Abraham Lincoln High School administrators sent the following email to the parents of the students, where they explained the gun violence hoax notes and noted that the school no longer employs Phelan:

The Council Bluffs Police Department has concluded its investigation into the threatening notes found at school a few weeks ago. They have determined the source of the notes to be a school employee. Investigators concluded there was no intent or means to carry out the threats. However, the employee has been charged with a crime, has voluntarily surrendered to the police, and will no longer be employed by the Council Bluffs Schools. We appreciate the detectives and their diligence in solving this crime.



During that investigation, students provided us with information that was helpful. This is what we expect from students at ALHS.

We want all students, parents and staff members to have confidence that our schools are safe and supportive environments.

Iran claims top nuclear scientist was assassinated with Israeli involvement,"A top Iranian nuclear scientist, believed by the Israeli government to be the mastermind directing Iran's nuclear weapons program in the early 2000s, was killed in a targeted attack Friday outside of Tehran, according to multiple reports, citing Iranian state media.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday said the killing of scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was ""an act of state terror"" that there were ""serious indications"" of Israeli involvement in his death, though Zarif did not level an outright accusation. According to the Associated Press, Israel did not immediately comment on Fakhrizadeh's death, but Israel has long been suspected of carrying out targeted assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists decades ago.

Fakhrizadeh was a senior officer with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and a professor of physics at Imam Hussein University in Tehran. He was the former leader of Iran's Physics Research Center, the Jerusalem Post reported.



Iranian state TV said Fakhrizadeh was ambushed by ""armed terrorist elements"" and suffered injuries that proved to be fatal. Reports said doctors and paramedics could not save him after he was taken to a hospital.

A statement released by Iran's defense ministry said, ""Armed terrorists targeted a vehicle carrying Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of the ministry's research and innovation organization.

""After a clash between the terrorists and his bodyguards, Mr. Fakhrizadeh was severely injured and rushed to hospital. Unfortunately, the medical team's efforts to save him were unsuccessful and minutes ago he passed away.""

The Fars news agency, which has ties to the IRGC, said the attack occurred in Absard, a small city east of the Iranian capital of Tehran. It said witnesses heard an explosion followed by machine gun fire. A car carrying Fakhrizadeh was the target of the attack, according to the agency.

The Associated Press says no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Zarif issued a statement on Twitter, calling on the international community and the European Union to condemn the attack and suggesting Israel was responsible.

The commander of the IRGC has also sworn vengeance for the killing.

""Assassination of nuclear scientists is the most obvious violation of the global hegemony to prevent our access to modern sciences,"" said Major General Hossein Salami.

Another Iranian official, 2021 Iranian presidential candidate Hossein Dehghan, accused ""Zionists"" of waging war on Iran.

""In the last days of their gambling ally's political life, the Zionists seek to intensify and increase pressure on Iran to wage a full-blown war,"" Dehghan tweeted, seemingly referring to U.S. President Donald Trump. ""We will descend like lightning on the killers of this oppressed martyr and we will make them regret their actions!""

According to BBC Persian reporter Jiyar Gol, Fakharizadeh's death ""is a blow to Iran's security and intelligence services who were tasked with protecting him."" The BBC reports that ""some in Iran even believe the assassination could have been carried out by Iranian security forces working for Israeli and Western intelligence agencies.""

Fakhrizadeh was in charge of Iran's ""Amad"" nuclear program, translated ""Hope."" Israel and other Western countries have accused the program of developing nuclear weapons while Iran has maintained the program was for peaceful purposes.

More from the Associated Press:

The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran ""carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"" in a ""structured program"" through the end of 2003. That was the Amad program, which included work on the carefully timed high explosives needed to detonate a nuclear bomb.



Iran also ""conducted computer modeling of a nuclear explosive device"" before 2005 and between 2005 and 2009, the IAEA has said. The agency said, however, that those calculations were ""incomplete and fragmented.""



IAEA inspectors now monitor Iranian nuclear sites as part of Iran's now-unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.

In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said ""remember that name"" after mentioning Fakhrizadeh in a news conference alleging that Iran had lied about its nuclear weapons program. Netanyahu presented tens of thousands of files of Iranian files acquired by Israeli intelligence from an Iranian nuclear archive.

""A key part of the plan was to form new organizations to continue the work,"" Netanyahu alleged. ""This is how Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of Project Amad, put it. Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-claims-top-nuclear-scientist-was-assassinated-with-israeli-involvement,2020-11-27
"Iran seizes oil tanker, ramps up uranium enrichment to near-nuclear weapon levels","Iran has begun enriching uranium at 20% — a technical step away from the 90% level needed to produce a nuclear weapon — at its underground facility at Fordo, officials in the country announced Monday.

What are the details?

The regime had previously been enriching uranium at 4.5%, which is still in violation of its 2015 nuclear agreement, though at a significantly lower level, NBC News reported.

The move is the latest in a series of escalating actions against the West and comes on the same day that Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized a South Korean oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.

The news also comes just days after satellite photos obtained by the Associated Press showed new construction under way at the facility. Under the nuclear pact, Iran is not permitted to enrich uranium at over 3.5% and is not permitted to enrich uranium at all at its Fordo site, which is located deep within a mountain near the holy city of Qom.

In exchange for limiting enrichment, Iran receives sanctions relief from other parties to the deal: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China.

President Donald Trump removed the United States from the agreement in 2018, arguing the regime could not be trusted and was in fact continuing to construct a bomb in spite of the pact's restrictions.

What else?

Iran has been ramping up its aggressive rhetoric and actions against the U.S. in the waning days of the Trump administration, making some worry that a military conflict may soon commence.

Just last week, top Iranian officials suggested they may attempt to assassinate Trump in retaliation for U.S. forces killing terrorist leader Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike a year ago. Soleimani was the commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.

At the same time, U.S. military leaders said they were bracing for an attack as the anniversary of Soleimani's death approached.

Anything else?

Officials in Iran apparently feel much better about their prospects with new leadership coming to the White House.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani recently bragged he has ""no doubt"" the incoming U.S. administration under Democratic President-elect Joe Biden will ""bow"" to Iran and rejoin the nuclear deal forged when Biden was vice president.

While on the campaign trail, Biden indicated he would rejoin the deal as a starting point for future negotiations with the terror-sponsoring regime.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-uranium-enrichment-seizes-tanker,2021-01-04
"ISIS-K in Afghanistan could be capable of launching terror attack against US in just 6 months, defense official says","ISIS-K terrorists in Afghanistan could have the capability to conduct external attacks on other countries — including the United States — in as little as six to 12 months, a Pentagon official told members of Congress this week.

What are the details?

While testifying in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl warned that the terrorist group has every intention of conducting such attacks but currently lacks the capability. The same is reportedly true of al Qaeda.

But Kahl said that could be changing in relatively short order, according to the Military Times.

""We could see ISIS-K generate that capability somewhere between 6 to 12 months, according to current assessments by the intelligence community. For al Qaida, it would take a year or two to reconstitute that capability,"" Kahl said during the testimony.

""We have to remain vigilant against that possibility,"" he added.

CBS News reported that the timeline greatly differs from the one offered by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley in September. At the time, Milley said that ISIS-K or al Qaeda would need six to 36 months to rebuild — and his timeline referred to only reconstitution, not the time it would take to generate capabilities to attack the U.S.

What else?

ISIS-K is the terrorist group responsible for killing 13 U.S. service members in a bombing outsid e the Kabul airport in Afghanistan in August.

In October, reports surfaced that the terrorist who carried out the attack was one of thousands of prisoners freed from Bagram Air Base in early August when the Taliban seized control of the facility.

The news only further increased criticism against the Biden administration over its bungled withdrawal process from the country, which resulted in tens of thousands of U.S. citizens and Afghan nationals scrambling to exit the country as the Taliban swept through. Many were left stranded.

Anything else?

Testifying alongside Kahl, Lt. Gen. James J. Mingus, joint staff director for operations, was careful to note that the short timeline is only if the U.S. and allies don't intervene.

Kahl, too, seemed to walk back some of the urgency of his report even while warning that ""the terrorist threat continues"" in the region. He noted that intelligence officials report that the risk to the American homeland ""is at its lowest point since Sept. 11, 2001.""

Conservative lawmakers reportedly bristled at the comment.

""It doesn't sound like a low risk when you have just told us that the possibility of an attack from ISIS-K on our homeland could come six to 12 months from now,"" Republican Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa) said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/isis-afghanistan-terror-attack-capability,2021-10-27
"ISIS allegedly threatening to attack Americans in Afghanistan, Biden admin refuses to answer questions on threat","Potential threats from Islamic State terrorists are reportedly complicating United States military evacuation operations in Afghanistan.

What is the background?

The startling new development comes after the U.S. Embassy in Kabul told Americans wishing to leave the country that traveling to the airport in Kabul, where all evacuation operations are taking place, was no longer safe.

""Because of potential security threats outside the gates at the Kabul airport, we are advising U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates at this time unless you receive individual instructions from a U.S. government representative to do so,"" the security alert said.

What are the details?

U.S. officials revealed Saturday the Islamic State's branch in Afghanistan is threatening to attack Americans waiting to be evacuated from Kabul, the Associated Press reported.

Officials, however, did not disclose further details, but the threat level was described as ""significant."" A CBS News reporter confirmed that Taliban outside the Kabul airport were telling people that ISIS was planning an attack.

Because of the threat, the U.S. military is developing alternative methods to get evacuees to the airport safely. ""We are executing an alternate path,"" a defense official told NBC News.

More from the AP:

The Islamic State group — which has long declared a desire to attack America and U.S. interests abroad — has been active in Afghanistan for a number of years, carrying out waves of horrific attacks, mostly on the Shiite minority. The group has been repeatedly targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent years, as well as Taliban attacks. But officials say fragments of the group are still active in Afghanistan, and the U.S. is concerned about it reconstituting in a larger way as the country comes under divisive Taliban rule.

Additionally, a defense official told Fox News, ""There are other terrorists groups we are concerned about as well."" That official also declined to provide further details.

What did the government say?

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby was asked about the threat during a press conference on Saturday, and he declined to provide any additional information.

'You will be pursued to the ends of the earth': US coalition airstrike kills top terrorist ISIS leader,"A top terrorist ISIS leader was killed during a coalition airstrike led by the United States in Iraq, officials announced Friday.

Coalition spokesman Wayne Marotto said in a statement that the airstrike on Wednesday killed 10 ISIS terrorists including Jabbar Salman Ali Farhan al-Issawi. It was a part of a joint mission between the U.S. and Iraqi forces.

""Yasir's death is another significant blow to Daesh resurgence efforts in Iraq,"" said Marotto, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS.

Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi also released a statement about the military victory over the vicious terror organization.

""We promised and fulfilled. I gave my word to pursue Daesh terrorists, we gave them a thundering response. Our heroic armed forces have eliminated Daesh commander Abu Yaser Al-Issawi as part of an intelligence-led operation,"" said Al-Kadhimi.

The terrorist organization had claimed responsibility for a double suicide bombing attack in Baghdad a week previous to the airstrike. The terrorists set off their bombs in a crowded outdoor marketplace, killing 32 people and injuring more than a hundred.

Witnesses said one of the suicide bombers pretended to be sick and detonated his bomb when people crowded to help him. The second terrorist detonated his bomb when others rushed in to help the wounded from the first attack.

""The Coalition will continue to remove key leaders from the battlefield and degrade the terrorist organization,"" said Marotto after the airstrike.

""Terrorists - you will never live in peace,"" he warned, ""you will be pursued to the ends of the earth.""

"ISIS sympathizer was under constant surveillance, but he still managed to stab 6 people in New Zealand terror attack","A man who reportedly supported the Islamic State terror group was shot and killed after a knife attack that wounded 6 people in a supermarket in Auckland, New Zealand.

Authorities admitted that the unidentified man had been under investigation and was under constant surveillance at the time of the attack.

Witnesses said the pulled out a long knife from a display in the store and began stabbing people. Six people in total were wounded, and three were in serious condition.

The man was shot and killed by police within 60 seconds of the attack.

Video posted on social media showed shoppers rushing out of the store in a panic after the attack. Another video appeared to capture the sound of the police shooting.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern condemned the attack but tried to separate the ideology of the ""violent extremist"" from the Islamic faith.

""What happened today was despicable. It was hateful, it was wrong,"" said Ardern.

""It was carried out by an individual, not a faith, not a culture, not an ethnicity,"" she continued. ""But an individual person who was gripped by ideology that is not supported here, by anyone or any community. He alone carries the responsibility for these acts, let that be where the judgement falls.""

Ardern confirmed that the man had been a person of interest to law enforcement authorities for about 5 years. She said that he had been arrested on suspicion of plotting a terror attack in 2020 but that he had been cleared and released by a judge.

The suspect had lived in New Zealand for about 10 years, and was originally from Sri Lanka. Police said that they were confident he acted alone and that there was no further threat to the public.

Pakistani doctor pleads guilty to attempting to join ISIS — wanted to carry out attacks on American soil,"On August 16, Muhammad Masood, 30, pled guilty to attempting to provide material support to ISIS. His plea comes within days of ISIS terrorist El Shafee Elsheikh receiving a life sentence in Virginia for hostage-taking resulting in deaths, including those of four Americans.

Masood, a Pakistani doctor who worked for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, New York, told an FBI informant that ""there is so much I wanted to do here...lon wulf [sic] stuff you know,"" but also that he wanted to fight for ISIS overseas. He bought a plane ticket to fly from Chicago to Amman, Jordan, from which he intended to set off to Syria.

According to an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the reason for Masood's trip was clear: ""i want to kill and get killed ... and kill and get killed."" He noted that he also hated ""smiling at the passing kuffar just to not make them suspicios [sic]."" Kuffar or kafir is a derogatory Arabic term for a non-Muslim, an alternate to ""infidel.""

The criminal complaint also alleges that Masood wrote ""sometimes i [want to] attack enemy when I am behind enemy [lines] itself.""

The pandemic altered his initial travel plans. Jordan closed its borders due to COVID-19, so Masood revised his travel arrangements to fly from Minneapolis to Los Angeles. There he believed the FBI informant would help him find accommodations on a cargo ship bound for ISIS territory. These revised plans were similarly thwarted.

The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force arrested Masood at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on March 19, 2020. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson indicated that Masood will be sentenced at a later date.

Masood is not the only foreign national to recently have been caught in the U.S. supporting or intending to support ISIS.

On June 3, Uzbekistani citizen and Brooklyn resident Dilkhayot Kasimov was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William F. Kuntz II to 15 years in prison for conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS. Kasimov collected money and used it to finance another individual's travel to join ISIS.

In January, 42-year-old Allison Fluke-Ekren was similarly charged with providing material support to ISIS. She left Kansas for Syria and married an Islamic terrorist leader in 2012. She allegedly rose in the ranks of the terror organization, training female terrorists how to fire weapons. Fluke-Ekren reportedly also expressed interest in carrying out a bombing at a mall or college in the U.S..

A 2020 George Washington University report analyzing the finances of 207 U.S.-based ISIS supporters between 2013 and 2020 suggested that very few had a criminal background and that 23.4% engaged in legal fundraising tactics to raise funds to support terrorists.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/isis-supporter-pleads-guilty-in-minnesota-court,2022-08-22
ISIS takes credit for terror attack in Israel that killed at least 2 police officers,"The Islamic State has taken credit for a terror attack in Israel over the weekend, in which at least two Israelis were killed and several others were wounded.

Two Arab-Israeli terrorists who had pledged allegiance to ISIS opened gunfire on a group of police officers and civilians in the city of Hadera late Sunday, police said.

Two 19-year-old Border Police officers, Yazan Fallah and Shirel Aboukaret, were killed during the attack, the Jerusalem Post reports.

The shooting began around 9 p.m. local time, according to police. The attackers waited for a bus to drive by before shooting at the civilians.

Undercover police officers from the Border Police's Counterterrorism Unit were eating at a nearby restaurant when the shooting began. They intervened and killed the perpetrators, authorities said.



Two Israeli men in their 20s were seriously injured by the gunfire, and a 45-year-old man and an Israeli woman in her 20s each suffered light injuries. They were taken to HIllel Yafe Medical Center for treatment, according to the report.



The terrorists were cousins from the Arab city of Umm el-Fahm in Israel, police said. Before the shooting, they posted a video on Facebook swearing allegiance to ISIS. Afterwards, the media arm of ISIS released a statement taking credit for the shooting as well as another deadly terror attack in Beersheba last week.

The terror attack was condemned by Israeli officials.

""Tonight's heinous terrorist attack is an attempt by violent extremists to intimidate and damage the fabric of life here,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said.

Defense Minister Benny Gantz thanked security forces who stopped the terrorists and sent his condolences to the victims' families in a statement Sunday.



""The IDF and all security forces are deployed and prepared with all means to restore calm and maintain the security of Israeli citizens everywhere and in every arena,"" he said. ""We will act vigorously against terrorism and the terrorists, and we will promote the continued reinforcement of the forces on the ground.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in Israel for talks with the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt, Morocco, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, also condemned ""today's terrorist attack in Hadera, Israel.""

""Such senseless acts of violence and murder have no place in society. We stand with our Israeli partners and send our condolences to the families of the victims,"" he said.

Police ramp up enforcement presence after report of threat from ISIS against Virginia shopping centers on Halloween,"Virginia police confirmed that they were ramping up their enforcement presence after a report of a terrorist threat from ISIS against shopping centers in the state.

CBS News learned of the threat from ISIS from a law enforcement source and confirmed it through several Virginian police departments. It said that shopping centers could be targeted in northern Virginia over the Halloween weekend.

The report of the threat was the basis for a law enforcement-sensitive alert.

Fairfax County police chief Kevin Davis said he had been made aware of the threat through regional intelligence partners and that police were aware of the report.

""We have increased our police presence throughout the county, to include major thoroughfares, transit hubs, shopping plazas and shopping malls,"" said Davis.

""It's just our responsibility to have a greater presence, to be more aware, and to ask the community to have their eyes and ears peeled for suspicious activities,"" said Davis at a media briefing Friday.

Davis went on to say that police would be alert for the holiday and for the state election on Tuesday.

""We have an election coming up next Tuesday where we'll have increased patrols throughout the next several days out of an abundance of caution, because that's what we do as a public safety agency,"" Davis explained.

The Arlington County Police Department warned people to stay alert over what they called a ""non-specific, unconfirmed threat to shopping centers.""

Prince William police released a similar statement.

""While we have not received any credible information of a threat, we do ask our community to remain vigilant while we continue working with our law enforcement partners to ensure everyone remains safe,"" the statement read.

Some experts have warned that the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan by the Biden administration had significantly emboldened terrorist groups, including ISIS. That terror group took responsibility for a gruesome terrorist suicide attack during the withdrawal in August that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members and 60 afghans.

'Barbaric' Islamic terrorist El Shafee Elsheikh sentenced to life for abuse and deaths of four Americans,"El Shafee Elsheikh is the Sudanese-born former British national who joined ISIS and committed atrocities in Iraq and Syria. He was convicted in April of hostage-taking resulting in death and other crimes. At a U.S. District Court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, on August 19, Elsheikh was sentenced to life in prison.

Elsheikh, the most senior ISIS terrorist to stand trial in the U.S., had a hand in the imprisonment, abuse and deaths of American hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller.

Whereas Foley, Sotloff, and Kassig were executed on camera, the footage of which was widely circulated online, Mueller was enslaved, raped by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and then killed.



On October 27, 2019, al-Baghdadi ""died like a dog ... like a coward"" in a ""dangerous and daring"" nighttime raid ordered by former President Donald Trump, wherein numerous other ISIS militants were reportedly killed.

Another one of Elsheikh's accomplices who had joined him in leaving England to join ISIS, Mohammed Emwazi (nicknamed ""Jihadi John""), was killed in a 2016 drone strike.

Elsheikh, captured in 2018 by Kurdish-led Syrian defense forces, was spared capital punishment along with his friend Alexanda Kotey because in August 2020, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr waived the death penalty to ensure cooperation from British prosecutors.

Raj Parekh, the lead prosecutor and first assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, requested that Elsheikh's punishment should reflect the Islamic terror group's engagement in ""the systematic torture and abuse of their victims, ultimately resulting in the horrific deaths of at least eight American, British and Japanese citizens, among others, including gruesome executions that were videotaped and broadcast globally.""

The Americans who Elsheikh was convicted of taking hostage were among 26 others taken captive by ISIS between 2012 and 2015. At the terrorist's base in Raqqa, Syria, the hostages were tortured in various ways, including waterboarding, mock executions, food deprivation, electric shocks, and prolonged beatings.

The New York Times reported the hostages were forced to fight one another, witness killings of fellow hostages, and were placed in painful stress positions.

Survivor Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, recalled an instance in 2013 where he and other hostages David Haines, James Foley, and John Cantlie were forced by their ISIS captors to fight one another. Whoever would lose this so called ""Royal Rumble"" would be waterboarded.

Although Elsheikh did not deny fighting for ISIS, his attorneys suggested that he was not actually involved in the kidnappings. They claimed that he had been confused for one of the so called ""Beatles,"" likely because the terrorists wore balaclavas and concealed their faces on camera.



Elsheikh's lawyer, Zachary Deubler, said his client will appeal his conviction. He also requested that Elsheikh not be sent to the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, where he would be indefinitely placed in solitary confinement.

Judge T.S. Ellis III, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, made no such recommendation to the Bureau of Prisons. Concerning the terrorist's conduct and behavior, Ellis said it could only be described as ""horrific, barbaric, brutal, callous, and, of course, criminal.""

Elsheikh's British citizenship was revoked in 2018. He had travelled to the U.K. as a refugee from Sudan, and settled in west London.

An estimated 900 British citizens left the U.K., where 23,000 known potential Islamic terrorists were living as of 2017.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/islamic-terrorist-gets-life-in-prison-for-deaths-of-4-americans,2022-08-19
Israel's military posts video showing how it has taken down more than 60 miles of Hamas tunnels,"For the last week and a half, Hamas terrorists have been indiscriminately launching rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces have been responding with targeted attacks on Hamas assets and personnel — who often hide among civilians and the media.

One of the IDF's top targets has been Hamas' underground tunnel system often referred to as the ""Metro."" The terrorist organization uses the Metro for storing weapons, conducting military operations, surreptitiously moving about Gaza, and carrying out training exercises.

Just last week, the IDF pulled off what became a headline-grabbing attack on a section of the Metro system. The agency duped Hamas into believing IDF troops were initiating a ground attack into Gaza, baiting the terrorists to head to the tunnels. Once the Hamas members were underground, Israel launched a massive air campaign, burying untold numbers of terrorists in their own infrastructure.

The IDF posted a video Wednesday explaining just how effective attacks have been on the Hamas Metro — as well as how extensive the terrorists' tunnel system has been, the New York Post said.

According the video, the Israeli military has taken out 62 miles (100 kilometers) of Metro tunnels so far.

""The Hamas terror organization invested the majority of its finances and efforts over the last decade in digging out a complex tunnel system across the Gaza Strip,"" the video said, adding that the ""extensive project"" was ""in the configuration of a 'metro' network — tunnels connected to each other at intersections and bypasses.""

The Metro, the IDF said, began just as ""individual shafts"" used as hiding places for Hamas operatives after launching rockets.

""The network of tunnels grew and branched off until it became a 'metro' of an internal tunnel system throughout the Gaza Strip,"" the military continued. ""The system enabled military training, mobility, the capacity to carry out and manage military operations without exposing themselves, storage for weaponry, and more.""

The IDF then showed locations of Metro access points and illustrated stages of airstrikes on the system.

IDF spokeswoman Capt. Libby Weiss told the Post that the Metro is ""one of Hamas' most strategic projects, created over the course of years and dug under the people of Gaza near homes, schools and mosques.""



""As a result of IDF activity, more than 62 miles of this network have been destroyed — that's the equivalent of almost a quarter of the NYC subway system,"" Weiss said. ""Rather than investing in the economic development of the Gaza Strip, Hamas sunk tens of millions of dollars in this system.""

IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told the Post that because the tunnels run under civilian areas, the military's airstrikes have been targeting roads above the tunnels in order to ""minimize damage to buildings.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israel-military-video-hamas-tunnels,2021-05-19
"Israel, Sudan agree to normalize relations in deal brokered with help of US: 'Accomplishment for the White House'","Israel and Sudan announced that they had normalized relations in a deal that was brokered with the help of the United States. Sudan becomes the third Arab country to normalize relations with Israel in recent weeks, along with U.S.-brokered agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which were the first nations in the Middle East to recognize Israel in 26 years.

President Donald Trump made the announcement of the agreement on Friday from the Oval Office at the White House. President Trump was on a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, senior U.S. officials told Reuters.

""The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,"" according to a joint statement issued by the three countries. ""In addition, the leaders agreed to begin economic and trade relations, with an initial focus of agriculture.""

During the call, President Trump took a shot at his presidential opponent Joe Biden.

Trump jokingly asked Netanyahu, ""Do you think Sleepy Joe could have made this deal?""

Israel's prime minister diplomatically responds, ""We appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America.""

As part of the agreement, President Trump will notify Congress of his intent to remove Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, which lifted sanctions against Sudan and will allow international financial assistance into the country. Trump signed the document to remove Sudan from the list while flying on Air Force One on Thursday night following the final presidential debate, according to a senior U.S. official.



Sudan has been listed as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 when al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden lived in the country as a guest of the government.

Earlier this week, Sudan's new government paid $335 million to the victims of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The terror attacks killed more than 220 people.

The U.S. side of the negotiations was led by Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner, Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and national security official Miguel Correa.

""This is obviously a great breakthrough,"" Kushner told Reuters. ""This is obviously going to create a big breakthrough peace between Israel and Sudan. Getting peace agreements done are not as easy as we are making them look right now. They are very hard to do.""

Pundits noted that this agreement is a big step in the process of peace in the Middle East. Oren Liebermann, CNN correspondent based in Jerusalem, noted that the agreement is a ""significant statement"" and ""certainly a foreign policy accomplishment for the White House.""

Not everyone was excited about the developments of potential peace in the Middle East. MSNBC host Chris Hayes downplayed the most recent agreement between Sudan and Israel.



""It's kind of hilarious that in end, the one thing Jared Kushner actually did get done was brokering a bunch of (incredibly cynical and transactional) middle east deals,"" Hayes tweeted.

During the news conference, President Trump said the agreement cost the United States ""nothing."" Trump also said that there are ""at least five"" countries who want to ""come into the peace deal.""

In September, Trump touted that there were ""at least five or six countries"" that could potentially make peace with Israel in the near future. Before the signing ceremony for the Abraham Accords at the White House last month, Trump said, ""We're very far down the road with about five additional countries ... frankly, I think we could have had them here today.""



""They want to see peace,"" Trump said. ""They've been fighting for a long time. They're tired. They're warring countries but they're tired, they're tired of fighting. So you're going to be seeing further announcements.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israel-sudan-normalize-relations-deal-trump,2020-10-23
"Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist from 1,000 miles away using a remote-controlled sniper machine gun","Late last year, Israeli intelligence agents killed Iran's top nuclear scientist from 1,000 miles away using a high-powered, remote-controlled sniper machine gun, the New York Times reported over the weekend.

What are the details?

The meticulously planned Nov. 27, 2020, assassination plot of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, considered the father of Iran's nuclear weapons program, had been in the works for nearly a year. In fact, the Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, had been seeking to kill Fakhrizadeh for more than a decade.

But now that former President Donald Trump appeared to have lost the election and with his successor, President Joe Biden, just weeks from taking office, it was go time, the Times reported. Biden had promised to reverse Trump's hard-line policies toward Iran and rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal with the terror-sponsoring country, which Israel adamantly opposed.

Fakhrizadeh, despite being under constant threat of assassination, opted against using extra protective measures advised by his security team. Instead of being escorted in an armored vehicle, he decided to drive himself and his wife from their vacation home near the Caspian Sea back to their country home in Absard in their black Nissan Teana sedan.

Little did he know that waiting for him in Absard was a hidden remote killing machine, well positioned to take his life. Here's what happened next, according to the Times:

Iranian agents working for the Mossad had parked a blue Nissan Zamyad pickup truck on the side of the road connecting Absard to the main highway. The spot was on a slight elevation with a view of approaching vehicles. Hidden beneath tarpaulins and decoy construction material in the truck bed was a 7.62-mm sniper machine gun.



Around 1 p.m., the hit team received a signal that Mr. Fakhrizadeh, his wife and a team of armed guards in escort cars were about to leave for Absard, where many of Iran's elite have second homes and vacation villas.



The assassin, a skilled sniper, took up his position, calibrated the gun sights, cocked the weapon and lightly touched the trigger.



He was nowhere near Absard, however. He was peering into a computer screen at an undisclosed location more than 1,000 miles away. The entire hit squad had already left Iran.



... The machine gun fired a burst of bullets, hitting the front of the car below the windshield. It is not clear if these shots hit Mr. Fakhrizadeh but the car swerved and came to a stop.The shooter adjusted the sights and fired another burst, hitting the windshield at least three times and Mr. Fakhrizadeh at least once in the shoulder. He stepped out of the car and crouched behind the open front door.



According to Iran's Fars News, three more bullets tore into his spine. He collapsed on the road.

Elsewhere in its report, the Times noted that the gun used to kill Fakhrizadeh, a special model of the Belgian-made FN MAG machine gun, is capable of firing 600 rounds in a minute. The nuclear weapons scientist didn't stand a chance.

What else?

The assault was a major victory for Israel, as Fakhrizadeh had been on the country's hit list since 2007.

In 2018, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the scientist's name several times during a news conference in which he revealed mounds of evidence allegedly proving that Iran had been lying about its nuclear weapons program.

""Remember that name,"" he said. ""Fakhrizadeh.""

Yet strangely, in its in-depth write-up of the assassination, the Times seemed to memorialize Fakhrizadeh, speaking of him in a positive light and describing him as a lover of poetry and seaside vacations.

""Despite his prominent position in Iran's military establishment, Mr. Fakhrizadeh wanted to live a normal life,"" the Times reported. ""He craved small domestic pleasures: reading Persian poetry, taking his family to the seashore, going for drives in the countryside.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-sniper-killed-iran-top-nuclear-scientist,2021-09-20
'It's crazy': FBI Director Wray confirms there are multiple open investigations into domestic extremist attacks on pro-life groups and churches,"FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed Thursday that there are multiple open investigations into domestic terrorist threats against pro-life organizations by the FBI's joint terrorism task forces.

The director testified during a Senate oversight hearing that the FBI is thoroughly investigating all acts of violence committed by either side of the abortion debate in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.



""I want to be crystal clear on this. From our perspective, I don't care what side of the issue you're on, I don't care who you're upset with or what you're upset about. On abortion or anything else, you don't get to use violence or threats of violence to act on it. And we're going to go after that conduct aggressively,"" Wray said.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) had asked the director about how pro-abortion activists have violently targeted more than 82 churches and pro-life pregnancy centers in the months since the Supreme Court's majority decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Center was leaked in May. Crimes committed against pro-life groups have ranged from acts of vandalism to firebombings and other terroristic threats.

""How many domestic terrorism investigations does the FBI currently have open under the category of abortion-related violent extremism?"" Lee asked.

""I don't have the exact number, but I can tell you that we have opened a number of domestic violent extremism investigations using our joint terrorism task forces that are specifically focused on attacks or threats against churches, pro-life organizations, pregnancy resource centers, similar types of organizations,"" Wray said.



Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) followed up after Lee and asked the director about threats by pro-life activists against abortion clinics or pro-choice people.

""We have seen violent threats, as noted, on both sides of the debate, but a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of a crisis pregnancy center in Nashville, arson at a Wyoming abortion clinic,"" Klobuchar said. ""I know that you have condemned violence, but could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of clinics themselves seeing threats?""

Wray said that ""historically"" there have been attacks against abortion clinics and pro-choice organizations and that since the Dobbs opinion was leaked, there has been ""an intensification of violence across the issue.""

""But we have seen a notable uptick in violence, which we had not seen as much of before, directed at the kinds of organizations and facilities that Sen. Lee mentioned. But there's absolutely the kind that you mentioned as well, and I think this is part of a larger phenomenon that we are experiencing in this country right now,"" he continued.

""I understand that passions run high, especially on an issue like abortion, but there are just way too many people who seem to think that that justifies engaging in violence and destruction of property, threats of violence — you mentioned Molotov cocktails, I feel like every day I'm getting briefed on someone throwing a Molotov cocktail at someone for some issue. It's crazy.""

"Jake Tapper grills Antony Blinken over Afghanistan failures, directly calls out Biden for being 'so wrong'","CNN anchor Jake Tapper confronted Secretary of State Antony Blinken Sunday over the imminent collapse of Afghanistan, grilling the top American diplomat over comparisons to America's humiliating evacuation from Vietnam.

Viral images showed Sunday that American helicopters were evacuating U.S. personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul as Taliban soldiers began seizing control of the Afghan capital city. Comparisons were immediately drawn to the evacuation of American personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon when communist soldiers seized the then-South Vietnam capital city in April 1975.

What happened?

During an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Blinken squarely denied that America is experiencing another ""Saigon moment.""

""With this troop surge to airlift Americans out of Afghanistan, aren't we already in the midst of a Saigon moment?"" Tapper asked.

Blinken quickly rejected the comparison, and claimed that America's mission in Afghanistan has been successful.

""No, we're not,"" Blinken responded. ""Remember, this is not Saigon. We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission. And that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11. And we have succeeded in that mission. The objective that we set, bringing those who attacked us to justice, making sure that they couldn't attack us again from Afghanistan, we have succeeded in that mission.""



""And, in fact, we succeeded a while ago,"" he added. ""And, at the same time, remaining in Afghanistan for another one, five, 10 years is not in the national interest.""

Tapper followed up by questioning Blinken whether he thinks ""Afghanistan now is going to become a hotbed of terrorism."" Blinken responded, ""I can't tell you what the Taliban is going to do.""

Earlier in the interview, Tapper grilled Blinken over Biden's comments from last month, when he declared that it was ""highly unlikely"" the Taliban would overrun Afghanistan.

Blinken, however, kept attempting to steer the conversation away from the Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.



""You keep changing the subject to whether or not we should be there forever. And I'm not talking about that,"" Tapper chided Blinken. ""I'm talking about whether or not this exit was done properly, taking out all the service members before those Americans and those Afghan translators could get out. That's what I'm talking about. And then you have to send people back in. That's the definition of, 'Oh, we shouldn't have taken those troops out, because now we have to send twice as many back in.'""

What did Tapper say about Biden?

Before interviewing Blinken, Tapper shredded Biden for the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, saying, ""it seems shocking that President Biden could have been so wrong.""

""He was wrong,"" Tapper said again, later referring to Biden's promises that the Taliban would not overrun the Afghan government.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jake-tapper-grills-antony-blinken-afghanistan,2021-08-15
"Democratic socialist Jamaal Bowman requested special police protection despite demanding to defund the police, saying cops 'serve the institution of white supremacy'","Freshman Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) requested special police protection to guard his home, according to a new report. Bowman, a Democratic socialist, allegedly asked for increased police protection despite being a staunch supporter of the defund the police movement and asserting that policing is rife with ""white supremacy.""

Following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, Bowman reportedly asked for an increased police presence at his home in Yonkers, New York.

""About a week after the Jan. 6th incident at the Capitol, we received a request from the Congressman's office for increased police presence at his residence,"" Yonkers Police Department Detective Lt. Dean Politopoulos told the New York Post.

""In response, our Intelligence Unit was notified of the request and the local precinct instituted what is called a directed patrol at the Congressman's home for the next two weeks,"" Politopoulos said.

Politopoulos said law enforcement has not seen anything unusual near Bowman's home since the request for special police protection.

Bowman pleaded for extra police protection despite being a vocal supporter of the defund the police movement.

""A system this cruel and inhumane can't be reformed. Defund the police, and defund the system that's terrorizing our communities,"" Bowman said in December 2020.

""Defund the police means defund the occupation of black bodies and the militarization of our communities,"" the far-left Democrat wrote on Twitter last August.

""We need to defund the police,"" Bowman said in February. ""Then we need to scrutinize the ones that remain with the full force of the law.""



""We screamed defund the police so we could reallocate those resources toward something that focuses on true public health and public safety,"" Bowman tweeted in April.

Former President Barack Obama, who endorsed Bowman in 2020, critiqued the ""defund the police"" slogan, which caused the rookie New York representative to lash out at the former president, ""The problem is America's comfort with Black death — not discomfort with slogans.""

Bowman asked for police to guard his home despite repeatedly linking police officers with white supremacy.

""We will reimagine every American institution that stands on a foundation of white supremacy. Including the police.""

""Policing has a white supremacy problem.""

""Police officers have sworn to protect and serve the institution of white supremacy, whether they know it or not. Black people are more likely to be killed by police, go to jail, stay in jail, and live in poverty within a corrupt capitalist system.""

""Too many police in our country are more concerned with protecting white supremacy than serving the communities that pay their salaries.""

""We need to impeach Trump immediately. Then we need to urgently and explicitly address white supremacy and its presence in our police forces.""

""Why was a fascist, white supremacist mob able to overwhelm Capitol Police? Do ties exist between the white supremacists who launched that attack and members of the police force?""

""What are the police defending? White supremacy or the freedom of us all?""

""White nationalism is a threat to democracy. But our white institutions — the government, police, and mainstream media — refuse to treat it as such.""

""I feel rage. I feel terror. I feel numb. We are murdered by police and civilians with impunity. What do I tell my sons? What do I tell my daughter? What do we tell our children? We must fight for the rest of our lives to end white supremacy once and for all!""

A spokeswoman for Bowman claimed that the Bowman needed police protection police at his home because he ""received threats.""



""U.S. Capitol Police advised us to reach out to local authorities to request heightened patrolling of his residence until the situation was mitigated. We followed their advice,"" chief of staff Sarah Iddrissu told the New York Post.

The New York Post added, ""She declined to elaborate on the threats beyond saying they were of 'varying degrees of alarm.' Iddrissu also sidestepped inquiries about whether the Congressman's actions were hypocritical in light of his anti-police stances.""

A recent report found that minorities do not support far-left proposals such as defunding or abolishing the police as much as progressive politicians would like you to believe.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jamaal-bowman-defund-police-white-supremacy,2021-06-27
Jemele Hill says ‘patriotic symbols have been weaponized’ to ‘undermine and diminish the humanity of black and brown Americans’,"Sports journalist and writer Jemele Hill declared recently that sports should absolutely nix the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" ahead of games because the practice has merely become an ""empty gesture of patriotism.""

Hill also insisted that the national anthem and the American flag have both been ""weaponized"" against U.S. citizens in order to ""undermine and diminish the humanity of black and brown Americans.""

What are the details?

In an article for the Atlantic titled ""The Problem with Mandatory Patriotism in Sports,"" Hill wrote, ""Playing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at sporting events has become an empty gesture of patriotism — so empty that, when the NBA's Dallas Mavericks quietly began skipping the ritual, 13 preseason and regular-season games passed before anyone noticed.""

Hill was referring to last week's news that the Dallas Mavericks stopped playing the national anthem before games.

Following the news, the NBA almost immediately responded and said that the national anthem must be played before all games in accordance with league rules. Its response was reportedly a direct rebuff of the Mavericks' decision.

""The Mavericks should have held their ground,"" Hill reasoned, ""because playing the national anthem shouldn't be a pregame ritual in American sports. No during a time when many people — including many athletes of color — are deeply uncomfortable with how patriotic symbols have been weaponized to undermine and diminish the humanity of black and brown Americans.""

National anthem has been interpreted as 'mocking or threatening' black people

Insisting that the NBA should altogether revisit its national anthem rule, Hill added, ""The ritual enforces a rote, narrow idea of patriotism — one that pro sports should be working to change, not uphold.""

""The anthem has always represented the nation's hypocrisy more so than its promises,"" she insisted. ""The lyricist was Francis Scott Key, a Maryland slave owner who once said that Africans in America were a 'distinct and inferior race of people, which all experience proves to be the greatest evil that afflicts a community.' Key wrote the song during the War of 1812. The second half of its third verse — which includes the lyric 'No refuge could save the hireling and slave, from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave' — has been interpreted as mocking or threatening the black people who escaped their enslavers and fought for the British.""

Hill continued, pointing out that the national anthem, ""was meant to rally spectators around American democracy"" during sporting events that dated back to the Civil War.

""The song that eventually became the national anthem was meant to rally spectators around American democracy — even if conditions in the United States were deeply unequal,"" she added.

Trump and conservatives were able to 'hijack the conversation'

In contemporary society, Hill noted, ""Commentators who did not object when the anthem was used for conservative causes became indignant when Colin Kaepernick used it in 2016 to draw attention to police violence against black people.""

""In taking a knee during 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' the former NFL quarterback unwittingly created an opportunity for former President Donald Trump and other conservatives to hijack the conversation,"" Hill insisted. ""As a candidate and as president, Trump criticized Kaepernick's protest to score political points. Real patriots stood for the anthem, Trump and his supporters insisted. And in their view, those who stood – or peacefully kneeled — against injustice were traitors.""

During Trump's presidency, Hill pointed out, Americans were subjected to ""far too many images of white supremacists waving the national flag"" while ""shouting patriotic slogans.""

""The insurrectionists at the U.S. Capitol did just that, even as they tried to overturn a free election,"" Hill wrote. ""Trump any many other Republicans who impugned Kaepernick's patriotism now want the rest of the country to ignore the Capitol riot and move on. If it wasn't clear before why people of color feel uncomfortable with the conservative definition of patriotism, it should be now.""

Hill concluded, ""Mandatory patriotism doesn't give Americans reason for pride; it only highlights the country's failures.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki 'out of the office' this week as Afghanistan falls and President Biden vacations,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki is ""out of the office"" this week while President Joe Biden vacations at Camp David — all while Afghanistan rapidly falls to the Taliban in a stunning takeover, Fox News reported.

What are the details?

The cable network said it sent questions to Psaki's White House email address Sunday morning and then tried to reach her once again Sunday evening — and each time received the same auto-reply: Psaki wouldn't be available this week.

""I will be out of the office from August 15th-August 22nd,"" Fox News said the auto-reply read. Others received the same auto-reply:

Although Biden is on a scheduled vacation, Republicans ripped his absence amid a colossal disaster in a country that was the primary focal point following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States — a month shy of 20 years ago.

""Joe Biden has been commander-in-chief for seven months — the current failure in Afghanistan falls squarely on his shoulders,"" Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. ""His lack of leadership during this pivotal moment has been shameful — it has only served to embolden our adversaries and let down our allies.""

Indeed, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani fled to Tajikistan, the presidential palace in Kabul on Sunday was ""handed over"" to the Taliban, and U.S. diplomatic members were forced to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on helicopters — a scene that drew comparisons to the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war.

In addition, Biden reportedly ""overruled"" top U.S. military commanders when he authorized the full withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. Vice President Kamala Harris also played a ""key role"" in Biden's decision.

What did folks have to say about Psaki?

Psaki's absence only added fuel to criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the crisis:

Anything else?

Biden issued a Saturday statement placing blame on former President Donald Trump for the Afghanistan debacle — after which Trump blasted Biden, saying the current commander-in-chief ""gets it wrong every time on foreign policy.""

It's also been reported that Biden will address the American people on the Afghanistan situation in the ""next few days.""

'Abolitionist' professor says 9/11 was attack on 'heteropatriarchal capitalistic systems' that benefit white people,"Dr. Jenn Jackson, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, triggered an avalanche of backlash after claiming Friday the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an attack on ""heteropatriarchal capitalistic systems"" that ""white Americans fight to protect.""

Jackson's website biography reads, ""Jenn M. Jackson (they/them) is a queer genderflux androgynous Black woman, an abolitionist, a lover of all Black people, and an Assistant Professor at Syracuse University in the Department of Political Science.""

What did Jackson say?

Jackson published a series of tweets Friday that vocalized her problems with how ""white pundits and correspondents"" talk about 9/11, and the impact those tragic events had on America.

""It's twenty years since 9/11 and I'm still really disturbed by how many white pundits and correspondents talk about it,"" Jackson began. ""I'm watching [White House chief of staff on 9/11] Andy Card and [Former Homeland Security Secretary] Jeh Johnson on MSNBC. Card just said that 9/11 was the first time that Americans ever felt fear. He said that it was the last morning we woke up without fear and that the 'terrorists' succeeded in introducing us to fear.""

""White Americans might not have really felt true fear before 9/11 because they never felt what it meant to be accessible, vulnerable, and on the receiving side of military violence at home. But, white Americans' experiences are not a stand-in for 'America,'"" Jackson continued. ""Plenty of us Americans know what it's like to experience fear and we knew before 9/11. For a lot of us, we know fear *because* of other Americans.""

""We have to be more honest about what 9/11 was and what it wasn't. It was an attack on the heteropatriarchal capitalistic systems that America relies upon to wrangle other countries into passivity. It was an attack on the systems many white Americans fight to protect,"" Jackson added.

""We have to be clear that the same motivations that animated America's hypervigilance and responsiveness to 'terror' after 9/11 are now motivating the carceral state and anti-immigration policy,"" Jackson said.

What was the response?

Jackson's remarks generated a mountain of criticism and mockery, which pointed out that Islamic fundamentalists are certainly not motivated by femenist or pro-LGBT ideology.



""This is the kind of disturbing rubbish people spout when they see the world through a lens of identity politics. We need to reverse the long march through the institutions,"" one person said.

""Yes, the fundamentalist Islamic men were attacking 'heteropatriarch capitalist systems' because fundamentalist Islam is a very pro feminist pro LGBT ideology you absolute doorknob,"" another person said.

""What a race-hustling hatemonger Jenn Jackson is,"" another person said.

""SU has a professor on staff, Jenn Jackson, that's clearly a racist and has zero empathy for what took place on 9/11. Look at what she tweeted yesterday of all days. Every SU alumni should be disgusted with who SU is willing to employ and keep employed,"" another person said.

""The language of wokeism… it uses colorful, smart & complicated sounding phrases tossed into a word salad and mixed with emotional expressions so you can't deconstruct the nonsense. Jenn Jackson is a poster child of a crazy person acting as a paid pseudo intellectual,"" one person said.

""If it's one thing Islamic terrorists hate it's the 'heteropatriarchy,"" one person mocked.

""Yes, Al Qaeda is well known for it's feminist and pro-LGBTQ+ activism,"" another person mocked.

""Let me make sure I am getting this correct... The 9/11 attack by arguably the most heteropatriarchal people on earth was orchestrated because of America heteropatriarchal systems? I'm sure the female & LGBTQ execs who died in the Twin Towers would love this hot take,"" another person said.

""oh yes, the people behind 9/11 are known for their liberal views and dismantling of heteropatriarchal systems. just ask all the girls who want to go to school or drive over there,"" one person said.

After Jackson's tweets began generating attention online, she ""locked"" her Twitter account, which means that people who were not following her before cannot see her tweets now.

However, Jackson's tweets were archived, which you can see here.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jenn-jackson-sept-11-attack-comments-backlash,2021-09-11
Miami man with gun stop anti-Semitic attack on Jewish family,"Florida police are investigating an alleged hate-fueled incident where a group of young men terrorized a Jewish family, who were visiting from Teaneck, New Jersey. The men shouted anti-Semitic threats at the family, but stopped the intimidating harassment when a man with a gun intervened, according to several reports.

Eric Orgen and his family were visiting Bal Harbour, located a few miles north of Miami Beach. Orgen, his wife Karen, his 16-year-old daughter, and Mark Schwartz, the deputy mayor of Teaneck, had just left a synagogue in the area and were walking on the sidewalk of Collins Avenue.

Four men said to be in their 20s in a white SUV allegedly drove up to the family and began screaming anti-Semitic remarks, ""F*** you, Jew"" and ""Die Jew."" They also said they were going to rape his wife and daughter, according to a Facebook post written by Orgen. The group reportedly threw garbage and a water bottle at the family while yelling, ""Free Palestine!""

""They just started screaming some derogatory things towards Jewish people out the window,"" Orgen told WPEC-TV. ""My first thought was just making sure my wife and daughter were behind me so I could take the brunt of anything that was going to happen.""

A driver of an Audi was right behind the SUV and allegedly witnessed the hateful harassment. The motorist, who was armed, got out of his car and ""pulled his gun to protect us and chased them as they drove away,"" Orgen claimed. ""So thankful that a total stranger stepped up to protect us!""

Orgen reported the incident to local law enforcement, which is investigating the alleged incident.

""It's a scary world we live in but the world is big enough for everyone to live peacefully. We all bleed red,"" Orgen told WSVN-TV, adding that he believed the incident was a hate crime.

Bal Harbour Mayor Gabriel Groisman issued a statement on the reported incident.

""Bal Harbour Police Department is actively investigating the incident, and I am confident that they will track down the perpetrators,"" Groisman wrote on Facebook. ""We have ZERO TOLERANCE for criminal conduct in our municipality, and we will do everything in our power to keep all residents and visitors in Bal Harbour safe.""

Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava issued a statement regarding recent anti-Semitic incidents in South Florida that began following the commencement of the most recent Israel-Gaza conflict.

""Acts of hate and violence against any community are not tolerated in Miami-Dade County,"" Cava said. ""Hate and intolerance contradict the foundations of our community – a place where so many generations of people found a safe home after fleeing their own countries to build a new life with their families.""

""As a member of the Jewish community and the first Jewish Mayor of Miami-Dade, acts of antisemitism in our County cut especially close to home,"" she continued. ""They also deepen my commitment to ensure Miami-Dade remains a place where all people are welcomed, respected, and made to feel at home, regardless of where they come from or their faith.""

On May 14, Miami police arrested Joseph Bounds, who was driving a van that was covered in anti-Semitic slurs and swastikas disrupting a pro-Israel rally in Boca Raton. The vehicle flew Palestinian flags, and had hateful remarks such as ""Jews killed Jesus,"" ""Jews are not white,"" ""vax the Jews,"" and ""Hitler was right."" There were at least six men raising their arms in the Nazi salute, according to the Miami Herald.

"'American Taliban': CNN's Jim Acosta compares Tucker Carlson, GOP lawmakers to terrorist group","CNN anchor Jim Acosta attacked Republicans and singled-out Fox News host Tucker Carlson on his weekend show Saturday, comparing some Republican lawmakers to the Taliban and calling Carlson a ""human manure spreader.""

At the center of his criticism, Acosta blasted Republicans and Carlson for expressing concern about the influx of Afghan refugees into the U.S. Carlson, for example, has said ""They're not all heroes. We don't know who they are,"" while Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), for example, has raised alarm about the refugee vetting process.

""Over on Fox, human manure spreader Tucker Carlson has floated yet another race-baiting conspiracy theory that tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are being welcomed into this country in order to change the outcome of future elections,"" Acosta said.

While delivering his anti-GOP monologue, CNN blared a chyron at the bottom of the screen that read, ""It's the far-right, not Afghan refugees, posing a threat to democracy.""

'Sort of like an American Taliban': Acosta calls out GOP figures www.youtube.com

The duration of Acosta's monologue recycled tired anti-Republican insults, such as calling the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol an ""insurrection"" and alleging the Texas law banning abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat sends a ""Handmaid's Tale vibe.""



That's when Acosta likened some Republicans to an ""American Taliban.""

""Some members of the far-right in this country have apparently decided they will resort to intimidation, and in some cases, even violence to get what they want. And they could sweep in power faster than the experts thought possible. Sound familiar? Sort of like an American Taliban,"" Acosta said.

""It is starting to look like a combination of theocracy and thugocracy. The leaders of this 'Magaban' movement — people like Marjorie [Taylor Greene], Madison [Cawthorn], and Tucker — they're not counting on an intelligence failure or a lack of planning on your part; they're counting on a lack of courage to stand up for your rights in this country,"" he continued.

""The anti-immigration, anti-democratic, anti-women's rights forces have all sought these kinds of changes for years, even decades in this country. Their operation to change America forever is well underway. It's just changing in a way that they don't want you to see,"" Acosta added.

Anything else?

Security concerns about some Afghan refugees is not without cause.

In fact, NBC News reported, ""Of more than 30,000 evacuees from Afghanistan to the U.S., about 10,000 needed additional screening as of Friday, said the sources, and of those about 100 were flagged for possible ties to the Taliban or terror groups. Two of those 100 raised enough concern for additional review.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-acosta-republican-lawmakers-,2021-09-05
Jim Jordan reveals just who might be investigated if the GOP takes the House in the midterm elections,"In an interview on “The Truth with Lisa Boothe” podcast, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) listed investigations he intends to prioritize should the Republican Party win a majority of seats in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections.

Currently, Jordan serves as the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Upon the Republican Party becoming the majority, he is positioned to become the committee’s chairman. As chairman, Jordan will be able to determine how the committee spends its time and resources.

When asked what sort of investigations he would pursue as Judiciary Committee Chair, the congressman expressed an interest in investigating the Department of Justice’s practice of flagging concerned moms and dads who make local school boards feel uncomfortable. Jordan said that this is “priority number one.”

In the fall of 2021, as parents nationwide became increasingly vocal about their opposition to schools teaching Critical Race Theory, President Biden’s Department of Justice began to label them as potential terror threats. The DOJ started this process shortly after a letter from the National School Boards Association prompted the President to protect them from accountability.

His second priority would be investigating the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to try and put an end to the “chaos that is now our southern border.” Jordan told Boothe, “Secretary Mayorkas every year would come in front of the Judiciary Committee because we have primary jurisdiction over immigration law, and he’s yet to appear in front of our committee.”

For over a year, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee have pushed Chairman Jerry Nadler to schedule a hearing concerning the ongoing immigration crisis with Secretary Mayorkas. Republican members of the House of Representatives have been highly critical of Mayorkas for not adequately addressing the seemingly perpetual immigration crisis at the country’s southern border with Mexico.

Lastly, Jordan expressed an interest in a joint investigation with the House Oversight Committee collaborating with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin into the origins of COVID-19 and Anthony Fauci.

In June, Jordan and Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) sought the White House’s cooperation in getting Anthony Fauci to explain potential discrepancies in his sworn congressional testimony regarding American subsidized gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The letter the two congressmen sent to the White House seeks clarification about the statements made under oath by Fauci in May, which appear to contradict previous comments he made and actions taken which show him endorsing gain-of-function research.

As it currently stands, the GOP has an 85% chance of retaking the House of Representatives and a 73% chance of retaking the Senate, according to MarketWatch.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-jordan-reveals-just-who-might-get-investigated-if-the-gop-takes-the-house-in-the-midterm-elections,2022-01-21
"Man planned to kill Joe Biden, van full of guns","A 19-year-old man with a van full of guns and explosives was arrested in North Carolina after he made threats online and contemplated assassinating Joe Biden, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Beast.

Around 11 a.m. on May 28, the Kannapolis Police Department was asked to tow an abandoned van from the parking lot of the Third Bank in Kannapolis, North Carolina. Through the window, officers spotted an AR-15 style rifle, a box for a .380-caliber handgun, a canister ""of the explosive material Tannerite,"" and a box of 5.56-caliber ammunition, according to a police report.

The van, which reportedly belonged to Alexander Hillel Treisman, was towed away, and was later searched. Inside the vehicle police found about ""$509,000 in U.S. currency (believed to be [Treisman's] inheritance), books (about survival, bomb making, improvised weapons and Islam), drawings of swastikas and planes crashing into buildings,"" and a Sig Sauer AR Rifle, a 9 mm Luger, a Kel-Tec Sub-2000, a .22-caliber rifle, and a Russian Mosin Nagant M91/30 bolt-action rifle, according to the search warrant application.

Later that day, Treisman arrived at the bank in a Honda Accord and asked about the towed van, according to court documents. Bank employees reportedly contacted police, and they took Treisman into custody.

Police searched Treisman's Honda Accord and discovered two more handguns, a .380-caliber, and a 9 mm Luger ""found concealed in a clothes hamper,"" court papers stated.

Treisman, originally from Seattle, was allegedly carrying multiple driver's licenses from three states: Washington, California, and Florida.

Treisman was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, according to officials say. Local police contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

A day after his arrest, the suspect reportedly called his mother, Kimberly Treisman. During the phone call, which was recorded, the mother suggested that he should ""jump bail,"" according to a report from CNBC.

Local police and investigators from the Joint Terrorism Task Force reportedly asked Treisman about the disturbing materials found in his van. During the interview, Treisman ""disclosed he has an interest in terrorist incidents and mass shootings,"" according to federal officials.

""Treisman conveyed to the interviewing officers that he had an interest in terrorist incidents and mass shootings, and that he watched YouTube videos and read Wikipedia articles about such incidents,"" the search warrant application states.

According to court documents, friends and family stopped speaking to him because of his ""remarks and jokes"" about mass shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks.

Treisman drove around the country, purchasing firearms in different states, authorities claim.

Law enforcement said they discovered an account on iFunny, a social media platform where users can post and comment on memes, alleged to belong to Treisman. The search-warrant application says Treisman posted a meme about killing Joe Biden.

On April 15, 2020, Treisman allegedly shared an image on iFunny with the caption, ""Should I kill joe biden?""

In a conversation with another user on iFunny, Treisman reportedly said he ""was going to do a columbine for a while."" The other user condemned him for wanting to ""harm the innocent.""

Treisman responded, ""My hatred is for the complacent American people who will turn u in for their own satisfaction. But aside from former goals, my eyes on the future. If anything I have to save bernie.""

Investigators concluded the ""bernie"" mentioned in the alleged threat was a reference to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who dropped out of the presidential race on April 8, which paved the way for Joe Biden to get the Democratic presidential nomination.

On May 3, financial transactions and cellphone records show Treisman was within four miles of Biden's home in Delaware.

Court documents said between March and May, Treisman made internet searches regarding ""information about Joe Biden's home address, state gun laws, rifle parts, and night vision goggles.""

Investigators determined Treisman's activity ""was consistent with a surveillance and attack plan connected to a possible threat against Joe Biden or other targeted act of violence,"" according to a search warrant.

The teenager allegedly wrote a note on his phone that outlined a plot for a mass shooting at a mall food court either on Christmas or Black Friday. The search warrant application states that he made a checklist that ended in ""execute.""

Treisman allegedly said he had not attempted to actually harm or murder anyone, telling authorities that his internet postings were ""all online threats were part of a persona.""

Investigators claim that they found a trove of ""sexually explicit videos and images of minors"" on Treisman's phone.

""Child pornography was found on eight of these devices (three laptops, three hard drives, an additional cellphone, and a flash drive),"" an Oct. 6 detention memo states. ""A total of 1,248 videos and 6,721 images of child pornography content were found on Defendant's devices, in addition to 637 videos and images of child pornography containing sadism and/or masochism content.""

Treisman reportedly had no prior criminal history before his arrest. The federal magistrate judge justified Treisman's detention without bail on child pornography charges because of the other evidence against him.

""No combination of available release conditions would reasonably assure the safety of the community, and that a preponderance of evidence establishes that no conditions would ensure Defendant's presence in court,"" the judge said.

Treisman was denied bail on Oct. 6 pending trial and is currently being held in Durham County, North Carolina.

Biden admin issues new guidelines on deportations and illegal alien advocates are outraged,"The Biden administration issued new guidance on deportation policy on Thursday and advocates for illegal aliens were outraged that it did not simply end all deportations.

Biden had promised that there would be no deportations under his administration for the first hundred days, but in January a federal judge in Texas blocked the action with a temporary restraining order.

The new guidelines sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement narrowed the scope of convictions that would allow for deportation based on a person being a public safety threat. They will be in place for 90 days while long-term guidelines are developed.

Deportations can also be implemented for persons considered a terrorism or espionage threat.

""By focusing our limited resources on cases that present threats to national security, border security, and public safety, our agency will more ably and effectively execute its law enforcement mission,"" said ICE Acting Director Tae Johnson.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) bristled at an additional provision that allowed for the deportation of anyone who entered into the United States illegally after Nov. 1.

""The memo is a disappointing step backward from the Biden administration's earlier commitments to fully break from the harmful deportation policies of both the Trump and Obama presidencies,"" said ACLU attorney Naureen Shah.

""While the Biden administration rightly acknowledges that immigrants are our family members, our coworkers, and our neighbors, for now it has chosen to continue giving ICE officers significant discretion to conduct operations that harm our communities and tear families apart,"" Shah added.

Biden has promised to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens, which could number from 11 million to 22 million by some estimates. His plan would also extend legal protections that were offered to recipients of DACA, called the ""Dream Act"" by some, under former President Barack Obama.

On Wednesday the Biden administration instructed Department of Homeland Security officials to stop using the phrase ""illegal aliens"" and refer to ""undocumented noncitizens,"" or ""undocumented individuals"" instead.

"President Biden's job approval plummets to lowest level since he took office, new poll finds","A new Quinnipiac poll found that President Joe Biden's job approval had tumbled among Americans to the lowest rate since taking office.

The poll says only 38% of Americans give the beleaguered president a positive job approval.

Slightly more than half of Americans, 53%, give Biden a negative job approval in the new poll. These represent the worst approval ratings for Biden from Quinnipiac since the beginning of his presidency.

Just three weeks ago, the same poll found that 42% of Americans said Biden was doing a good job, while 50% said he was doing a bad job. The drop from three weeks in his net approval rating went from -8 points to -15 percentage points.

The Biden administration has been pummeled by critics over the disastrous and humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan, the growing humanitarian crisis at the border, and continuing woes related to the economy.

Among Democrats, 80% said they approve of the job Biden is doing, while 60% of independents said they disapproved of the president.

Biden received the lowest approval rate when Americans were asked about the situation at the U.S.-Mexican border, with 67% in disapproval and only 23% approving. The president received the highest net rating in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but it was still slightly negative, with 48% approving and 50% in disapproval.

""Battered on trust, doubted on leadership, and challenged on overall competency, President Biden is being hammered on all sides as his approval rating continues its downward slide to a number not seen since the tough scrutiny of the Trump administration,"" said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy in comments accompanying the poll results.



The Biden administration is currently struggling to pass massive spending bills to mollify the progressive wing of the party.

John Kerry responds to allegation from leaked audio that he disclosed secret info of Israeli operations to the Iranians,"Former Secretary of State John Kerry denied allegations based on a leaked audio that he revealed secret information about Israeli attacks to the Iranians.

""I can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false. This never happened - either when I was Secretary of State or since,"" Kerry tweeted on Monday in response to the claims.



The allegation arose out of audio between Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and an economist made in March but leaked to the New York Times on Sunday.

""Former Secretary of State John Kerry informed him that Israel had attacked Iranian interests in Syria at least 200 times, to his astonishment, Mr. Zarif said,"" the Times reported.

Kerry was then-America's top diplomat during the Obama administration. Now, he serves in the Biden administration as the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.

Some responded to the leaked audio by calling for Kerry's resignation.

""This is something that deserves a Senate investigation. If it indeed is proven to be accurate, then John Kerry should seriously consider resignation,"" said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) to Fox News.

""This is disgusting on many levels,"" tweeted Nikki Haley. ""Biden and Kerry have to answer for why Kerry would be tipping off Iran, the number one sponsor of terror, while stabbing one of our greatest partners, Israel, in the back.""

Kerry linked to a Washington Post reporter who noted that a senior Israeli spokesperson had acknowledged in 2018 the nation's number of operations in Syria against Iranians and their allies.

""Only just now it was published - in the name of military sources, so I can quote it too - that in the last two years Israel has taken military action more than 200 times within Syria itself,"" said Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz during a speech at a conference.

""Understand the significance of this matter in terms of preserving the red line, preventing the things that Iran has done, is doing and is trying to do against Israel from Syria,"" he added, according to the report in Reuters.

When White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the leaked audio on Monday, she refused to offer a comment.

Joliet Pride invites children to bring dollar bills to 'tip the performers' at all-ages drag show in Illinois,"A PrideFest event in Joliet, Illinois, advertised for children to bring dollar bills to ""tip the performers"" at an all ages drag show.

A screenshot of the advertisement was posted to Twitter by the popular social media account Libs of TikTok. Followers of the account immediately responded with scorn for the event planned for September 17.

The group appeared to delete the post from Facebook and replace it with a different version that didn't include the text about bringing dollar bills.

Profits from the event are going to fund Joliet PrideFest's outreach efforts, including ""Joliet PrideFest free, the LGBTQ+ Youth Drop-in Center, Youth Queer Prom.""

In April, the group organized an LGBTQ prom for high schoolers and included a drag show at that event as well.

The EventBrite invitation for the event showed the ""Family Friendly Drag Show"" was still scheduled for 5 to 7:30 p.m. while the ""PrideFest AfterDark Leather and Lace"" show was scheduled to start only half an hour later.

The Libs of TikTok account has exposed countless inappropriate drag shows and other extreme posts by members of the far left on social media. As a result, the account has been targeted by the news media and big tech companies, but it has been able to keep its online presence.

On Monday, the account was able to shut down a drag show promoted as a ""Back to School"" event for children in the city of Pocatello in southeast Idaho. The Southeastern-Idaho Pride posted on its Facebook page that it cancelled the show for security reasons.

""The event as planned was a G rated theatrical review, by all 18+ performers,"" their post read. ""However, due to the misinterpretation of marketing materials, and to mitigate the harm to our LGBTQ+ community, we feel it is best to not proceed with this performance.""

Sen. Josh Hawley rips 'Antifa scumbags' who 'threatened' his home with only his wife and newborn daughter inside. The protesters called it a 'peaceful vigil.',"A group of leftist protesters showed up at Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's Washington, D.C.-area home Monday night while only his wife and newborn daughter were there, shouting through bullhorns and allegedly banging on the door in protest of his recent decision to challenge the presidential election results.

Hawley, who was away from his family and back in Missouri at the time, has drawn harsh criticism since becoming the first senator to announce plans to object to the Electoral College certification when electors meet on Jan. 6.

As any young father feeling helpless to defend his family would be, he was incensed over the incident and denounced the ""Antifa scumbags"" on Twitter late Monday night for causing his family to feel threatened.

""They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door,"" he said. ""Let me be clear: My family & I will not be intimidated by leftwing violence.""

At least one of Hawley's neighbors shared the sentiment, as video shows him approaching the group and demanding to know why they were ""disturbing our neighborhood and scaring our children.""

A peaceful vigil?

However, in conversation with the Washington Post, the group, known as ShutDownDC, characterized their demonstration much differently.

It was nothing more than a ""peaceful vigil,"" the activists argued in a Post write-up that described the night's activities like this: ""On the sidewalk in a Northern Virginia suburb, a group of 15 people chanted while holding candles and signs saying, 'Protect democracy.'""

""This was not threatening behavior,"" one ShutDownDC organizer, Patrick Young, told the Post. ""This is people engaging in democracy and engaging in civil discourse ... This was a pretty tame and peaceful visit to his house.""

A 50-minute long video of the events posted on YouTube by the group titled, ""Vigil For Democracy,"" shows protesters loudly shouting and chanting outside Hawley's home and at least one point approaching the door to leave a copy of the U.S. Constitution.

Vigil For Democracy youtu.be

Video shows Virginia police present at the scene, but it was not immediately clear if any action was taken against the protesters except that one officer asked them to quiet down until her supervisor arrived.

Hawley responds

Later, in response to the group's press release on the demonstration, Hawley tweeted, ""Now 'vigil' means screaming threats through bullhorns, vandalizing property, pounding on the doors of homes and terrorizing innocent people and children.""

Then on Tuesday morning, after the Post article was published, Hawley hit the group again on Twitter, slamming their ""outright lies.""

The Antifa group ""now describe themselves as sweet angels,"" he said. ""BS. You screamed through bullhorns, shouted down my wife when she asked you to leave, vandalized property, pounded on our door, and terrorized neighbors.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/josh-hawley-antifa-protesters,2021-01-05
Journalist 'covering government wrongdoing' has not been seen publicly since FBI raided his home 6 months ago,"On April 27 of this year, the FBI reportedly conducted a flash raid on an apartment that investigative journalist and producer James Gordon Meek had rented for 10 years. The raid lasted approximately 10 minutes, and Meek has not been seen publicly since.

After that morning, Meek, 52, apparently vacated the apartment, resigned from his job at ABC, and withdrew from a book project about the withdrawal from Afghanistan, a project which he had previously promoted on social media, according to Rolling Stone, which first broke this story.

""They didn’t stick around,"" Meek's neighbor John Antonelli recalled about the federal agents that day. ""They took off pretty quickly and headed west on Columbia Pike towards Fairfax County.""

An unnamed gas station attendant who works across the street from Meek's apartment building likewise recalled the April raid: ""I remember coming to work that morning and seeing a lot of police cars out there. Nobody said anything. I didn’t know what was going on.""

Though a search warrant for the raid has not been released, a magistrate from the Eastern District Court of Virginia reportedly signed it the night before. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco also likely authorized the raid, Rolling Stone claimed, since Attorney General Merrick Garland established a new policy requiring the deputy AG to sign off on any seizure of materials belonging to a journalist.

The FBI has not exactly confirmed the raid on Meek. However, it did state that agents had conducted ""court-authorized law-enforcement activity"" somewhere on the block where Meek's apartment is located and on the day in question. It declined to comment further, citing ""an ongoing investigation.""

The exact nature of the investigation remains a mystery. Rolling Stone reported that ""sources familiar with the matter"" claimed that agents had discovered classified material on Meek's laptop.

Meek's attorney Eugene Gorokhov responded to the allegations in a written statement:

""Mr. Meek is unaware of what allegations anonymous sources are making about his possession of classified documents,"" Gorokhov wrote. ""If such documents exist, as claimed, this would be within the scope of his long career as an investigative journalist covering government wrongdoing.

""The allegations in your inquiry are troubling for a different reason: they appear to come from a source inside the government,"" the statement continued. ""It is highly inappropriate, and illegal, for individuals in the government to leak information about an ongoing investigation.""

Meeks has not been charged with any crime.

ABC News claimed that after April 27, Meek ""resigned very abruptly"" from the position he had held for nine years. His social media accounts have not been active since that morning. Neither his former colleagues nor his neighbors have heard from him since the raid, and his family has not responded to requests for comment.

Meeks spent most of his career covering issues related to national security and terrorism. He notably exposed a possible Pentagon cover-up regarding the deaths of four Green Berets in Niger in 2017 and produced a Hulu documentary entitled ""3212 Un-Redacted"" about the topic. The documentary was released to great fanfare late last year, and many speculated that it would earn an Emmy. However, promotion of the documentary stalled after Meek disappeared, and ""3212"" eventually failed to earn a nomination.

Brian Epstein, who directed and co-produced ""3212,"" also suddenly dropped out of its promotions, though Rolling Stone has had contact with Epstein.

Meek also abandoned ""Operation Pineapple Express: The Incredible Story of a Group of Americans Who Undertook One Last Mission and Honored a Promise in Afghanistan,"" a book he had been writing along with Lt. Col. Scott Mann, a retired Green Beret. After the raid, Meek dropped out of the project, and Simon & Schuster erased his name from the book and all its promotional materials. It was released in August with Mann listed as its sole author.

""[Meek] contacted me in the spring, and was really distraught, and told me that he had some serious personal issues going on and that he needed to withdraw from the project,"" Mann said. ""As a guy who’s a combat veteran who has seen that kind of strain — I don’t know what it was — I honored it. And he went on his way, and I continued on the project.""

"Journalist Glenn Greenwald reveals horrifying home invasion story in which he was bound, tortured, and held at gunpoint by 5 suspects","Journalist Glenn Greenwald says that no less than five men robbed him at gunpoint during a home invasion in March.

What are the details?

In a lengthy essay, Greenwald revealed that he was alone at a Rio de Janeiro-area farm he and his family were renting when the harrowing incident took place.

Greenwald, who is married to Brazilian politician David Michael Miranda, said that his husband and their two children were not at the farm when the purported robbery took place.

""I've begun my day for the last five months by feeding the chickens, rabbits, ducks, swans and peacocks that are there: a perfect way to connect to farming life,"" he wrote. ""My husband and our two children had spent the week in Rio because the kids had school entrance exams that required a faster internet connection than is available at the farm. Because March 5 was the day before my birthday, they had all planned to come to the farm that day, but decided at the last second that they would come early the next morning instead.""



That evening, he recalled, he was at the farm with an off-duty police officer working security for Greenwald and his family.

""At roughly 9:30 p.m. that night, I was speaking with a friend on the telephone when I noticed that our dogs — twelve of whom were at the farm, with the rest at home — were barking incessantly and intensely for a sustained period of time, which is unusual,"" he continued. ""I ended the call to see why they were so agitated and walked out of the house toward the gate where I heard them.""

Greenwald explained that within seconds, three suspects wearing black masks and pointing guns swarmed him.

""They told me to walk toward a small stand-alone room near the house and began pushing me to go faster,"" he explained. ""Soon as I entered, I saw that two other armed men had detained the security guard, the off-duty cop, and had him laying face-down on the floor as they stood over him with guns pointed at his head.""



Greenwald said he first suspected he was victim of a targeted political attack due to threats he said he'd been receiving.

""I was relieved, to the extent one can be in such a situation, when they began demanding money,"" he said. ""Because most of what we have has remained in our home, I did not have much of value there: a couple hundred dollars, some kitchen appliances, and clothes for ourselves and our kids. They did not believe that, which drove them to a considerable amount of anger.""

It got worse from there.

'Psychological terror'

Keeping him tied up for at least an hour, the suspects reportedly grilled him over whether there were more valuables at the farm.

""Driven by the belief that I was hiding valuables — refusing to believe my assurances that I would not do that with five men pointing guns at me — they attempted various forms of psychological terror,"" Greenwald recalled. ""They repeatedly threatened to shoot the police officer in the head, repeatedly kicked him so hard that they cracked several of his ribs, ordered me to open my mouth and stuck a gun in it as they demanded to know where the rest of the money was, smashed my phone and tablet against a wall when they could not figure out how to erase the hard-drive, and just generally tried to create a climate of extreme fear. Most of the hour was spent with them ransacking every part of the farm, including our kids' rooms.""



Greenwald said that when they were satisfied that there were no more valuables with which to abscond, they demanded his car keys.

""They then ordered both of us to go to a separate small house near the back of the farm,"" he wrote. ""They put us in a room, used cords to tie our arms behind our backs and bound our legs together, then locked the door. Once we heard the car leave, we worked on freeing ourselves, which took roughly fifteen minutes, and then used the computer they had idiotically left to call my husband and the other police officers who work with us at the farm.""



Greenwald said that police were able to quickly identify the suspects after they made several missteps, including using a car registered to his husband, a member of Congress, and more.

""Between the five of them, they stole ... no more than two thousand dollars worth of value: a small amount of cash, a microwave, kitchen appliances and even food such as large packs of rice and beans,"" he wrote. ""The most valuable item they took was the police officer's gun.""



It took three weeks for the officer — who is now on psychiatric leave from the force — to recover physically from the attack.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/journalist-reveals-horrifying-home-invasion-story-in-which-was-bound-and-held-at-gunpoint,2021-04-05
Joy Behar implies unvaccinated COVID patients don't deserve medical help since they've 'chosen to listen to the lies' on Fox News,"Far-left co-host of ""The View"" Joy Behar on Wednesday's show implied that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients don't deserve medical help because they've ""chosen to defy the science"" and have ""chosen to listen to the lies on Fox [News]"" — all while patients with other needs can't get hospital beds.

What are the details?

Former Utah Congresswoman Mia Love — a Republican — sat at ""The View"" table in former co-host Meghan McCain's seat and argued that it's a ""slippery slope"" for doctors to say they won't treat unvaccinated patients as that decision could lead to them saying they won't treat people for other illnesses.

Behar then stepped in, at first agreeing with Love that doctors denying health care to smokers and the morbidly obese could be problematic — but then she declared that such patients have developed ""long-term"" habits compared to the one-time decision by unvaccinated people to not get a COVID-19 shot ""based on false information.""

She added — as if she were speaking to unvaccinated COVID-19 patients — they should ""go to [Fox News host] Tucker Carlson and make your case. Because he's telling you lies. He and other people on Fox and on some parts of Facebook are telling you lies about the vaccine.""

Behar also said, ""I have people in my family who say, 'I wanna get pregnant, and the vaccine could hurt my fertility.' No! There is no evidence of this. They are hearing things all over the place that are false. So now you have cancer, or you have to get a stent or what have you, and you are not able to get a bed because someone has chosen to defy the science. Someone has chosen to listen to the lies on Fox and on other places.""

Here's the clip:

Anything else?

Behar was on a roll, as on Tuesday's program she made reference to the United States needing to ""worry about the Taliban in America"" while ripping Texas' new law banning abortion at six weeks of pregnancy.

Also on Tuesday she praised President Joe Biden's disastrous Afghanistan pullout: ""I believe that in six months, people will say about this war that Biden got us out of the longest war that Americans ever had. No other president can say that. I think the man deserves a lot of credit for that and Americans will back him up in six months to a year.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-behar-unvaccinated-do-not-deserve-medical-help,2021-09-08
Juan Williams claims defending parents' rights is racist dog whistle: 'Code for white race politics',"Fox News political analyst Juan Williams claimed in a new essay that defending parents' rights is meant to sow racial division while masquerading ""as a defense of little children.""

What did Williams say?

Parents' rights have become a prominent issue in recent months as parents nationwide dispute a number of issues impacting schools, including COVID-related restrictions, radical LGBT policies, and certain teachings on race.

But according to Williams, defending parents' rights — which became a prominent issue in the Virginia gubernatorial race — is a racist dog whistle, or as the headline of his recent essay at The Hill claims, ""code for white race politics.""

""It is a campaign to stop classroom discussion of Black Lives Matter protests or slavery because it could upset some children, especially white children who might feel guilt,"" Williams wrote.



By making parents' rights a prominent issues, Williams charged that ""Trump-imitating Republican"" have struck ""political gold.""

Without evidence, Williams directly connected concerns over parents' rights to defending Confederate monuments, the 2017 Charlottesville riots, the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and segregation.

""There is a long history behind the latest racist political appeals. It is not long ago that racist southern politicians rallied against integration with an argument for 'states' rights,' a call to be free of federal laws seeking to end segregation,"" Williams wrote. ""Now the message is that white parents are being ignored when they complain that their children are uncomfortable learning about racism.""

Williams even expressed support for the letter the National School Boards Association sent President Joe Biden, demanding federal intervention over angry parents confronting school boards. The NSBA has since apologized for the letter.

Anything else?

Williams' essay reads like Democrat Terry McAuliffe's talking points.

In the closing weeks of the Virginia gubernatorial race, McAuliffe's two biggest attacks on his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, focused on Youngkin's position on parents' rights and former President Donald Trump. Although Trump has not played a role in the election, McAuliffe has continually tried to tie Youngkin to Trump.

In the end, Williams claimed the fight to defend parents' rights has nothing to do with parents' rights, but everything to do with ""stirring up racial division.""

Judge indefinitely ​blocks Biden deportation ban,"President Joe Biden's plan to impose a 100-day ban on deportations of illegal immigrants was interrupted again Tuesday after a district judge extended an injunction against the ban indefinitely.

In response to a lawsuit from the state of Texas, U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton blocked enforcement of the Biden administration's Jan. 20 executive memorandum banning most deportations, Fox News reports.

Previously, Judge Tipton enacted a two-week restraining order against Biden's deportation moratorium after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued in court to stop the ban. The state of Texas argues Biden's executive action ""violates the U.S. Constitution, federal immigration and administrative law, and a contractual agreement between Texas"" and the Department of Homeland Security. On Feb. 9, Tipton extended his injunction against the ban for two more weeks before extending it again yesterday.

Biden's deportation ban was among his first acts as president, fulfilling a campaign promise to reverse President Donald Trump's immigration policies. Biden ordered Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to cease deporting some illegal immigrants for a period of 100 days. Biden's order instructed these agencies within the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a ""review and reset"" of the the previous administration's policies.

There were some exceptions to the deportation ban. Illegal aliens found by ICE to have engaged in terrorism or espionage against the United States or who threaten national security may still be deported. Aliens who were not present in the U.S. before Nov. 1, 2020, individuals who waived their right to remain in the U.S., and others as determined by the director of ICE are exempt from the deportation moratorium.

Paxton sued to stop Biden's order immediately after it was enacted, claiming it violated the Constitution and a contractual agreement between Texas and the Trump administration that requires the Department of Homeland Security to give Texas 180 days' notice of any proposed policy changes that would reduce immigration enforcement or pause deportations.

In granting a preliminary injunction against Biden's moratorium, Tipton sided with Texas' argument.

""This preliminary injunction is granted on a nationwide basis and prohibits enforcement and implementation of the [100-day pause] in every place Defendants have jurisdiction to enforce and implement the January 20 Memorandum,"" he wrote in a 105-page ruling.

""The core failure of DHS lies not in the brevity of the January 20 Memorandum or the corresponding administrative record, but instead in its omission of a rational explanation grounded in the facts reviewed and the factors considered,"" Tipton wrote. ""This failure is fatal, as this defect essentially makes DHS's determination to institute a 100-day pause on deportations an arbitrary and capricious choice.""

The ruling does not cancel the entirety of Biden's executive action. The DHS is still required to conduct a review of its immigration enforcement policies and guidelines and report to the president.

Last week, ICE announced interim guidelines for immigration enforcement and deportations, shifting prioritization of law enforcement and deportations to threats to national security, border security, and public safety. This is a softening of enforcement policy from the Trump administration, which sought to enforce immigration law against every alien present in the U.S. illegally.

""By focusing our limited resources on cases that present threats to national security, border security, and public safety, our agency will more ably and effectively execute its law enforcement mission,"" said ICE Acting Director Tae Johnson. ""Like every law enforcement agency at the local, state and federal level, we must prioritize our efforts to achieve the greatest security and safety impact. Further, by implementing a system for obtaining prior approval before pursuing certain cases, and through regular reporting of civil immigration enforcement actions, we will better coordinate our efforts, achieve consistency in our operations, and inform the development of the Secretary's new enforcement guidelines. We look forward to working closely with the Secretary throughout this process.""

These interim guidelines will be in effect until Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas issues new enforcement guidelines for the department.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-indefinitely-blocks-biden-deportation-ban,2021-02-24
Judge orders man who defaced LGBT mural to write 25-page essay on Pulse mass killing that FBI said was terrorism,"A Florida judge handed down a bizarre punishment last week to 20-year-old man who admitted to vandalizing an LGBT mural.

What is the background?

Last June, Alexander Jerich was slapped with a felony charge last summer after he defaced an LGBT mural — rainbow colors painted inside a Delray Beach intersection — by doing a burnout with his truck. His tires left a 15-foot skid mark on the painted asphalt.

In March, Jerich pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and reckless driving.

What happened now?

Last Thursday, Judge Scott Suskauer of the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida ordered Jerich to write a 25-page essay ahead of his sentencing hearing on June 8.

The topic? The 2016 mass killing at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando.

According to the Palm Beach Post, Suskauer believes Jerich has ""little understanding of the meaning of the rainbow-colored gay pride mural he defaced or the struggles of the LGBTQ community."" Suskauer thus ordered Jerich to write not only about the tragedy itself, but the 49 victims, their families, and why such mass killings happen.

""I want your own brief summary of why people are so hateful and why people lash out against the gay community,"" the judge reportedly told Jerich.

The assignment, while unorthodox in criminal proceedings, is particularly bizarre because the Pulse nightclub killer was not motivated by LGBT hate. In fact, the FBI declared terrorism as the official motive for the heinous crime because the killer declared allegiance to ISIS.

What about sentencing?

Prosecutors are pushing for Jerich to be sentenced to jail for 30 days. The founder and president of the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council, meanwhile, wants a one-year jail sentence, according to the Palm Beach Post.



At the hearing last week, Suskauer said he expected Jerich to be a ""thug"" or ""redneck"" or ""someone who displays complete disrespect for their fellow citizens,"" but Jerich's remorse apparently has the judge feeling merciful.

According to the Post, Suskauer said he did not want Jerich to go to jail for a year, nor does he want the felony criminal mischief charge to stand because he does not want ""to do that to a young man who has his whole life ahead of him.""

Instead, while Suskauer may consider some jail time, he indicated that he wants Jerich to perform community service for an LGBT organization. He may even order Jerich to return to the mural that he defaced each week to ensure that it is clean.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-orders-defendant-lgbt-essay,2022-04-29
"Justice High School graduates warned of world full of 'racism,' 'white supremacy' — and hear Pledge with phrase 'one nation under Allah'","It was a high school graduation ceremony as rife with woke ideology as you can imagine — but then again, with a moniker like Justice High School, what else could one expect?

What are the details?

By way of introduction, Justice High School — which is part of the Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia — was known as J.E.B. Stuart High School until July 2018 when the powers that be decided on a name change in order to ""represent a fundamental American value but also specifically in honor of three outstanding individuals identified by our community for their roles in championing equal rights, inclusivity, and justice for all: Barbara Rose Johns, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Col. Louis G. Mendez Jr.""

The school is dominated by students of color; only about 20% are white, according to the latest demographics. And it's an ""international student body"" with ""over 50 different languages ... from more than 70 countries.""

And last Monday, more than 500 graduates gathered with their caps and gowns — and folks got a taste of what the school apparently is all about.

For starters, about 25 minutes into the ceremony, the class president recited the Pledge of Allegiance — which she called ""the nation's anthem"" — and used the phrase ""one nation under Allah,"" which caused a bit of a stir in the aftermath.

Then came a strident keynote address from Abrar Omeish — the lone Muslim member of the Fairfax County School Board — who told graduates they're entering a world full of ""racism, extreme versions of individualism and capitalism, [and] white supremacy."" Her speech begins just before the ceremony's one-hour mark.

At one point — speaking to students apparently in Arabic — Omeish uttered the word ""jihad"" after she had urged them in English to ""be reminded of the details of your struggle."" In Arabic, ""jihad"" means ""struggle"" but also has been tied closely to radical Islam.

But mostly she urged students to live up to their legacies as ""the justice class of 2021"" since they were ""made for something different"" and ""something bigger"" — in other words, to cause ""good trouble"" as they live as woke activists.

""Social justice is only political for those who can afford to ignore it,"" Omeish added to the students, emphasizing that ""'neutral' is another word for 'complicit.'""

Eye-opening background

The Daily Wire reported that the student government president introduced Omeish by highlighting that she was ""Virginia co-chair for the Bernie Sanders campaign"" and that her father, Esam Omeish, was a ""leader and a board member of the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center"" who ""raised his daughter to be an outspoken woman."" Omeish noted that her dad was in the crowd, the outlet said.

The outlet added that two 9/11 hijackers and the 2009 Fort Hood killer attended the Dar al-Hijrah mosque — and that its American-born imam was Anwar al-Awlaki, an American who was killed under former President Barack Obama for his connection to terrorism.

More from the Daily Wire:

In her introduction, the student leader said Omeish faced ""hatred for speaking truth to power about the Palestinian experience"" but ""continues to overcome and be an example so that young leaders like us will do the same.""



The introduction from a student also stated that ""two years ago [Omeish's] civil rights were violated by the police due to her appearance: she was attacked and discriminated against."" That entire incident is on video, which shows that an officer pulled over her car after watching her run a red light from a distance, from which her appearance was not visible. She repeatedly refused to show her license and then refused to get out of the car, leading to her arrest.

Here's a snippet of Omeish's nearly 30-minute speech:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/justice-high-school-graduates-racism-white-supremacy,2021-06-14
Justin Trudeau — after grisly murders in French church amid Muslim anger at Muhammad cartoons — says free speech 'is not without limits',"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reacted to the grisly murders in a French church amid worldwide Muslim anger over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad by saying that free speech ""is not without limits,"" the Guardian reported.

What are the details?

Muslims have been furious at the French government for refusing to take action against its citizens for public displays of Muhammad, which have been in solidarity with free expression after a French schoolteacher was beheaded by a Chechen refugee on Oct. 16, apparently over the teacher showing Muhammad cartoons to his class.

Effigies of French President Emmanuel Macron were burned over his defense of the right to publish such caricatures, the Guardian reported, adding that Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said ""we are in a war against an enemy that is both inside and outside.""

Thursday's deadly terrorist attack took place inside the Notre-Dame Basilica in Nice, the paper said, adding that the three people who died were a 60-year-old woman who was almost decapitated, 55-year-old Vincent Loques — the church sexton — and a 44-year-old Brazilian-born mother of three.

Officers described the scene as a ""vision of horror,"" the Guardian reported, adding that Nice's police chief, Richard Gianotti, said officers shot a man ""who was holding a knife"" and ""had just killed three people"" and was ""was shouting 'Allahu Akbar.'"" The suspected attacker, 21-year-old Brahim Aouissaoui from Tunisia, was in serious condition in a local hospital, the paper noted.

""Any symbol of the republic or Christianity is a potential target,"" Gianotti also said, according to the Guardian. ""We have to be vigilant, we have to be attentive.""

Nice attack: knife attacker kills three people at church in France youtu.be

Big contrast



Trudeau, however, worded his reaction to the killings with more — er — nuance.

""We will always defend freedom of expression,"" Trudeau said Friday, the paper reported, adding that the the far-left politician tempered that sentiment by saying that ""freedom of expression is not without limits. We owe it to ourselves to act with respect for others and to seek not to arbitrarily or unnecessarily injure those with whom we are sharing a society and a planet.""

According to the Post Millennial, Trudeau also seemed to compare the showing of Muhammad images to yelling ""fire"" in a crowded theater — and emphasized that ""in a pluralistic, diverse and respectful society like ours, we must be aware of the impact of our words, of our actions on others, particularly these communities and populations who still experience enormous discrimination.""

"Despite 2 million illegal immigrants stealing into US under her watch, Vice President Kamala Harris claims, 'We have a secure border'","In an NBC ""Meet the Press"" segment filmed in Texas, which aired on September 11, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed border security with host Chuck Todd. Citing the record-breaking number of illegal aliens who have stolen across the southern border into the U.S. over the past year, Todd asked Harris, ""Would you call the border secure?""

Harris first responded by suggesting what needs to be done is ""pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship."" She then answered Todd's question with a caveat: ""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system.""

So far in 2022, there have been over 1,946,780 encounters with illegal aliens at the southern border, surpassing last year's totals, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection had 1,734,686 such encounters. Over 69% of these illegal aliens are single adults. As a point of comparison, in former President Trump's final year in office, there were 458,088 encounters at the southern border.

Todd pressed Harris on whether she was indeed confident in the border's security.

Harris responded: ""We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration.""

She reiterated her earlier claim that it is a priority of the Biden administration to ""put into place a law and a plan for a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people who are here and are prepared to do what is legally required to gain citizenship.""

The amnesty push

Democrats have long sought to confer amnesty and ultimately citizenship on millions of illegal aliens.

Then-candidate Joe Biden indicated during his 2020 campaign that he would seek to work with Congress on ""providing a road map for citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants.""

Upon taking power, the Biden administration introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would have set illegal aliens up for citizenship and provided green cards to others present in the U.S. illegally. Since Republicans would not support such a measure, the bill died.

Democrat lawmakers tried to get amnesty provisions into the Build Back Better Act, which would have provided amnesty to at least 7 million illegal aliens and work authorizations to many more. The bill passed the House but was not taken up by the Senate.

Is the border really ""secure""?

In response to Harris' remarks on ""Meet the Press,"" Rep. Mayra Flores (R-Texas) told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Harris ""has done nothing for us in South Texas to secure the borders. She's useless.""



Arizona Governor Doug Ducey (R) tweeted on Sunday that ""VP Harris and President Biden are clueless when it comes to border security. Let's call this for what it is: an Open Border Policy.""

In another tweet, Ducey wrote: ""Border security is clearly NOT a priority for the Biden Administration. They have NO IDEA what's happening at their nation's southern border.""

Referencing the recent revelation that over 66 suspects on a U.S. terror watch list had been caught illegally crossing the border, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) wrote: ""How many got away undetected? Border security is national security. Under the Biden administration, we have neither.""

In August, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) suggested that ""The Biden Regime has facilitated an invasion of our sovereign borders of more than 4.2 million illegal aliens since January 2021.""

According to Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, the perception that illegal aliens are permitted into the U.S. under the Biden administration's policies has spurred more criminal traffic across the border. ""In my experience, we have seen increases [in illegal immigration] when there are no consequences.""

Harris' past remarks regarding border security



Harris stated on ABC's ""The View"" in 2019 that illegal aliens should not be treated as criminals. ""It should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal one,"" she said. ""We can't treat people like criminals when they are crossing the border.""



In her 2019 book ""The Truths We Hold,"" Harris noted that ""a wall on the border with Mexico was a total waste of taxpayer money.""

She explained to NPR that she ""would not enforce a law that would reject people and turn them away without giving them a fair and due process to determine if we should give them asylum and refuge.""

When Trump suggested he would send the U.S. military to secure the southern border until the border wall was completed, Harris claimed that doing so was about ""vilifying people"" and that there were more pressing issues such as ""climate change, because guess what, guy, it's real and it's a crisis.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-claims-border-is-secure,2022-09-12
"Kamala Harris compares Jan 6 Capitol riot to Pearl Harbor, 9/11","On the first anniversary of the riot at the U.S. Capitol building, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech comparing the events of Jan. 6 to the bombing of Pearl Harbor that catapulted the United States into World War II and the world-altering terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001.

""Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were, and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,"" Harris began her address at Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday morning.



Harris then recalled dark dates in American history, ""Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory: Dec. 7, 1941, Sept. 11, 2001, and Jan. 6, 2021.""

Harris said the for ""extremists who roamed these halls,"" what they were out to ""degrade and destroy was not only a building"" but they were also assaulting ""the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.""

Harris claimed that the riot exposed ""the fragility of democracy"" in the United States because of ""the very fact of how close we came to an election overturned.""



""The fragility of our democracy is this: If we are not vigilant, if we do not defend it, democracy simply will not stand. It will falter, and it will fail,"" Harris said.

""On January 6th, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful,"" she continued. ""The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos. What was at stake then, and now, is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it: by we, the people — all the people.""

Harris applauded her fellow politicians for certifying the presidential election the night of ""the violent assault"" that interrupted Congress.

""Yet, the resolve I saw in our elected leaders when I returned to the Senate chamber that night — their resolve not to yield, but to certify the election, their loyalty, not to party or person, but to the Constitution of the United States — that reflects its strength,"" she said.

Numerous online commentators found the comparison of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot to the deadly attacks on Pearl Harbor and on Sept. 11 to be completely outrageous and downright offensive.

Director of communications for Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) Harrison Fields: ""As the son of a 9/11 first responder & survivor, & as someone who experienced the tragedy of 1/06, I can tell you unequivocally—1/06 was NOT & will NEVER be comparable to 9/11. To hear the @VP compare the 6th to 9/11 is a slap in the face to 9/11 survivors & heroes like my mom.""

Writer Josh Jordan: ""Putting January 6th in the same category of Pearl Harbor and 9/11 is ridiculous. What happened a year ago was terrible, but let's not compare it to two events that killed thousands of Americans and led to wars around the world.""

Author Matthew Betley: ""I don’t take anything the stupendously incompetent @VP says, but comparing January 6 to Pearl Harbor is as outrageous and offensive as it gets, especially to World War II veterans who know what a real attack looks like. Shame on #KamalaHarris.""

Outkick founder Clay Travis: ""Kamala Harris said January 6th is the equivalent of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Honest question, does anyone actually believe this, even the most idoitic left winger on the planet? This is one of the dumbest historical analogies I have ever seen.""

Digital strategist Greg Price: ""When a two-hour riot happened at the Capitol, Kamala Harris compared it to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. When neighborhoods in Minneapolis were burned to the ground, Kamala Harris helped raise bail money for the people who did it.""

Conservative commentator John Cardillo: ""9/11: 2977 innocents dead Pearl Harbor: 2403 Americans dead Jan 6th: One death. Unarmed Ashli Babbitt killed by an inept Capitol cop, @KamalaHarris’s comparison is disgraceful and insults the memories of those we lost.""



The Pearl Harbor attack took place when a Japanese strike force consisting of more than 420 aircraft launched a surprise offensive on the U.S. military stationed at the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii. Within an hour and 15 minutes, 2,403 U.S. military personnel were killed in the attack and another 1,178 were wounded. Six U.S. ships were sunk or destroyed, plus another 16 damaged. There were 169 U.S. Navy and Army Air Corps planes that were obliterated and another 159 damaged.

The death toll of the 9/11 attacks is 2,974 people – the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in U.S. history. Since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, 7,052 U.S. military members and 8,189 U.S. contractors were ""killed directly in the violence of the U.S. post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere,"" according to a study by Brown University’s Costs of War project and the Center for International Policy. The Pentagon has spent $14 trillion since 9/11. The World Trade Center Health Program – a federal health program administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that provides medical monitoring and treatment of World Trade Center-related health conditions for 9/11 responders and survivors – found that 25% of 9/11 first responders ages 55-64 have at least one kind of cancer and 33% of the same age bracket of 9/11 first responders suffer from aerodigestive illness (conditions or diseases that affect the airways and upper digestive tract).

White House press secretary Jen Psaki went into damage control when asked about the vice president's controversial comparison.

""If we look back to some very difficult moments of our history, back in 1861, there were no Confederate flags being waved in the Capitol,"" Psaki said during Thursday's press conference. ""In very dark moments in our history, there were not people storming our nation's Capitol trying to take over the office and even threaten the speaker of the House.""

Psaki then advised that anyone criticizing Kamala Harris for making comparisons to major historical events stop making comparisons to major historical events, despite attempting to defend the vice president for doing just that.

""Instead of focusing on or analyzing comparisons of moments in history, I would suggest they be a part of solving the threats of democracy that occurs today,"" Psaki said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-jan6-911-pearl-harbor,2022-01-06
VP Kamala Harris cancels rally to help Gov. Newsom against recall effort after terror bombings in Afghanistan,"Vice President Kamala Harris canceled a planned rally to help California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) fight a recall effort after the deadly terror bombings in Afghanistan.

The terrorist suicide bombings killed 13 U.S. service members and many more Afghan lives on Thursday. The attack came after U.S. officials warned of terror threats and told Americans to leave the airport.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for Harris said the vice president would be returning to Washington, D.C., after visiting the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii instead of heading to California for the rally.

Harris had planned to join Newsom at the Cow Palace event center outside San Francisco for a ""drive-in"" campaign event.

Newsom is battling to keep his office after new polls show that a recall effort could pick up the 50% of votes needed to oust him on Sept. 14, the day of the special election.

Among the leading candidates to replace Newsom is popular talk radio show host Larry Elder, an outspoken conservative. Newsom has warned supporters that Elder is only 2 percentage points away from becoming the state's next governor.

Democrats have sounded the alarm about the recall election after finding that Latinos in California are among those who have turned against Newsom. One Democratic strategist was lambasted online after saying that ""Latinx"" people don't seem to have a clue that there is an effort underway to toss Newsom out of the governor's office.

Harris has been criticized for her silence about the overseas disaster since initially defending Biden's plan for withdrawal. When Harris was pressed about the issue at a media briefing in Singapore, she said there would be time later to analyze the events.

""I think there's gonna be plenty of time to analyze what has happened and what has taken place in the context of the withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" replied Harris, ""but right now we are singularly focused on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and Afghans who are vulnerable, including women and children.""

"They ripped Tim Scott, but liberals are predictably silent after Kamala Harris agrees America is not a 'racist country'","Liberal critics were predictably silent on social media in response to Vice President Kamala Harris' suggestion that America is not ""racist"" Thursday morning, despite ripping Republican Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) for making the same claim only hours before.

What's the background?

Progressive commentators on Twitter — as if trying to prove racism still exists — launched a racially charged offensive against the Republican lawmaker Wednesday night after he declared ""America is not a racist country"" while responding to President Joe Biden's address to a joint session of Congress

The critics referred to ""Uncle Tim"" so many times that it started trending on Twitter, prompting the social media company to have to block the trend.

In response, Scott called the attacks against him ""upsetting"" and ""so disappointing"" during a Thursday morning appearance on Fox News, adding that leftists ""are literally attacking the color of my skin.""

""The left has doubled down,"" he said. ""You cannot step down out of your lane, according to the liberal elite left.""

""What they want for us is for us to stay in a small corner and not go against the tide that they think is America,"" he continued. ""Their America and my America are not the same if they think that discriminating is the fastest way to end discrimination.""

Then what happened?

Amazingly, also on Thursday morning, the vice president agreed with Scott's assessment that America is not a racist country, though the response to Harris' statement has drawn comparatively little outrage.

""First of all, no, I don't think America is a racist country,"" Harris said during an appearance on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

""But we also do have to speak truth about the history of racism in our country and its existence today,"" she quickly added. ""It does not help to heal our country, to unify us as a people, to ignore the realities of that.""

""We want to unify the country, but not without speaking truth and requiring accountability, as appropriate,"" she continued.

As of Thursday afternoon, no hateful, racist trends against the vice president had emerged on social media.

Anything else?

During the interview, Harris said she applauds President Joe Biden for ""always having the ability and the courage, frankly, to speak the truth"" about racism in the country.

She added, in accord with Biden, that domestic terrorism manifested as white supremacy is ""one of the greatest threats to our national security.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-tim-scott-america-not-racist,2021-04-29
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Crack down on conservative celebrities' speech — and even left-wing luminaries who aren't woke enough,"NBA legend-turned-cultural commentator Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said social media companies aren't doing enough to silence ""irrational and harmful"" posts from conservative celebrities — and even from fellow left-wing luminaries who don't check every woke box.

What are the details?

In his column for the Hollywood Reporter this week, Abdul-Jabbar said that ""no matter their previous achievements, celebrities deserve legacy-killing backlash when they spread ignorance.""

He first pointed his finger at Rudy Giuliani — the personal lawyer of President Donald Trump — saying that his legacy of ""calm authority"" in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York City has been overshadowed by his Trump alliance and last month's ""cringeworthy news conference about unproven conspiracies while black streaks streamed from his hair."" Abdul-Jabbar also ripped Giuliani for being on a ""hidden camera in the latest Borat movie with his hand down his pants while lying on a bed in the presence of a teenage girl."" (Giuliani insists he was tucking in his shirt.)

Problem for Abdul-Jabbar is that the female in question is a woman, and Giuliani said ""at no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate. If Sacha Baron Cohen implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar.""

Abdul-Jabbar then turned his attention to conservative actors, saying ""Roseanne Barr had achieved the near impossible, sabotaging her career not once but twice. After she left her top-rated sitcom, she faded into irrelevance with out-of-left-field political musings. Seeking to connect to the Trump demographic, ABC gave Roseanne new life, but her character was killed off after she went on a racist rant. James Woods, winner of a Golden Globe and Emmy, was once considered a dynamic actor. Now, after his caustic social commentary tweets, he's viewed as the cranky geezer who won't let you get your ball from his yard. Jon Voight, once a shining star among actors, recently posted a rambling video calling the political left ""Satan"" and promoting conspiracies about the election, reducing him from brilliant Oscar winner to cultural dumpster diver.""

Abdul-Jabbar also found fault with Christian actress Letitia Wright, who starred in ""Black Panther,"" because she ""posted a link to a YouTube video questioning the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccines in general. After a tsunami of social media backlash, she wrote: 'My intention was not to hurt anyone. My ONLY intention of posting the video was it raised my concerns with what the vaccine contains and what we are putting in our bodies. Nothing else.'"" But Abdul-Jabbar said ""at best, that's naive, and at worst, disingenuous. If someone wants to raise concerns — that's legitimate — they need to do basic research: Find facts, statistics and qualified authorities. Because the reality is that when she posts, readers believe she endorses the false conclusions — and that can't be undone.""

Left-wingers aren't immune, either

The former NBA great pointed out that famed author J.K. Rowling, a left-winger by just about every measure, took a ""stumble from grace"" due to her ""anti-trans tweets"" which ""could end up tainting her entire literary legacy."" But Rowling doesn't appear to be backing down an inch, most recently declaring that the ""climate of fear"" around the trans debate needs to end.

""Many are afraid to speak up because they fear for their jobs and even for their personal safety,"" Rowling said in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine. ""This climate of fear serves nobody well, least of all trans people.""

He also ripped John Cleese's ""tone-deaf defense of Rowling,"" saying it ""left many fans bitterly disappointed, tarnishing his reputation."" But like Rowling, the former Monty Python legend doesn't seem to care about what others think — and unabashedly thinks for himself.

In fact, Cleese accused the rage mob of ""wokery, humorless posturing, and moral self-promotion.""

""If you can't control your own emotions, you're forced to control other people's behavior,"" Cleese said of Twitter users who've attacked Rowling and demanded that she shut up. ""That's why the touchiest, most oversensitive and easily upset must not set the standard for the rest of us.""

Big brother, where art thou?

Concluding his piece, Abdul-Jabbar said social media giants ""have begun slapping warnings on some messages that are false, incite violence, or cause harm to society. But this needs to be done with more consistency and vigilance. Studies indicate that when readers see these warnings, they are less likely to read or believe things. However, as another study showed, there can be a backfire effect in which content that isn't flagged, even when inaccurate, is perceived as true.""

He added: ""The irresponsibility of tweeting irrational and harmful opinions to millions, regardless of the damaging consequences to their country or people's lives, proves that those stars deserve the harsh backlash.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kareem-abdul-jabbar-crack-down-conservative-speech,2020-12-18
Envelopes with white powder sent to Kari Lake headquarters,"Two envelopes containing a suspicious white powder were allegedly mailed to Kari Lake's campaign headquarters. The incident reportedly prompted the response of hazmat units and the FBI.

NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hillyard reported that the FBI, Phoenix Police, hazmat teams, and bomb squad units responded to an alleged incident involving ""suspicious items"" discovered at Kari Lake's campaign headquarters around 10 p.m. on Saturday.

A source said that a ""white powdery substance"" was found in two envelopes addressed to Lake's office.

A campaign staffer reportedly opened one of the envelopes and was exposed to the powder.

The Daily Mail reported that the envelopes also contained ""abusive messages.""

A source familiar with Lake's campaign told the Daily Mail, ""Yesterday, one of Kari's staffers opened up an envelope that had a suspicious white powder in it and had a letter in there with a bunch of vulgarities and ranting and raving about Kari. The employee then noticed a second package that was exactly like the first one she had opened and she reported it.""

At the time of the incident, Lake was at a campaign event in Scottsdale and away from her headquarters.

As of yet, the staffer has not reported any symptoms or injuries from the exposure.

Law enforcement is said to have conducted an investigation at the office until 5 a.m. on Sunday. Investigators have seized the suspicious materials.

""When officers arrived, they learned there were suspicious items located inside the mail. Additional resources responded to collect the items and secure the area,"" said Sgt. Phil Krynsky. ""There have been no reports of injury and the investigation remains active.”

Daily Mail political reporter Rob Crilly said, ""Staffer is fine, I'm told, but campaign is shaken up.""

The Daily Mail reported, ""Her campaign believes this was a 'terroristic attack, trying to intimidate Kari and the campaign staff.'""

Lake campaign spokesman Colton Duncan told CNN, ""It was one of two envelopes that were confiscated by law enforcement and sent to professionals at Quantico for examination, and we are awaiting details. The staff member is currently under medical supervision.""

Duncan declared, ""In the meantime, know that our resolve has never been higher, and we cannot be intimidated. We continue to push full speed ahead to win this election on Tuesday.""

Lake is battling her Democratic opponent Katie Hobbs in the Arizona gubernatorial race.

New York governor uses Buffalo mass killing to push for new control on speech: 'You don't protect hate speech',"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) wasted no time using the atrocious Buffalo mass killing to push for more government control over the lives of Americans.

In appearances on multiple Sunday cable news shows, Hochul advocated for government intervention to stop so-called ""hate speech"" from spreading online. She credited such content with radicalizing the perpetrator of the Buffalo massacre.

CNN

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Hochul said the ""bone-chilling"" aspect of the killer's manifesto ""is that there is the ability for people to write and subscribe to such philosophies filled with hate, the white supremacist acts of terrorism that have been fomented on social media.""

She added that she wants the CEOs of every major social media platform to ""look me in the eye and tell me that everything is being done that they can to make sure that this information is not spread.""

Later in the interview, Hochul demanded new ""national laws"" to restrict the Second Amendment and ""the unfettered sharing of hate information on the internet."" She described firearms and the aforementioned hate information as a ""lethal combination.""

NBC

In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Hochul took her rhetoric further, blaming social media companies and TV commentators for spreading the type of information that radicalized the Buffalo killer.

""They need to be held accountable as well,"" she said of such TV commentators. ""And any government leader that does not condemn this and condemn it today is a coward, and they're also partially responsible.""

Not only did she also place blame on elected officials, but she called for new, unconstitutional restrictions against so-called ""hate speech.""

So let's just be real honest about the role of elected leaders. And what they need to be doing is calling this out and not coddling this behavior and saying that, ""Well, that's just young people and they're sharing their ideas."" Yeah, I'll protect the First Amendment any day of the week. But you don't protect hate speech. You don't protect incendiary speech. You're not allowed to scream ""fire"" in a crowded theater. There are limitations on speech. And right now, we have seen this run rampant. And as a result, I have ten dead neighbors in this community. And it hurts. And we're going to do something about it.

Meet The Press Broadcast (Full) - May 15 youtu.be

ABC

In an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" Hochul repeated the same message and claimed that ""hate speech"" is not protected speech, which is patently false.

""The CEOs of those companies need to be held accountable and assure all of us that they're taking every step humanly possible to be able to monitor this information,"" she said.

Hochul then demanded that so-called hate speech ""be monitored and shut down the second these words are espoused out there in these platforms.""

""And short of that, we will protect the right to free speech, but there is a limit. There is a limit to what you can do and hate speech is not protected,"" she claimed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kathy-hochul-speech-restrictions-buffalo-massacre,2022-05-16
Mother of slain Marine unleashes on 'treasonous' Biden in surprise call to radio show: 'You did this to my son',"The mother of a United States Marine killed in the terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport last week tore into President Joe Biden during a radio interview on Friday, placing ultimate blame for her young son's death at the feet of the president.

Kathy McCollum — the mother of 20-year-old Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, whose child will be born in just weeks — called into the SiriusXM radio show of Andrew Wilkow, host of ""Wilkow"" on BlazeTV, called Biden a ""b***h,"" and then unloaded on the president.

""That feckless, dementia-ridden piece of crap just sent my son to die,"" she said, speaking of Biden. ""I woke up at four o'clock this morning, two Marines at my door telling me my son was dead. So, to have her on right before me and listen to that piece of crap talk about diplomatic crap with frickin' Taliban terrorists who just freakin blew up my son and no, nothing, to not say anything about, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry for families.' So, my son is gone.""

Then McCollum took aim at Democrats who voted for Biden in the 2020 election.

""You just killed my son, with a dementia-ridden piece of crap who doesn't even know he's in the White House,"" she said. ""He still thinks he's a senator.""

McCollum explained that she called into Wilkow's show, which obviously surprised the radio host, to help her ""process through anger instead of tears.""

The grieving mother added that she believes her son ""died in vain"" because of how Biden facilitated the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.



""I never thought in 1 million years that he would die for nothing, for nothing because a feckless, dementia-ridden piece of crap who decided he wanted a photo-op on Sept. 11 — that's what kills me,"" McCollum said. ""I wanted my son to represent our country, to fight for my country. But I never thought that a feckless piece of crap would send him to his death and smirk on television while he's talking about people dying with his nasty smirk.""

McCollum said that Biden ""needs to be removed from office,"" adding that her son would not have died if Donald Trump were still president.

McCollum ended the call by labeling Biden a ""treasonous man"" and a ""disgusting human being."" She also again blamed Democrats for her son's tragic death.

""You did this to my son, every Democrat that's listening, you did this to my son,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kathy-mccollum-joe-biden-afghanistan,2021-08-29
Twitter reactions from AOC and Chasten Buttigieg on protesters targeting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh,"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was forced to bolt from a dinner at a Washington, D.C., restaurant on Wednesday. Leftist protesters discovered Kavanaugh was eating at Morton's Steakhouse and disrupted the entire restaurant to ""unduly"" harass the Supreme Court justice over his decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Morton's Steakhouse called the incident an ""act of selfishness and void of decency.”

However, Democrats have gleefully cheered on the targeted harassment of a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) shared a tweet from Huffington Post senior editor Andy Campbell slamming Politico for ""clutching pearls"" for writing up a 212-word account of the harassment of Justice Kavanaugh near the end of its Playbook feature.

""While the court had no official comment on Kavanaugh’s behalf and a person familiar with the situation said he did not hear or see the protesters and ate a full meal but left before dessert, Morton’s was outraged about the incident,"" the Politico article said.

AOC wrote on Twitter, ""Poor guy. He left before his soufflé because he decided half the country should risk death if they have an ectopic pregnancy within the wrong state lines. It’s all very unfair to him. The least they could do is let him eat cake.""

""I will never understand the pearl clutching over these protests,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a follow-up tweet. ""Republicans send people to protest me all the time, sometimes drunk and belligerent. Nobody cares about it unless it’s a Republican in a restaurant. Can someone please explain the obsession because I don’t get it.""

National Review fact-checked the Democratic socialist and noted that AOC was spreading misinformation in her post regarding ectopic pregnancies – which occur when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus where it can not survive and can be fatal for the mother.

""While Ocasio-Cortez seemed to smile upon the demonstration, her reason for supporting such action is fictitious,"" the outlet stated. ""The treatment of ectopic pregnancies — which occur when an embryo implants itself outside of the uterus, oftentimes on the fallopian tube — remains legal in all 50 states. Embryos that implant outside of the uterus are not viable, and even the most strident of pro-life groups support the immediate treatment of them as a medically necessary act, not an abortion.""

Washington Examiner writer Jerry Dunleavy added, ""Not only is medical treatment for an ectopic pregnancy not illegal anywhere in America, but implying to your 13 million followers that it is illegal is the sort of thing that could actually cause someone to risk death for no reason rather than seek out the treatment they may need.""

Many online commentators also pointed out that Ocasio-Cortez previously lashed out at someone for merely taking a photo of her eating.

In February 2019, AOC spouted, ""Tonight a dude was creepily (and obviously) taking a picture of me while pretending he wasn’t and I had to break his imaginary fourth wall and say 'Hi! I’m a person! This is weird!'""

The Politico Playbook article was also shared on Twitter by Chasten Buttigieg – the husband of U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.

The spouse of the Biden cabinet member snarkily tweeted, ""Sounds like he just wanted some privacy to make his own dining decisions.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended protesters targeting a Supreme Court justice eating at a restaurant by saying, ""This is what a democracy is.""

TV writer Bryan Fuller raged, ""REMINDER: BRETT KAVANAUGH DESERVES TO DINE IN TERROR.""



Progressive podcaster Ethan Klein bloviated, ""I hope Brett Kavanaugh never has a peaceful meal for the rest of his life. Who gives a f***? Dude just stripped human rights away from 50% of Americans. F*** yo dinner bitch.""

Actor Ken Olin blustered, ""Sorry, not sorry. Brett Kavanaugh is a bad person. He’s only in that fancy DC steakhouse because his SCOTUS seat was bought & paid for by rich right wing religious fanatics. So if Americans want to exercise their 1st Amendment rights to protest outside a restaurant… tough s***.""

Baseball writer Craig Calcaterra ranted, ""F*** around and find out. Sorry, dude. You wanna ruin the lives of millions, expect people to tell you they hate it.""

Screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer tweeted, ""If Brett Kavanaugh never enjoys a dinner out again as long as he lives, he will still suffer less inconvenience than a child forced to give her birth to her rapist's baby.""

NBC Think writer Noah Berlatsky bemoaned, ""Pregnant people literally have no right to their own body and can be tortured for nine months and then killed by the state if it feels like it. How would Brett Kavanaugh like it if that happened to him? Forcing someone to carry a child they do not want at risk of their mental and physical health is torture. It's torture. And it's meant as such. these laws are deliberately sadistic and meant to terrorize women and keep them in their place.""

Far-left organization Shutdown DC offered money to tipsters who informed them of the physical location of Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Kavanaugh.

Rep. Maxine Waters accuses Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey of 'plain racist ignorance' after Ivey says that people will have to 'learn Spanish' if Biden keeps sending illegal immigrants into states,"Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) fired back after U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) decried the governor over a gubernatorial campaign ad.

Ivey, who is currently seeking re-election, issued a campaign ad in which she said that if President Joe Biden continues sending ""illegal immigrants into our states"" everyone will need to ""learn Spanish.""

""My message to Biden: No way Jose,"" Ivey declares in the ad.

During an appearance on MSNBC, Waters slammed the Alabama governor.

""This is plain racist ignorance in your face,"" the congresswoman declared. ""We don't have time to deal with that kind of stupidity and that kind of ignorance.""

Ivey responded: ""There’s nothing racist with telling the truth about the disaster Joe Biden is causing with illegals invading our country. I’m not going to be lectured by a liberal Congresswoman from California. We’ll handle our business in Alabama.""

The U.S. continues to face an ongoing massive influx of migrants along its southern border, a situation that many expect to worsen once the termination of a Title 42 order is implemented next month.

""In total, there were 221,303 encounters along the southwest land border in March, a 33 percent increase compared to February,"" according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. ""Of those, 28 percent involved individuals who had at least one prior encounter in the previous 12 months, compared to an average one-year re-encounter rate of 14 percent for FY2014-2019.""



Border security is a critical for public safety — CBP press releases frequently highlight the arrest of previously convicted, previously deported sex offenders who have unlawfully entered the country.



Inadequate border security also leaves the nation vulnerable to the possibility of terrorists sneaking into the country.

Last year, the Border Patrol nabbed multiple individuals named on the terror watchlist, Fox News reported, citing CBP data it obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. The outlet reported that between Jan. 20 and Dec. 27 of last year, authorities had 23 encounters with people who had names that matched with the Terrorist Screening Database.

""Before the 9/11 attacks, there were several different terrorism watchlists, making it difficult to share information,"" according to the FBI. ""The [Terrorist Screening Center] consolidated that into one federal terrorism watchlist. This watchlist has information on people reasonably suspected to be involved in terrorism (or related activities).""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kay-ivey-responds-after-maxine-waters-accuses-kay-ivey-of-racism,2022-04-19
Cost to detain Khalid Sheikh Mohammed imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay,"A jaw-dropping report revealed the shocking amount of American taxpayer money that has been spent on imprisoning Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks, and the Al Qaeda terrorist who claimed responsibility for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

Less than a month after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was put on the FBI's ""most wanted terrorists"" list, and he had a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture. On March 1, 2003, Mohammed was captured in Rawalpindi, near the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. U.S. intelligence was tipped off by an informant, who messaged American authorities, ""I am with KSM,"" the New York Times reported.

On Sept. 6, 2006, then-President George W. Bush announced that ""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody have been transferred to the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay."" Previously, the terror suspects were allegedly kept at ""black site"" CIA detention facilities in Eastern Europe, as reported by ABC News.

In 2006, Bush said there were 455 detainees being held at Gitmo.

The New York Times reported, ""Of the roughly 780 people who have been detained at the United States military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 731 have been transferred and 40 remain. In addition, nine detainees died while in custody.""

There have been mind-boggling costs to house Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the terrorist onslaught in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 by weaponizing hijacked commercial airliners to bring down the Twin Towers, attack the Pentagon, and crash a plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

""The U.S. government has spent an estimated $161.5 million housing the suspected mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks – Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,"" Fox News reported on Sunday. ""It's not exactly clear how much the federal government spends housing its Gitmo prisoners, but it's somewhere between $9.5 and $13 million per prisoner, per year.""

The New York Times reported in 2019:

Then there is Guantánamo Bay, where the expense now works out to about $13 million for each of the 40 prisoners being held there.



According to a tally by The New York Times, the total cost last year of holding the prisoners — including the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — paying for the troops who guard them, running the war court and doing related construction, exceeded $540 million.



The $13 million per prisoner cost almost certainly makes Guantánamo the world's most expensive detention program. And nearly 18 years after the George W. Bush administration took a crude compound called Camp X-Ray and hastily established it as a holding station for enemy fighters picked up in the war on terrorism, it has taken on a sprawling and permanent feel, with the expense most likely to continue far into the future.

After the report was published, then-President Donald Trump was asked about the exorbitant Guantanamo costs.

""I think it's crazy. It costs a fortune to operate it and I think it's crazy,"" Trump told reporters in September 2019. He added that ""we're looking into that.""

Trump then criticized former President Barack Obama for not shutting down the infamous prison in Cuba after he promised to do so during his 2008 run for the White House.

""He was going to have everybody removed and Guantanamo Bay closed up by the time he left office and he didn't do that. He didn't do that either,"" Trump told reporters. ""So we're stuck with it.""

NPR reported in 2019 that American taxpayers were annually paying at least $9.5 million per detainee in Guantanamo Bay.



""The U.S. military court and prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today,"" NPR reported.

""That does not include the $60 million annual expense of operating Guantanamo's naval base or the salaries of military personnel, including the 1,800 guards overseeing the detention center's prisoners,"" according to the whistleblower report.



The report alleged that hearings held at Guantanamo's military court in 2014 ""cost taxpayers the equivalent of $700,000 an hour.""

A Defense Department report in 2013 estimated the annual operating costs of Guantanamo Bay's prison and court system to be $454.1 million. ""At the time, there were 166 prisoners at Guantanamo, making the per-prisoner cost $2.7 million,"" according to the New York Times.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed made headlines this week when it was reported that 40 Guantanamo Bay detainees, including KSM, would be getting vaccinated.



""COVID-19 vaccinations will be offered to all detainees and prisoners. It will be administered on a voluntary basis and in accordance with the Department's priority distribution plan,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Defense told CBS News.

There was immediate outrage that suspects said to be involved in the 9/11 attacks would get the COVID-19 vaccination before millions of Americans.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted, ""President Biden told us he would have a plan to defeat the virus on day 1. He just never told us that it would be to give the vaccine to terrorists before most Americans.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter. ""How the hell does this make sense??""

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said, ""It is inexcusable and un-American that President Biden is choosing to prioritize vaccinations for convicted terrorists in Gitmo over vulnerable American seniors or veterans,""

Following the uproar by Republican lawmakers, the Pentagon ""paused"" its decision to vaccinate the prisoners.

""No Guantanamo detainees have been vaccinated. We're pausing the plan to move forward, as we review force protection protocols. We remain committed to our obligations to keep our troops safe,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby stated on Saturday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-guantanamo-bay-cost,2021-01-31
Kurt Bardella calls GOP 'domestic terrorist cell',"Kurt Bardella, who indicates that he is an advisor to the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has described ""MAGA Republicans"" as ""a domestic terrorist cell.""

""MAGA"" is an acronym for former President Trump's well-known campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again.""

""The Republican Party, the MAGA Republicans, are a domestic terrorist cell operating in America,"" Bardella said during an appearance on MSNBC. He said that whenever there is ""a group ... devoted to using violent rhetoric, extreme means, to incite violence against other people that is terrorism.""



But that was not the only time Bardella has employed that type of inflammatory terminology about Republicans. ""They are basically a domestic terrorist cell operating within America. Their goal is to end democracy,"" he said during another MSNBC appearance.

President Biden has said that ""extreme MAGA philosophy"" is ""like semi-fascism.""

He has also claimed that ""MAGA Republicans have awakened"" American women. People on social media dragged the president for the comment, with some pointing out that liberals struggle to define the meaning of the word ""woman.""

Biden is slated to deliver a speech in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Thursday in which he will discuss how rights are supposedly under assault in the country. NBC News White House correspondent Mike Memoli reported that an official said Biden ""will talk about the progress we have made as a nation to protect our democracy, but how our rights and freedoms are still under attack. And he will make clear who is fighting for those rights, fighting for those freedoms, and fighting for our democracy.""

"Law enforcement experts say shooting of 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant was legally justified, no other options to 'de-escalate' were available","Law enforcement experts asked to weigh in on the deadly police shooting of a 16-year-old girl who was attacking another person with a knife say that the police officer's use of force was legally justified and that it appears he had no other options to de-escalate the situation.



The fatal shooting occurred Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio. Police were called to respond to a physical threat of violence at a house in the southeast area of the city. Bodycam footage released by the Columbus Division of Police after the incident shows the teen girl, Ma'Khia Bryant, attempting to stab two people with a knife. The video is from the perspective of Officer Nicholas Reardon, who arrived on the scene and shortly thereafter fired his weapon and shot Bryant before she could stab someone.

Bryant was taken to the hospital and later died of her injuries. Her death led many prominent leftists and celebrities to denounce ""police terror"" and the ""injustice"" of another death of a black person at the hands of the police.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the death was ""tragic,"" saying, ""she was a child.""

""We're thinking of her friends and family in the communities that are hurting and grieving her loss. We know that police violence disproportionately impacts black and Latino people in communities and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence. We also know that there are particular vulnerabilities that children in foster care, like Ma'Khia, face,"" Psaki said.

Experts point out, however, that the shooting appears justified and note that Officer Reardon likely saved the lives of one or more people.

After reviewing the video footage, Bowling Green State University professor Philip Stinson, who specializes in criminal justice and researches fatal shootings, told the Columbus Dispatch that Officer Reardon appears to have been ""legally justified in using deadly force.""

""It's a terribly tragic situation, and my heart goes out to the girl and her family and friends,"" he said Wednesday. ""But from looking at the video, it appears to me that a reasonable police officer would have had a reasonable apprehension of an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death being imposed against an officer or someone else. That's the legal standard.""

Another expert with 33 years of experience training police officers and serving as an expert witness at trials in use-of-force cases agreed after seeing the video.

""An officer is justified in using deadly force if his life or the life of someone else is at risk,"" retired Columbus Division of Police SWAT Officer James Scanlon said. ""Few would argue that there weren't at least two lives there that were at serious risk.""

He explained that Officer Reardon took action ""to save the life of someone he doesn't even know. ... It's a shame that no one has recognized that that officer, in all likelihood, saved one or more lives.""

Stinson added that the shooting is ""a good reminder that officers sometimes have to make split-second, life-or-death decisions in violent street encounters. ... These situations can escalate in a matter of milliseconds, as we saw here.""

Both experts agreed that Reardon did not appear to have any means of de-escalating the situation, whether by using a Taser or by shooting the knife-wielding assailant in the leg.

""I don't know what the officer could have done differently,"" Stinson said. ""Based on what I saw, there was no opportunity for the officer to de-escalate.""

He explained that use of a non-lethal weapon like a Taser isn't appropriate for ""a lethal-force situation."" He also told the Dispatch that police officers are trained to shoot at ""center mass"" of the person they're trying to stop, so as to protect themselves or others.

Officers are taught ""to shoot until the threat is neutralized,"" he said.

Scanlon further described the incident as ""a textbook scenario"" of when officers are trained to use deadly force in a shoot/don't shoot scenario.

""That's exactly the kind of film you'd see in training rooms where you have to react to a deadly situation,"" he said.

Scanlon added that officers ""are trained and they're re-trained in use-of-force situations. One problem we see is officers who react in ways that are inconsistent with their training. I did not see that in this video.""

""In this situation, inaction by the officer, I believe, would likely have resulted in serious bodily injury or death to one or more persons,"" Scanlon said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/law-enforcement-experts-makhia-bryant-shooting-justified,2021-04-22
Leaked memo says Biden administration is preparing for violence after abortion ruling,"The Department of Homeland Security is preparing for an increase in political violence after the Supreme Court hands down its official ruling on Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks, according to a leaked memo reported Wednesday.

First Axios and then Fox News published details from a May 13 memo revealing that federal law enforcement is investigating threats made on social media to ""burn down or storm"" the Supreme Court building. Pro-abortion-rights activists began making such threats earlier in the month when a draft majority opinion leaked to Politico indicated the court had voted to uphold Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban and overturn the landmark Roe decision.

Pro-abortion protesters have called for a ""summer of rage,"" with the expectation that the court will roll back abortion rights. Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices have already endured potentially illegal protests outside their private homes, and the headquarters of a pro-life organization was attacked with a Molotov cocktail in Madison, Wisconsin.



The DHS memo reportedly says that threats made against Supreme Court justices, lawmakers, churches, and abortion clinics ""are likely to persist and may increase leading up to and following the issuing of the Court's official ruling.""

Violence could come from both sides of the abortion debate, according to the DHS.

""Some racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists’ embrace of pro-life narratives may be linked to the perception of wanting to 'save white children' and 'fight white genocide,'"" the memo reportedly says. It also warns that extremist acts could come from pro-abortion radicals.

But heated rhetoric surrounding the debate should not be confused with calls to violence, the memo says.



""The mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute domestic violent extremism or illegal activity and is constitutionally protected.""

In a statement, a DHS spokesperson said the government ""is committed to protecting Americans' freedom of speech and other civil rights and civil liberties, including the right to peacefully protest.""

""DHS is also committed to working with our partners across every level of government and the private sector to share timely information and intelligence, prevent all forms of violence, and to support law enforcement efforts to keep our communities safe,"" the spokesman said.

Last week, the Department of Justice said it is monitoring threats made against Supreme Court justices.

""Attorney General Garland continues to be briefed on security matters related to the Supreme Court and Supreme Court Justices. The Attorney General directed the U.S. Marshals Service to help ensure the Justices’ safety by providing additional support to the Marshal of the Supreme Court and Supreme Court Police,” said DOJ spokesman Anthony Coley.

"Leaked notes reveal extent of Biden's 'failures' on Afghanistan withdrawal, evacuating Afghans who helped America","Leaked notes from a meeting held by senior Biden administration officials in the White House Situation Room the day before Kabul fell last August — in fact, as Kabul was falling — reveal the level of inadequate preparation for such an event by President Joe Biden.

The notes were first reported by Axios, which characterized them as revealing Biden's ""failures"" on Afghanistan.

What are the details?

The meeting of the National Security's Council's so-called Deputies Small Group — which Axios explained as a group of senior aides to Cabinet members, who meet to work out ""practical details for executing decisions already made by their bosses"" — took place on Aug. 14 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. EST.

The meeting was chaired by Liz Sherwood-Randall, an NSC official.

Decisions that were made at the meeting included:

The State Department ""will immediately stand up a communications/manifest’ team which will be responsible for notifying individuals from various priority lists of their travel eligibility and collect biographic information for all travelers to be manifested.""

The State Department and Defense Department will attempt ""to manifest at least 5,000 individuals for relocation per day from Afghanistan.""

""State will work to identify as many countries as possible to serve as transit points. Transit points need to be able to accommodate U.S. citizens, Afghan nationals, third country nationals, and other evacuees.""

""Embassy Kabul will notify LES [locally employed staff] to begin to register their interest in relocation to the United States and begin to prepare immediately for departure.""

Such action points, all of which leaders said needed to be addressed ""immediately,"" show the ""crucial actions"" the Biden administration had yet to take as the Taliban were entering Kabul, Axios explained.

The notes underscore criticism of Biden in the days and months after the fall of Afghanistan. Critics have said the Biden administration overestimated the Afghan national military's ability to withstand the Taliban, underestimated the speed with which the Taliban were seizing control of Afghanistan, and therefore did not sufficiently prioritize evacuating Americans and American allies from the country, including Afghans who helped American forces in country.

The unpreparedness resulted in mass chaos at the international airport in Kabul, which, as the world unfortunately learned, became a target for terrorism. The problems caused by Biden's unprepared and hasty exit from Afghanistan remain today.

How did the Biden administration respond?

NSC spokesperson Emily Horne said the NSC would not comment on ""cherry-picked"" notes, which Horne claimed distort and do not show planning that allegedly took place in the months before Kabul fell.

""While we're not going to comment on leaked internal documents, cherry-picked notes from one meeting do not reflect the months of work that were already under way,"" Horne told Axios.

""Earlier that summer, we launched Operation Allies Refuge and had worked with Congress to pass legislation that gave us greater flexibility to quickly relocate Afghan partners,"" Horne added. ""It was because of this type of planning and other efforts that we were able to facilitate the evacuation of more than 120,000 Americans, legal permanent residents, vulnerable Afghans and other partners.""

Indeed, Biden continues to staunchly defend his Afghanistan chaos, saying just last month that he has ""no apologies"" to offer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leaked-notes-reveal-extent-of-bidens-failures-on-afghanistan-withdrawal,2022-02-02
Left-wing radio host wants Trump fan Curt Schilling wiped from Phillies' Wall of Fame over 'racist' tweets. Schilling calls host a 'special piece of s**t.',"In our latest episode of the Cancel Culture Chronicles, we find a left-wing sports radio host apparently looking for a little attention — and greasing the skids by zeroing in on legendary pitcher Curt Schilling, who's been making headlines of late.

What is the background?

Earlier this week, Schilling — an outspoken conservative and major supporter of President Donald Trump — claimed that AIG canceled his insurance over his ""social media profile.""

The alleged insurance cancellation occurred in the wake of the U.S. Capitol riot last week, after which leftists — and the powers that be heeding their words — began vilifying and canceling conservatives at a dizzying pace. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pulled the plug on Trump, while Apple and Amazon took down Twitter competitor Parler.

Schilling posted a tweet hours after the riot — and it had some legs with the media: ""You cowards sat on your hands, did nothing while liberal trash looted rioted and burned for Air Jordan's and big screens, sit back, stfu, and watch folks start a confrontation for s**t that matters like rights, democracy and the end of gov't corruption."" His tweet was still active Friday afternoon.



Wanna be startin' somethin'?

Enter veteran sports talk radio host Mike Missanelli, a well-known figure in Philadelphia sports circles who was on the airwaves when Schilling and the Phillies were vying for a World Series title in 1993.

So Missanelli — who's as outspoken about his left-wing politics as Schilling is about his conservative views — let the former Phillies star have it:

""In light of his tweets (racist among other things) following the seditious attack on the Capitol — re: today's Inquirer — I call upon the Phillies and John Middleton to immediately remove Curt Schilling from their Wall of Fame,"" Missanelli tweeted Thursday.

How did Schilling respond?

As you might guess, Schilling was not pleased with Missanelli's declaration and threw down with the radio host: ""You know my family, you've known me for almost 30 years. It takes a special piece of s**t to do and say things you know are lies. Esp given you know my wife and her battle with cancer right now. Do me a huge favor, next time we're ftf call me a racist.""

Missanelli replied as most folks on social media do — absent any clear and present physical danger, of course: ""Your family is great. I sent your WIFE best wishes (it should have read). You turned into a traitorous asshole. There. That more clear for ya?""

He added in another tweet to Schilling, ""You should be ashamed of yourself for your ignorant tweet DURING an act of sedition and for supporting it in any way.""

It's worth noting that unless Schilling posted and deleted another tweet, the one in question was posted at 11:52 p.m. Jan. 6 — after the afternoon riot was over.

How did folks react?

Commentary on the dust-up has been a mixed bag. Some back Missanelli's wish to cancel Schilling. But others? Not so much:

""Let me know when that goes down, Curt. I got your back,"" one user noted. ""Would love to have a front row seat watching you beat the crap out of this bitter lowlife.""

""Mike is a scumbag Curt you know this already,"" another commenter offered. ""Typical looney liberal.""

""'Remove all traces of people that disagree with me' is straight from the commie playbook for a reason,"" another user said.

Schilling's wife, who is battling cancer, even got in on the war of words:

Missanelli sent the following reply: ""Shonda, you know you have always had my best wishes. And I pray for your good health. Your husband tweeting what he tweeted, supporting an act of sedition, DURING the act, is disgraceful. He can't now play the victim.""

Anything else?

Schilling's outspokenness, particularly with regard to his conservative politics, has led to numerous controversies over the years:

His June 2016 blog post in the wake of the terror attack at an Orlando gay nightclub lit into gun control advocates and Muslims.

ESPN fired him in April 2016 for a meme he posted that mocked transgender bathroom laws.

And the sports network pulled him off the air in September 2015 for the rest of the baseball season over a tweet against radical Islam.

Also it's long been opined that his politics have kept him out baseball's Hall of Fame, but a Philadelphia sportswriter wrote that ""Schilling belongs in Hall of Fame even though his views are worthy of nothing but shame.""

Just before Trump's 2017 inauguration, Schilling said his support of the president also was keeping him out of the Hall.

""I promise you if I had said, 'Lynch Trump,' I would be getting in with about 90 percent of the vote this year,"" Schilling told TMZ Sports, a reference to baseball writers' politics as well as their all-powerful votes that grant entrance into Cooperstown.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-radio-host-curt-schilling,2021-01-15
Leftist college students: 9/11 history lessons shouldn't mention terror attacks' 'roots in Islam'; instead teachers should 'focus on America's faults',"Leftist college students at the University of Florida surprised absolutely no one when Campus Reform interviewed them recently about how the world-changing terror attacks against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, should be taught in the classroom.

In short: Don't focus on who carried out the carnage — and criticize America instead.

What are the details?

One student said some of the more ""gruesome"" facts about the 9/11 attacks should be kept out of lesson plans.

Another said teachers should ""avoid talking about its roots in Islam"" since the 9/11 attackers were part of an ""extremist group"" of Muslims.

One guy — who may have been vying for neo-hippie of the year — offered that 9/11 should be ""taught in way that doesn't really target, like, more like, who did it, but, like, more like, how we can, like, move forward and, like, different, like, healing processes that we can go through to, like, to make everything, like, you know, good again.""

Or something.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Another student agreed, saying teachers should ""avoid placing blame,"" since such an action might lead to ""Islamophobia"" and — gasp! — discussions about ""American exceptionalism.""

As it turns out, American exceptionalism was a big trigger point for the students when it comes to 9/11 education.

""We don't need more nationalism in this country ... we need more, like, healthcare,"" one student noted. ""I think they should focus on America's faults, not like how amazing we are and how we need to be superior, 'cause we're not.""

One student added that ""I definitely don't agree that America is the best country on the earth; I think that we still need a lot of, like, fixing.""

Another student declared flat-out that ""I don't think we should be talking about the greatness of the country"" while another pointed out the ""colonist and imperialist notions"" behind such an idea.

Yet another student said American exceptionalism is ""a dangerous mindset to teach young people ... because I think that's the reason why a lot of people grow up to be kind of extremists and, like, really nationalistic.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftist-college-students-9-11-history-lessons-shouldn-t-mention-terror-attacks-roots-in-islam-instead-teachers-should-focus-on-america-s-faults,2021-09-10
"Leftist filmmaker Michael Moore says US must defend democracy 'against our own domestic Taliban,' apologizes for American wars","Leftist filmmaker Michael Moore — fresh off comparing Southern Baptists to bloodthirsty, misogynistic Taliban militants who've once again taken over Afghanistan — has shared yet another divisive declaration.

What did he say?

As the U.S. military pulled its last service member out of Afghanistan, Moore on Monday took to Twitter and not only apologized for wars the United States has waged, but also he called out ""our own domestic Taliban"" and said we must defend our democracy against it:

""WAR IS OVER. 4:33pm ET. ENOUGH!"" Moore wrote. ""No more wars. Peace. Apologies to all. Time to fix ourselves and strengthen our own Democracy and defend it against our own domestic Taliban. Take the war money and use it on schools, health care, guaranteed income, housing. Never again. Ever.""

It isn't exactly clear who Moore believes constitute ""our own domestic Taliban,"" but given his politics, one can safely infer he means certain supporters of former President Donald Trump and not violent extremists like Antifa.

How did folks react?

As with most pronouncements that proceed from Moore's mouth, this particular statement garnered some support, but it appeared most commenters weren't pleased at all with the radical leftist documentarian:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftist-filmmaker-michael-moore-says-us-must-defend-democracy-against-our-own-domestic-taliban-apologizes-for-american-wars,2021-08-31
Leftist militants attack conservative students and use terror tactics to shut down Turning Point USA event ​at UC Davis,"A Turning Point USA event was shut down Tuesday evening after multiple attacks by leftist militants on attendees were answered, not by the UC Davis police, who were kept from intervening, but by a handful of counter-protesters ready for a fight.

A night with 'MAGA Hulk'

The UC Davis student chapter of Turning Point USA organized an event for Oct. 25, set to feature conservative speaker Stephen Davis, the host of the podcast ""SMASH with MAGA Hulk.""

The chapter vice president of UC Davis TPUSA, Luke Shalz, noted that Stephen Davis is ""an African-American gentleman who does not believe in systemic racism.""

In advance of the event featuring a black conservative speaker, flyers were distributed on campus accusing TPUSA of being ""racist, homophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigrant"" and of celebrating violence. The flyers also defamed Kyle Rittenhouse, who spoke at a TPUSA event, as a ""racist murder [sic].""

The flyers called on ""anyone who opposes racism and bigotry to stand together and make it known that TPUSA is not welcome on our campus.""

Similar posts were circulated online accusing Stephen Davis of being a fascist for ""denying systemic racism.""

Notwithstanding calls for censorship ahead of the event, the university claimed that it was ""committed to the First Amendment, and ... required to uphold it. We affirm the right of our students — in this instance, Turning Point USA at UC Davis — to invite speakers to our campus, just as we affirm the right of others to protest speakers whose views they find upsetting or offensive.""

The university also reportedly informed the TPUSA campus chapter that UC Davis police would be present at the event and that they would intervene if protests turned violent.

However, when leftist protesters began using barriers as battering rams and pepper-spraying young women, the campus police — said to have been on site — did not take action or deploy into the crowd.

The university told KCRA3 that officers had been on standby when the fighting broke out, but did not act because ""the situation de-escalated on its own, eliminating the need for the police to engage.""

The brawl

The brawl that ensued allegedly involved 100 people and began, according to TPUSA's field team, when Antifa began provoking people trying to enter the venue.



In a statement, UC Davis noted there had been reports of Antifa supporters involved in the fighting and pepper-spraying and that members of the pugnacious men's group Proud Boys may have also been on the scene.

One young female conservative was pepper-sprayed by leftist agitators.

UC Davis also indicated that some ""in the crowd used barricades to beat on the glass of the UC Davis Conference Center, where about 30 people were inside waiting for the event to begin.""

Student Affairs staff reportedly determined that the chaos outside presented sufficient danger to warrant shutting down the event.

The UC Davis TPUSA chapter ultimately agreed, later stating, ""Rather than risk any further escalation of violence, our TPUSA chapter leadership decided to cancel the event when it became apparent campus PD was unable to disperse the violent agitators outside while also keeping our students safe inside.""

""This is a great loss for free speech, our speaker Stephen Davis, and for the students at UC Davis. TPUSA condemns all violence and refuses to be cowed by those who use threats and intimidation to stop conservatives on campus,"" TPUSA tweeted.

On Thursday, former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell called out UC Davis chancellor Gary May, suggesting he had failed up to stand up for true diversity on campus after Davis, a black speaker, had been shut down by ""radical lefties.""

Catherine Brinkley, a UC Davis professor, celebrated the silencing of a black conservative and the leftist attacks on unarmed students, stating she was ""really proud of our students, faculty, staff and community who showed up to counter-rally a planned speaking event at UC Davis. Thank you for putting your bodies on the line.""

It is unclear whether the event will be rescheduled.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftist-militants-attack-conservative-students-and-use-terror-tactics-to-shut-down-turning-point-usa-event-at-uc-davis,2022-10-27
Former CIA director warns botched Afghanistan withdrawal could pave way for Al Qaeda attacks on US soil,"Leon Panetta, who served as CIA director and Defense secretary in the Obama administration, warned Sunday that Al Qaeda could launch future attacks on American soil because the Taliban again control Afghanistan.

What did Panetta say?

Speaking with Greta Van Susteren, Panetta said the Taliban that re-took control of Afghanistan ""is pretty much the same Taliban that controlled Afghanistan on 9/11,"" which means Al Qaeda will likely reorganize under the protection of the Taliban.

""I just see terrorism becoming a renewed threat to the United States, and I'm not sure that you can get a lot done when you're dealing essentially with an adversary whose primary interest, the primary interest of terrorists, is to attack Americans and kill Americans,"" Panetta said.

In fact, Panetta explained he has zero doubts Al Qaeda will exploit the botched U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover to launch future attacks against America.

""There was a recent interview by one of the spokesman for the Taliban, where he was asked about bin Laden's role in 9/11, and he had the gall to say that he has not seen any evidence that [Osama] bin Laden was involved in the 9/11 attack,"" Panetta said. ""And if that is the case, then it's clear to me that they're going to continue to support Al Qaeda, and allow Al Qaeda to basically continue to develop and expand. And I think they will plan additional attacks on our country, as well as elsewhere.""

Later in the interview, Panetta described the ""rapid-fire withdrawal"" from Afghanistan, which was orchestrated by President Joe Biden, as a ""mistake.""

""What we missed was understanding the kind of consequences that developed and protecting ourselves from those consequences,"" Panetta said.

Leon Panetta: ‘The Taliban took us for a ride’ www.youtube.com

Anything else?

Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, speaking on CBS' ""Face The Nation,"" agreed with Panetta's assessment.

""I think that the Taliban winning the war in Afghanistan, and then the way our exit happened, has absolutely inspired jihadists all over the world,"" Morell said.

""The Taliban is saying, 'We just didn't defeat the United States. We defeated NATO. We defeated the world's greatest military power ever,'"" he continued. ""So there's a celebration going on. 'We defeated the Soviet Union. Then it fell. Now we've defeated NATO. Right? Maybe they can fall, too.' I think not only will jihadists be inspired, but a lot of them are going to come to Afghanistan to be part of the celebration, to be part of jihadist central.""

""So after 9/11, they all scattered from Afghanistan. I think we're going to see a flow back in, and that's one of the things that makes Afghanistan more dangerous than other spots on the planet,"" Morell predicted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leon-panetta-future-al-aqeda-attacks,2021-09-12
Liberal journalist delivers scathing rebuke of the left's new politics of 'social control',"Zaid Jilani — a journalist who formerly reported for liberal organizations such asThinkProgress, United Republic, Alternet, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee — recently took aim at members of his own ideological tribe over their newfound penchant for censorship, suppression, and cancellation.

What did he say?

In an op-ed for Newsweek published Monday, Jilani, who now hosts the podcast ""Extremely Offline,"" masterfully exposed the left's drift from its ""old politics of social liberation"" to its new ""politics of social control,"" a movement he claims escalated during the Trump presidency.

As proof of this new politics, Jilani cited the immediate actions taken by newly elected Democratic Rep. Cori Bush (Mo.). Her election, he thought, had ""created an opportunity for progressive change,"" yet her very first bill introduced in Congress ""called for an investigation into and possible expulsion of over 100 House Republicans who objected to the certification of electoral college votes on Jan. 6th, the same day as the Capitol riot.""

Should such an expulsion take place, he noted, not only would it disenfranchise tens of millions of voters, but it would ""demonstrate a glaring double standard,"" since Democratic lawmakers in the not-so-distant past voted to do the same thing. That's not even to mention the woefully problematic precedent that would be set.

""After all, if we were to hold everyone who holds a certain belief responsible for a small number of their ideological allies who resort to violence, then Bush herself would have to be expelled; she is after all an outspoken supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, whose protests have at times devolved into violent riots,"" he wrote. A stunning admission from a progressive writer.



What else?

If people should need further proof of the left's politics, they need to look no further than ""bias response teams"" on college campuses or big tech's evolution into ""a 21st century speech police,"" Jilani argued as if writing for some conservative outlet.

""This new politics of social control means using public and private institutions, almost all of which are now controlled by left-leaning people, to coerce individuals into their preferred modes of being and even thinking,"" he wrote.

He later added: ""The left's system of social control is focused squarely in one direction: at individuals, organizations, and ideologies perceived to be representing the excesses of the right,"" noting that the left believes ""the only way to deal with this conflagration is with repression, ranging from classmates snitching on each other to a new domestic anti-terrorism law.""

Jilani also argued that mainstream media has played a major role in the left's transformation by exaggerating racism and sexism in the country and thus fomenting division and stoking fear. This fear, he argues, is the impetus for the left's crusade of ""surveilling, censoring, punishing, and expelling.""

""When we're in a climate of fear, the impulse to just do something is overwhelming,"" he notes.

Anything else?

By way of conclusion, Jilani offered some salient advice for his friends in the progressive movement:

The left should move away from a posture that sees social control as its primary function and remember its roots in social liberation. Bullying and repressing people backfires. The best way to fight hate is by building trust, even with those who dislike us.



The left has traditionally existed to liberate human beings, not take pleasure in controlling and punishing people it views as aberrant or evil. Social control should be a last resort, not a pastime. Only by realizing this can the left resume its mission of expanding human freedom by promoting the dignity of every person.

For the conservative reader, Jilani's arguments are hardly anything new. Though still, conservatives should celebrate the fact that a progressive writer would wield them.

It appears there is yet some self-awareness in left-leaning circles. Perhaps it will win the day.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-journalist-exposes-left-social-control,2021-02-09
'Lifelong liberal' resigns from woke women's college for its 'racially hostile environment' where whites allegedly are attacked,"Readers of TheBlaze might recall a racially charged dust-up a couple of years back at Smith College — a prestigious all-women's school in Massachusetts — in which a black student accused an employee of racism. But even though an investigator the college hired found that the charges were unfounded, Smith still reacted with wringing hands.

The school's president, for starters, called the student to apologize and then placed the employee on administrative leave, the New York Post reported, citing the New York Times. The Post in a separate piece said staff members soon were ""forced to take 'anti­racist' training, and some employees [were] tarred as bigots.""

Later the school began requiring campus police to gather information about callers who report suspicious persons and tell their superiors if they believe such calls involve racial bias.

But that was just for starters.

'Lifelong liberal' employee blows the whistle

Jodi Shaw was a Smith College employee at the time of the latter incident, but even though she wasn't involved in it, the school's resulting actions disturbed her.

Shaw went public last fall with a video calling out the school. It's titled, ""Dear Smith College: I Have a Few Requests"":

Dear Smith College: I Have a Few Requests youtu.be

Despite calling herself a ""lifelong liberal,"" Shaw said she felt attacked by the college because of her skin color and was tired of the ""extreme intimidation we are all working under in regard to race.""

In the clip, she asked Smith to ""stop reducing my personhood to a racial category"" and to stop asking her to project stereotypes and assumptions on to others based upon their skin color. Other requests:

""Stop demanding that I admit to 'white privilege' and work on my so-called 'implicit bias' as a condition of my continued employment.""

""Stop telling me that as a white person I'm especially responsible for doing the work of dismantling racism.""

""Stop emboldening students to act abusively toward staff by refusing to hold them accountable for their own egregious behavior.""

""Lastly, we have the right to work in an environment free from the ever-present terror that any unverified student allegation of racism — or any other 'ism' — has the power to crush our reputations, ruin our livelihood, and even endanger the physical safety of ourselves or our family members.""

What happened next?

Shaw resigned last week after a monthslong standoff with Smith College, Fox News reported, adding that Shaw cited Smith's ""racially hostile environment"" as a reason for leaving.

Her resignation letter was published by former New York Times writer Bari Weiss, who herself resigned from the paper last summer after enduring ""constant bullying from colleagues"" because she pushed against the paper's leftism.

Shaw wrote that she ""endured meetings in which another staff member violently banged his fist on the table, chanting 'Rich, white women! Rich, white women!' in reference to Smith alumnae. I listened to my supervisor openly name preferred racial quotas for job openings in our department. I was given supplemental literature in which the world's population was reduced to two categories — 'dominant group members' and 'subordinated group members' — based solely on characteristics like race.""

Fox News reported that a Monday post on Shaw's website said she could no longer tolerate the impact working at Smith was having on her mental health and that she had turned down a ""generous settlement"" from the university that would have ""required confidentiality.""

Shaw added that she had offered to accept a severance only if Smith would take steps to end its ""mandatory race-based struggle sessions and their requirements that employees judge each other and the students in our care on the basis of their skin color.""

More from the network:

According to Shaw, when Smith said they would not consider the changes, she then had to consider how she could ""do the most good for this cause"" and acknowledged that the ""importance of telling the truth"" was not worth the price.



""I knew this was going to be an ugly process, and I'm sure this is not the last attempt Smith will make to discredit me. It seems that facts do not matter to Smith; what matters to Smith is its commitment to destructive race-based policies,"" she concluded. ""I look forward to seeing Smith in court.""



Shaw's statement came on the heels of a second letter from McCartney in which she ""flatly denies"" Shaw's ""baseless"" claims -- though not referring to Shaw by name -- and says Shaw's resignation letter ""contains a number of misstatements about the college's equity and inclusion initiatives.""



""The employee suggests that Smith tried to buy her silence. But it was the employee herself who demanded payment of an exceptionally large sum in exchange for dropping a threatened legal claim and agreeing to standard confidentiality provisions,"" McCartney asserted. ""Further, while the employee aims her complaint at Smith, her public communications make clear that her grievances about equity and inclusion training run more broadly...""

Anything else?

Fox News reported that Stacey Schmeidel, Smith College's senior director for news and strategic communication, said Smith ""stands behind President McCartney's response. Beyond that, we do not comment on potential or pending litigation.""

More from the network:

To date, Shaw has raised more than $214,000 on a GoFundMe page she said will be used to help both her and others in similar situations with legal and living expenses -- placing any amount over $150,000 in an escrow account.



On Saturday, Shaw tweeted that her GoFundMe page was placed ""under review"" and that there was a hold on all funds that she feared was ""for ideological reasons.""



However, the GoFundMe page is now back online and the crowdfunding platform told Fox News on Tuesday that the funds would be released to Shaw and that their Trust & Safety Team had been in contact with her.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-resigns-woke-college-racially-hostile-environment,2021-02-26
"MSNBC viewers lash out at reporter for criticizing Biden over Afghanistan, but she says she was just quoting Jen Psaki","MSNBC viewers lashed out at PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor for criticizing the Biden administration's withdrawal in Afghanistan but she replied that she was simply quoting White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

Alcindor was a guest on MSNBC when she said that the lethal terror attack in Afghanistan appeared to be the worst day of the Biden presidency.

""The president told reporters earlier this week 'history is going to record that this was a rational, logical right decision to make,' but as someone who pledged to strengthen strained relations from the Trump administration with our allies, what's the impact, what are you hearing from your sources inside the White House, what are their concerns?"" asked host Chris Jansing.

""Well, let's remember that yesterday was quite possibly the worst day of the Biden presidency amid one of the worst weeks of the Biden presidency,"" responded Alcindoor.

""Not only of course were those 13 service members as well as dozens of Afghans killed on his watch as commander-in-chief, you also have spiking cases of COVID-19, an eviction moratorium struck down by the Supreme Court, a confluence of problems that is turning out to be a very ugly August for this Biden presidency,"" she added.

""And the concern is, that all of this really undermines President Biden's push to really be seen as in control of these crises,"" she concluded, ""all of these crises that are affecting both the country and the world at this point.""

MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle published a tweet with the video of Alcindoor's comments, but she had to delete it later after the onslaught of online fury.

Image Source: @RuhleOnMSNBC Twitter screenshot





Many took to social media to accuse Alindoor of being unfairly biased against President Joe Biden.

""It's really interesting that when we characterized 9-11, I don't recall the immediate reaction being 'worst day in the Bush presidency,'"" tweeted Joyce White Vance, who is a legal analyst at MSNBC.

Jennifer Rubin replied, ""the press simply cannot cover ANYTHING without converting it into a partisan scorekeeping. They wouldn't dream of saying: It was the worst day for America in many years. It. Is. All. About. Horserace. Politics.""



""I am very disappointed in @Yamiche. This was one of the most ridiculous statements I've yet to hear. I'm done and done. A refresher in Journalism 101 is sorely needed,"" responded another critic on Twitter.

""This is not telling the whole story. Why is the media determined to undermine President Biden. Also why are reporters calling him Biden. It's President Biden!"" tweeted another critic.

Alcindoor fired back at the outrage by tweeting at Vance.

""It's easy to rage out on journalists on Twitter. But you're mischaracterizing me and wrong. Yesterday, WH press secretary Jen Psaki said this, 'Any day where you lose service members is — maybe the worst day of your presidency.' It's not my reaction. It's what the WH said,"" she tweeted.

Despite her explanation, Biden's defenders still went on the attack.

""You did not attribute that statement to Jen. YOU made it sound as if YOU were making that statement. Joyce said what many of us are thinking/saying. None of you ever hold Rs to the high standards you hold for Ds,"" said one critic.

Last week, Libs of TikTok highlighted a video in which a self-described ""Licensed Professional Counselor and Sex Therapist in Erie, PA,"" described pedophiles — whom she refers to as ""minor-attracted persons"" — as a ""marginalized population"" which is ""probably the most vilified population of folks in our culture.""

"On D-Day anniversary, Lincoln Project actually equates left-wing Antifa thugs with soldiers who stormed Normandy's beaches and fought Hitler, Nazis","The Lincoln Project — the notorious group of supposed conservatives who were out to get former President Donald Trump but ended up disgraced and humiliated — continues to demonstrate a stunning lack of self-awareness and basic intelligence.

What now?

Joining the legion of left-wingers who sing the praises of Antifa — the lawless, militant thugs who disguise their identities while ganging up and terrorizing those who get in their way — the Lincoln Project used the anniversary of D-Day to equate Antifa with the soldiers who stormed Normandy's beaches to fight Adolf Hitler and Nazis in World War II.

Here's the ad the Lincoln Project ran:

""The work of opposing fascism is as American as apple pie,"" the text of the group's Twitter post read. ""As we again face the rise fascism — this time on our own shores — that work must continue.""

The ad included a video whose narrator actually referred to the World War II allies as ""Antifa"" — as if any of those incredibly brave and honorable soldiers would be caught dead participating in any of Antifa's thuggish behavior.

How did folks react?

Incredibly, the tweet has received over 10,000 likes since Sunday, as well as a number of kudos-drenched comments. But not everybody is buying what the Lincoln Project is trying to sell:

""Those American soldiers loved America, loved the flag, were patriotic, brave, HATED Nazism AND communism, and would never destroy the property of innocent American citizens,"" one commenter said. ""Complete opposite of today's America-hating Antifa domestic terrorists.""

""Anyone comparing current day Antifa (Marxists) to veterans of Allied countries in the world wars needs their diplomas revoked and their heads examined,"" another user said. ""Honor the heroes and please refrain from invoking parallels to domestic terrorists within the same discussion.""

""Stop. Just stop. You don't get to befoul the greatest generation by usurping their accomplishments,"" another commenter declared. ""They were fighting you, vacuous imbecile.""

And a couplemore:

This writer's perspective

The left figured out immediately after Trump's 2016 election that they could get away with street violence and destruction in most cases. Antifa was born from that realization and has flourished in left-wing cities like Portland and Seattle, as arrested thugs are often released with no bail. During last summer's rioting, woke celebrities and other left-wingers with deep pockets financed bailouts and legal defenses for many arrested militants across the country.

The gaslighting only grew from there, as leftist politicians like President Joe Biden repeated the false claim that Antifa isn't an organization but an idea. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler (N.Y.), chairman of House Judiciary Committee, said last summer that Antifa is a ""myth."" Nothing more than the left-wing playbook talking point that a Big Lie repeated often enough starts to become true.

But we have the receipts. Antifa militants are so convinced of their righteousness that they hide their identities behind masks and goggles as they wreak havoc on the streets. They plot to kill police. They intimidate people who take video of their lawlessness and order them to put their cellphone cameras away. Again, why? Especially when their cause is so apparently righteous?

They habitually attack victims from behind — and then run away. They do their fighting in groups and typically target one individual, or at best a much smaller group to ensure their tiny victories.

Content warning: Language:

Conservative writer Andy Ngo roughed up at Portland antifa/right wing protests youtu.be

But when face to face with a larger group of opponents, they are rather easily defeated.

In short, Antifa militants are bullies — and when it comes down to it, sissies. The opposite of the Allies in World War 2.

Lindsey Graham says US will have to reinvade Afghanistan,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) left a BBC reporter stunned Monday when he said the United States will likely reinvade Afghanistan to continue the War on Terror.

During an interview with BBC reporter Stephen Sackur, Graham predicted that the new Taliban government in Afghanistan will provide a safe haven for radical Islamic terrorists who hate America and may devise plots to attack the U.S., just as they did before 9/11. He voiced skepticism of President Joe Biden's assurances that an ""over the horizon"" counterterrorism strategy using targeted drone strikes will be effective.

""They're going to give safe haven to al Qaeda who has ambitions to drive us out of the Mid East writ large and attack us because of our way of life,"" Graham told Sackur, referring to the Taliban.

""We will be going back into Afghanistan, as we went back into Iraq and Syria,"" he said.

""Hang on. You seriously think the United States will once again, in the foreseeable future, put troops back into Afghanistan?"" an incredulous Sackur asked.

""We'll have to,"" Graham replied. ""We'll have to. Because the threat will be so large. ... It will be a cauldron for radical Islamic behavior.""



He added that Biden must choose to either let the terrorists regroup under the Taliban's protection or ""hit them before they hit you.""

Last month, Biden confidently told the American people that U.S. forces will be able to fight terrorist activity in Afghanistan without placing troops on the ground.



""We conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don't have a permanent military presence,"" the president said on Aug. 16, addressing the nation on the evacuation crisis in Afghanistan. ""If necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan. We've developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed.""

But Graham criticized Biden's strategy, telling Sackur ""you cannot deal with this over-the-horizon.""

Instead, the United States should offer support to anti-Taliban resistance in the Panjshir Valley, said Graham. He predicted that over time, ""you're going to see the resistance rise"" because the Afghan people ""hate"" the Taliban.

Graham also predicted the entire country of Afghanistan would fracture as resistance fighters, ISIS, and the Taliban all go to war with each other, creating an environment that would benefit terrorist activity.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lindsey-graham-us-reinvade-afghanistan,2021-09-07
"Thirty-two years after Lockerbie bombing, US announces charges against Libyan national who allegedly created the bomb","Attorney General William Barr announced Monday that a Libyan national named Abu Agila Mohammad Masud has been charged with terrorism crimes for his alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing, which is one of the deadliest terror attacks in history. The charge, which will be one of Barr's final acts as attorney general, will bring full circle an investigation he helped lead more then three decades ago as attorney general for former President George H.W. Bush in 1991.

On Dec. 21, 1988, a bomb exploded on Pan Am Flight 103, which originated in Frankfurt, Germany, and was bound for Detroit via London and New York City. The attack killed all 243 passengers and 16 crew members, and debris from the explosion killed 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland, with the result that the incident became known as the Lockerbie bombing. It remains today the deadliest act of terrorism in U.K. history. Of the total 270 people who were killed, 190 were American citizens.

After a three-year joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local Scottish authorities, arrest warrants were issued in 1991 for two Libyan men, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah. Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who was rumored to have ordered the attack, turned the men over for trial in Scotland. Al-Megrahi was ultimately found guilty of 270 counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison, while Fhimah was found not guilty.

In 2003, Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing as part of an attempt to get sanctions lifted upon his country; however, he has denied personally ordering the attack.

The Scottish government sparked international controversy when it granted al-Megrahi compassionate release from prison due to prostate cancer, which was reportedly set to kill him within three months or less. Al-Megrahi left prison, reportedly to spend his last few weeks in Libya; however, al-Megrahi was perhaps not in quite as much extremis as advertised, as he lived in Libya until his eventual death three years later in 2012. Al-Megrahi maintained his innocence until his death.

Now, the United States believes it has found a vital third conspirator: the man who may have actually fabricated the bomb. According to the BBC, the United States learned that Masud was being held in prison in Libya and asked to review Masud's intake interview.

According to the Department of Justice's statement, Masud was one of Gaddafi's top bomb makers and traveled to Malta at Gaddafi's direction in 1988, where he constructed the bomb that would ultimately be used to destroy Pan Am Flight 103. The statement also claims that Masud was involved in the April 5, 1986, bombing of the LaBelle Discotheque in West Berlin, Germany, which resulted in the deaths of two United States servicemen.

According to the statement, ""Our message to other terrorists around the world is this – you will not succeed – if you attack Americans, no matter where you are, no matter how long it takes, you will be pursued to the ends of the earth until justice is done.""

The Department of Justice also announced that it plans to seek the extradition of Masud to the United States for trial, according to the BBC.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lockerbie-bombing-charges-filed,2020-12-21
Report: Nation’s largest defense contractor sent execs on a retreat to atone for their ‘white male privilege',"Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest and most prominent defense contractor, reportedly had white male executives undergo a diversity training program last year intended to help them atone for their ""white male privilege,"" according to filmmaker and journalist Christopher Rufo.

During the three-day program, the group of 13 senior Lockheed executives participated in a series of exercises aimed at deconstructing their ""privilege"" by awakening them to the harmful impact they have on women and minority individuals by virtue of their ethnicity and gender.

The program, conducted by a diversity-consulting firm known as White Men As Full Diversity Partners (WMFDP), began with a ""free association"" exercise during which the participants were encouraged to list connotations often associated with white men.

During that exercise, the executives listed several negative terms such as ""old,"" ""racist,"" ""privileged,"" ""anti-women,"" ""angry,"" ""Aryan Nation,"" ""KKK,"" ""founding fathers,"" ""guns,"" ""guilty,"" ""conservative,"" and ""good old boys network"" in addition to a handful of positive terms like ""fathers,"" ""educated"" and ""hard working,"" documents obtained by Rufo show.

According to the participants, these overwhelmingly negative perceptions about white men lead to assumptions that they ""are the problem,"" ""are arrogant,"" ""can't lead diversity,"" and ""don't want to give away ... or lose power.""

In his report, Rufo noted that a set of related resources used by WMFDP shows the firm espouses a troubling view of privilege. The firm's training programs reportedly assess that the ""roots of white male culture"" consists of traits — such as ""rugged individualism,"" ""a can-do attitude,"" ""hard work,"" ""operating from principles,"" and ""striving toward success"" — which may seem positive but are actually ""devastating"" to women and minorities.

In subsequent sessions of the Lockheed training, participants were encouraged to acknowledge their privilege in a series of statements, which included ""My culture teaches me to minimize the perspectives and powers of people of other races""; ""I can commit acts of terrorism, violence or crime and not have it attributed to my race""; ""My earning potential is 15%-33% higher than a woman's""; and ""My reproductive organs are not seen as the property of other men, the government, and/or even strangers because of my gender.""

Finally, participants were asked to read a series of ""I'm Tired"" statements meant to convey their ""devastating"" impact on others. The statements included ""I'm tired of you making more money than me""; ""I'm tired of people disparaging our campaigns (like Black Lives Matter)""; ""I am tired of people who assume I'm taking a white person's job, and that I should go back to Mexico""; and ""I'm tired of seeing you get offered opportunities that I don't get offered.""

Rufo noted that WMFDP has conducted other controversial diversity training programs in the past, such as with Sandia National Laboratories, a company that designs America's nuclear weapons.

During former President Donald Trump's term, he issued an executive order banning racial stereotyping, scapegoating, and discrimination in federal diversity programs. But that order was rescinded on President Joe Biden's first day in office.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lockheed-martin-white-male-privilege-training,2021-05-27
Los Angeles is trying to clear out homeless camps from city park but MS-13 claims it as their gang territory,"A Los Angeles official said that efforts to clear out a city park of homeless camps are being complicated by the MS-13 gang, which considers the park their territory.

Officials are closing MacArthur Park in hopes of driving out the homeless and renovating the 35-acre recreation area, but the vicious criminal gang is getting in the way of their outreach to homeless people, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times.

The gang regularly terrorizes residents near the park and has targeted transgender people and other LGBTQ members for threats and intimidation.

In March, a 19-year-old MS-13 gang member was charged with violently assaulting a transgender person while yelling derogatory insults. In 2019, another MS-13 gang member was charged with three counts of attempted murder over attacks on transgender people.

Officials plan to close the park on Oct. 15 and reopen it in January.

The park falls within the district of City Council member Gil Cedillo, who is overseeing the effort but has promised to avoid the missteps of other park closures in Los Angeles.

""We have tried to learn from the experiences of our colleagues in Echo Park and Venice — and from the city collectively as we figure out how to go forward,"" Cedillo said.

Cedillo's deputy district director Jose Rodriquez told the Times that the presence of the MS-13 gang was interfering with outreach efforts to place homeless people into temporary housing while the renovation is implemented.



Rodriguez said the homeless people would be housed in hotels and motels in the mid-downtown area. About 160 people have already been relocated from the park.

The project is expected to cost $1.5 million.

The park was established in 1886 as Westlake Park and was later renamed to honor World War II hero Gen. Douglas MacArthur in 1942.

French President Emmanuel Macron issues ultimatum to Muslim leaders after lethal terrorist attacks,"President Emmanuel Macron of France issued an ultimatum to Muslim leaders after several lethal terrorist attacks from Islamists in his country.

Macron addressed the French Council of the Muslim Faith on Wednesday and gave them 15 days to accept a ""charter of republican values.""

He is seeking a bill that would place restrictions meant to deter Islamic radicalization. Among those restrictions is the establishment of a National Council of Imams that would register imams. He is also seeking restrictions on homeschooling and increased punishments for those who attack officials for religious reasons.

""We must save our children from the clutches of the Islamists,"" said French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin.



Darmanin said also that the charter is clear in its rejection of Islam as a political movement.

One Texan imam responded on Twitter to the announcement of the new restrictions by calling Macron a fascist.

""Not a day goes by without France introducing a new form of ridiculousness. This is liberal fascism, and Macron must be stopped,"" tweeted Dr. Omar Suleiman.

France has been rocked by three suspected Islamist attacks in the last month, including the beheading of a teacher who had shown cartoons of Muhammad to his class. He warned students who might be offended by the cartoon that they could leave the classroom. Later he was beheaded by a Muslim immigrant.

The Muslim world responded by demanding Macron apologize for the insult to Muhammad, and when the president refused, they began a campaign to boycott French products and insult Macron.

In one protest against Macron in Pakistan, a cleric yelled, ""There's only one punishment for blasphemy,"" which was followed by the crowd chanting, ""Beheading! Beheading!""

France has the largest number of Muslims among nations in Western Europe.

Major newspaper wants to know why anyone should trust the Associated Press if it's going to claim it didn't know Hamas was in its building,"Israeli Defense Forces took down a Gaza City building that housed multiple media outlets and personnel, including Associated Press journalists, over the weekend because, according to Israel's government, the building also housed Hamas assets and terrorists.

After the attack, the AP denied having any knowledge that Hamas was in the building, despite evidence to the contrary. Now a major U.S. newspaper wants to know why anyone should trust what the AP reports.

What happened?

On Saturday, IDF forces destroyed a Gaza City high-rise that housed the AP because it was a location also known to house Hamas, the terrorist organization currently lobbing thousands of rockets into Israel. An hour before launching its strike, the Israeli military warned civilians and journalists in the building that they needed to evacuate. As a result, zero members of the media were injured.

Following the strike, the IDF said, ""After providing advance warning to civilians & time to evacuate, IDF fighter jets struck a multi-story building containing Hamas military intelligence assets. The building contained civilian media offices, which Hamas hides behind and deliberately uses as human shields.""

But members of the AP decried the IDF's move, saying the media agency, which had been in the building for 15 years, had no idea Hamas was also on the premises.

The AP reported on the incident as though it was unaware of Hamas' presence, saying, ""The Israeli military said it targeted the building because it contained assets of Hamas intelligence agencies, which it said were using media offices as 'human shields.' It did not provide evidence for the claims.""

AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said his organization was ""shocked and horrified"" by the move, claiming, ""The Israeli government says the building contained Hamas military intelligence assets. We have called on the Israeli government to put forward the evidence.""

""AP's bureau has been in this building for 15 years. We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,"" Pruitt asserted. ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu countered the AP's claims Sunday, telling CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the building was a ""perfectly legitimate target"" and that the intelligence about Hamas' location was shared with the U.S. government.

Even more damning, former AP reporter Matti Friedman reported for The Atlantic in 2014 that the AP was fully aware of Hamas' presence.

The AP staff in Gaza City would witness a rocket launch right beside their office, endangering reporters and other civilians nearby—and the AP wouldn't report it, not even in AP articles about Israeli claims that Hamas was launching rockets from residential areas. (This happened.) Hamas fighters would burst into the AP's Gaza bureau and threaten the staff—and the AP wouldn't report it. (This also happened.) Cameramen waiting outside Shifa Hospital in Gaza City would film the arrival of civilian casualties and then, at a signal from an official, turn off their cameras when wounded and dead fighters came in, helping Hamas maintain the illusion that only civilians were dying. (This too happened; the information comes from multiple sources with firsthand knowledge of these incidents.)

What's this about trusting the AP?

In response to the AP's claim of ignorance about Hamas being in their building, the New York Post asked in a staff editorial in the Tuesday issue why anyone should trust the AP's reporting.

""If it's true that AP was so unaware — and the evidence suggests it's unlikely — how can anyone trust its reporting in the region?"" the Post asked.

The paper indicated that, if the AP was unable to figure it out, its reporting abilities should be called into question. If AP did know, then its willingness to cover-up and obfuscate should lead people to question the agency's ability to deliver trustworthy news.

Citing Friedman's 2014 report, the Post said, it certainly appears the AP did know about Hamas occupying the same building and refused to reveal it.

""It seems that what AP doesn't know — and doesn't report — always favors Hamas over those the group terrorizes,"" the Post concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/major-newspaper-trust-associated-press,2021-05-18
MSNBC expert Malcolm Nance faces ridicule over bizarre claim about Chernobyl during attack on Ukraine,"MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance faced online ridicule and mockery over a bizarre claim he made about the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine amidst the Russian attack on the former Soviet republic.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian president confirmed that Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl site, where the world's worst nuclear disaster was contained in 1986. The report raised concern after higher than usual levels of radiation were detected, though they were still within safety guidelines.

When someone asked on social media, ""What does [Russian President] Putin want with Chernobyl?"" Nance had an odd response.

""It powers central North Ukraine,"" he replied.

Social media users immediately mocked the suggestion, given that the nuclear plant had been decommissioned for decades.

""What in the ever loving hell is wrong with Malcolm Nance?"" read one tweet. ""And he was in 'intelligence' for over 30 years?? Explains a lot, actually.""

""Malcolm Nance googled 'Chernobyl,' saw that it was a nuclear power plant, and then just stopped reading,"" joked another user.

""Malcolm Nance is a Russian expert & doesn't know Chernobyl is a nuclear waste land?"" asked another detractor.

""Please don't listen to him. I mean the rest of Chernobyl has been shut down since 2000, ffs. He's just a grifter,"" said another critic.

""Well, In fairness to @MalcolmNance.... If he were smart or had any credibility at all, he wouldn't be on @msnbc, now would he?"" read another tweet.

Nance later deleted the tweet, but it was documented at an online archive.

Despite Nance's odd explanation, other experts said that Chernobyl was simply in the path of one of the quickest routes to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

Nance previously outraged many when he told Americans to get over the bombing in Afghanistan during the U.S. withdrawal from that country. He later said that he tweeted before knowing about the U.S. casualties in the terror attack.

On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that the Chernobyl nuclear plant was safe and secure despite the military occupation by Putin's troops.

"Malcolm Nance claims Republicans are insurgents, Americans may have to fight neighbors.","Terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance proclaimed that Republicans have become the party of insurgency, and Americans may have to ""fight"" their neighbors. Nance made the comments during a Wednesday appearance on the ""Zerlina"" online show that is broadcast on the Peacock streaming service.

""But here in the United States – to characterize that to understand what just kind of terrorism we might be dealing with,"" Nance told host Zerlina Maxwell, ""you have to label it as white extremism because we have 30% of the population of the United States who no longer believe in the democratic norms that we established in the founding of the country. Let’s just be honest about that.""

""The January 6 uprising was an attempt to overthrow American democracy,"" Nance asserted.

Nance claimed that former President Donald Trump expected to be ""crowned as a king"" on Jan. 6, 2020.

Nance maintained, ""American democracy is not just fragile, American democracy is under direct and immediate attack by people who would see 245 years of democratic governance destroyed.""

He believed that Trump supporters want to ""transform"" the United States back into a monarchy or totalitarian government.

Lance lashed out at 60% of Americans ""are not listening or paying attention at all"" to the Jan. 6 hearings.

Nance said that he was ""reading their forums"" of domestic terrorists, and alleged that Trump supporters ""were going to try to either overthrow the government or they were going to settle in for a long-term series of destabilizing actions using a political party – the Republican party – as their political base and then use violence, and threats of violent extremism as a way to manifest change in the street.""

""This is called an insurgency,"" he continued. ""The insurrection that happened on Jan. 6, that was one event. An insurgency is a chain of events.""

The cable news pundit argued that the United States is much like toppled governments in Iraq, Libya, and Syria.

He felt that the current-day U.S. Republicans are ""closer to the beginnings of the Irish Republican Army.""

""You know Irish Republicanism – where now the Republican Party is Sinn Fein – and it’s just a matter of seeing who comes up as the original Irish Republicans in this story, and starts carrying out acts of violence to affect change,"" he avowed.

Nance proclaimed that Americans may need to fight their neighbors.

""We may have to fight them,"" he emphasized. ""They who want to kill Americans are your neighbors.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/malcolm-nance-claims-that-republicans-are-the-party-of-insurgency-declares-that-americans-may-have-to-fight-their-neighbors,2022-07-15
MSNBC analyst claims jokes about Joe Biden's Air Force One fall could inspire assassins,"MSNBC analyst Malcolm Nance claimed Friday that joking about President Joe Biden's infamous tripping incident while boarding Air Force One could encourage an assassination attempt against Biden.

What is the background?



With cameras rolling, Biden tripped three times while climbing stairs to board Air Force One on Friday. In response, the White House blamed the wind.

Of course, the incident quickly triggered internet memes and jokes.

Donald Trump Jr., son of former President Donald Trump, even posted a video that jokingly showed his father hitting a golf ball that strikes Biden in the head to trigger his stair-tripping incident.

""It wasn't the wind folks,"" Trump Jr. tweeted.

What did Nance say?

The MSNBC terrorism analyst claimed Trump Jr.'s tweet was ""dangerous"" because it could inspire bad actors to harm the president.

""Well, it's dangerous because what he does is he makes light of the potential of injury people,"" Nance alleged on Dean Obeidallah's SiriusXM radio show.

Shockingly, Nance claimed that members of firearm forums may see Trump Jr.'s video and become inspired to use their ""long-range shooting skills"" against Biden.

Look, you know one of the things that I do is I monitor right-wing extremists' internal communications. I watch their chats, I watch their telegram channels and their Parler tweets and go on the forums that they're very prevalent on.



And some of the forums that are prevalent are gun forums. And let me tell you, you want to see some seething hotbeds of violence — you know potential violence — and some of these people have long-range shooting skills. And this is the sort of thing that they would you know they would see that video and it would turn into a discussion of whether they use a .338 Lapua or whether they use .50 caliber BMG to get that shot, right?



Somehow Trump Jr.'s video invokes murder jokes, Nance went on to claim.

""That is joking about murder, and you know the thing is so long as it's not directly stating you know 'I want to do X,Y or Z to Joe Biden' they can get away with that. But the point is [Trump Jr's video] mainstreams the potential for danger,"" Nance said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/malcolm-nance-jokes-biden-fall-violence,2021-03-21
MSNBC analyst excoriated online over tweet telling Americans to get over terror attack that killed US Marines,"An MSNBC contributor faced a brutal backlash online after he downplayed a terror attack in Afghanistan that cost the lives of 11 U.S. Marines.

Malcolm Nance is an intelligence analyst for the left-wing cable news channel but he used his platform to try to quell the outrage over the horrendous suicide bomb attack at the airport in Kabul.

""20 YEARS- FYI there have been terrorist suicide bombers killing civilians nearly DAILY in Afghanistan,"" the tweet read.

""This ain't new. It's why we are leaving,"" he added with a hashtag saying ""Deal with it.""



Reports had said at least 4 U.S. Marines had been killed in the blast by the time Nance sent out his tweet, but Pentagon officials later said that 11 Marines had been killed as well as one Navy corpsman. Dozens of Afghans were killed and 143 were wounded in the bloody attack.

Many were outraged at Nance's flippant response.

""At least 4 US Marines killed and three wounded. Many more Afghans dead and wounded. F*** you,"" said Marine veteran Paul Szoldra.

""Nothing like a guy who throws out #DealWithIt within an hour of civilians and U.S. Marines getting blown up,"" responded one critic.

""You are the worst of humans,"" tweeted another.



""There were a million different ways you could have made your point, and yet you chose the one that makes you an a**hole,"" replied attorney Ari Cohn.

Nance responded to the furor by claiming that some were sending racial insults at him.

""We have lost 4 of our servicemembers. The reality is this is terrible. The cost could be greater if we don't complete this mission,"" he tweeted, adding that he was being called an N-word.

Still later he said he was going to delete the tweet.

""HERE IS WHY I'm going to delete this tweet. Today we lost 12 brave Americans & many Afghans. I deeply regret how callous it now sounds. I would never intentionally disrespect my brothers & sisters in arms. I also sincerely apologize to their families, and I pray for them,"" he tweeted in part.

He claimed that he posted before ""serious casualties"" had been reported and that he should have waited.

Malcolm Nance says he's fighting for Ukraine against Russia: 'I'm done talking ... It's time to take action',"Former MSNBC foreign policy analyst Malcom Nance revealed on Monday that he had joined the fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Nance, who heads a think tank called the Terror Asymmetrics Project, appeared on Joy Reid's show on MSNBC to explain why he joined the fight against the Russians.

“The more I saw of the war going on, the more I thought, ‘I’m done talking, all right? It’s time to take action here.' So about a month ago I joined the international legion here in Ukraine, and I am here to help this country fight, you know, what essentially is a war of extermination,"" said Nance.

""This is an existential war and Russia has brought it to these people and they are mass murdering civilians, and there are people here like me who are here to do something about it,"" he added.

Reid asked Nance if being an international troop put him in danger's way more than the Ukrainians.

“No, it doesn’t, because the war that’s being waged here is being waged against everybody,” Nance responded. ""Look, they're not going around hunting for American flag patches or to see who’s Black, who’s Asian, who’s Latino. We are a part of the Ukrainian armed forces, we are brothers and sisters with the Ukrainian army.""

Nance went on to say that the U.S. needs to provide heavy weaponry to the Ukrainians in order to take away that advantage for the Russians.

“Let me say something to the president of the United States: give them counter battery long range artillery – multiple rocket launch systems,"" Nance said. ""Something that can out-range the artillery. If you do that, you stop the attacks on civilians, because that's what they are doing with the artillery - they are mass murdering civilians.""

Nance concluded the interview by saying the Russians are trying to wipe out Democracy in Ukraine and hope it ""cascades"" into other countries.

""This battle is here. It's gonna be fought now, and we're gonna win it!"" Nance said. ""You fight, you win, and this country is already winning and that's why Russia is already shifting its strategy.""

After his appearance, MSNBC confirmed that Nance was no longer an analyst at the network.

The father — who sustained gashes across the face, ears, and tongue — was rushed to the hospital for treatment after the attack, KTTV-TV reported. But doctors were not able to save one of his eyes.

What are the details?

According to the news outlet, the incident occurred Sunday on Dan Blocker Beach when Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies responded to a call about an assault following a dispute.

Two homeless people allegedly approached a family saying they were not allowed in the area, leading to an argument between them and the father. The argument turned violent when one of the suspects, later identified as Richard Franck, pulled out a machete and began swinging at the father.

Deputies said Franck and his companion then chased the other four family members.

The two suspects were later found and arrested. Both now face charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, KTTV said. Franck is being held on $1 million bond.

What else?

The heinous crime has reportedly caused uproar in the community as L.A. County's homeless problem continues to worsen, putting members of the public in danger.

Sheriff Alex Villanueva put the county's district attorney, George Gascón, on blast Thursday, tweeting that Franck was arrested in April for pulling a knife on a peace officer, only to be released on a misdemeanor charge under the district attorney's progressive new crime measures.

""There are consequences for reducing penalties for crimes ... and the consequences are being borne right now by the public all because our D.A. doesn't want to do his job,"" Villanueva said Thursday night during a meeting with Malibu residents.



During the town hall, the sheriff added that actions need to be taken now to reduce the homeless population in the area.

""We cannot afford L.A. County to house the nation's homeless,"" he said. ""People are not entitled to pop a tent wherever they want to and claim public space for themselves.""

Anything else?

Violent homeless crime has been on the rise in progressive West Coast cities this year.

"18-year-old Florida man arrested over post showing him with rifle, handgun, tactical-style vest — and asking Siri for 'directions to the nearest school'","An 18-year-old Florida man was arrested over a social media post showing him with a rifle, handgun, and tactical-style vest along with a caption reading, “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school.""

What are the details?

After receiving a tip about the post, detectives arrested Corey Anderson at his home near Tampa on Sunday, WKMG-TV reported, adding that he was charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism.

“This type of threat is unacceptable,"" Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. ""This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter.""

Detectives determined the handgun and rifle in question are airsoft guns.

Anderson was booked into jail and released on bond, WKMG said, citing jail records.



“We will do everything within our power to apprehend, and pursue charges on those who make school-based threats,"" Chronister added in his statement. ""Protecting students is our greatest priority. We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.”

'We are getting threats'

A woman who identified herself as Anderson's mother was reached at his home and told WFLA-TV that reports in the media haven't been accurate, but she wouldn't discuss details.

She also said her family has been receiving threats.

“Beyond that there is no comment,"" she told WFLA. ""We are getting threats at this time; it’s very scary, very scary."" She added to the station that her family has hired an attorney.

Man accused of smashing up an NYC McDonald's with an ax released without bail: 'My intentions were not to hurt anyone',"The man who allegedly caused thousands of dollars in damage and terrorized several late-night patrons at a New York City McDonald's has been released without bail.

According to the criminal complaint, Michael Palacios, 31, used an ax to smash up various surfaces and two panes of glass in a Lower East Side McDonald's around 2:30 a.m. local time Friday morning.

A video of the incident, which has since gone viral, indicates that Palacios became frustrated when a woman there ""rejected"" his advances. The man who filmed the video, Uber Eats deliveryman Ruben G, told the New York Post, ""So, basically he got into an argument with a girl, and then the girl rejected him. She didn’t want to talk to him. He kept going at her.""

As Palacios continued to pester the woman, several men stood up to intervene on her behalf. The men attempted to restrain Palacios, who then turned his aggression towards them. The men then punched him in the head a few times in retaliation, though Palacios himself appeared unaffected by the assault. Once the men backed off, Palacios reached into his backpack, took out what he called a ""tomahawk,"" and began smashing a couple tables, including the one at which the unidentified woman he had targeted earlier was sitting.

He also smashed a glass partition and punched one of the men in the head. Palacios, a messenger, then retrieved his bike and rode away. Police apprehended him soon after.









""The suspect intentionally caused property damage to the establishment,"" a police spokesperson said. ""The individual was taken into custody by responding officers. [During a] search incident to a lawful arrest, an additional knife was recovered from his backpack. Victims did not report any injuries.""

Prosecutors have charged Palacios with fourth-degree criminal mischief and possession of weapons, neither of which qualify for bail in New York state, where criminal justice laws are lax.

Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin has condemned the criminal justice reform measures which released Palacios back to the street without bail.

""This guy hacked up tables and walls at a McDonald’s, swung his hatchet wildly at customers, and got released before his fries got cold,"" Zeldin quipped. ""Cashless bail in New York must be repealed ASAP!""

Palacios has since spoken with reporters to give his version of events.

""My intentions were not to hurt anyone,"" Palacios said. ""My intentions were not to put anyone in the hospital or dice anybody up.

""The reason why I pulled out the hatchet was, ‘Ok, I’m gonna get back at these guys,'"" Palacios continued. ""'I’m gonna make sure that they don’t jump me again.'""

Palacios admitted that he had been drinking earlier that evening, and that a security guard at the McDonald's wouldn't let him use the restroom.

He said he does not want to see the other men involved in the altercation charged with a crime.

""You don’t need to be in jail for a lesson,"" he said. ""I hope the fear they felt that night is enough to never assault someone again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-accused-of-smashing-up-a-nyc-mcdonald-s-with-an-ax-released-without-bail-my-intentions-were-not-to-hurt-anyone,2022-09-19
Man arrested at Loudoun County school board meeting says officials covered up his daughter's rape,"Amid heated debate over controversial transgender-affirming policies in Virginia's Loudoun County this summer, school officials concealed that a ninth-grade girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by a gender-fluid male student in a bathroom, the Daily Wire's Luke Rosiak reported.

The girl's father, Scott Smith, was arrested during a raucous June 22 school board meeting that shut down public comment from incensed parents who came to protest critical race theory and proposed transgender policies. Smith was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after he had an argument with a woman for whose daughter Smith's wife had been a Girl Scout leader.

Smith's arrest was captured on video and went viral, calling national attention to parent protests at school board meetings. The National School Board Association cited his arrest in a letter to the Biden administration requesting that the Department of Justice classify threats and intimidation from angry parents as ""domestic terrorism.""

Telling his side of the story publicly for the first time, Smith told the Daily Wire that he had been provoked by the woman, who said she did not believe his daughter, and by Loudoun County school officials who had covered up the alleged sexual assault.

The Daily Wire reported that while juvenile court records are sealed, Smith's attorney, Elizabeth Lancaster, said a boy at Stone Bridge High School was charged with two counts of forcible sodomy, one count of anal sodomy, and one count of forcible fellatio related to an incident on May 28, when Smith says his 15-year-old daughter was attacked in a school bathroom.

Smith says that the boy wore a skirt when he entered the girls' bathroom and allegedly attacked his daughter.

After the alleged attack, the administration called Smith to come to the school and told him it would handle the incident ""in-house."" When he began to make a scene, as any outraged parent would, he says the school called police officers on him and it was only after he managed to avoid getting arrested that he convinced police to escort his daughter to the hospital to have a rape kit administered.

A records request from the Daily Wire confirmed that a report titled ""Offense: Forcible Sodomy [and] Sexual Battery"" was filed matching the date and location of the alleged assault.

Later that day, the school principal sent an email to the community informing them of ""an incident in the main office"" that required a police presence. ""There was no threat to the safety of the student body,"" the principal wrote. He offered counseling services for any student who was upset by Smith's behavior but made no mention of the alleged assault.

""LCPS washed their hands of this,"" Smith told the Daily Wire, adding that the incident was only taken seriously because of the sheriff's office.

A spokeswoman for Loudoun County Public Schools said, ""Any information related to student information is confidential under state and federal laws regarding student privacy.""

According to Smith's attorney, the suspect made self-incriminating statements during an interview with prosecutors and a conviction is ""expected imminently, likely in the form of a plea deal to a charge of felony aggravated sexual battery.""

School officials never publicly acknowledged the incident even as the district debated adopting policies that would permit transgender students to use bathrooms that matched their self-declared gender identity.

During the June school board meeting, school officials told parents minutes before Smith's arrest that concerns about transgender students in bathrooms or locker rooms were a ""red herring"" and that there were no records of assaults occurring in bathrooms. They did not inform the public of the alleged assault against Smith's daughter, which was reported to police three weeks before.

Smith stood there and listened as members of the school board lectured the public about how there were no issues involving transgender students and that ""if a crime or violation of the rules were committed, that would be investigated and dealt with to the full extent of the rules or the law.""

Members of the public were permitted to speak, and while many parents voiced their opposition to critical race theory and transgender policies, other speakers who supported the transgender policies accused them of being hateful.

One woman who attended, a left-wing activist named Jackie Schworm, confronted Smith and his wife Jess, demanding to know which side they were on. Jess, a Girl Scout troop leader, had mentored Schworm's daughter as part of her troop.

The Daily Wire reports that the confrontation between Smith and Schworm, which led to Smith's arrest, unfolded as follows:

Schworm was at the June 22 school board meeting, wearing a shirt with a rainbow heart on it. As a Girl Scout troop leader, Jess had mentored Schworm's daughter. Smith and Jess said Schworm sought them out in the crowd, demanded to know which side they were on, then berated them that they were wrong. ""Jess, who is this?"" Smith asked his wife.



""I thought she was my friend,"" Jess replied.



Smith tried to tell her what happened to his daughter, he said. ""And she looks me dead in the eyes and says 'that's not what happened.'""



Schworm noticed that Smith was wearing a shirt with the name of his plumbing business on it, ""And she goes 'Oh… I'm going to ruin your business on social media,'"" he said.



""You're a bitch,"" Smith told her, video shows. A police officer monitoring the tension-filled exchange pulled on Smith's arm, he yanked it away, and soon, Smith and the officer were wrestling. Other officers pinned Smith to the ground, bloodying his lip in the process, as Smith uttered, ""I can't breathe.""



Jess cried out, in words lost in the chaos: ""My child was raped at school, and this is what happens!""



Smith was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

During an interview with the Daily Wire, Schworm made contradictory statements denying that she had an argument with Smith (an argument that was caught on video) and also made ""repeated comments"" about Smith's daughter's ""mental stability.""

She also repeatedly brought up that Smith was convicted of a crime and sentenced to 10 days in jail.

The arrest and the subsequent negative media coverage of Smith has taken an emotional toll on the family. Smith told the Daily Wire he had to install temporary fencing around his house to keep news reporters away. On social media, Smith was mocked for his physical appearance and demonized for his arrest.

Buta Biberaj, Loudoun County's progressive top prosecutor, personally appeared in court to prosecute the case against Smith. The Daily Wire noted that Biberaj was elected on a platform opposed to ""mass incarceration"" but sought to put Smith in jail for misdemeanor charges.

Meanwhile, the 15-year-old male suspect who allegedly attacked Smith's daughter has not yet been convicted and is accused of sexually assaulting another girl at a different school.



On Oct. 7, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office announced that ""a teenager from Ashburn has been charged with sexual battery and abduction of a fellow student at Broad Run High School.""

""The investigation determined on the afternoon of October 6, the 15-year-old suspect forced the victim into an empty classroom where he held her against her will and inappropriately touched her,"" police said.

The Daily Wire reported that the suspect is the same male student who allegedly assaulted Smith's daughter.

Prosecutors in Loudoun County have reportedly moved the date the suspect was expected to plead guilty to assaulting Smith's daughter from Oct. 14 to Oct. 25., so that both cases could be handled together.

The Loudoun County School Board approved the policy permitting transgender students to use whatever bathroom they wish on Aug. 11. Parents were never told about the alleged assault of Smith's daughter until the Daily Wire's report was published late Monday evening.



Editor's note: This story has been corrected to note that the Daily Wire's report was published on Monday evening, not Sunday.

"Man convicted of mosque bombing blames right-wing blogs, says he's a transgender woman and calls for leniency based on gender dysphoria","An Illinois man who was convicted of bombing a mosque said that he was transitioning into a transgender woman and that right-wing blogs and his own gender dysphoria are to blame for his actions.

Michael Hari was convicted in December 2020 of orchestrating the 2017 attack at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. Hari was the leader of an anti-government militia group called the White Rabbits. Some of those militia members testified against Hari in court.

Hari, who goes by Emily Claire Hari, is facing life in prison over the bombing but his defense attorney asked the court for leniency based on Hari's inner turmoil about his gender identity.

""She strongly desired making a full transition but knew she would be ostracized from everyone and everything she knew,"" wrote attorney Shannon Elkins in court documents cited by the Star Tribune.

""Thus, as she formed a ragtag group of freedom fighters or militia men and spoke of missions to Cuba and Venezuela, Ms. Hari secretly looked up 'sex change,' 'transgender surgery,' and 'post-op transgender' on the Internet,"" Elkins explained. ""As she purchased military fatigues for their 'missions' she also purchased dresses and female clothing for a planned trip to Bangkok, Thailand for male-to-female surgery. She was living a double life.""

While no one was hurt in the bombing, the community was traumatized by the violence and Hari was convicted of using a destructive device in a crime of violence and damaging property because of its religious character, among other charges.

Hari, who continues to deny his guilt, blames right-wing blogs and news outlets for his radicalization against Muslims.

""This degrading, anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic rhetoric and misinformation has spread throughout the United States over the past several years through social media and the internet,"" Elkins wrote.

Elkins asked the court to deny the terrorism enhancement requested by federal prosecutors and instead sought a 30-year prison sentence, the mandatory minimum allowed for the charges.

Hari had been convicted previously for kidnapping his daughters in a custody dispute and taking them to Belize in Central America.

Hari will be sentenced on Sept. 13.

Man with loaded AK-47 arrested outside home of Iranian-American journalist known for criticizing the Iranian government and the hijab,"A man with a loaded AK-47 in his vehicle was arrested after the FBI says he ""behaved suspiciously"" outside the New York City home of Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-American journalist internationally known for her criticism of the Iranian government.

According to reports, Khalid Mehdiyev of Yonkers was recently arrested after he was supposedly seen peering into the windows of Alinejad's Brooklyn home and attempting to open the door. Mehdiyev's gray Subaru SUV with Illinois plates was likewise seen parked for hours in front of her home over the course of two days last week. Mehdiyev had also been issued a parking ticket in the area on July 23.

Mehdiyev was soon afterwards arrested after he failed to stop at a stop sign. He was also supposedly driving with a suspended license. When members of NYPD searched his vehicle, they found a suitcase containing a Norinco AK-47-style rifle with a magazine and a round in the chamber. He also had $1,100 in cash and license plates from other states besides Illinois.

Authorities said that, when questioned, Mehdiyev initially denied knowing that there was a gun in the suitcase and that he had insisted that he was in the area looking for a room to rent. He then supposedly changed his story, admitted that he owned the gun, said he was in the area ""looking for someone,"" and then asked to speak to a lawyer.

Alinejad, 45, was not specifically named in the criminal complaint filed in federal court. However, she tweeted out a video taken from a CCTV camera demonstrating that Mehdiyev had been on her front porch.

""These are the scary scenes capturing a man who tried to enter my house in New York with a loaded gun to kill me,"" Alinejad tweeted along with the video. ""Last year the FBI stopped the Islamic Republic from kidnapping me. My crime is giving voice to voiceless people. The US administration must be tough on terror.""

Alinejad is referring to allegations made last year by the U.S. Justice Department that the Iranian regime had orchestrated an attempt to kidnap Alinejad and transport her back to Iran. Iranian officials have supposedly targeted Alinejad, who has dual Iranian and American citizenship, because she criticizes many Iranian policies, especially regarding women wearing the hijab.

""While the international media is paying attention to my assassination plot in the US, let’s remember these women who have been forced to give false confessions against themselves on Iranian state TV,"" Alinejad tweeted on Sunday. ""These acts of terror won’t stop our fight against forced hijab.""

Manchin gives Democrats a reality check on gun control,"Democratic lawmakers are calling for new gun control legislation in the wake of the racially motivated massacre in Buffalo, New York, last weekend, but once again Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is standing in the way of the most fervent progressives.

President Joe Biden went to Buffalo on Tuesday and visited with the families of 10 people who were killed and three others wounded by a white supremacist gunman. In a speech, the president denounced the attack as an act of ""domestic terrorism,"" condemned white supremacy, and renewed calls for a federal ban on so-called ""assault weapons.""

“There are certain things we can do. We can keep assault weapons off our streets. We’ve done it before. I did it when I passed the crime bill,” Biden said, referring to the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a 10-year assault weapons ban.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also speaking in Buffalo Tuesday, vowed that Democrats would ""work towards finally ridding our streets of weapons of war.""



But Manchin, speaking to reporters shortly before Biden spoke, gave his realistic assessment that in the 50-50 Senate, the only gun control legislation that has a chance of passing is a bipartisan compromise on background checks that previously failed. That bill, named for Manchin and his chief co-sponsor, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), would expand federal background check requirements to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows and over the internet.

“I support the Manchin-Toomey, I’ve always done that,” Manchin told reporters, according to The Hill. “The Manchin-Toomey is the one. I think if you can’t get that one, then why try to do something just for basically voting for the sake of voting?”

While some Democrats want action on a universal background check bill that passed the House in March last year, the West Virginia moderate has previously said that bill goes too far because it would extend to private transactions, such as those between neighbors, hunting buddies, or even family. The Manchin-Toomey bill exempted those transactions.

“The best piece of legislation that we’ve ever had, that most people agreed on, was the Manchin-Toomey. We didn’t infringe on anyone’s rights privately,” Manchin said.

But if Manchin-Toomey was the bill ""that most people agreed on,"" that wouldn't mean much — the bill failed in 2013, coming six votes short of the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster at a time when a stronger Democratic majority held the Senate. Only two Republicans voted for it, Toomey and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).

It is far more unlikely that 10 Republicans would cross the aisle to vote for any sort of gun control bill this year, especially before the midterm elections in November.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manchin-gives-democrats-a-reality-check-on-gun-control,2022-05-18
Marco Rubio warns that Raphael Warnock is 'unabashed Marxist sympathizer who would destroy the American Dream',"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) delivered a warning to Georgians about Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock ahead of the upcoming runoff elections on Jan. 5. Rubio urged people to vote for Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler because Warnock's ""policies do not represent Georgia values.""

""Democrat Raphael Warnock is the most radically liberal candidate anywhere in the country,"" Rubio wrote in a Fox News opinion piece. ""He would vote in lock-step with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to eliminate the Senate filibuster, pack the U.S. Supreme Court, raise taxes on families and small businesses by trillions of dollars, decimate families and farmers with the Green New Deal, socialize your health care, shut down the economy, and weaponize technology companies to silence dissent.""

Rubio labeled Warnock as ""an unabashed Marxist sympathizer who would destroy the American Dream.""

""He has repeatedly praised Marxism and socialism, and slammed capitalism, writing that 'the Marxist critique has much to teach the black church' and that the Black middle-class should pay more attention to the 'hard questions about the distribution of wealth,'"" the senator wrote.

Earlier this month, Loeffler's campaign released a compilation of Warnock's writings and associations that appear to flirt with Marxism and socialism.

Like Rubio, Loeffler has made comments about Warnock's coziness with Marxism, and in November, she said that her Democratic challenger has ""a Marxist ideology.""

During an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Wednesday night, Loeffler said she and fellow Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue ""are the firewall to socialism in this country.""

""If we don't vote, we could see the election of America's first Marxist senator in this country, right here in Georgia. And that's why we're the firewall,"" Loeffler said of Warnock if he is elected.



""My opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, is a socialist,"" Loeffler said during the debate between the candidates earlier this month. Loeffler challenged Warnock to ""renounce socialism and Marxism.""



Warnock refused to condemn socialism and Marxism, and defended his politics by replying, ""I believe in the free enterprise system.""

Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott called Warnock a ""radical's radical,"" and questioned the Democratic candidate's comments about Cuba's former Marxist-Leninist dictator Fidel Castro. When Castro died in 2016, Warnock said, ""We remember Fidel Castro, whose legacy is complex. Don't let anybody tell you a simple story.""

Scott slammed Warnock's defense of Castro, ""Murder isn't complex. Exporting terrorism across Latin America isn't complex. Denying his people basic human rights isn't complex. This shouldn't be hard.""

In his article, Rubio concluded that the country does not need ""someone like Raphael Warnock who espouses Marxism and has spent his life siding with brutal dictators.""

Loeffler and Warnock will face off in a runoff election, as will incumbent Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff. The Georgia races will determine which party controls the Senate next year. The Republicans hold a 50-48 advantage, but the chamber would be split if Warnock and Ossoff win, allowing the vice president to break any ties.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marco-rubio-raphael-warnock-marxist,2020-12-18
Commanders reportedly ordered Marines to clean up anti-Taliban graffiti before leaving Kabul airport: 'Slap in the face',"Before finally leaving the Kabul airport in the wake of the chaos created by President Joe Biden's mishandled withdrawal from Afghanistan, U.S. Marines were given an important task: Destroy things that might be useful to the Taliban, the Washington Post reported this week. A job they were apparently happy to do.

They were also reportedly given a less-than-great task: Clean up graffiti at the Kabul airport that was insulting to the Taliban, as well as pick up trash.

This, according to the Post, was seen as a ""slap in the face"" to the Marines.

What happened?

In the days leading up to the final troops on the ground getting aboard aircraft and leaving the South Asian country, where the U.S. had been at war for nearly two decades following the Sept. 11 terror attacks, a suicide bomber killed 13 American service members and nearly 200 Afghans.

U.S. Marines were the ones who, after the blast, the Post reported, ""picked through the carnage to recover equipment and bloody uniforms — and prevent militants from claiming a trophy.""

As Biden's plan ramped up to get everyone out of Afghanistan — minus hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans and tens of thousands of U.S. allies — so did the many last-minute tasks for U.S. Marines at the Kabul airport. Some of them they took pleasure in.

""Troops were directed to destroy equipment that the United States planned to leave behind — a form of catharsis after the bombing,"" the Post said. ""They took sledgehammers to electronics, smashed windows and stripped armored vehicles to keep the Taliban from using them.""

Troops also spray-painted obscene messages for the Taliban on walls at the airport. On Sept. 1, Task & Purpose posted some images of some of the ""art"" that had made its way to social media — but has since been deleted.

One photo reportedly showed ""Marines with the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, and 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment standing in front of spray painted messages to the Islamic State group (ISIS) and the Taliban. They were very direct: 'F*** ISIS. AFG 2021,"" Task & Purpose said.

Another photo showed a Marine in front of a graffitied wall with the message, ""F*** ISIS + Taliban,"" featuring a crude drawing of a penis.

Content warning: crude imagery

But American commanders were not about to let the Taliban-taunting graffiti or the trash at the airport stay, the Post reported, over concern that they could somehow impact flights the Taliban were allowing out of the region.

Though it is unclear who specifically painted the messages, the higher-ups ordered Marines to clean up the trash and graffiti mess before leaving.

""My boys had to go ... pick up every last piece of ... trash for who? The Taliban?"" one Marine told the Post. ""It was a slap in the face to us.""

Ultimately, the Marines collected all the trash and painted over the messages to the Taliban.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marines-anti-taliban-graffiti-kabul-airport,2021-09-30
"CNN reporter attempts to fact-check conservative colleague, but it goes horribly wrong: 'Got jack to say'","Mary Katharine Ham, one of the few conservative commentators at CNN, blasted a top CNN reporter Friday after he attempted to fact-check her criticism that the media underreported on the 2017 attempted assassination of Republican congressmen.

What is the background?

The focus of Ham's criticism lay on the substantial attention the media have devoted to the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots at the United States Capitol as opposed to the 2017 shooting.

In fact, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) highlighted the apparent disparity of attention given to the riots over the left-wing political activist who targeted Republican Congress members practicing for a charity baseball game in 2017. That shooting critically wounded Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was House Majority Whip at the time, and left three others injured by gunfire.

The perpetrator was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Last year, the FBI classified him as a domestic terrorist.

What happened?

Responding to a New York Times reporter who downplayed DeSantis' remarks, Ham explained that she lives near the baseball field where the attempted assassination of GOP lawmakers occurred and in ""under 48 hours, the news vans were gone.""

""I was on TV, live from the baseball field where they played the game a day later, after almost being canceled by mass murder, but my topic was 'Mike Pence reportedly hired a lawyer,'"" Ham explained.

She added that her observation does not downplay covering the anniversary of Jan. 6, but noted that ""Scalise's return to Congress was very sparsely covered, and the anniversary was barely mentioned.""

In response, CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski fact-checked Ham.

""It looks you discussed the baseball game?"" he responded, posting a screenshot photo of Ham.

Ham quickly responded to her CNN colleague. She explained that the segment he posted was not the one she was referring to and highlighted a larger problem with Kaczynski's attempted fact-check. Where was his criticism of Chris Cuomo and Jeffrey Toobin?

""Hi, Andrew. Yes, this is within 24-48 hrs that this was a story. This segment was based on the galactically stupid Sanford contention that it was *Trump’s rhetoric* that caused it, bc of course. Pointed out Nats Park hit bc it was overlooking the game & yet not focused on this,"" Ham began.

""Do you need the rest of my itinerary from that day and the day after, which again, were basically the only days this was a national story, which was my point?"" she added. ""Got jack to say about Cuomo and Toobin, but gotta fact-check me when he’s got nothing.""

Regarding Cuomo and Toobin, Ham continued, ""One jacked off in front of female colleagues and one violated every conflict of interest rule in journalism, lied about it, and got fired, but I’m the issue bc I think the Congressional baseball shooting was covered too lightly and taxes are too high. Sure, dude.""

In other comments, Ham explained how the media downplayed the political motivations of the perpetrator who opened fire on Republican lawmakers by contrasting the media's focus on the perpetrator of the 2011 shooting that critically wounded then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).

""Media incredibly made Giffords’ schizophrenic shooter w no political motive into an indictment of [Sarah] Palin/right while a Bernie bro’s motives trying to murder a Congressional delegation were apolitical/ignored,"" Ham said.

"Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announces investigation into Baltimore City Attorney Marilyn Mosby's office amid crime wave, threatens to withhold funding","Amid a recent string of violent crime, including strings of high profile homicides that rocked the city over the last two weeks, Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan made a series of announcements today regarding his office's efforts to bring crime under control in the beleaguered city. Among other measures, Hogan promised an investigation into the office of controversial Baltimore City Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who made national news earlier this year when she announced that her office would no longer prosecute ""low-level"" crimes like prostitution and drug possession. Mosby's stated theory, when announcing the new policy, was that, ""the data suggest there is no public safety value in prosecuting low-level offenses.""

In practice, it has not worked out that way. A number of neighborhoods in Baltimore have seen severe deterioration in their quality of life since Mosby's edict, leading a group of over 40 businesses to threaten to withhold taxes until crime prevention improved. In addition to quality of lifeissues, violent crime is back on the rise in Baltimore; for the seventh straight year, homicides in the city have surpassed a total of 300. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the city's creation of ""no shoot zones"" has not actually succeeded in creating areas where shootings do not occur.

In a Tuesday press conference, Governor Hogan stated, ""People are being shot nearly every single day in Baltimore City, and we all have an obligation to do something about it right now. With all of the actions we have announced today, I want those families and all the victims of this violence to know that we will not stop pursuing those criminals who are terrorizing our community, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to make these neighborhoods safer and to get these violent shooters off the streets.""

Hogan took particular aim at Mosby's office, and in a letter sent to Mosby, demanded an accounting of her office's use of state crime prevention funds, including specifically an accounting of ""The number of cases your office has chosen not to prosecute, including a breakdown of the reasons for non-prosecution,"" as well as ""The number of cases plead down to lesser charges, including plea agreements reached that are less than mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines."" The Governor's office threatened that ""all funding for your office [will be placed] under evaluation pending the fulfilment of this request and review of the data produced.""

Additionally, Governor Hogan announced that it was fast-tracking and expanding its neighborhood safety grants program, which would provide ""hardware upgrades, lighting, cameras, and increased security services for community organizations and business districts,"" including ""places of worship and vulnerable communities."" Hogan also promised to reintroduce crime legislation during an upcoming December special session of the Maryland legislature.

In response, Mosby lashed out at Hogan, calling his remarks a political stunt and defending her office's prosecution of violent crime. ""Quite candidly, he's more concerned with pointing the finger at everyone else, as opposed to actually leading and delivering for a city that is the heartbeat of this state,"" Mosby said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-announces-investigation-into-baltimore-city-attorney-marilyn-mosby-s-office-amid-crime-wave-threatens-to-withhold-funding,2021-11-24
"Mass murder in California leaves at least 10 dead, numerous others injured — suspect remains at large","Gunfire erupted at a ballroom dance club in Monterey Park, California on Saturday night, terrorizing a Lunar New Year festival and leaving at least 10 people dead, according to multiple reports.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has thus far confirmed that 10 people were pronounced dead at the scene, and an additional 10 were taken to the hospital with injuries of varying severity.

The suspect escaped the scene and is still at large as of the time of the publication of this article. Thus far, authorities have only indicated that the suspect is male, and have not provided any other physical description.

The shooting occurred in a predominantly Asian community, leading many to speculate that this may have been a racially-driven crime, but police thus far have cautioned the public that there simply is not enough information available to come to any conclusions on that front. ""We will look at every angle as far as whether it's a hate crime or not. It's just too early in the investigation to know,"" said Captain Andrew Meyer of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Meyer added that people were ""pouring out of the location screaming"" when officers arrived at the scene around 10:30pm local time. Meyer also said that there was no information on the kind of gun used by the shooter, or any possible motive. He indicated that police were looking into whether the shooting was connected to another incident in Alhambra to see if they were possibly related. No injuries were reported in that incident.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre indicated on Twitter that President Biden has been briefed on the situation and has offered the full resources and assistance of the FBI with the investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mass-murder-in-california-leaves-at-least-10-dead-numerous-others-injured-suspect-remains-at-large,2023-01-22
"Mass shooting in Copenhagen, despite strict Danish gun control laws","An unidentified 22-year-old suspect has been arrested and admitted to a psychiatric facility after he allegedly fired off several rounds of a gun at a shopping mall in Copenhagen, Denmark, reportedly killing three and wounding seven others.

The type of gun used in the attack has not yet been released.

Reports say that the shooter — whose name police say has been sealed by a Danish court, but who has been described as an ""ethnic Dane"" — likely suffers from severe mental illness. He allegedly posted a video to Twitter recently in which he rants about the ineffectiveness of the drugs prescribed for mental illness.

According to Newsweek, ""The man had posted chilling videos on social media on Saturday, the day before the attack, in which he posed with a handgun and rifle and pressed their muzzles against his head and into his mouth. He also uploaded several playlists to YouTube, with the titles 'Killer Music' and 'Last Thing to Listen To,' writing a caption underneath reading: 'Quetiapine does not work.'""

Whatever the cause, the man began firing at Field's shopping mall on Sunday afternoon at approximately 5:35 p.m. local time. No other suspects are believed to have been involved in the shooting, and authorities do not believe the suspect was motivated by terrorism.

Some media outlets seem to have expressed surprise at the shooting, largely because Denmark has strict gun control laws.

MSN claims that ""Gun violence is rare in Denmark, where civilians are not allowed to own fully-automatic firearms and semi-automatic weapons and handguns are only allowed with special authorization. Danish citizens wishing to be licensed gun owners are required to demonstrate a genuine reason to possess a firearm, such as for collection or hunting. They also must be at least 18 years old and have to pass a background check that includes a criminal and mental health records check.""

Newsweek adds that ""Denmark has restrictive gun laws that are regulated by the Ministry of Justice and the European Commission, according to Gun Policy, an organization focused on gun control and violence.""

Two 17-year-old Danish nationals, one male and one female, and one 47-year-old Danish resident with Russian citizenship were killed in the attack. Seven more were wounded by the shooting, and twenty people were injured slightly during the evacuation process. The names of all victims have been banned by a Danish court. The suspect will remain in custody at the psychiatric facility until at least July 28. He faces three counts of manslaughter and seven counts of attempted murder.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mass-shooting-in-copenhagen-despite-strict-danish-gun-control-laws,2022-07-04
Pregnant widow of slain Marine left her meeting with Biden distraught after he showed 'total disregard' for her husband: Report,"President Joe Biden arrived at Dover Air Force Base on Sunday with the intention of paying his respects to the 13 U.S. service members killed in last week's terror attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. But according to at least one family, the president's attendance at the solemn ceremony was anything but respectful.

During the ""dignified transfers,"" as they have come to be known, Biden met privately with family members of the fallen. The Washington Post reported that during the meetings, some expressed anger at the president, holding him responsible for the bungled military withdrawal that led to their deaths.

The family of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, in particular, found it difficult to embrace Biden after Rylee's tragic death. The 20-year-old was a husband and expecting father — his young wife Jiennah only weeks away from giving birth to their first child.

Biden could have consoled them in their grief. Yet he amplified their pain by reportedly offering only a ""scripted and shallow"" response to their loss. Here's more from the post:

One of McCollum's sisters, Roice, said she and her sister and her father joined McCollum's wife, Jiennah McCollum, on the trip. But when it came time to meet with the president, they left the room, because she said they did not want to speak with the man they held responsible for McCollum's death.



Only Jiennah, who is expecting the couple's child next month, stayed. But she left disappointed, Roice said. The president brought up his son, Beau, according to her account, describing his son's military service and subsequent death from cancer. It struck the family as scripted and shallow, a conversation that lasted only a couple of minutes in ""total disregard to the loss of our Marine,"" Roice said.



""You can't f--- up as bad as he did and say you're sorry,"" Roice said of the president. ""This did not need to happen, and every life is on his hands.""



The White House declined to comment on the private conversations Biden had with families.

The McCollums' sentiment was reportedly shared by some of the other Gold Star families. Townhall reporter Julio Rosas claimed that sources close to some of the families told him that ""more than one of the families did not even want Biden to attend the dignified transfers.""

Paula Knauss, the mother of Sgt. Ryan Knauss, who was also killed in the attack, lamented Biden's failure of leadership in conversation with the Post.

""You can't have a hasty withdrawal after 20 years of war,"" she said. ""Because it's beyond me. It disgraces the name of all those who have fought in the past and who are now on ground, foreign ground fighting right now, my son's [82nd] Airborne is still there, and they deserve to be protected.""

Prior to the ceremonies, another family member of a fallen Marine also expressed his anger with the president.

Steve Nikoui, the father of Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui, when reached by the Daily Beast, said, ""Biden turned his back on him. That's it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mccollum-slain-marine-biden-meeting,2021-08-30
"McConnell rejects Capitol riot commission: Any major review should include Black Lives Matter violence, too","Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) appeared on Wednesday to dash Democrats' hopes of launching a broad investigatory review of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, blasting the move as ""partisan by design.""

Last week, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans to form an ""independent 9/11-type commission"" to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Capitol riot, which Democrats have labeled an attempted insurrection and a domestic terror attack spurred on by former President Trump.

But, according to Politico, McConnell has rejected a draft version of the proposed commission, articulating that any large-scale review must also take into account the steady wave of Black Lives Matter riots that ravaged and burned cities across the country last year following the death of George Floyd in late May.

The proposal reportedly would have also given Democrats a 7-4 majority on the panel.

""If Congress is going to attempt some broader analysis of toxic political violence across this country, then in that case, we cannot have artificial cherry-picking of which terrible behavior does and does not deserve scrutiny,"" McConnell said.

Instead, McConnell suggested he may be open to a much smaller-scale review focused on the security failures that allowed a mob of Trump supporters to breach the Capitol while both chambers of Congress were in session.

""We could do something narrow that looks at the Capitol, or we could potentially do something broader to analyze the full scope of the political violence problem in this country,"" he added. ""We cannot land at some artificial, politicized halfway point.""

In a letter to Democratic colleagues last week, Pelosi insisted that the commission was necessary in order to protect ""the security of our members"" of Congress and the ""security of our country.""

The commission, according to Pelosi, would ""investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex ... and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power, including facts and causes relating to the preparedness and response of the United States Capitol Police and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement in the National Capitol Region.""

On the same day that Pelosi sent the letter, she also received one from four leading House Republicans, criticizing her for dodging questions regarding her own ""responsibility for the security"" of the Capitol on Jan. 6, such as why requests for National Guard assistance ahead of the planned Trump rally that day were denied.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mcconnell-rejects-capitol-riot-commission,2021-02-24
"Megyn Kelly savagely celebrates ouster of 'the most racist person in all of television': 'Joy, oh, joy!'","Megyn Kelly savagely celebrated MSNBC's decision to fire host Tiffany Cross, whom Kelly described as ""the most racist person in all of television.""

What is the background?

Last week, MSNBC abruptly parted ways with Cross, who hosted a weekend TV show on the network.

A source told Fox News that MSNBC executives quickly canned Cross upon the conclusion of her two-year contract over ""repeated bad behavior on and off-air"" and ""bad judgement."" Cross repeatedly generated headlines for controversial segments that focused on racism and for tarnishing anyone not aligned with her progressive agenda.

Variety similarly reported that Cross' relationship with executives had become ""frayed.""

What did Kelly say?

On her SiriusXM radio show on Friday, Kelly proclaimed, ""Joy, oh, joy! Tiffany Cross is gone!""

""I tip my hat to MSNBC and NBC for doing the right thing, because she was — she was — the most racist person in television,"" Kelly declared.

Megyn Kelly Says Farewell to Tiffany Cross, Fired by MSNBC, with Dana Loesch www.youtube.com

Kelly then provided examples of Cross' outrageous opinions, explaining:

""She was upset when Tua [Tagovailoa] got hurt, the concussion thing, which I was upset with, too. But she took it racial. She was like, 'All these white owners making these black players—' Tua’s not black, and the coach was not white.""

""She blasted Republican members of Congress as white supremacists a day after the Wisconsin jury acquitted [Kyle] Rittenhouse. Somehow, that made the Republican members of Congress white supremacists.""

""She called Rittenhouse a 'little murderous white supremacist.'""

""She said we should all be concerned about white replacement, 'It is, after all, a very threat to our survival here — white replacement can strangle culture.' I thought we weren't suppose to be talking about 'replacement theories'? I thought that was racist.""

After Kelly read one more example of Cross' commentary — in which she suggested that ""white women"" who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots engaged in behavior close to ""domestic terrorism"" — conservative radio host Dana Loesch tore into Cross.

""Her whole show, if memory serves, the content is essentially a YouTube comment section,"" Loesch said. ""That's her whole content: just one angry YouTube comment section diatribe.

""I can see why, Megyn, it didn’t offer much value to the network,"" Loesch mocked.

Anything else?

After Kelly criticized Cross last month — calling her a ""dumba**"" — Cross responded by telling Kelly to ""move on with your life"" because she ""is not going to claw her way back to social relevance on my show.""

"Two MLB players died in World War II, Memorial Day tribute","Today is Memorial Day, a time to reflect on those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country as well as for our rights and freedoms. There have been at least 1.1 million Americans who have died in combat since 1775. Every one of those lives was meaningful and should be remembered on Memorial Day. There were two American heroes in World War II who had the distinction of bravely dying for their country and were also professional baseball players.

More than 500 professional baseball players served in the military during World War II, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans. Hall of Fame players such as Ted Williams, Stan Musial, Hank Greenberg, Bob Feller, and Joe DiMaggio garnered the most attention and praise for serving in the military during World War II. However, most people are not familiar with Elmer Gedeon and Harry O'Neill, the only two MLB players who died in combat during World War II.

Gedeon, a Cleveland native, was a three-sport star at the University of Michigan, playing football, track, and baseball. After college, Gedeon was signed by the Washington Senators as an outfielder. He played in five games for the Senators in 1939 and had 17 plate appearances, with three singles, one run scored, and an RBI. Gedeon was sent down to the minors in 1940, where his performance reportedly impressed Senators manager Bucky Harris, and it looked like he would return to the big leagues.

After the baseball season, Gedeon became the assistant coach for the University of Michigan football team in the fall of 1940 and hoped to play for the Senators in the spring. Gedeon was drafted into the U.S. military in January 1941, nearly a year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

Gedeon was assigned to the Army Air Corps, and he was training in North Carolina. In August 1942, Gedeon was flying on a B-25 bomber that crashed during a training exercise. The military plane burst into flames during the crash landing. Despite being seriously injured and suffering three broken ribs, Gedeon freed himself from the wreckage and crawled out. Gedeon then went back into the fiery airplane to try to rescue Cpl. John Rarrat.

Rarrat died in the plane crash, as did two other military members.

""Gedeon spent 12 weeks in a hospital in Raleigh, recovering from severe burns, some of which required skin grafts,"" the New York Times reported. ""Gedeon lost 50 pounds, received a medal and returned to action.""

Gedeon believed he had had his brush with death and would be safe going into World War II, telling his cousin, ""I had my accident. It's going to be good flying from now on.""

He was a captain with the 394th Bomb Group of the United States Army Air Force, known as the ""Bridge Busters"" since their targets were ""primarily road and rail bridges as well as gun emplacements, airfields, railway installations, fuel dumps and ammunition dumps.""

From the NYT:

Gedeon usually sat at a desk, involved in planning missions in Europe. But he wanted to maintain his flying proficiency, so at dusk on April 20, 1944, Gedeon took off from Boreham, an airfield in Chesterfield, England, along with 35 other B-26 bombers, which were nicknamed Marauders.



Their destination was a construction site in the woods outside Esquerdes, France, near the northern coast. The target was a launch site for the V-1 rocket, the first of Adolf Hitler's terror weapons that he used against England. The mission was part of Operation Crossbow, a concerted effort to attack the V-1 bases.



At about 7:30 p.m., after Gedeon's plane had dropped its bombs — most were later determined to have missed the target — antiaircraft fire ripped through its undercarriage. The B-26 burst into flames.

The only crewman to escape was Gedeon's co-pilot, James Taaffe. He was captured on the ground and imprisoned. He was told that his six crew mates, including Gedeon, 27, had died.

Gedeon was given a proper burial at Arlington National Cemetery.

Harry O'Neill attended Gettysburg College, where he was also a three-sport star. O'Neill, a Philadelphia native, led his school to league championships in basketball, football, and baseball. After graduating college, he signed with his hometown Athletics as a catcher.



O'Neill was the team's third-string catcher and played in one game during the 1939 season. ""During the ninth inning of a July 23, 16-3 drubbing at the Detroit Tigers' hands, [Earle] Mack inserted O'Neill into the lineup as a defensive replacement, but he never got a turn at bat,"" according to the Herald Courier. O'Neill spent the next two seasons in the minors.

After the Pearl Harbor attack, O'Neill enlisted in the Marines. Following training, O'Neill was deployed to the Pacific theater of WWII. In July 1944, he suffered a debilitating injury from shrapnel that kept him out of commission for three weeks, and he was awarded the Purple Heart.

In February 1945, only months before the end of World War II, O'Neill and his 25th Marine Regiment landed on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima.

""Eleven days after Americans raised a flag atop Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, O'Neill, 27, and fellow Marines engaged in a daylong battle in the bloody Turkey Knob section of Iwo Jima,"" according to the New York Times. ""In the early evening of March 6, 1945, O'Neill stood in a deep crater that seemed to provide some cover.""

Standing next to O'Neill was Pfc. James Kontes.



""We were standing shoulder to shoulder,"" Kontes told the Bucks County Courier Times in 2009. ""Harry was on my left. We were looking out at the terrain in front of us. And this shot came out of nowhere.""

O'Neill was shot and killed by a sniper.

In July 1947, O'Neill's remains were returned to the U.S. and buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.

This and every Memorial Day, remember to pay your respects to our fallen heroes and honor these patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice.

Michael Flynn's relatives sue CNN in $75 million lawsuit,"The brother and sister-in-law of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn are suing CNN for $75 million over a report that the couple were believers of the QAnon conspiracy theory.

John ""Jack"" Flynn, brother of retired Gen. Michael Flynn, and his wife Leslie filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Flynns allege that the cable network falsely accused them of being supporters of the QAnon movement.

John and Leslie Flynn claim that a CNN segment dedicated to exposing the QAnon movement featured footage of the couple at a Fourth of July barbecue in Rhode Island. Video shows the couple joining Michael Flynn and the group saying, ""Where we go one, we go all."" The phrase has been a rallying cry of QAnon, but the Flynns contend that it has nothing to do with the conspiracy theory group.

""The lawsuit disputes that the 'WWG1WGA' slogan, which is routinely used on QAnon merchandise and by adherents on social media and at rallies, is linked to the conspiracy theory,"" Newsweek reports. ""Flynn's phrase, it said, was inspired by an inscription 'engraved on a bell on one of President John F. Kennedy's sailboats, acknowledging the unity of mankind.'""

The Flynns claim that CNN selectively edited the video clip that originally aired on Feb. 4, and did not include the moment directly after when the family exclaimed, ""God Bless America."" The lawsuit alleges that the CNN clip was ""fraudulently making it appear and insinuating that [Jack and Leslie] pledged an oath of allegiance to QAnon.""

""Plaintiffs are not followers or supporters of any extremist or terrorist groups, including QAnon,"" the lawsuit states, according to The Hill. ""CNN falsely attributed to Plaintiffs associations that never existed, actions Plaintiffs never took, including an oath of allegiance to QAnon, and views Plaintiffs never held.""



""CNN's false attributions exposed Plaintiffs to public scorn, ridicule and contempt, and lowered their esteem in the community, causing insult, embarrassment, humiliation and substantial injury to Plaintiffs' reputations,"" the suit stated.

""CNN falsely accused Plaintiffs of being 'followers' and supporters of the 'dangerous,' 'violent,' 'racist,' 'extremist,' 'insurrectionist,' 'domestic terrorism movement – QAnon,"" the suit alleged, according to Just The News.

The lawsuit alleges that after ""the January 6 storming of the Capitol, a chorus of left-wing media outlets began to spread false narratives about QAnon, including that Jack Flynn's brother, retired Lieutenant General Michael T. Flynn ('General Flynn'), was the 'founder' of QAnon.""



The Flynns' lawyer, Steven S. Biss, accused CNN of being ""a Democratic Party trumpet that foreswore its role as an impartial reporter of facts and joined with political partisans in an overall plan or scheme to discredit the character of the Flynns. For that, it must be held accountable by a jury.""

Leslie Flynn released a statement that said, ""Enough is enough with CNN, and the lies about our family. We cannot sit by any longer and allow CNN to disparage our good name. This has got to stop.""

The lawsuit claims that the CNN segment has caused the Flynns to suffer from ""public scorn, ridicule and contempt, and lowered their esteem in the community, causing insult, embarrassment, humiliation and substantial injury to Plaintiffs' reputations.""

When asked about the lawsuit, a CNN spokesperson told The Hill, ""As a policy we don't comment on litigation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-flynn-relatives-sue-cnn-qanon,2021-03-27
Top GOP lawmaker discloses 'something more' to hostage crisis at Texas synagogue; investigation goes global,"A top House Republican revealed Sunday the investigation into the man who took four people hostage at a Texas synagogue on Saturday has gone international.

What are the details?

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN host Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" there is ""something more"" to the case than a lone actor.

In fact, McCaul disclosed that the FBI's investigation now extends to London and Tel Aviv.

""I know the FBI has now fanned their investigation out to London and Tel Aviv. So this has now turned into an international investigation. So there’s something more here,"" McCaul said. ""And the fact he’s calling for Lady al Qaeda’s release from prison has been, as you said, in the jihadist world kind of a cause celebre.""

""And so I think we’re going to find out a lot more in the next 24, 48 hours. He is British. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s Pakistani, just like Siddiqui. And we need to get to the bottom of this,"" he added. ""We haven’t seen one of these radicalized attacks in a few years now, and it is disturbing to see it raise its ugly head again.""

Law enforcement identified 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram as the perpetrator, and said he traveled to the U.S. approximately five weeks ago. The motive has not been officially determined, although his choice of attacking a synagogue on a Saturday during the middle of a Sabbath service strongly suggests religious motivations.

The suspect reportedly demanded the release of convicted terrorist Aafia Siddiqui, who is known as ""Lady Al Qaeda."" Siddiqui is serving an 86-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2010 of attempted murder and armed assault of U.S. military personnel. Siddiqui is incarcerated at a federal prison not far from the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue that was attacked.

""This is a disturbing case that demonstrates that anti-Semitism is unfortunately alive and well,"" McCaul said. ""I think they chose this synagogue because she, Siddiqui, the Lady al Qaeda, they call her, is being detained in a Fort Worth prison facility.""

Anything else?

After the FBI attempted to downplay the role religion played in hostage crisis at the synagogue, President Joe Biden condemned the incident as an act of terrorism.

""This was an act of terror,"" Biden said.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan also condemned the incident as an ""act of terrorism"" and an ""act of anti-Semitism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-mccaul-something-more-synagogue-hostage-crisis,2022-01-16
"Michigan high school mass killing suspect may have been armed with a gun during disciplinary meeting with parents, school officials","The Oxford High School mass killing suspect may have had a gun on him during a meeting with his parents and school administrators on the day he allegedly took the lives of some of his school peers.

The district superintendent maintains at the time of this reporting that the student's troubling disciplinary history did not warrant discipline at the time of the meeting.

The suspect would then soon allegedly go on to shoot at least 11 people, with four killed at the time of this reporting.

What are the details?

Authorities said that the 15-year-old suspect — who is being tried as a adult and who faces terrorism charges in addition to murder and assault — may have had a gun in his backpack during a Monday meeting with administrators to discuss his deteriorating behavior.

At that point, however, no disciplinary action was warranted — at least according to the school superintendent.

""No discipline was warranted,"" Tim Throne, superintendent of the Oxford Community Schools district, said in a Thursday statement. ""Yes, this student did have contact with our front office. And yes, his parents were on campus Nov. 30.""

CNN reported Friday that Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said that there's a ""strong possibility"" that the teen had a gun — which he reportedly used in the mass killing — during the morning meeting.

""During COVID, they don't use lockers, so they just have backpacks,"" she reasoned. ""Unfortunately, he was allowed to get back to class, and we now know that he had a weapon with him at that time, and that is simply tragic.""

The teen's parents could also face charges related to the shooting. Earlier this week, McDonald said that the gun the teen is believed to have used was purchased by his father on Black Friday.

""We know that owning a gun means securing it properly and locking it and keeping the ammunition separate and not allowing access to other individuals, particularly minors,"" McDonald said according to a report from the Detroit Free Press. ""We have to hold individuals accountable who don't do that.""

The teen suspect, if convicted on all charges, faces possible life in prison.

Michigan teen school killing suspect charged with terrorism; parents could also face charges,"The 15-year-old school shooting suspect accused of killing at least four of his fellow students at a Michigan high school will be tried as an adult and faces murder, assault, and weapons charges in addition to one count of terrorism causing death, according to a Wednesday CNN report.

Seven other people were injured and wounded during the attack, which took place on Tuesday.

What's a brief history here?

A subject opened fire in a school hallway on Tuesday, shooting at least 30 rounds at those in the hallway and through classroom doors.

During a Wednesday arraignment, the suspect pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutor Marc Keast said that the suspect emerged from a school bathroom and began firing on people in the hallway. He reportedly continued strolling the hallway at a ""methodical pace"" and continued the attack for at least another five minutes.

The suspect surrendered when deputies arrived on the scene.

Administrators previously flagged the student for “behavior in the classroom that they felt was concerning,” Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard said during a Wednesday press briefing

Bouchard also announced in the briefing that the teen's parents were at the school earlier on the morning of the attack to discuss their son's concerning behavior.

What's happening now?

Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald told the outlet that the teen now faces the terrorism charge in addition to murder and other charges related to the attack.

According to CNN, Michigan law defines an act of terrorism as a ""willful and deliberate act that is all of the following,"" listing ""an act that would be a violent felony under the laws of this state, whether or not committed in this state,"" ""an act that the person knows or has reason to know is dangerous to human life,"" and ""an act that is intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence or affect the conduct of government or a unit of government through intimidation or coercion.""

""There is no playbook about how to prosecute a school shooting and candidly, I wish I'd never even had — it didn't occur so I wouldn't have to consider it, but when we sat down, I wanted to make sure all of the victims were represented in the charges that we filed against this individual,"" McDonald said. ""If that's not terrorism, I don't know what is.""

McDonald added that there is a great deal of digital evidence in the case — some of which ended up making its way onto social media.

""But you probably don't even need to see that to know how terrifying it is to be in close proximity of another student shooting and killing fellow students. I mean, it's terror,"" she explained. ""Like every other child that was in that building, and I address that about the terrorism charge, we must have an appropriate consequence that speaks for the victims that were not killed or injured but also, they were affected, how do they go back to school?""

On Wednesday, McDonald added that she is considering bringing charges against the teen's parents.

Bouchard confirmed that the gun the teen is believed to have used was purchased by his father on Black Friday.

""We know that owning a gun means securing it properly and locking it and keeping the ammunition separate and not allowing access to other individuals, particularly minors,"" McDonald said according to the Detroit Free Press. ""We have to hold individuals accountable who don't do that.""

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also told the outlet that state laws can impose parental accountability when minor children are involved in violent crimes.



""Theoretically, if you had a case where you had a teenager who had demonstrated some sort of instability, mentally or suicidal or homicidal thoughts or actions, or anything to that extent, and in addition to that you still allowed this child to have unfettered access to a weapon, then theoretically I don't think it would be a huge stretch to charge the parents with involuntary manslaughter under those circumstances,"" Nessel explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-teen-school-killing-suspect-charged-with-terrorism-parents-could-also-face-charges,2021-12-02
Migrants from overseas are now flocking to the southern border to enter the US,"A new wave of migrants who are not from the typical countries that flood the U.S. southern border are attempting to illegally enter the United States, according to a report from Axios. There are tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from overseas who are traveling to the southern border because they believe they can gain access to the U.S. during the current migrant crisis.

Typically, migrants encountered at the U.S. southern border are from Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle, which includes Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. However, there has been an alarming spike in migrants from atypical countries on the other side of the world.

There were 33,877 migrants from countries other than Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador encountered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in April. The number of migrants who are not from the usual countries is exploding during the border crisis. There were 25,126 in March and 11,911 in February. April 2021's total is triple what it was in 2019 (11,665) and there were only 1,310 CBP encounters in April 2020, according to Department of Homeland Security data.

U.S. immigration agents have encountered people from over 160 countries, the New York Times reported earlier this month.

""More than 12,500 Ecuadoreans were encountered in March, up from 3,568 in January,"" the outlet stated. ""Nearly 4,000 Brazilians and more than 3,500 Venezuelans were intercepted, up from just 300 and 284, respectively, in January. The numbers in coming months are expected to be higher.""



""From India and elsewhere in Asia, they embark on Phileas Fogg journeys,"" the Times said. ""Some reported taking buses in their hometowns to a big city, like Mumbai, where they boarded planes to Dubai and then connected through Moscow, Paris and Madrid, finally flying to Mexico City. From there, they embarked on the two-day bus ride to reach the Mexico-U.S. border.""



There were over 2,217 Romanians apprehended by CBP at the southern border since the start of the fiscal year 2021, which began in October 2020. There were only 266 Romanians caught at the border in fiscal 2020 and 289 in fiscal 2019, according to CBP data.

A Reuters photographer claimed to have witnessed nearly 200 Romanians crossing at different points along the Texas border over a three-week period this year.



Many of the overseas migrants at the U.S. border are Romani, a traditionally nomadic people who originated from northern India and are now Europe's largest ethnic minority, but ""have a long history of social exclusion and discrimination"" and are attempting to seek asylum in the United States.

Four people whose names were on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database have been arrested attempting to enter the U.S. from Mexico since Oct. 1 of last year. Three of the suspects were Yemen nationals and another was Serbian.



Border Patrol agents encountered 178,622 migrants in April attempting to enter the U.S. illegally at the southern border. Border apprehensions during April were the highest in over 20 years, since March 2000 when there were 220,063 illegal aliens during Bill Clinton's presidency.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/migrants-overseas-us-southern-border-cbp,2021-05-27
Top military leader admits acceleration of terrorist reorganization after Taliban's swift victory in Afghanistan,"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told United States senators in an intelligence briefing the reorganization of terrorist groups in Afghanistan has accelerated because of the botched U.S. military withdrawal.

What are the details?

During a conference call among Army Gen. Milley, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and lawmakers, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked whether the intelligence community would reassess its prediction about terrorist groups reorganizing in Afghanistan in light of the Taliban's swift victory.

According to Axios, Milley responded to Graham's question saying, ""yes.""

Milley's assessment indicates top American intelligence foresees an acceleration of terrorist groups reconstituting in Afghanistan. In June, Austin told Congress the risk was ""medium.""

""Two takeaways for me: We're gonna leave tens of thousands of people behind,"" the source who spoke with Axios said, ""and the timeline in terms of threats has accelerated.""

Why is this important?

The shocking admission, if proved true, would essentially nullify the U.S. mission in Afghanistan that spanned two decades.

The American military campaign in Afghanistan was focused on upending the Taliban-controlled government that harbored Al Qaeda terrorists, which had allowed them to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

The campaign was initially successful. The U.S. coalition routed the Islamic extremist government in a little more than two months time. The U.S. invaded Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001, and was victorious by mid-December.

Nearly 20 years later, the U.S. campaign has cost America more than $2 trillion and the lives of thousands of American servicemen and U.S. military contractors. More than 100,000 Afghan civilians, military, and national police were also casualties of the war.

Should all of the lives spent on the war be for nothing? By allowing the Taliban to seize control of Afghanistan — providing terrorists with a safe haven to plan future attacks — Biden will be forced to grapple with that question.

How quick could terrorists reorganize?

While the exact timeline is unknown, videos posted to social media over the weekend showed prisoners fleeing from the Parwan Detention Facility, Afghanistan's main military prison that housed ""big names"" from Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

There's little doubt those prisoners were rehabilitated while incarcerated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/military-leader-mark-milley-admits-acceleration-of-terrorist-reorganization-taliban-afghanistan,2021-08-16
"Breaking: Last U.S. plane departs Kabul airport, leaving behind 'hundreds' of Americans: 'We did not get out everybody we wanted to get out' ​","The Pentagon confirmed that the last plane left Kabul airport on Monday, ending the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan after two decades while leaving hundreds of Americans behind.

""I'm here to announce the completion of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the end of the military mission to evacuate American citizens, third country nationals, and vulnerable Afghans,"" said Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the head of the U.S. Central Command, to reporters in a media briefing.

""The last C-17 lifted off from Hamid Karzai international airport on August 30 this afternoon at 3:29 p.m. East Coast time, the last manned aircraft is now clearing the airspace above Afghanistan,"" he added.

McKenzie admitted that hundreds of American citizens had been left behind, and there were no American civilians on the last flight out because they were not able to make it to the airport.

""There's a lot of heartbreak associated with this departure. We did not get out everybody we wanted to get out,"" he said.

He added that the U.S. would work to get them out diplomatically by the State Department.

""I believe our Department of State is going to work very hard to allow any American citizens that are left, and we think the citizens that were not brought out number in the low — very low 100s,"" McKenzie explained. ""I believe that we're going to be able to get those people out.""

The Biden administration has faced bitter criticism over the way the withdrawal has been mismanaged. On Thursday, 13 U.S. service members were killed when a suicide terror attack struck people trying to get into the airport. Dozens of Afghans were also killed and injured in the gruesome attack.

The Pentagon said that 122,300 people had been evacuated from Afghanistan since the beginning of August, but only 5,400 of those were American citizens.

""Every single U.S. service member is out of Afghanistan, I can say that with absolute certainty,"" McKenzie said.

Missouri and Ohio school board associations leave National School Board Association over 'domestic terrorists' letter,"The school board associations in Missouri and Ohio on Tuesday separately announced they are ending their membership with the National School Boards Association over a letter the NSBA sent to President Joe Biden last month requesting federal law enforcement to intervene at local school board meetings.

Ohio School Board Association President Robert Heard and Chief Executive Officer Richard Lewis wrote to the NSBA to inform the organization that ""OSBA will not continue its membership in the National School Boards Association.""



""OSBA's decision to terminate membership and affiliation with the NSBA Association is a direct result of the letter sent by you to President Joe Biden last month,"" they wrote. ""The letter purported to be sent on behalf of state associations and school board members across the nation. This assertion could not be further from the truth. OSBA was not notified of the letter, nor were we asked for our thoughts on the matter.

""If we had been consulted, we would have strongly disagreed with NSBA's decision to request federal intervention as well as your claims of domestic terrorism and hate crimes,"" the letter stated.

Similarly, the Missouri School Board Association said Tuesday the NSBA has shown it does not align with the state organization's principles of local governance.

""We also believe that no school board member or educator should ever have to endure threats of violence or acts of intimidation against themselves or their families for making these difficult decisions. However, attempting to address that issue with federal intervention should not be the first step in most cases, and is antithetical to our long-standing tradition of local control,"" the MSBA said.

""Further, the use of inflammatory terms in the NSBA letter is not a model for promoting greater civility and respect for the democratic process.""

In September, the NSBA wrote to Biden that school board members nationwide were ""under an immediate threat"" from concerned parents and residents opposed to critical race theory, transgender policies, and COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates. The letter requested federal assistance in response to incidents of violence at raucous school board protests and alleged threats made against some school board members. It also likened protesting parents to ""domestic terrorists,"" which led to widespread criticism both from parents and from at least 21 state school board associations who said they were not consulted about the letter before the national organization claimed to speak for them.

In response, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Oct. 4 that the Department of Justice is ""committed to using its authority and resources"" to address alleged threats and violence, drawing fire from critics who said the Biden administration was unfairly targeting concerned parents.

On Oct. 15, the Pennsylvania School Board Association became the first state school board association to leave the national group over the letter.

""The most recent national controversy surrounding a letter to President Biden suggesting that some parents should be considered domestic terrorists was the final straw,"" the PSBA said.

""Attempting to solve the problems with a call for federal intervention is not the place to begin, nor a model for promoting greater civility and respect for the democratic process,"" it added.

The Ohio School Board Association raised similar concerns in its letter.

""OSBA believes strongly in the value of parental and community discussion at school board meetings, and we reject the labeling of parents as domestic terrorists. There is tremendous value in allowing and encouraging the public to have meaningful input into the decision-making process,"" the letter stated.

""However, that participation should not come at the expense of interfering with the board's ability to conduct its businesses or subjecting individual board members to threats of violence, abuse, or harassment. That said, dealing with such interference should be dealt with at the local level, not by federal officials.

""The NSBA letter demonstrated just how out of touch the national association is with the concerns of local school boards and the principle of local control. OSBA can no longer allow NSBA to speak for our association or our membership and no longer see the value of continued membership.""

Facing public controversy, the NSBA apologized for the letter and said it would conduct an internal review of the processes and procedures that led to it being sent to the White House without input from state school board associations.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/missouri-ohio-school-board-associations-domestic-terrorists-letter,2021-10-26
Mitch McConnell bursts bubble of Republicans hoping to impeach Biden over Afghanistan debacle: 'That's not going to happen',"Republicans in the U.S. Congress have been clamoring for President Joe Biden to be impeached over his disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal policies that left the South Asian country in chaos, thousands of Afghan allies in fear for their lives, and at least hundreds of Americans stranded in a nation now ruled by the Taliban.

But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) on Wednesday rejected GOP lawmakers' calls to boot Biden from the White House, National Review reported.

What's happening?

Calls have rung out from several Republicans in both the House and the Senate to impeach the president for his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that played out on televisions across the world over the last three weeks.

American allies felt betrayed.

Our Afghan friends were abandoned.

U.S. citizens were left behind.

Terror groups are gaining power, all while the Taliban enjoys the military hardware spoils of a quick and hasty American evacuation.

That, in the minds of many Republicans, is enough to justify removing Biden from office.

But Sen. McConnell has made it clear that's never going to happen.

Whether it's simply a matter of math or some sort of political calculation or something else, the leader of the GOP in the upper chamber has rejected the calls.

McConnell faced questions during a Wednesday event in Kentucky about whether the president's mishandling of the Afghanistan situation would justify impeachment and whether the senator would back the move, National Review said.

He answered that ""the president is not going to be removed from office.""

""There's a Democratic House, a narrowly Democratic Senate. That's not going to happen,"" he said, adding, ""There isn't going to be an impeachment.""

So, what is the right answer for holding the president (and his party) accountable in McConnell's mind?

Elections.

""The report card you get is every two years,"" McConnell said. ""I think the way these behaviors get adjusted in this country is at the ballot box.""

And the man who would like to regain the title of Senate majority leader is optimistic: ""I do think we're likely to see a typical kind of midterm reaction to a new administration. ... Typically there is some buyer's remorse.""

McConnell's not the only member of the GOP congressional leadership who has chosen not to back recent calls for impeachment, National Review noted. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) has not jumped on board either. Instead, he has said that, should Republicans take control of the House next year, they would launch investigations into the Afghanistan withdrawal and that there would be a ""day of reckoning.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-rejects-biden-impeachment,2021-09-02
"Rep. Mo Brooks claims Eric Swalwell's 'team' broke into his house, 'accosted' wife to serve Jan. 6 lawsuit","California Rep. Eric Swalwell (D) finally made good on his promise to serve Republican Rep. Mo Brooks (Ala.) with a lawsuit over his alleged role in the deadly riot at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6.

After being served, Brooks alleged that Swalwell's ""team"" broke into his personal residence and ""accosted"" his wife.

What are the details?

Swalwell filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr., and Brooks alleging they provoked the Capitol riot by alleging voter fraud marred the 2020 election.

Not only that, but the lawsuit claims the defendants broke laws in Washington, D.C., ""including an anti-terrorism act, by inciting the riot, and that they aided and abetted violent rioters and inflicted emotional distress on members of Congress,"" CNN reported.

The lawsuit was filed in March, but Swalwell's legal team told a judge they had difficulty locating Brooks to serve him with the suit. Federal Judge Amit Mehta refused to allow U.S. Marshals to serve Brooks with the lawsuit, citing ""separation of powers concerns.""

Swalwell's legal team hired a private investigator to locate Brooks. But even the investigator could not initially find the congressman. Brooks taunted Swalwell on Friday over the private investigator's inability to find him.

Over the weekend, the private investigator finally delivered the lawsuit to Brooks' wife in Alabama, Matthew Kaiser, an attorney for Swalwell, told CNN.

What did Brooks say?

Brooks alleged the private investigator not only delivered the lawsuit, but committed criminal trespass in the process — and even alleged that his wife had been ""accosted.""

""Well, Swalwell FINALLY did his job, served complaint (on my WIFE). HORRIBLE Swalwell's team committed a CRIME by unlawfully sneaking INTO MY HOUSE & accosting my wife!"" Brooks tweeted.

""Alabama Code 13A-7-2: 1st degree criminal trespass. Year in jail. $6000 fine. More to come!"" he added.

How did Swalwell's team respond?

Philip Andonian, an attorney for Swalwell, spoke with CNN, denied Brooks' allegations, and attacked the congressman for not volunteering to be served with the lawsuit.

""No one entered or even attempted to enter the Brooks' house. That allegation is completely untrue. A process server lawfully served the papers on Mo Brooks' wife, as the federal rules allow,"" Andonian said.

""This was after her initial efforts to avoid service. Mo Brooks has no one but himself to blame for the fact that it came to this. We asked him to waive service, we offered to meet him at a place of his choosing. Instead of working things out like a civilized person, he engaged in a juvenile game of Twitter trolling over the past few days and continued to evade service,"" Andonian added. ""He demanded that we serve him. We did just that. The important thing is the complaint has been served and Mo Brooks can now be held accountable for his role in inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mo-brooks-eric-swalwell-lawsuit,2021-06-07
"Mom who blasted Biden after her Marine son was killed in Kabul terror attack invites 'real President' Trump to funeral: 'I love you, and America loves you'","Shana Chappell — the Gold Star mom who alleged President Joe Biden ""rolled"" his ""f***ing eyes"" when she confronted him at the dignified transfer of her son, Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui, who was killed in the Kabul terror attack — invited the ""real President"" Donald Trump to her son's funeral.

What are the details?

Writing on Facebook last week, Chappell said ""I would love if somehow my President (you Mr. Trump) could be present as i lay my Beautiful baby boy Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui to rest.""

Chappell added, ""It would be such an honor to meet the real President of the United States of America, President Trump. I love you, and America loves you.""

What was Trump's response?

Trump replied Monday to Chappell on his Save America PAC: ""Thank you Shana — our Country loves you and especially loves your beautiful boy, Kareem.""

Trump didn't indicate if he would be attending Nikoui's funeral, which is open to the public and scheduled for Sept. 18 at Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California.

Anything else?

Chappell's Aug. 30 Facebook post ripping Biden following the dignified transfer read, in part: ""MY SONS BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS!!! All 13 of them, their blood is on your hands!!!! If my President Trump was in his rightful seat then my son and the other [heroes] would still be alive!!!!""

After Chappell's outcry, Trump offered sympathy to her in a statement released through his Save America PAC: ""Shana, you are 100% correct. If I were President, your wonderful and beautiful son Kareem would be with you now, and so would the sons and daughters of others, including all of those who died in the vicious Kabul airport attack.""

""Civilians should have been brought out first, along with our $85 billion of equipment, with the Military coming out very safely after all was clear. I love you, and I love Kareem,"" Trump added.

MSNBC host suggests killing American citizens with drone strikes,"During a discussion regarding domestic terrorism, MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace floated the idea of the U.S. government killing American citizens with drone strikes.

Wallace brought up the National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin that was released to all law enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security last week. The bulletin, which is in effect until April 30, warns that the DHS allegedly received information that there is the threat of ""ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence.""

Wallace notes, ""There's a bulletin released to all law enforcement earlier this week, that there is, until the end of April, a persistent threat of domestic extremism, domestic terrorism carried out in the ideology and around this belief that the election was fraudulent, that the Covid restrictions are unnecessary. All of those ideologies pushed by Donald Trump.""

The ""Deadline: White House"" host then said, ""But my question for you is around incitement. We had a policy, and it was very controversial, it was carried out under the Bush years, and under the Obama years, of attacking terrorism at its root.""

""Of going after and killing, and in the case of Anwar Awlaki, an American, a Yemeni-American, with a drone strike for the crime of inciting violence, inciting terrorism,"" Wallace stated.

""Mitch McConnell was in the Senate then. He was in the Senate after 9/11 too,"" the MSNBC anchor said. ""How does Mitch McConnell, who understands that the way you root out terrorism, is to take on, in the case of Islamic terrorism, kill those who incite it. How does he not vote to convict someone that he said, on the floor of the Senate, incited an insurrection?""

Al-Awlaki was an alleged American member of the al-Qaeda terrorist organization who was assassinated in Yemen by a drone strike approved by then-President Barack Obama in 2011. Awlaki was believed to be the former head of external operations for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and was linked to several terrorism plots, including an attempt to blow up a jetliner bound for Detroit in 2009. He was one of the United States' most wanted terrorists.



The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2010, ""There is no indication Mr. Awlaki played a direct role in any of the attacks, and he has never been indicted in the U.S.""

The Brookings Institute declared Al-Awlaki's assassination as ""the first extra-judicial killing by the United States government against a U.S. citizen.""



His 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, was killed in a U.S. drone strike two weeks later.

This is the second time that al-Awlaki has been mentioned on Wallace's show in the last two weeks. Previously, MSNBC contributor and former FBI agent Clint Watts hinted that former President Donald Trump was inciting violence against the U.S. government much like al-Awlaki with the Capitol riots on Jan. 6.

Watts told Wallace, ""We had a period after 9/11, where we were trying to get 'left of boom' as they would say in counter-terrorism. Which is, can you get way up, up the stream of an attack and start to root out all of the confluences which bring about that attack?""

""If you took what President Trump said, and you instead put it in Anwar Awlaki's mouth, we would be talking about a drone strike overseas,"" Watts said on the left-wing cable news network. ""So that's one aspect of our political leaders talking about this rhetoric.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-host-drone-strike-kill-americans,2021-02-05
MSNBC's Joy Reid and Lincoln Project adviser say Republicans becoming radicalized domestic terrorists who champion violence,"MSNBC host Joy Reid and Lincoln Project senior adviser Kurt Bardella claimed that Republicans are becoming ""radicalized"" and that the GOP is ""basically a domestic terrorist cell at this point and they should be treated as such.""

During Thursday's episode of ""The ReidOut,"" host Joy Reid was interviewing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) about the impeachment trial against former President Donald Trump.

Reid posed the question, ""Congressman Schiff, do we need to start having a serious conversation not just about Donald Trump being a bad guy, but about the Republican Party becoming a radicalized, anti-democratic institution?""



""You can't have a regular party like the Democrats, who have their flaws, and a party that is willing to seize power by force,"" Reid stated.

Schiff responded by saying that the Republican Party ""doesn't have an ideology any more, it doesn't have principles any more.""

Reid floated the conspiracy theory that if Trump is allowed to run for president in 2024, he'll know that he has ""paramilitary forces who are willing to be activated by him"" to get into the White House ""and never leave.""

Also during the MSNBC cable news program, Reid welcomed Kurt Bardella, who is a member of the Lincoln Project, the ""Never Trump"" super PAC that has received scrutiny after accusations of sexual misconduct against co-founder John Weaver.

Regarding the Lincoln Project allegations, the Associated Press reported on Friday, ""In June 2020, members of the organization's leadership were informed in writing and in subsequent phone calls of at least 10 specific allegations of harassment against co-founder John Weaver, including two involving Lincoln Project employees, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the situation.""

During the cable news interview, Bardella proclaimed that you are a ""sociopath"" if you don't ""feel something"" from presentations from Democratic impeachment managers.

""If you watch the proceedings, the presentations that Democrats have offered over the last couple of days, and you don't walk away feeling something, you are a sociopath. There is something fundamentally wrong and broken with you,"" claimed Bardella. ""What we are witnessing is the full embrace of the Republican Party of the most extreme and radical and racist elements of their base. There is no coming back from this.""

""From this point forward, they are the party that champions anti-democratic values,"" the former Republican-turned-liberal said. ""They are the party that champions the silencing of the votes of people of color in this country. They're the party that champions violence and insurrection and domestic terrorism.""

""The Republican Party, if they allow this to happen and allow no consequences to befall the person who led the charge and literally instructed people to commit violence and mayhem on our Capitol, if they allow that to happen, the Republican Party is basically a domestic terrorist cell at this point and they should be treated as such,"" he said, NewsBusters reported.

The assertion that Republicans are terrorists comes a week after another MSNBC host suggested that the U.S. government should use drone strikes to kill American citizens. MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace compared the Capitol rioters on Jan. 6 to Anwar Awlaki, the alleged former head of external operations for al-Qaeda who was assassinated in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike in 2011 during the Obama administration.

"UPDATED: Multiple people injured in Brooklyn subway shooting, explosion; police find several 'undetonated devices'","At least 10 people were shot and 6 others injured in a firearm and explosive attack inside a subway station in Brooklyn, New York, early Tuesday, and police reported that several undetonated devices were also located at the scene.

Amazingly, none of those injured are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, and as of Tuesday afternoon, the attack was not being considered an act of terrorism.

The incident occurred at the 36th Street and 4th Avenue station in Sunset Park at approximately 8:30 a.m., police said.

WNBC-TV reported that law enforcement officials are describing the suspect as a black male who is roughly 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds. He was reportedly wearing a gas mask and an orange construction vest at the time of the shooting.

The outlet added that law enforcement sources believe the suspect threw smoke canisters prior to opening fire on the crowd. Officers also believe they have recovered the suspect's gun and several more unused canisters and fireworks.

The gunman, however, is still at large and a manhunt remains under way, according to WABC-TV.

In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell told reporters: ""The suspect was in the train car, the shooting began in the train car. As the train was pulling into the station, the subject put on a gas mask. He then opened a canister that was in his bag and then the car began to fill with smoke. After that he began shooting.""

Officials give 1st update on Brooklyn subway shooting www.youtube.com

A witness to the incident told the New York Post the gunman fired off so many rounds that she ""lost count."" She added that she originally thought he was an MTA worker because of his clothing, but then she saw him drop ""some kind of cylinder that sparked at the top.""

The New York City Fire Department and other emergency medical responders quickly arrived on the scene to treat victims. Authorities believe many of the victims were struck by gunfire, while some others were hit by shrapnel.

The extents of the victims' injuries were not immediately clear, but photos and videos posted on social media showed several people bloodied from the gunfire and lying on the ground. Some appeared to be injured in their legs.

Local news outlets reported that the victims have been taken to nearby hospitals for further treatment.

Police have not yet offered more information regarding the undetonated devices but have confirmed that no active explosives remain on the scene.

"Elon Musk says Twitter has ""left wing bias""","Billionaire business tycoon Elon Musk declared in a tweet on Monday that Twitter clearly has a significant ""left wing bias.""

""Twitter obv has a strong left wing bias,"" Musk tweeted.

Musk, who is planning to purchase Twitter, reiterated that his objective is to allow free speech on the platform within the confines of the law.

""Like I said, my preference is to hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates. If the citizens want something banned, then pass a law to do so, otherwise it should be allowed,"" he noted.

Blaze Media CEO Tyler Cardon replied to Musk, remarking, ""And for this you’ll be smeared as a virulent racist/sexist/homophobe. Let them screech. Stay the course.""

Many social media users have long criticized Twitter for being biased against those on the right of the political spectrum.

Musk made the comment about Twitter's leftward leanings in response to Mike Cernovich, who had tweeted, ""Here you go @elonmusk, when Twitter employees invariably lie to you about enforcement policy, maybe they can explain why a verified account is allowed to incite terrorism without any care in the world about being banned.""



Cernovich included a screenshot of a tweet in which an individual named Caroline Reilly expressed approval about the news that a pro-life group's office had been targeted by vandalism. Reilly's tweet said, ""more of this. may these people never know a moment of peace or safety until they rot in the ground.""

Muslim student who put 9/11 memorial flags into trash bags rails against 'Islamophobia' while defending his 'Flag Relocation',"A Muslim student who removed nearly 3,000 miniature U.S. flags from a 9/11 memorial at Washington University in St. Louis — and was caught on video carrying them away in trash bags — railed against ""Islamophobia"" as he defended his ""Flag Relocation.""

What are the details?

Fadel Alkilani, who's vice president of finance for the Student Union, was seen by another student, Nathaniel Hope, removing the flags Saturday morning — the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks — and Hope began recording video showing Alkilani holding multiple plastic bags containing the flags, the college's newspaper reported.

Alkilani defended his actions in a formal statement Saturday night, which called it a ""Flag Relocation Incident"" in the title.

""Muslims such as I have faced fear, harassment, and Islamophobia from those who unjustly use the victims of 9/11 as a political cudgel,"" he wrote. ""Those who died during 9/11 deserve better than to be used as a political tool by those who seek to excuse American imperialism and Islamophobia.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @yaf

He added:

Since 9/11, Islamophobic hate crimes have been higher than they ever were before. The United States invaded countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, and over 900,000 people have been killed because of the wars the United States has propagated. 37 million people have been displaced, with some reports stating that number reaches up to 59 million. Any memorial of 9/11 that does not contend with these facts is not only incomplete, but it also amplifies pro-imperialist sentiment and actively disrespects those who have died because of American Invasion. A memorial which uses U.S. flags is especially insidious, as it does not recognize those who have fallen, but uses a symbol that was on the shoulders of those who are responsible for the deaths of 900,000 people, and uses the innocent lives lost during 9/11 as a political prop upholding American hegemony.

Alkilani also claimed he did nothing wrong — and was ""verbally and physically harassed"":

The misinformation that is currently circulating on YAF's page states that I was ""stealing"" the flags. This is due to a WashU College Republicans member, taking a video of me collecting flags in plastic bags. However, I had no intention of removing the flags from the Mudd Field area, and my full protest did not have the chance to be actualized. My planned protest was to place the bags of flags on Mudd field, along with various statistics (including those below) explaining the human cost of 9/11 in the past 20 years. On the sides of the bags, some writing may be visible, but the full statement was not outlined at the time of the video. I did not deface, destroy, damage, nor steal any flags, nor did I interfere with any registered event time. I assert that I did not violate any University Code of Conduct policy, though the conduct process is undergoing. Additionally, I was verbally and physically harassed by numerous WashU students and WUPD officers, whom I plan to report through official channels.

Anything else?

Students said Alkilani tried to destroy the memorial Friday night, but campus police ordered him to stop, Fox News reported.

The school condemned Alkilani's actions in a statement to the paper: ""We were disappointed to learn about the disruption to the 9/11 display on Mudd Field. We condemn the interference with the expression of support by the College Republicans for the victims of the national tragedy that took place 20 years ago today.""

Chancellor Andrew Martin said much the same, the school paper reported Sunday: ""I want to make it very clear that, as an institution, we find the actions of this student to be reprehensible. The removal of the flags impeded the ability of individuals to commemorate the lives lost on 9/11 and to process the trauma of that day.""

While Martin didn't mention Alkilani by name, he did say the school would investigate the incident.

College Republicans president Nick Rodriguez said Alkilani ""made a mockery of one of the most somber days in American history"" and should be disciplined.

""At minimum, I believe he should be removed from both SU and his [resident advisor] position, as what does it say to be a top American institution, and have yourself represented by a student leader who has no respect for property, campus traditions or the remembrance of thousands of lost lives,"" Rodriguez said in a statement. ""Today is about remembering the tragedy, 20 years ago to the day, not to make a political statement. Any reason he can conjure to remove the flags I find ludicrous.""



Junior Reagan Steirn was among those who gathered with a large American flag on Mudd Field Saturday evening, the paper reported — and she was not happy about Alkilani's actions: ""I'm livid. With a leadership role, someone doing those actions and showing his disrespect will just allow other students on campus to do the same thing, when in this situation it's just not okay to do that.""

"Muslim student who pulled US flags from 9/11 memorial, tossed them into trash bags exercised freedom of speech: First Amendment law prof","In the wake of a growing controversy at Washington University in St. Louis where a Muslim student removed nearly 3,000 miniature U.S. flags from a 9/11 memorial and was caught on video carrying them away in trash bags — after which he railed against ""Islamophobia"" as he defended his ""Flag Relocation"" — a First Amendment law professor at the school is saying the student exercised his freedom of speech and had as much right to remove the flags as those put them there while creating the display.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @yaf

What's the background?

Fadel Alkilani, who's vice president of finance for the Student Union, was seen by another student, Nathaniel Hope, removing the flags Saturday morning — the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks — and Hope began recording video showing Alkilani holding multiple plastic bags containing the flags, the college's newspaper reported.

Alkilani defended his actions in a formal statement Saturday night, calling his actions a ""Flag Relocation Incident"" in the title of his statement.

""Muslims such as I have faced fear, harassment, and Islamophobia from those who unjustly use the victims of 9/11 as a political cudgel,"" he wrote. ""Those who died during 9/11 deserve better than to be used as a political tool by those who seek to excuse American imperialism and Islamophobia.""

He added:

Since 9/11, Islamophobic hate crimes have been higher than they ever were before.

While Martin didn't mention Alkilani by name, he did say the school would investigate the incident.

Professor stands up for Alkilani

However, one of the college's most prominent First Amendment law professors, Gregory Magarian, argued that the administration's silence on Islamophobia and racism after the incident caused ""far greater harm"" than Alkilani's actions, the campus newspaper reported in a follow-up story.

""Putting up these flags as a way of commemorating 9/11 and making a political statement about 9/11 — there's no question that that is an act of speech, that that is expressive, that it carries a message,"" Magarian told the paper earlier this week. ""And I think there's no also no question that as a category, as a phenomenon, taking down the flags in opposition to the display is also expressive.""

The professor also said widespread hate speech following Alkilani's counterprotest, and the way in which it was allowed to go on for days without rebuke from administrators, likely would have a chilling effect on the future atmosphere of free speech on campus, the paper added.

""The point of what Alkilani did, whether or not we agree with his methods, should not be lost: a lot of people feel differently about this,"" Magarian added to the paper. ""This is a very contentious, very contestable political message — the idea that 9/11 is all about national unity and the national interest, the idea that we should focus only on the deaths that occurred on 9/11 and not in commemorating this event talk about things that happened subsequently, that Islamophobia need be no part of the discussion and for that matter, the symbolic rendering of each of these lost lives in the form of an American flag.""

The paper reported that in the wake of the incident Muslim students have said they fear for their safety and are concerned about the rise of Islamophobic rhetoric from fellow students and from strangers on social media.

"Nancy Pelosi backtracks, reassures America that Democrats 'did not rebuke' Rep. Ilhan Omar","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemingly backtracked Sunday, reassuring America that Democrats did not, in fact, rebuke Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) for comparing the United States and Israel to terrorist organizations.

What is the background?

Omar triggered controversy last Monday when she lumped together the U.S., Israel, Afghanistan, Hamas, and the Taliban as countries and organizations guilty of committing ""unthinkable atrocities.""

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,"" Omar said.

House Democratic leadership, of which Pelosi is the leader, responded by releasing a statement that condemned Omar's comparison.

Legitimate criticism of the policies of both the United States and Israel is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate. And indeed, such criticism is essential to the strength and health of our democracies. But drawing false equivalencies between democracies like the U.S. and Israel and groups that engage in terrorism like Hamas and the Taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress toward a future of peace and security for all. We welcome the clarification by Congresswoman Omar that there is no moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel and Hamas and the Taliban.

Their statement came one day after a group of 12 House Democrats similarly rebuked Omar, who later denied conflating the U.S. with terrorist organizations.

What is Pelosi saying now?

During an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host Dana Bash confronted Pelosi over Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who ""don't seem to be letting this go.""

Bash noted that Pelosi and ""top House Democrats released a pretty rare statement rebuking [Omar]."" That's when Pelosi seemingly backtracked on her earlier condemnation of Omar.

""OK. You know what? Let me just say this,"" Pelosi began. ""We did not rebuke her. We thanked— acknowledged that she made a clarification.""

""Congresswoman Omar is a valued member of our caucus. She asked her questions of the secretary of state. Nobody criticized those, about how people will be held accountable if we're not going to the International Court of Justice. That was a very legitimate question. That was not of concern,"" Pelosi added.

""Members did become concerned when the tweet that was put out equated the United States with the Taliban and Hamas,"" she continued. ""And then she clarified it. And we thanked her for clarification.""

"Person of interest named in Nashville explosion, FBI raid","A day after the explosion that rocked downtown Nashville, law enforcement revealed that they have received over 500 investigative leads. FBI special agent in charge Doug Korneski said on Saturday that more than 250 employees are currently on the investigation into the Christmas Day bombing, including a behavioral unit from Quantico to create a profile of the person or people responsible.

Korneski stated, ""There are a number of individuals we are looking at,"" but added, ""At this point we're not prepared to identify any single individual.""

A law enforcement source told CBS News that a ""person of interest"" has been identified in the RV bombing of America's country music capital. ""Multiple sources confirm that Anthony Quinn Warner, a Nashville area resident, had a similar make and model RV as the one in photos released to the public,"" the report stated.

CBS News reporter Jeff Pegues said, ""Anthony Quinn Warner, a Nashville area resident, had a similar make and model RV.""

CBS New York reporter Nick Caloway posted an alleged photo of a Google street-view image featuring an RV camper that appears very similar to the vehicle involved in the Nashville explosion, which authorities have labeled as ""an intentional act"" and had a chilling audio message.

At 11 a.m. on Saturday, the FBI, ATF, and the Metro Nashville Police Department conducted a raid at a duplex home in Antioch, Tennessee. Korneski confirmed the FBI investigation in the suburb of Nashville, but would not elaborate any further.

Neighbors told The Tennessean that an RV similar to the one seen at the scene of the explosion was parked at the home within the last two weeks.

Darrell DeBusk, an FBI public affairs officer, said information provided led to Saturday's ""court-authorized activity."" He said no arrests have been made.



""We will find out who did this,"" FBI special agent Matt Foster said during a Friday news conference. ""This is our city, too. We're putting everything we have into finding who was responsible for what happened here today.""



CBS News correspondent David Begnaud said a law enforcement source claimed investigators are entertaining the ""possibility that AT&T may have been the target or some other building or infrastructure in the area of the explosion.""



""The blast caused considerable damage to AT&T, which apparently is a communication switch hub, knocking out internet & cell phone service throughout a wide area from Nashville to Alabama,"" Begnaud said.

The explosion caused an AT&T outage, which affected 911 operations and residential services. Nashville Fire Department chief William Swann said restoring services could take days, according to The Tennessean.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency stated in a report released on Saturday that tissue samples found at the scene were determined to be human remains.

Authorities said there is no indication of additional threats. ""Nashville is safe,"" Nashville Metro Police chief John Drake said Saturday. There are ""no known threats"" against the city.



The Federal Aviation Administration has classified airspace over Nashville as ""National Defense Airspace"" in the aftermath of the bombing.

The order states, ""Pilots who do not adhere to the following procedures may be intercepted, detained, and interviewed by law enforcement/security personnel."" The temporary flight restriction that is in effect until Wednesday declares, ""The United States government may use deadly force against the airborne aircraft, if it is determined that the aircraft poses an imminent security threat.""

Nashville Mayor John Cooper issued a State of Civil Emergency for the affected area and a curfew through Dec. 27.

On Saturday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee requested emergency aid from the White House because of the ""severity and magnitude of the current situation.""



""This morning I toured the site of the bombing,"" Lee wrote in a tweet. ""The damage is shocking and it is a miracle that no residents were killed.""

The Christmas Day blast injured three individuals, all of whom were in stable condition. There were at least 41 businesses that were ""materially damaged.""

National School Boards Association faces 'critical loss' of funding over letter likening some parents to domestic terrorists,"The National School Boards Association is quickly learning that demonizing parents who are concerned about their children’s education, and even likening some to domestic terrorists, is not a winning strategy.



In fact, the decision has triggered a ""critical loss"" of financial backing for the organization.

What is the background?

The Justice Department sent shock waves throughout the U.S. in October when Attorney General Merrick Garland announced he had dispatched the FBI to respond to a number of concerns lodged by the NSBA.

In September, the NSBA wrote President Joe Biden requesting federal intervention over heated confrontations between parents and school boards. The NSBA claimed school board members had been subjected to threats, intimidation, and, in some cases, actual violence.

Not only did the NSBA request intervention from federal law enforcement agencies, the organization urged the federal government to characterize sharp reaction against school boards as ""domestic terrorism"" and ""hate crimes.""

The NSBA later apologized. The mea culpa, however, did not stop more than one dozen state education boards from withdrawing support from the NSBA.

What is happening now?

Axios reported that at least 17 states have withdrawn support for the NSBA, cutting off the organization from a significant reservoir of funding.

In fact, financial documents obtained by Axios showed that those states accounted for more than $1 million in annual dues in 2019, or more than 40% of all annual dues received by the NSBA that year.

More from Axios:

The group gets more dues income directly from school districts, with more than 1,200 providing nearly $5.3 million this year, according to NSBA records. Like the state associations, some of those districts also have severed ties with the group this fall.



The $1.1 million figure likely undercounts state associations' financial support, which also includes contributions related to NSBA conferences and events. The Montana School Boards Association, for instance, initially budgeted for $68,000 in 2021-22 dues payments. But it estimated its total financial commitment to be much higher, at nearly $160,000. It voted last month to leave the NSBA.

What did the NSBA say?

A spokesman for the organization downplayed the financial headache caused by the states withdrawing their membership from the NSBA.

""NSBA continues to have the resources we need to be effective on behalf of our members, and we will relentlessly work to advance our mission and continuously improve as an organization,"" the spokesperson told Axios.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-school-boards-association-faces-critical-loss-of-funding-over-letter-likening-some-parents-to-domestic-terrorists,2021-12-07
"NATO and China showcase their latest killer drones, turning page on autonomous ground warfare","October was a big month for ground-based killer drones. The Royal Netherlands Army announced on Oct. 14 that it had begun armed robot trials, deploying four armed and unmanned tanks to Lithuania. China similarly showcased defense contractor Kestrel's ""combat dog"" system in an Oct. 3 video demonstrating the unmanned ground vehicle's carriage by aerial drone and ability to run with a light machine gun.

While UGVs are presently an unreliable supplement to flesh-and-blood ground forces, their development and growing capabilities may signal their future adoption as soulless substitutes.

A new breed of dog

A social media account affiliated with Chinese defense contractor Kestrel released a video earlier this month of an unmanned aerial vehicle dropping off a robotic four-legged dog equipped with what WarZone reported was possibly a Chinese QBB-97 light machine gun, capable of firing 650 rounds per minute.

A translation of the post in which the video first appeared on the Chinese micro-blog site Weibo said, ""War dogs descending from the sky ... Red Wing forward heavy-duty drones deliver combat robot dogs, which can be directly inserted ... behind the enemy to launch a surprise attack.""

The post also suggested that the UGV could ""be placed on the rooftops and work with troops on the ground to ambush enemies inside buildings.""

A longer version of the demonstration shows the Chinese UGV climbing stairs and performing simulated ground operations with human companions.

Kestrel Defense Blood-Wing | Military promotional video #3 youtu.be

The same Chinese defense firm also released a video revealing the doglike UGV's ability to carry a loitering munitions launcher.

Unmanned tanks

Armored UGVs are not unprecedented, but have historically been grossly ineffective.

Russia, for instance, deployed its semi-autonomous Uran-9 tanks in Syria in 2016, which proved to be more trouble than they were worth. The technology is, however, improving.

Janes reported that the Royal Netherlands Army became the first Western military to start operational trials with UGVs.

Lt. Col. Sjoerd Mevissen explained that the four Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry Systems tanks that were deployed with the Netherlands' 13th Light Brigade to Lithuania last month ""have been handed over for experimental use in an operational unit in a military-relevant environment.""

""These are not simply tests on a training ground,"" said Mevissen. ""We are under the direct eyes and ears of the Russians, and as such in a semi-operational environment.

The THeMIS tank's various capabilities are showcased in this video:

General Dynamics announced on Oct. 4 that it would be unveiling the AbramsX, a modified version of the Abrams battle tank. Although it will not be a fully unmanned vehicle, General Dynamics indicated that it will have a ""reduced crew size and AI-enabled lethality, survivability, mobility, manned/unmanned teaming ... and autonomous capabilities.""

Remote-controlled terrors

Killer drones have long been a feature of modern combat. Unmanned aerial vehicles have been on the scene since the 1990s. The Guardian reported that one of their first impactful deployments was in the 1999 Kosovo war, when they were used to identify hidden Serbian positions.

Slate reported that in January 2001, the U.S. armed a Predator drone for the first time, equipping it with a laser-seeker and a Hellfire air-to-ground missile. Several months later, after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the U.S. recorded its first drone kill when, on Nov. 14, 2001, a Predator-launched Hellfire missile obliterated al Qaeda's Mohammed Atef and six of his terrorist allies.

Drones have been shown to be capable of hitting hard and airborne targets as well.

The first UAV air-to-air kill was recorded in 2017, when a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone shot down another with an infrared guided air-to-air missile, but by then drones were already ubiquitous.

This year, hundreds of lightweight U.S. Switchblades have been deployed in Ukraine, where they have been used to strike small targets.

This is the Power of the Switchblade Drone That Is So Scary! youtu.be

Janes indicated that by 2030, over 80,000 surveillance drones and nearly 2,000 attack drones will have been purchased. A 2019 estimate indicated that the biggest purchaser of combat drones over the next decade would be the United States, with over 1,000 prospective purchases. China was a distant second, looking to acquire only 68 drones.

With tensions rising between the U.S. and both China and Russia, as well as smaller international conflicts, those estimates may prove conservative.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nato-and-china-showcase-their-latest-killer-drones-turning-page-on-autonomous-ground-warfare,2022-10-28
Neighborhood bands together to guard Asian-American family's home after months of racist attacks,"An Orange County, California, neighborhood has banded together to guard an Asian-American family after the family purportedly suffered a series of ""deeply upsetting"" racist attacks.

What are the details?

According to the Los Angeles Times, Haijun Si and his family moved from China to the United States four years ago. He and his family eventually landed in Ladera Ranch in Orange County just a few months ago. Almost immediately, the family and other neighbors report that they were subjected to racism.

The Times notes that a group of 15 to 20 neighborhood-area teenagers reportedly rang the family's doorbell late at night, threw rocks at the family's home, and called the family racial slurs on more than one occasion.

Si told the outlet, ""My kids are scared. I'm very annoyed. At night, my wife and I could not sleep for more than three or four hours. Please, parents, tell your kids don't do that again.""

To prevent the annoyances, Si said he installed a wrought-iron fence, security cameras, and floodlights and even filed a police report — but the harassment didn't stop. It only abated after neighborhood residents banded together to stand watch in the family's driveway and from the street outside their home.

It didn't even stop there.

""The Orange County Sheriff's Department has been called to the home seven times between October 2020 and February,"" the outlet noted. ""Deputies have ramped up patrols in the area, and the department has launched an investigation, said Sgt. Dennis Breckner.""

'Definitely made me sad for this community'

One neighbor, Layla Parks, told the outlet that she was ""immediately outraged"" when she heard about the family's treatment and wanted to help — so she shared footage of one of the attacks to a neighborhood Facebook group. Parks' move eventually prompted other neighbors to volunteer to guard the family's home.

Now neighbors are standing guard on a nightly basis outside the family's home in order to protect them from any further harassment.

The Times noted, ""Violence and hate incidents directed at Asian Americans have surged across California, including in Orange County, since the beginning of the pandemic, with some blaming Asians because of the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan, China.""

""I did not understand the extent of the harassment and how often it was occurring,"" Parks told the Times. She later added that it makes her ""physically ill"" to admit that racism is ""alive and well"" in the neighborhood.

""It's definitely made me sad for this community, because this is just a wonderful place full of friends and neighbors that love and care about each other,"" she added.

Turning their eyes to volunteers

The Times noted that one evening, a group even threw rocks at volunteers who were chatting with Si on the front lawn.

""The next day, as Chinese families around the world celebrated the Lantern Festival, hundreds of residents gathered on the grassy lawn across the street to show their support,"" the outlet noted. ""People held red lanterns and watched a traditional lion dance performance. Young children danced and clapped along to the music.

Emily Lippincott, who lives nearby in Rancho Mission Viejo, told the outlet that she got involved because she, too, is raising a young child.

"" I don't want to put a 'for sale' sign in front of my house and say, 'I can't deal with this,'"" Lippincott said. ""I kept seeing excuses being made, 'Oh, it's just kids being kids.' No, this is months of terrorizing this poor family.""

State Sen. Dave Min (D) told the outlet that it's imperative for the community to stand together.

""We're seeing an epidemic of hate right now, and we have to stand together,"" Min said last week in remarks at an event supporting the Si family.

Si said of his supporters, ""I love my neighbors. I love my community, and I love my country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/neighborhood-guards-asian-american-family-racist-attacks,2021-03-04
Netanyahu fires back at reporter who claimed journalists were 'lucky' to escape targeted building: 'It wasn't luck',"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired back at journalists who claimed over the weekend they were ""lucky"" to escape a building in Gaza before Israeli Defense Forces destroyed it.

What is the background?

Controversy erupted on Saturday when the IDF struck a high-rise building in Gaza that housed international media, including an Associated Press bureau.

Journalists and First Amendment organizations immediately condemned the act, which Israel said was necessary because Hamas intelligence assets operated from the building. Israel later showed American intelligence officials ""smoking gun"" evidence proving Hamas' presence in the building.

What did Netanyahu say?

Speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Netanyahu rebuked an AP reporter who claimed journalists were ""lucky"" to escape their offices before the building was leveled.

Netanyahu said it wasn't luck. In fact, he explained Israeli officials went to great lengths to warn occupants the airstrike was coming, a fact that was widely reported after the building was targeted.

""The interesting thing is, I would say that, you know, all the journalists, one of the, I think AP journalists said, 'We were lucky to get out' No, you weren't lucky to get out. It wasn't luck. It's because we took special pains to call people in those buildings to make sure that the premises were vacated,"" Netanyahu explained.

""Look, you have your own experiences, I think, in Mosul, in Fallujah, in Afghanistan. I think you can appreciate the efforts we go through in dense urban fighting when terrorists are targeting civilians who are hiding behind civilians, how difficult that is,"" he continued. ""We do our best to avoid civilian casualties. And we did that yesterday with that building as well.""

Netanyahu defends strikes on Gaza, says Israel will do ""whatever it takes to restore order"" youtu.be

Netanyahu also confirmed that intelligence was shown to American officials proving the building was a legitimate military target.



""We share with our American friends all that intelligence, and here's the intelligence we had: it's about Palestinian terrorists, an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organization housed in that building that plots and organizes the terror attacks against Israeli civilians,"" Netanyahu explained.

""So it's a perfectly legitimate target. And I can tell you that we took every precaution to make sure that there were no civilian injuries. In fact, no deaths, no injuries whatsoever,"" he added. ""Well, I can't say injuries, I don't know if somebody received a fragment of a stone. I don't know that. But no people were killed.""

What did the AP say?

AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt claimed his organization was unaware that Hamas operated from the same building as his journalists and demanded that Israel show evidence proving its claims.

""The Israeli government says the building contained Hamas military intelligence assets. We have called on the Israeli government to put forward the evidence,"" Pruitt said in a statement.

""AP's bureau has been in this building for 15 years. We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,"" he claimed. ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/netanyahu-fires-back-at-reporter-who-claimed-journalists-were-lucky-to-escape-targeted-building-it-wasnt-luck,2021-05-17
Quinnipiac Poll: Biden's job approval is underwater and a strong majority disapprove of his handling of foreign policy,"A new Quinnipiac University national poll of adults has President Joe Biden's job approval rating underwater, with 42% approving of how Biden is handling his job, compared to 50% who disapprove.

Those numbers from a survey conducted Sept. 10-13 mark a significant sentiment shift since a survey carried out from July 27-Aug. 2 found that 46% approved while 43% disapproved of the way Biden was handling his role.

The numbers have also shifted strongly against Biden regarding his handling of foreign policy. Just 34% approve of the president's handling of foreign policy, versus 59% who disapprove, a notable swing from the 42% approval and 44% disapproval ratings Biden had on the issue in the earlier poll.

A strong majority (65%) disapproved of the way the president handled the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan while only 31% approved of how he handled it.

And a whopping 62% believe that U.S. troops will need to return to Afghanistan to combat terrorism, compared to just 28% who do not think so.

Biden is also underwater regarding the way he is handling his role as commander-in-chief of the American military—while 40% approve, 55% disapprove.

And while 42% approve of how the president is handling the economy, 52% disapprove.

""If there ever was a honeymoon for President Biden, it is clearly over. This is, with few exceptions, a poll full of troubling negatives... from overall job approval, to foreign policy, to the economy,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said.



While 48% approve of the president's handling of the coronavirus response, 49% disapprove. Those figures mark a notable shift compared to the poll conducted from late July through early August which found that 53% approved while 40% disapproved.

Cuomo's alleged bullying tactics gained attention when New York state Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democrat, accused the governor of personally threatening him last week for calling out the governor's ""BS"" surrounding the nursing home cover-up.

Following Kim's accusation, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat, came out and said the lawmaker's allegation was ""not a surprise.""

""It's a sad thing to say, Mika, but that's classic Andrew Cuomo,"" de Blasio told MSNBC last week. ""A lot of people in New York state have received those phone calls.""

""The bullying is nothing new,"" de Blasio said, adding, ""The threats, the belittling, the demand that someone change their statement right that moment — many, many times I've heard that and I know a lot of other people in the state that have heard that.""

Now one New York journalist has gone on the record accusing Cuomo's office of bullying him during his time as editor of a magazine covering New York politics and saying that this is a pattern of behavior for the executive.

In a new op-ed for the New York Post titled ""Cuomo's office terrorized me for doing my job as a journalist,"" former City & State editor-in-chief Morgan Pehme recounted an incident he claims took place in April 2014 when his magazine was prepared to run a story that the governor didn't like.

Pehme began his tale of Cuomo woe:

It was 4:30 a.m., so I pulled the bathroom door shut in my one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment to answer the phone without waking my then-5-year-old. On the line was Melissa DeRosa, Gov. Cuomo's then-communications director, now his second-in-command. She was threatening to destroy me.



By now, thanks to Queens Assemblyman Ron Kim blowing the whistle on the threats he received in a call from Cuomo, the public has a glimpse of the bullying practiced by the governor and his top brass.



Many Americans are shocked, having bought into the compassionate persona Cuomo conveyed in his pandemic briefings. But Kim's revelations came as no surprise to anyone who has dealt with the governor. As one Albany insider texted me last week, “everyone has an Andrew Cuomo story.""

The onetime editor said his publication was going to expose Cuomo's efforts to distort a report on public corruption — a report for which Pehme's magazine got pushback from Cuomo's office the minute the outlet began digging.

Though he cannot quote exactly what the governor's office threatened him with, Pehme said he knows that a promise to ""destroy"" his career and get revenge was included in the threats.

And the fear he experienced was warranted, he added, considering Cuomo's ""track record of vindictiveness"":

I had no reason to think these were idle threats. I was fully aware of the governor's volcanic temper and track record of vindictiveness. If he wanted to crush me, he could and likely would.



This was a serious gut check for me. I worried about losing my livelihood, damaging my future, letting down my wife and daughter. But fortunately, I had bosses and colleagues who stood by the quality of our work. So we published the piece, like the press is supposed to do in the face of intimidation.

According to Pehme, ""abusive calls"" from the governor's office or the governor himself are regular fare for the Albany press corps:

[T]he abuse he privately metes out amounts to a systematic campaign to chill negative coverage of his administration. And it works.



Editors kill legitimate stories because of his threats; reporters shy away from promising tips; sources stay silent.



There are many reasons the media don't expose the governor's bullying. Albany reporters fear that if the governor freezes them out, they won't be able to do their jobs effectively. Some journalists see speaking up as a violation of the unwritten code of “off-the-record"" conversations. Others just assume that “everyone knows"" how Cuomo operates, so it isn't worth reporting.

Pehme closed his piece urging journalists to do their jobs and report the truth about Cuomo — just as they did when the #MeToo movement uncovered abusive ""monsters"" in the entertainment industry.

""Journalists are agents of accountability,"" he wrote. ""It's time for New York's reporters to step up and tell their own Cuomo stories.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-journalist-cuomo-terrorized-him,2021-02-23
New York lawyer turned terrorist trying to avoid prison after firebombing NYPD vehicle,"Two leftist New York City lawyers were arrested on May 30, 2020, for firebombing an NYPD vehicle amid the BLM riots, during which more than 2,000 police officers were injured. Earlier this month, one of the terrorists requested a commutation of her sentence, suggesting that ""her otherwise exemplary life"" should excuse her from a further prison term.

At the time of the Pakistan-born terrorist's arrest, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue stated, ""No rational human being can ever believe that hurling firebombs at Police Officers and vehicles is ever justified. The Eastern District of New York will ... ensure that criminals who use the camouflage of lawful protest to launch violent attacks against Police Officers face justice.""

If the terrorist, 33-year-old Urooj Rahman, gets her way, then Donoghue's assurances that justice will be meted out may soon ring hollow.

While originally slated to stand for sentencing on September 29, Rahman was also granted a new date so that her mother could be present. Her fate will now be determined on November 9, 2022, one month after her co-conspirator's sentencing.

The terrorist and the bombing

Rahman, a so-called human rights attorney, was admitted to the New York state bar in June 2019 after graduating from Fordham University School of Law. The school's Leitner Center indicated that she had worked as a foreign lawyer in Turkey to ""assist and empower"" refugees who had fled there.

A member of the American Muslim Bar Association, Rahman is a vociferous critic of Israel, having both penned articlescriticizing the nation and taken part in anti-Israeli protests in the West Bank.



In 2014, she undertook an internship at Israel-based Mada Al-Carmel's Arab Center for Applied Social Research, which is funded by George Soros' Open Society Institute.

After returning to her adopted country, Rahman lived with her mother and worked at Bronx Legal Services.

She has not only been a committed supporter of Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders, but also supported local Democrat politicians, having worked on Bob Gangi's failed New York City mayoral campaign.

In May, 2020, Rahman was caught on surveillance video — her face visible despite her Palestinian keffiyeh — throwing an explosive device into an unoccupied police cruiser in the vicinity of the NYPD's 88th Precinct in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. She returned to the minivan belonging to her co-conspirator, 34-year-old Colinford Mattis, and the two fled the scene.

Police chased and ultimately stopped the van on Willoughby Street. Inside the van, officers found multiple other explosives devices. According to their detention memo, the terroristic duo had allegedly attempted to ""distribute Molotov cocktails ... in furtherance of more destruction and violence.""

In an interview taken that night and published on June 5, 2020, Rahman justified the the BLM riots and the leftist violence she had participated in. ""This sh** won't ever stop unless we f****** take it all down.""

She emphasized, ""The only way they hear us is through violence.""

When asked about violence committed against police, Rahman answered: ""I think it's understandable. ... It's a way to show their pain, their anger."" She suggested that the city's mayor should have withdrawn police officers and that having not done so opened them up to danger.

Rahman was bailed out by former Obama intelligence official attorney Salmah Rizvi.

Guilty

In June, Rahman and Mattis withdrew earlier guilty pleas for possessing and making explosive devices (i.e., firebombs), instead entering guilty pleas for conspiracy to commit arson and possession of an explosive device. They also evaded a ""terrorism enhancement,"" which would have had them spend decades in prison.

The deal they struck with prosecutors this summer will ensure they won't serve more than two years in jail.

After Rahman's and Mattis' post-terror attack capture, FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said, ""Behavior like the attacks charged here puts our entire community — protestors and first responders alike — in danger, and we will simply not allow it to go unaddressed.""

Sweeney likely did not anticipate that the ""severe"" consequences he had hoped for would amount to no more than several months and potentially time served.

Rahman has since been on home detention and wearing an electronic monitoring device.

Request for commutation

According to court filings obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Rahman's legal representatives asked Judge Brian Cogan of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to let the terrorist off with ""time served.""

Citing a psychological evaluation by Dr. Leslie Lebowitz indicating that Urooj ""is gravely compromised,"" attorneys Rita Maxwell and Peter Baldwin suggested that the September 11, 2001, Islamic terror attacks on the United States resulted in Rahman's harassment, which allegedly produced in the terrorist ""incapacitating depression, panic, and uncontrollable obsessional thinking.""

Notwithstanding the interview above, taken the night of the bombing, in which Rahman appeared coherent, the court filing suggested that Rahman had drunk vodka on an empty stomach, which ""further clouded her judgment.""

The document also claimed that Rahman, who suggested that the only way to be heard is through violence, ""is no radical"" and ""not a terrorist.""

In texts read by prosecutor Ian Richardson in the duo's first plea hearing, Rahman allegedly wrote: ""Molotovs rollin' ... I hope they burn everything down. Need to burn all police stations down and probably the courts too.""

""One isolated act committed on a night when passions ran wild should not define a person,"" wrote Maxwell and Baldwin. ""Tossing the Molotov cocktail was a way of expressing anger.""

The dean of Fordham Law School, John Feerick, suggested that her felony conviction ""will cause her to lose her law license for more than seven years"" and intimated that losing the license was substantial enough punishment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-lawyer-turned-terrorist-trying-to-avoid-prison-after-firebombing-nypd-vehicle,2022-09-29
NY Times taken to woodshed for claiming Iran's nuclear program is 'peaceful': 'Is this an Iranian paper?',"The New York Times was summarily blasted on Saturday after the newspaper presented Iran's nuclear program in a positive light. The Times' posturing came after the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the Islamic country's top nuclear scientist.

What did the Times say?

The Times claimed that the nuclear ambitions of Iran — a state-sponsor of terrorism, according to the State Department — are for ""peaceful purposes.""

""Iranian officials, who have always maintained that their nuclear ambitions are for peaceful purposes, not weapons, expressed fury and vowed revenge over the assassination, calling it an act of terrorism and warmongering,"" the newspaper tweeted.

What was the response?

In response, the New York Times, the so-called ""paper of record,"" was accused of disseminating ""foreign propaganda garbage.""

""Is this an Iranian paper?"" conservative commentator Lisa Boothe said.

""What was once the self-styled newspaper of record is now just a well-funded left-wing blog, relentlessly hostile to America and Israel, and always ready to propagandize for their enemies,"" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said.

""NYT, once again, ignores U.S. intelligence agencies' warnings and props up a murderous, gay killing Regime. Their tweet should have a warning label of pushing misinformation, @Twitter,"" Richard Grenell responded.

""The New York Times is pure foreign propaganda garbage,"" Republican operative Arthur Schwartz said.

""Two weeks ago, the IAEA declared Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was over 12 times the legal limit. Also, you don't build nuclear facilities deep under mountains with 90 degree entrances meant to defeat cruise missiles when they're for peaceful purposes,"" GOP operative Alex Plitsas said.

""Wow. The press has truly become an anti- American propaganda tool. Not even worth using for toilet paper,"" another person said.

""Lmao. Much like the peaceful protests, this is just peaceful nuclear bomb research,"" another person mocked.

Anything else?

Notably, two top officials from the Obama administration were angered by Fakhrizadeh sudden death.

Former CIA Director John Brennan called the operation to kill Fakhrizadeh ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless.""

""This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict. Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits,"" he said.

Brennan added, ""I do not know whether a foreign government authorized or carried out the the murder of Fakhrizadeh. Such an act of state-sponsored terrorism would be a flagrant violation of international law & encourage more governments to carry out lethal attacks against foreign officials.""

Meanwhile, Ben Rhodes, a top Obama aide who helped craft the Iran nuclear deal, claimed Fakhrizadeh's death was meant to undermine Joe Biden's administration.

""This is an outrageous action aimed at undermining diplomacy between an incoming US administration and Iran. It's time for this ceaseless escalation to stop,"" Rhodes said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-times-iran-nuclear-peaceful,2020-11-28
Climate change activist calls for pipelines destroyed on New Yorker,"New Yorker magazine platformed a Swedish climate change activist who advocates blowing up pipelines in the name of climate justice on a recent episode of its ""New Yorker Radio Hour"" podcast.

Andreas Malm is an associate professor at Sweden's Lund University, and the author of the book ""How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Learning to Fight in a World on Fire."" Malm's book does not only have an eye-catching title; he actually advocates destroying any and all fossil fuel infrastructure.

Malm wrote in his book, ""Damage and destroy new CO2-emitting devices. Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep on investing in the fire know that their properties will be trashed.""

Malm contends that obliterating private property associated with fossil fuels is ""precisely what the climate movement needs.""

When climate activists shut valves and destroy pipelines, when they set fire to heavy machinery owned by oil companies, they assert their rights to this infrastructure and their rights to the land and air and water that it is destroying. It is what I have referred to elsewhere as ""prefigurative expropriation""; a momentary, but informative and empowering challenge to the economic system of private property and the morality that it produces. Sabotage, as its earliest proponents understood, is a powerful threat to the owning class and this is precisely what the climate movement needs.

Malm appeared on the New Yorker podcast last week, where he literally championed destroying pipelines.

Malm said he felt ""panic and desperation"" in the summer of 2018 because of heatwaves, wildfires, and droughts in northern Europe, which pushed him into radical ideas in his climate change activism.



He called for an ""escalation,"" for the ""movement to diversify its tactics, and move away from an exclusive focus on polite, gentle, and perfectly peaceful civil disobedience.""

""I am recommending that the movement continues with mass action, civil disobedience, but also opens up for property destruction,"" Malm told host David Remnick. ""I do think we need to step up, because so little has changed, and so many investments are being poured into new fossil fuel projects.""

""So I am in favor of destroying machines, property, not harming people,"" he added. ""I think property can be destroyed in all manner of ways or it can be neutralized in a more gentle fashion...or in a very spectacular fashion as in potentially blowing up a pipeline under construction,"" Malm proclaimed.

The internet reacted with shock that New Yorker magazine would provide a platform to someone advocating for violence, and encouraging what many called ""terrorism.""













Other media outlets presented Malm's ideas of carrying out acts of violence against energy infrastructure. In May, the New Republic argued that Malm's proposal to destroy private property should be heard in an article titled: ""The Climate Case for Property Destruction.""



What, then, is to be done? The main argument of How to Blow Up a Pipeline is simple: The climate movement should itself enact, through direct action, that prohibition on new fossil fuel infrastructure, and that dismantling of existing pipelines and power plants, which governments have so far refused to take on. Only if such equipment is damaged often and badly enough as to make its continued operation unprofitable does the stabilization of the climate stand a chance. For climate activists to confine themselves to peaceful protest is meanwhile to watch the earth become less and less hospitable to human life. Plenty of readers will react (as I did) with a sort of instinctive skepticism to Malm's case that only widespread property destruction can forestall civilizational suicide, but his case deserves a hearing.

In July, another influential outlet platformed Malm's ideas of blowing up pipelines — the New York Times.

Former Vox co-founder Ezra Klein, who wrote the article, appeared to conflate possible eco-terrorist acts advocated by Malm to violence used during the American Revolution and during the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.

""Malm's rebuttal to potted histories of past social movements, which is persuasive in parts,"" Klein wrote. ""He's surely right that we sanitize past uprisings, lionizing the peaceful and blackening or forgetting the names of the violent. There is at least an argument that it's the interplay of forces that transforms societies. There was no peaceful American Revolution. There were riots and rifles woven into the civil rights movement. 'Does this movement possess a radical flank?' asks Malm.""

""Still, violence is often deployed, even if counterproductively, on behalf of causes far less consequential than the climate crisis,"" Klein reasoned.

Klein did acknowledge that blowing up pipelines would increase energy prices, which would hurt the poor the most.

Fox News noted, ""Ezra Klein previously denounced the violent actions of the January 6 Capitol riots as 'lunacy' and 'lawless' in a New York Times article published on January 7.""

Despite endorsing blowing up a pipeline, writing a book about blowing up a pipeline, and encouraging others to blow up a pipeline, Malm has yet to put his own words into action. Possibly because those who are caught sabotaging energy infrastructure go to prison for years.

In June, the Des Moines Register reported on two eco-terrorists who were sentenced to eight years in prison for causing millions of dollars in damage to the Dakota Access pipeline.



Climate activists Jessica Reznicek, 39, and Ruby Montoya, 31, were indicted on nine federal charges each in September 2019, including charges for damaging an energy facility, use of fire in the commission of a felony, and malicious use of fire. Reznicek and Montoya both pleaded guilty to a single count of damaging an energy facility. In July 2017 the women claimed credit for a series of acts of sabotage, including burning pipeline construction equipment at a Buena Vista County worksite in November 2016 and using oxyacetylene cutting torches or gasoline-soaked rags to damage other pipeline sites around the state between March and May 2017. At the time of their admission, they were affiliated with the Des Moines Catholic Workers' social justice movement.

In the name of climate activism, Malm has admitted that he deflated tires of SUVs in 2007, according to the Los Angeles Review of Books.

In the summer of 2007, five dozen SUV owners in an affluent part of Stockholm awoke to find their cars ""reclining on the asphalt."" On their windshields, they found a leaflet. ""We have deflated one or more of the tyres on your SUV,"" it read. ""Don't take it personally. It's your SUV we dislike."" The leaflets continued by pointing out how much gasoline the SUVs burned, this burning was directly connected to the rapid warming of the planet, and the drivers would be fine — they might be mildly inconvenienced, but clearly they had money and lived in a city with good public transit. At roughly the same time, the small band of SUV saboteurs published a statement taking credit for the action, exhorting others to copy their work, and making available a ""simple manual"" for how to release the air from a tire.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-yorker-climate-activist-pipelines-destroy,2021-09-26
"Tribute to Nicole Gee, Marine killed in Kabul airport attack","Only days before her death, Sgt. Nicole Gee was pictured cradling an Afghan baby at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. Gee was one of the 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans who were killed in the terrorist attack at the Kabul airport. Friends and fellow service members remember Nicole Gee, who was robbed of her life at the age of 23.

Gee, who was from Roseville, California, enlisted in the military in 2017. She served as a maintenance technician with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based out of Camp Lejeune, California.

In early August from Kuwait, Gee gleefully announced that she had been promoted to sergeant before being deployed to Afghanistan.

On Aug. 21, Gee posted a photo of her holding a baby at the Kabul airport with the caption: ""I love my job.""



On Aug. 22, Gee posted a photo on Instagram of her escorting evacuees onto a plane.

On Aug. 24, the official Twitter account for the Department of Defense shared a photo of Gee escorting Afghan citizens onto a C-17 airplane.

On Aug. 26, Gee along with 10 other marines, one soldier, and one Navy corpsman were killed in a suicide bombing at the Hamid Karzai International Airport.



The Marines who died are Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover, 31, of Salt Lake City, Utah; Sgt. Johanny Rosariopichardo, 25, of Lawrence, Massachusetts; Cpl. Hunter Lopez, 22, of Indio, California; Cpl. Daegan W. Page, 23, of Omaha, Nebraska; Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez, 22, of Logansport, Indiana; Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza, 20, of Rio Bravo, Texas; Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz, 20, of St. Charles, Missouri; Lance Cpl. Rylee J. McCollum, 20, of Jackson, Wyoming; Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola, 20, of Rancho Cucamonga, California; and Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui, 20, of Norco, California.



Navy Hospitalman Maxton W. Soviak, 22, of Berlin Heights, Ohio, and Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss, 23, of Corryton, Tennessee, also died during the terror attack.

""We continue to mourn the loss of these Marines and pray for their families,"" Marine Corps spokesman Maj. James Stenger said in a statement on Friday. ""Our focus now is taking care of the families of those who were killed and caring for our injured.""

Brig. Gen. Forrest C. Poole III, commanding general of 2nd Marine Logistics Group, said, ""Our unit mourns the immense loss of Sgt. Gee, our fallen service members, and the Afghan people who lost their lives in this attack. I express my deepest heartfelt condolences to Sgt. Gee's family, friends, and loved ones. We will continue to provide support to all those affected by this incident.""

""She had a name. She was doing God's work…..a warrior,"" Capt. Karen Holliday said. ""Searching Afghan women and children trying to get out of country.""

Lance Cpl. Joyner Seaman, who trained with Gee in 2018, told The Daily Beast, ""She was a badass. She would outrun and outperform most male Marines in the physical categories during our training. She was truly a badass individual—and more importantly, she was the nicest person. She was a Marine's Marine.""

Joe Stowers, a fellow Marine, called Gee ""the ultimate nurturer.""

""She always came by and took care of us and never had an issue with anyone,"" Stowers said. ""A gentle kind hardworking person down to the bone. One of a kind, and an outstanding Marine. Always worked hard and never complained.""

Sgt. Mallory Harrison, who lived with Gee for three years and called her a ""sister forever,"" wrote a heartfelt Facebook post about the tragic loss.

""We've been attached at the hip from the beginning,"" Harrison said in the touching tribute. ""I can't quite describe the feeling I get when I force myself to come back to reality & think about how I'm never going to see her again.""

""Her last breath was taken doing what she loved—helping people—at HKIA in Afghanistan,"" she said of her best friend. ""Then there was an explosion. And just like that, she's gone.""

""Nothing can prepare you. My best friend. 23 years old. Gone,"" the heartbreaking post read. ""I find peace knowing that she left this world doing what she loved. She was a Marine's Marine. She cared about people. She loved fiercely. She was a light in this dark world.""

""Til Valhalla, Sergeant Nicole Gee. I can't wait to see you & your Momma up there. I love you forever & ever,"" the homage ended.

Gee is survived by her husband, who is also in the Marine Corps.

"'Noose' found at Obama Presidential Center building site in Chicago — but some conservatives are skeptical: 'I’ll take 'hate crime hoaxes' for $3,500, Alex'","A ""noose"" was found at the Obama Presidential Center site in Chicago late last week, after which the outfit building the $830 million center immediately halted construction and said it's holding anti-bias training for staff and workers.

But some notable conservatives are skeptical about the origins of the ""noose.""

What are the details?

Lakeside Alliance, which is in charge of the Center's construction, announced the discovery of the noose — but the circumstances of the discovery weren’t clear, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The paper added that Chicago police said they were investigating the incident but didn’t release details.

""We are horrified that this would occur on our site and are offering a $100,000 reward to help find the individual or individuals responsible for this shameful act,"" a statement from Lakeside Alliance read, according to the New York Post.

Lakeside Alliance consists of four minority-owned firms that have a 51 percent equity stake in the construction management contract, the Sun-Times reported.

“The noose is more than a symbol of racism, it is a heart-stopping reminder of the violence and terror inflicted on Black Americans for centuries,"" Democrat Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in regard to the reported incident, the Sun-Times said. ""I condemn this act of hate in the strongest possible terms, and the state of Illinois will make all needed resources available to help catch the perpetrators.”

Democrat Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called the discovery “disturbing"" and added that “racism and racist symbols have no place in Chicago, and those inciting it will be held responsible for this repulsive act,” the Sun-Times reported.

Hang on a sec

However, a number of prominent conservatives aren't so sure the ""noose"" is legit.

Matt Walsh sarcastically tweeted that it's ""definitely a hate crime. I can't imagine any other reason why a rope would be on a construction site. Also, this is Chicago. It's not a place known for hate crime hoaxes.""

Walsh presumably referred to the Jussie Smollett hoax, in which the actor and singer staged a fake hate crime against himself, falsely claiming that supporters of then-President Donald Trump physically attacked him near his apartment in Chicago in the middle of the night in January 2019.

Smollett said the two men wearing ski masks confronted him as he was leaving a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. in below freezing conditions and yelled ""aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before beating him up, putting a rope around his neck, pouring bleach on him, and hollering, ""This is MAGA country!"" — a reference to Trump's red ""Make America Great Again"" hats.

But once a police investigation began, Smollett's story began to crumble. A jury last December found him guilty on five of six counts of felony disorderly conduct.

'I’ll take ‘hate crime hoaxes’ for $3,500, Alex'

Other notable conservatives agreed with Walsh:

""I’ll take ‘hate crime hoaxes’ for $3,500, Alex,"" Townhall’s Scott Morefield tweeted.

""I’m guessing this is #FakeNoose,"" filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza tweeted.

""Surreeeee,"" Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe tweeted.

Anything else?

The Obama Foundation had some words for the ""noose"" discovery as well. The Sun-Times reported that it called the incident “shameless,"" and that “the act of cowardice and hate is designed to get attention and divide us. Our priority is protecting the health and safety of our workforce.”

While the Obama Foundation said the ""operations and construction of the Obama Presidential Center will be entirely funded by private donations,"" the former commander-in-chief appeared to offer a different spin on who's behind it all during last year's groundbreaking.

“It feels natural for Michelle and me to want to give back to Chicago, and to the South Side in particular. ... We will always be grateful for that, and the Obama Presidential Center is our way of repaying some of what this amazing city has given us, but we’re also building this center because we believe it can speak to the struggles of our time,” Obama said, the Sun-Times reported.

"With over 30,000 North Carolina residents left without power, leftists circulate conspiracy theory that conservative vandals are to blame","Tens of thousands of people have been left in the dark and cold after two power substations in North Carolina were blasted with gunfire over the weekend.

While engineers work to restore power and law enforcement seeks those responsible, leftists are circulating unsubstantiated rumors online, suggesting that right-wing activists seeking to shut down a drag show on Saturday night were responsible.



What are the details?

Around 8 p.m. on Saturday, power outages swept Moore County.

According to PowerOutage.US, over 45,000 residents experienced blackouts. Charlotte-based utility company Duke Energy's outage map indicated that as of early Monday afternoon, over 35,000 people were still without power.

Duke Energy officials suggested that residents could possibly be powerless until Thursday, because the damage is extensive and the repairs needed are complex.

A spokesman for the company said, ""Unlike perhaps a storm where you can go in and reroute power somewhere else, that was not an option in this case, so repair has to be complete; in many cases, some of that equipment will have to be replaced.""

The county declared a state of emergency, claiming that the electric grid had been ""intentionally attacked.""



The outages began in the Carthage area and then spread to the southern parts of Moore County.

A 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. nightly curfew has been put into effect. The Triad Business Journal noted that the curfew will remain in effect until power is restored. Schools have also been closed in the county.

With temperatures at times almost down to freezing, county officials announced on Sunday that the Moore County Sports Complex in Carthage had been turned into a shelter.

An intentional attack

The Moore County Sheriff's Office issued a statement, saying that the ""mass power outage across the county is being investigated as a criminal occurrence.""

Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields told reporters on Sunday that while a motivation had not yet been found, it was clear that someone had pulled up and ""opened fire on the substation, the same thing with the other one.""



The vandals had allegedly breached the gates at both substation sites.

Although Fields would not state whether the outages were resultant of domestic terrorism, he underscored how the incident ""was a targeted, intentional attack and was not random.""

""I can promise you, to the perpetrators out there, we will find you,"" said the sheriff.

Gov. Roy Cooper (D) tweeted that an ""attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.""



Cooper also indicated that the state is providing support as needed.

Leftist rumors

When asked whether the shooting may be linked to a Saturday night drag show at the Sunrise Theater in Southern Pines, Sheriff Ronnie Fields said, ""We've not been able to tie anything back to the drag show.""

Fields' admission did not stop leftists and LGBT activists from advancing their preferred narrative online.



Script-reader Ethan Embry claimed that ""group of christofascists has shot at power substations in Moore county to shut down a drag show happening in town. 40,000 residents are without power, people who need power for medical devices, families who need to stay warm, plunging a community into darkness. A terror attack.""



Fellow script-reader Melissa Jo Peltier, similarly convinced that critics of drag shows that sexualize children were responsible, demanded, ""Arrest them all.""

Civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo intimated that Libs of Tiktok might be partly responsible.

So-called artist Barbara Malmet expressed certainty not only that the drag show was the reason the substations were hit, but that those responsible also happened to be white.

Journalist Andy Ngo noted that, without any evidence, transsexual activist Erin Reed named specific groups he figured must be responsible.



WRAL reported that the MCSO interviewed former U.S. Army psychological operations officer Emily Grace Rainey regarding a post she made on Facebook concerning the outages, which read, ""The power is out in Moore County and I know why.""

Rainey noted that the reason why was ""that God works in mysterious ways and is responsible for the outage.""

Sheriff Fields cast significant doubt on whether Rainey had anything to do with the blackout.

According to the Fayetteville Observer, the drag show in question had been open to children but due to pressure was subsequently made an 18+ event.

Sunrise Theater executive director Kevin Dietzel suggested that changing the age and thereby precluding children from witnessing the highly sexualized performances ""adds to the stigma that people in the drag community already feel. ...

North Korea publicly executes citizen who violated COVID quarantine edicts: report,"The government of North Korea wants its subjects to understand that it is super serious about stopping the spread of COVID-19 and that the dictatorship's rules are in place to keep everybody safe.

Pyongyang is so intent on making clear the seriousness of COVID-19 lockdowns that it held a public execution of a citizen who violated the nation's quarantine orders, Radio Free Asia reported Friday.

Who was executed?

The Hermit Kingdom has repeatedly claimed to be coronavirus-free, RFA noted, but it is still instituting strict measures upon its people to prevent the spread of the virus.

Kim Jong Un's regime has employed lockdowns of entire cities and counties, canceled cultural events, and stopped travel between provinces, the outlet said. The nation declared in April that its ""emergency quarantine posture"" would go through at least the end of 2020.

But Korean smugglers who transport Chinese goods into the locked-down nation after the Sino-Korean border was completely closed in January over pandemic concerns have continued to frustrate the Norks. So the Kim government ""ratcheted up"" its COVID edicts with ""ultra-high-level emergency"" measures, a source told RFA.

""Since the end of November, the Central Committee [of the Korean Workers' Party] have ratcheted up the existing emergency quarantine measures to 'ultra-high-level emergency quarantine measures,'"" the source, who is a resident of North Pyongan province on the border with China in the country's northwest, reportedly told RFA Tuesday.

In order to make sure people understood the government meant business, the source told RFA that a citizen smuggler in his 50s was executed via firing squad on Nov. 28 for violating the lockdown and attempting to ""smuggle with Chinese business partners.""

""They held a public execution by firing squad to threaten residents here in the border area, because there's been a lot of contact with people on the other side of the border, including a lot of smuggling,"" the source said.

The source added that the ""public execution happened because the victim was charged with violating quarantine right before the ultra-high-level emergency measures took effect around November 20th.""

According to the source, the government moved the execution in order to avoid international outcry.

""They were supposed to shoot the guy in Sinuiju,"" the source said, ""but they decided to do it in Ryongchon county, because he's from that area. If they did it in Sinuiju, news would quickly spread across the border to China.""

Rumors are also spreading that, as part of its ""reign of terror,"" the government executed a currency exchange broker in the capital city who broke quarantine rules, RFA said.

Crackdown intimidation working

The Kim regime is so worried about the virus spreading that they've told soldiers monitoring the border to shoot anyone who comes within half a mile of the border, no matter their reason for being there.

And then they deployed landmines along the border area to ""increase deterrence,"" RFA said.

RFA's North Pyongan source said that at the end of November, the government's Central Committee instructed agencies and state-owned businesses to crack down on anyone violating lockdown rules by surveilling the public using police, factories, and ""neighborhood watch units.""

A North Pyongan official reportedly told RFA this week that North Korea's citizens are ""more afraid than ever due to the ever-increasing measures to control their movement.""

""While guarding the border seamlessly from the ground, in the air, and at sea, authorities ordered soldiers to shoot anyone approaching the border unconditionally, regardless of who the person is or their reason for being in the area. It is an absolute threat to the border area residents,"" the official said.

This is typical behavior from Pyongyang, the official told RFA: ""Whenever the people complain because their livelihoods are affected, the authorities always try to shut them up by threatening them with public executions or by sending them to political prison camps.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-publicly-executes-citizen-who-violated-covid-quarantine,2020-12-04
Man armed with a bow and arrow kills 5 and injures 2 in a 'gruesome' attack in Norway,"A man armed with a bow and arrow killed five people and injured two others in what was called a ""gruesome"" attack at a small town in Norway.

The attack unfolded at multiple sites in the town of Kongsberg, which is about 50 miles from the Norwegian capital of Oslo.

Police responded to several reports about a man attacking others at 6:13 p.m. Wednesday. They said that the man was simply walking around and shooting arrows at people.

Police Chief Oeyving Aas told reporters that police were able to apprehend the alleged assailant after a confrontation but he offered few details about the altercation.



The man remained unnamed by police but they said he was 37 years old and a Danish citizen who lives in the town.

Among the two people wounded was an off-duty officer who was inside a shop the suspect attacked, police said.

Acting Prime Minister Erna Solberg called the attack ""gruesome,"" according to the Associated Press.

""The local authority has brought in the crisis staff,"" said Kongsberg Mayor Kari Anne Sand, in a translation provided by WXIN-TV, ""The team have now sat together for just over an hour and we are now setting up a center to safeguard those who need it.

""From the course of events, it is natural to consider whether this is an act of terrorism,"" said Aas.

Police said they were not searching for other suspects and the motivation for the attack was still under investigation.

""The man who carried out the act has been arrested by the police, and there is no active search for more people. Based on the information we have, there is one person behind this,"" Aas said.

As a result of the attack, police, who normally require prior approval to carry firearms, were ordered to temporarily carry a firearm as a precaution.

""This is an additional emergency measure,"" read a statement from the Norwegian police. ""The police currently have no concrete indications that there is a change in the threat level in the country.""

Suspect in deadly bow-and-arrow attack had been flagged for radicalization after converting to Islam,"The suspect in a deadly bow-and-arrow attack Wednesday in Norway had been previously flagged for radicalization after he had converted to Islam.

The 37-year-old suspect had been captured by police after he allegedly attacked people in Kongsberg, a town 50 miles away from the Norwegian capital of Oslo.

Police had previously said the man was a Danish citizen and a resident of the town, which has a population of about 26,000 people.

On Thursday, Police Chief Ole B. Saeverud said the man had been flagged for possible radicalism before the attack. They identified him as Espen Andersen Braathen.

""There earlier had been worries of the man having been radicalized,"" Saeverud said to reporters.

He went on to add that there were ""complicated assessments related to the motive, and it will take time before this is clarified.""

The man previously had a restraining order against him for threatening to kill one of his parents. He also allegedly published a video proclaiming his Muslim faith and issuing a warning.

Five people were killed in the ""gruesome"" attack that also seriously injured three others, including an off-duty officer. Police said the man walked around the town targeting people, and added the detail on Thursday that he did not start targeting people until after police arrived.

Norway's domestic security office, known as the PST, said in a statement that the attack appeared to be one motivated by terrorism.

Witnesses said they heard intense screaming during the attack.

""The screaming was so intense and horrifying there was never any doubt something very serious was going on,"" said Kurt Einar Voldseth according to the Associated Press. ""I can only describe it as a 'death scream,' and it burned into my mind.""

"Not wearing mask in public is 'act of domestic terrorism,' LA County health officer declares","The health officer of Los Angeles County said that those who don't wear masks in public in response to the coronavirus pandemic are guilty of an ""act of domestic terrorism,"" the Los Angeles Daily News reported.

What are the details?

""If it were up to me, anybody not wearing a mask when they are out in public would be arrested,"" Dr. Muntu Davis said last week, according to the paper. ""That's an act of domestic terrorism and should be treated like one.""

Davis has been the county health officer since 2018.

Davis' declaration came as county public health officials have been faced with ""dramatically increased rates of transmission and potentially exponential growths of deaths in the coming weeks"" as "" hospital rooms fill up again and depleted hospital staffs scramble to keep up,"" the Daily News noted.

The paper also said health officials worry that such resources could be overwhelmed across the county as more people ignore public health guidelines.

""Limiting certain activity that can easily result in increased cases like outdoor dining at restaurants is done to try to get our case rates lower so we can move to a less restricted tier and open more businesses,"" Davis added, according to the Daily News. ""We know what we have to do, but not enough people are doing it.""

Indeed, county supervisors last week barred outdoor dining at restaurants — not that it prevented Supervisor Sheila Kuehl from doing just that only hours after her vote for the ban.

The Daily News added that county projections show COVID-19 present in roughly one in every 145 people — many of whom may not know it.

Interestingly, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer and Davis have ""acknowledged that contact tracing cannot definitively point to outdoor dining as the cause of the surge. Davis leaned on Centers for Disease Control studies. They stressed it is the only retail activity that allows customers to be mask-less for long periods of time,"" the paper added.

Anything else?

The county also issued a new health order that went into effect Monday, saying ""residents are advised to stay home as much as possible and always wear a face covering over their nose and mouth when they are outside their household and around others.""

The new order also included the following changes to the ""existing Health Officer Order"":

Gatherings: All public and private gatherings with individuals not in your household are prohibited, except for faith based services and protests, which are constitutionally protected rights.

Occupancy limits at various businesses; all individuals at these sites are required to wear face coverings and keep at least 6 feet of distance: Essential retail – 35% maximum occupancy Non-essential retail (includes indoor malls) – 20% maximum occupancy Personal care services – 20% maximum occupancy Libraries – 20% maximum occupancy Fitness centers operating outdoors – 50% maximum occupancy Museums galleries, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens operating outdoors – 50% maximum occupancy Mini-golf, batting cages, go-kart racing operating outdoors – 50% maximum occupancy



Outdoor recreation activities all which require face coverings (except for swimming) and distancing: Beaches, trails, and parks remain open; gatherings at these sites with members outside your household are prohibited. Golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball, archery ranges, skate parks, bike parks, and community gardens remain open for individuals or members of a single household. Pools that serve more than one household may open only for regulated lap swimming with one person per lane. Drive-in movies/events/car parades are permitted provided occupants in each car are members of one household.



Schools: All schools and day camps remain open adhering to re-opening protocols. K-12 Schools and Day Camps with an outbreak (3 cases or more over 14 days) should close for 14 days.



Closed non-essential businesses/activities: Playgrounds (with the exception of playgrounds at childcare and schools) Cardrooms



The new order also said that ""restaurants, bars, breweries and wineries remain closed for in-person dining and drinking, as customers are not wearing face coverings during their visit which results in an increased chance of transmission of the virus. Restaurants, wineries and breweries remain open for pick-up, delivery, and take-out. Breweries and wineries remain open for retail sales at 20% occupancy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/not-wearing-mask-in-public-is-act-of-domestic-terrorism-la-county-health-officer-declares,2020-12-01
National School Boards Association apologizes for letter to DOJ calling for investigation of parents as 'domestic terrorists',"The National School Boards Association reversed course on Friday and apologized for their controversial letter calling on President Joe Biden to have parents investigated as ""domestic terrorists.""

The letter from the NSBA claimed that school board members were under ""immediate threat"" of violence by protesting parents and was immediately assailed by critics as government overreach and intimidation.

On Friday, the NSBA apologized.

""As you all know, there has been extensive media and other attention recently around our letter to President Biden regarding threats and acts of violence against school board members,"" the statement began.

""On behalf of NSBA, we regret and apologize for the letter. To be clear, the safety of school board members, other public school officials and educators, and students is our top priority, and there remains important work to be done on this issue,"" the statement continued.

""However, there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter. We should have had a better process in place to allow for consultation on a communication of this significance,"" the organization added.

While the apology did not specify what language was unjustified in the original letter, it was likely this section:

""As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.""

Critics accused the effort of being an attempt to intimidate parents against protesting against vaccine mandates, mask mandates, critical race theory, and transgender bathroom controversies at public schools.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland had responded to the letter by announcing that the FBI would be investigating any threat of intimidation against school board members.

The newer statement went on to claim that the NSBA ""deeply valued"" the voices of the parents that they had previously referred to as ""domestic terrorists.""



They also said the organization would conduct an internal review of the processes and procedures that led to the creation of the controversial letter.

"‘Pretextual war on parents’: NSBA letter comparing parents to domestic terrorists was ordered by Biden’s education secretary, email shows","The highly controversial National School Boards Association letter sent to President Joe Biden that compared protesting parents to domestic terrorists and led the FBI to use counterterrorism tactics against parents was drafted at the direction of Biden's education secretary, Miguel Cardona, a newly obtained email indicates.

What are the details?

The potential bombshell — which raises serious concerns that the Biden administration engaged in a preconceived war on concerned American parents — was revealed in an Oct. 5 email exchange between two of the NSBA's board members, Marnie Maldonado and Kristi Swett.

In the exchange, Swett, who serves as the association's secretary-treasurer, responded to concerns from Maldonado about the letter by recounting that interim CEO Chip Slaven had ""told the [board] officers he was writing a letter to provide information to the White House, from a request by Secretary Cardona.""

The email communication was unearthed by the activist group Parents Defending Education through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Parents Defending Education previously reported that the NSBA had coordinated with the White House and the Department of Justice for weeks prior to the sending of the letter, notifying state directors that ""a letter requesting federal assistance would be sent."" The association even allegedly altered the letter's text at the White House's request.

What's the background?

What's more, the infamous letter, sent Sept. 29, was directly relied upon by Attorney General Merrick Garland in his issuing of an Oct. 4 memo dispatching the FBI to address a supposed ""disturbing spike"" of ""harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence"" against school administrators, board members, and other personnel.

In the letter, NSBA officials claimed that education leaders around the country were under ""immediate threat"" for ""approving policies for masks to protect the health and safety of students and school employees"" and ""propaganda purporting the false inclusion of critical race theory within classroom instruction and curricula.""

They urged the government to act on their behalf, in part, by classifying alleged threats from parents as acts of ""domestic terrorism"" and ""hate crimes.""

It was later revealed that the FBI did just that, creating a ""threat tag, EDUOFFICIALS,"" for agents to ""track"" any ""threats of violence or fear"" against school personnel.

Why does it matter?

If true that Cardona originally requested the letter, it would mean that the Biden administration was involved in the formulation of a policy to track and monitor parents as domestic terrorists from start to finish.

It seems that the administration only wanted the cover of an urgent request for assistance from the NSBA to bolster its predetermined plans to go after parents protesting COVID-19 policies and critical race theory teaching.

""Should this allegation be true, it would reveal that this administration's pretextual war on parents came from the highest levels,"" Nicole Neily, president of Parents Defending Education, told Fox News in a statement.

""Attorney General Merrick Garland unequivocally stated that he based his memo on the NSBA's letter — which in turn, mobilized the FBI and US Attorneys,"" she added. ""If Secretary Cardona was truly involved in this ugly episode, it is a significant breach of public trust, and he should be held accountable.""

Anything else?

In a statement, Education and Labor Committee Republican Leader Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.) said the news proved that ""from the very beginning, the targeting of concerned parents has been nothing short of a witch hunt orchestrated by partisan demagogues in the White House, Department of Justice, and the Department of Education.""

“It is abundantly clear to me that Secretary Cardona must answer to the Education and Labor Committee, Congress on the whole, and especially the American people,"" Foxx added. ""Anything less is an insult to the proud parents who want to better the education of their children. This pattern of behavior displayed by the Biden administration — let alone the Secretary of Education — is what one could expect from a political arsonist.""

New York library hosts 'drag camp' for kids age 11 and up to adopt a drag persona and perform at pride show,"A publicly funded library in upstate New York is being assailed for hosting a ""drag camp"" for children as young as 11 years old to take on a drag persona and perform at a pride drag show.

The Thompson County Library scheduled a series of classes where local drag queen Tilia Cordata would teach children to become drag queens.

The class went viral when the popular Twitter account ""Libs of TikTok"" posted a screenshot of the advertisement.

The four-week series will teach students ""about costuming, makeup, lip synching, stage presence, and more.""

Those children who finish the drag camp series will have an opportunity to perform for adults at the Downtown Ithaca Pride Festival on July 2.

The organizer of the event, a drag queen performer named Tilia Cordata, is described as ""a gal lost in time"" in the advertisement.

""Mixing modern sensibilities and activism with the bygone looks of yesteryear, from bars to brunches, libraries to lecture halls, she is sure to charm your grandparents while offending your conservative family,"" the ad proudly states. Cordata is also runs the ""Drag Me to School"" program at Cornell University and a ""Drag Wonderland Brunch,"" which is also aimed at children.

The Libs of TikTok account has been targeted by the media for simply publicizing videos of far left-wing teachers and others posted to TikTok and other social media outlets. The account has been previously censored on social media despite it only posting what people on the left willingly publicize themselves.

On Wednesday, the same account was able to shut down a drag show marketed as ""family-friendly"" that was being sponsored by a town in Indiana. LGBTQ supporters accused the account of terrorism.

Teacher fired after suggesting 'reciprocity' against NYPD gathered to mourn murdered detective Jason Rivera: '5/30/20: NYPD SUV drives into a crowd of protestors. Ideal conditions for reciprocity.',"A New York City math teacher is out of a job after he created an Instagram post suggesting ""reciprocity"" against NYPD officers gathered in the city to mourn the death of NYPD Detective Jason Rivera.

Rivera was killed last week during an ambush-style attack while responding to a domestic incident in the city.

What are the details?

Chris Flanigan, who worked at Brooklyn's Coney Island Prep, created the post in response to the massive crowd of officers that lined the city's streets to honor Rivera for his ultimate sacrifice.

He shared a snapshot of the myriad officers paying tribute to Rivera and captioned it, ""5/30/20: NYPD SUV drives into a crowd of protesters. Ideal conditions for reciprocity.""

Flanigan was apparently referring to a 2020 incident that took place following George Floyd's murder in which an NYPD vehicle drove through a group of Brooklyn protesters who were demonstrating against police.

At the time, former NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea insisted that the officers were not using the SUV to harm protesters, and then-NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio said that protesters should have moved out of the way.

No injuries were reported at the time.

Flanigan's post quickly went viral, and law enforcement officials who caught wind of the math teacher's quip found themselves at a loss over the remarks.

“For a school teacher to condone an act of terrorism is reprehensible. I wouldn’t want him giving my own children instruction of any kind,” an unnamed Manhattan police officer told the Post for its reporting on the incident.

A Brooklyn officer added, ""You have a city worker wishing physical harm or worse to fellow city workers during a solemn service. It is the ultimate act of cowardice.”

What did the school say?

The school on Sunday said that Flanigan is no longer employed at the school.

Coney Island Prep CEO Leslie Bernard Joseph issued a statement on Flanigan's termination and said, ""We do not condone or promote violence of any sort. As of this afternoon, Mr. Flanigan is no longer employed at Coney Island.""

“The teachers and staff of Coney Island Prep are public servants; and like all public servants we hold ourselves to a much higher standard,” Joseph added. “We work hard to serve the young people in our community, and we know our police officers do as well, taking innumerable risks, to keep our city safe.”



Flanigan on Sunday told the New York Post that he'd been facing death threats ever since posting the now-deleted Instagram Story.

He added that the message was ""misconstrued"" and pointed out that he was only trying to convey a message of police ""vulnerability.""

“I respect the NYPD. I do not condone violence,” he told the outlet. “A 22-year-old police officer murdered in the line of duty is reprehensible. I’m devastated by that.”

Flanigan wasn't the only one to poke the hornet's nest this weekend: On Saturday, New York City-based actress Jacqueline Guzman was removed from her theater company after commenting that street closures due to the large gathering of police officers were ”f***ing ridiculous.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-math-teacher-fired-over,2022-01-31
Obama defense secretary Leon Panetta says US will have to send combat troops back into Afghanistan after the Biden disaster: 'Our work is not done',"Count former President Barack Obama's onetime Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta as a skeptic of President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan and his insistence that America will end its ""forever war"" in the south Asian country.

In fact, Panetta is sure the U.S. is going to have to put troops back on the ground in Afghanistan soon following Thursday's suicide bombing outside the airport in Kabul.

What did he say?

Panetta was on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" Thursday evening and made it clear that the ongoing chaos in Afghanistan shows that ""our work is not done"" there and that the military will need to be back in the country soon to fight ISIS.

Burnett pressed Panetta on whether Biden should stick to his Aug. 31 deadline.

Panetta responded, ""Bottom line is that our work is not done in Afghanistan.""

""I know we'll be removing our troops by a certain date, but the bottom line is our work is not done,"" he continued. ""We're going to have to go after ISIS. I'm glad the president said that we're going to hunt them down and make them pay a price for what they did in killing our warriors and we should. We're going to have to go back in to get ISIS.""

Not only will the U.S. need to take down ISIS for its deadly attack on American troops and Afghans at the airport, he noted, but also to fight al Qaeda when it surely returns under the Taliban.

""We're probably going to go have to go back in when al Qaeda resurrects itself, as they will with this Taliban,"" Panetta said. ""They've gave safe haven to al Qaeda before. They'll probably do it again.""

It's all about the War on Terror, the former top spy said: ""I understand that we're trying to get our troops out of there, but the bottom line is we can leave a battlefield but we can't leave the war on terrorism, which still is a threat to our security.""

Burnett noted that what Panetta is calling for runs directly counter to what Biden wants.

Too bad, Panetta replied.

""What we're going to be doing is counterterrorism operations,"" he said. ""We're going to have to go after those that are responsible. I think we have pretty good intelligence on the leadership of ISIS. I think there's a pretty good chance we can identify who is involved with this attack.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-defense-secretary-leon-panetta-troops-afghanistan,2021-08-27
"Ocasio-Cortez says corporate greed caused inflation, not Biden policies, and claims we're 'facing an environment of fascism' from voter intimidation","Socialist Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York denied that government policies exacerbated inflation and instead blamed corporate greed while claiming Americans were in an ""environment of fascism.""

Ocasio-Cortez made the claims while being interviewed by MSNBC host Chris Hayes on his show. She was addressing how Democrats were failing in polls ahead of the midterm elections because of the weak economy.

""Even when we talk about issues like inflation. A lot of this has to do with the massive consolidation of our markets and corporate greed,"" she claimed emphatically.

""Our inflation is not going up due to government policies, inflation is going up due to Wall Street decisions,"" she angrily said.

Earlier in the interview, she also said America was facing ""an environment of fascism"" from Republican candidates running for Congress in the midterms in reference to some citizens, mostly on the right, ostensibly guarding voter ballot boxes from voter fraud.

""There is absolutely no doubt that the data shows that the vast majority of incidents of domestic terror come from white nationalism,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

""And that we are really truly facing an environment of fascism and in the United States of America,"" she continued, ""this type of intimidation at the polls brings us to Jim Crow, it bring us back and hearkens back to a very unique form of American apartheid that is not that long past ago. And we have never fully healed from it. And those wounds threaten to rip right back open if we do not strongly defend democracy in United States of America.""

Ocasio-Cortez was repeating a well-worn defense used by Democrats and others to try to defend President Joe Biden and his high-spending policies from those saying they made inflation worse. Polls show that Americans mostly blame Biden's policies for inflation ahead of a key midterm election season.

Ilhan Omar's office claims ads from pro-Israel group are putting her 'life at risk' by 'baselessly' quoting from her statements,"Leftist Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) has had no problem likening the United States to Hamas and the Taliban or accusing Israel of committing ""unthinkable atrocities"" and horrible human rights abuses.

But if pro-Israel groups hit back, her modus operandi appears to be to get testy and accuse them of putting her life in danger.

What happened?

In June, Omar upset a large number of people by equating the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban.

Omar claimed in a tweet that the U.S., Israel, Hamas, and the Taliban have all committed ""unthinkable atrocities"" and human rights abuses.

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity,"" she said as the world was still dealing with the repercussions of thousands of Hamas rocket attacks on Israel in May.

The tweet included a clip of Omar questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken on how those who perpetrate human rights abuses — including, she said, Hamas, the Taliban, and Israeli security forces — will be held accountable.

Even a dozen of her fellow Democratic lawmakers came out to condemn her statements. After the dustup, reports surfaced that the rift between Omar and congressional Democrats was more significant than previously reported, with some Democratic lawmakers reportedly calling her an ""anti-Semite"" privately.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, also known as AIPAC, began running an ad recently that goes directly after the lawmaker's attacks on the United States and Israel.

And Omar did not take kindly to AIPAC's criticisms, Fox News reported.



Her spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, hopped on Twitter Wednesday to claim the group's attack ads — which responded directly to the congresswoman's statements — were ""Islamophobic"" and to accuse the group of endangering Omar's life.

""The language AIPAC uses in paid ads to smear and vilify [Rep. Omar] is virtually identical to the language used in death threats she gets,"" Slevin said in a post that included a screenshot of an AIPAC ad that took issue with Omar's statements. ""Make no mistake: AIPAC is putting Rep. Omar's life at risk with repeated Islamophobic attack ads.""

""It shouldn't have to be stated, but baselessly linking Muslim-Americans to terrorism is *the* textbook example of Islamophobia and is routinely used to silence advocacy for Palestinian human rights,"" he continued.

Fellow ""Squad"" member and radical leftist Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) responded to Slevin's post with a tweet of her own: ""I am so sick of this s**t.""

Image source: Twitter/@RashidaTlaib screenshot

AIPAC replied to Slevin's attack by saying, ""Your baseless attack on us can't deflect from [Omar's] attack on America and Israel.""



""It is outrageous for Rep. Omar to put the U.S. and Israel on the same level as the Taliban and Hamas,"" the group added. ""There is no moral equivalence between democratic allies and the terrorists who target them.""

Ilhan Omar accuses Jewish Democrats of not being 'partners in justice' and says she doesn't regret comparing the US to terrorists,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday about her recent controversial statements and she doubled down in response.

Omar was asked if she regretted comparing the United States and Israel to Hamas terrorists and she said she did not regret saying it, despite having walked back the comments after being criticized by others in her party.

""Do you regret these comments?"" asked Tapper.

""I don't,"" she responded. ""I think it's really important to think back to the point that I was trying to make. Obviously, I was addressing Secretary of State Blinken.""

""The cases are put together in front of the [International Criminal Court]. ICC has been investigating, I know that, you know, some of my colleagues don't lend legitimacy to the ICC, but I tend to think that people around the world who have experience with injustice, need to be able to have a place where they can go,"" she continued.

""And as a country that helped found the ICC and supported it,"" she added, ""I think it is really important for us to continue to find ways in which people can find justice around the world.""

Omar was also pressed during the interview about comments she made about Jews that many called anti-Semitic, and she blamed Jewish Democrats for not being aligned to her political agenda.

""Do you understand why some of your fellow House Democrats especially the Jews find that language anti-Semitic?"" asked Tapper after listing examples of Omar's controversial speech.

""I have welcomed any time, you know, my colleagues have asked to have a conversation, to learn from them, for them to learn from me,"" Omar responded.

""I think it's really important for these members to realize that they haven't been partners in justice, they haven't been, you know, equally engaging in seeking justice around the world. And I think I will continue to do that. It is important for me as someone who knows what it feels like to experience injustice in ways that my colleagues don't to be a voice in finding accountability,"" she added.

Omar's comments garnered renewed ire from groups opposing anti-Semitism.

""Shocking - Ilhan Omar refusing to take ANY accountability for her obscene antisemitism,"" tweeted Stop Antisemitism.

""Instead she has the audacity to blame Jewish members of Congress. When will this vile bigot finally be censured and properly reprimanded by her party? Enough is enough!"" they added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/omar-ilhan-antisemitism-jews-terrorism,2021-06-30
'He was the punching bag for his sister and her wife': Lesbian couple accused of murdering and torturing a 10-year-old boy admit they dislocated his vertebrae and jaw,"A 28-year-old lesbian in northwest Indiana pled guilty on Nov. 15 to felony neglect resulting in a 10-year-old boy's gruesome death. Prosecutors indicated that the abuse of the child, which 28-year-old April Wright admitted to participating in with her ""wife"" over a prolonged period of time, was tantamount to torture.

What are the details?

April Wright admitted in her plea agreement that she and her ""wife"" Rachel Wright, 28, dislocated two of Leviticus Kuchta's cervical vertebrae and his jaw, resulting in his death.

Cervical vertebrae are the spinal bones stacked on top of each other in the neck to protect the spinal cord immediately below the skull.

Prosecutors noted in court filings that the child had been ""repeatedly isolated and tortured"" by the lesbian couple who, per a report from the (Northwest Indiana) Times, had been entrusted with his care.

The Times reported that a forensic pathologist for the Lake County coroner's office concluded that the child had died from a dislocation of his cervical vertebrae caused by blunt force trauma.



Kutcha's body was found on Oct. 12, 2020, at a home in the 7100 block of Fillmore Street in Merrillville, Indiana. Another child, three years old, found at the scene was reportedly rescued by Child Protective Services from ""deplorable living conditions.""

According to court records, Rachel and April Wright initially told police that Kuchta had succumbed to injuries sustained while riding a dirt bike. That narrative was quickly quashed after officers found dust, shrubs, and spiderwebs on the bike, suggesting it hadn't recently been used, reported the Associated Press.

Neighbors confirmed the child had not been seen outside for months.

The Chicago Tribune indicated that the boy's grandmother had been attempting to gain custody of the child, who had pleaded for her to take him ""home"" during one phone call. The lesbian couple allegedly dissuaded her, saying that Kuchta had COVID-19.

Unimaginable pain and horror

Prosecutors indicated that notwithstanding the severe wounds the lesbian couple had inflicted on Kuchta, they never once sought medical care for the child. Instead, they covered his wounds with makeup.

Extra to the blunt force trauma that ultimately killed him, Kuchta reportedly had suffered puncture wounds and lacerations to his ""scalp, forehead, cheeks, nose, lips, ears, neck, shoulder, upper back, lower back, both arms, both hands, genitals, right hip, both lower legs, both feet and toes."" The boy's jaw was dislocated on both sides of his face, rendering him unable to speak.

Dr. Zhou Wang of the coroner's office indicated that the boy likely would have been unable to use his hands or left foot, owing to multiple infections, skin ulcers and necrosis, reported Law & Crime.

The coroner also indicated, on the basis of traumas observed at various stages of healing, that the lesbian couple's terror had likely been as long as it had been severe.

Lake County Supervisory Deputy Prosecutor Michelle Jatkiewicz wrote in court documents that Kutcha ""was the punching bag for his sister and her wife. ... They had complete access to Leviticus, who had not access to help. The only way he would leave that house was in a body bag. And that is what ultimately happened.""

Death penalty state

April Wright's plea agreement states she had not only witnessed Rachel Wright brutalize the boy but joined the 28-year-old in inflicting horrible injuries upon the child. Neither woman, per the agreement, bothered to intervene despite knowing the injuries could be fatal.

April Wright's sentencing hearing is on Jan.19. If Judge Gina L. Jones accepts the plea deal, April could face 20 to 35 years in prison.

Extra to the neglect charge, both April and Rachel Wright have been charged with murder, aggravated battery, and battery of a person under the age of 14.

When charged for Kutcha's murder, April had already been on probation for battering a former girlfriend in a motel room in 2019.

Indiana is a death-penalty state.



As part of her own plea deal, wherein she admitted guilt to one count of felony neglect in connection to Kuchta's untimely death, Rachel Wright agreed to testify against the boy's older sister. On account of her agreement to testify against her ""wife,"" Rachel Wright's trial will not begin until April's has been resolved.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/one-of-two-lesbians-accused-of-torturing-10-year-old-boy-to-death-admits-they-dislocated-his-vertebrae-and-jaw,2022-11-23
Oregon pro-life pregnancy center set on fire in 'suspicious' attack,"Authorities said Friday they are investigating the suspected arson of a Oregon pregnancy center in what appears to be yet another attack on a pro-life organization ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court's highly anticipated abortion decision.

The Seattle Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Friday it was assisting police in Gresham, Ore., investigate a fire at the Gresham Pregnancy Resource Center. ATF said the fire was ""suspicious in nature.""

According to First Image, the Christian pro-life organization that owns the pregnancy center, the building was set ablaze at about 3 a.m. on Friday. Police and fire authorities said it appeared that an ""incendiary device"" was thrown through a window, First Image said in a post on its website.

The pregnancy center's alarm system alerted authorities, and firemen were able to extinguish the fire. The damage was mostly contained to one room, but it was extensive and there is additional water and smoke damage in other parts of the building, the group said.



Nobody was hurt.

“We don’t know who’s involved in this. But there’s enough to tell us that it is suspicious in nature,” Gresham fire chief Jason McGowan told KOIN-TV on Friday. “And that’s why we need to have multiple agencies looking into it and seeing what exactly happened this morning.”

This attack follows the alleged firebombing of a pro-life pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, by pro-abortion terrorists and a string of vandalism and crimes against other pro-life groups.

""The kind of outrage that’s being directed at us is based on a complete misunderstanding and misrepresentation of who we are and how we have served the hundreds of thousands of people that have come to us over the decades,"" First Image CEO Luke Cirillo said. ""This moment in our culture is volatile, and the spillover into violence is deeply destructive to the fabric of our communities. We reject and refuse to have any part in the culture of hate. Jesus has modeled a different way. It’s the way of love. That narrow way includes, as a challenge to us all, the love of those who hate us.""

The U.S. government has been preparing for a potential surge in political violence once the Supreme Court releases its decision in a high-profile abortion case concerning Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. A leaked draft opinion for the case indicated the court has voted to uphold the abortion ban and overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade opinion, which would end constitutional protections for abortion.

A terrorism advisory bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security issued last week said ""several high-profile events could be exploited to justify acts of violence against a range of possible targets.""

""Given a high-profile U.S. Supreme Court case about abortion rights, individuals who advocate both for and against abortion have, on public forums, encouraged violence, including against government, religious, and reproductive healthcare personnel and facilities, as well as those with opposing ideologies,"" the DHS said.

An internal memo circulated by the department last month said that law enforcement agencies have monitored threats on social media to burn down or storm the Supreme Court building and murder justices, as well as attack houses of worship or abortion clinics.



A man was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his Maryland home last week. He had brought a firearm to Kavanaugh's residence and confessed to police that he's been having suicidal thoughts and traveled from California to Maryland to kill Kavanaugh.

As the attacks on pro-life groups and the attempted murder of a Supreme Court justice demonstrate, the violence is no longer hypothetical and is escalating.

"2 killed, more than 20 injured in attack on LGBTQ festival in Norway, officials say killer is a Muslim extremist","Two people were killed and more than 20 others were injured at a mass shooting incident at an LGBTQ festival in Oslo, Norway, and officials said the attacker is a Muslim extremist.

Police said a man began shooting into crowds of people at three locations of the event including a gay bar called the London Pub on Saturday morning. The business is the largest gay bar in Oslo.

Officials were able to apprehend a suspect soon after the shooting.

Police said the suspect was a 42-year-old Norwegian citizen who immigrated from Iran. The media identified the man as Zaniar Matapour. Police said he was a radicalized Muslim with a history of mental illness.

Officials were also able to recover two weapons believed to be used in the attack: a handgun and an automatic weapon.

Matapour is being held on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and terrorism. Officials had said he is not cooperating with the investigation and has not indicated what motivated the attack.

“Everything indicates that this has been an attack by an Islamist extremist,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere.

He later addressed the Muslim community on Sunday during a memorial service for the victims.

“I know how many of you felt when it turned out that the perpetrator belonged to the Islamic community,"" said Stoere. ""Many of you experienced fear and unrest. You should know this: We stand together, we are one community and we are responsible for the community together.""

Matapour reportedly arrived in Norway with his family in the 1990s. He also had a criminal record including possession of a knife and a narcotics offense.

Activists hoped to organize a demonstration on Monday to show support for LGBTQ causes despite the attack but a police warning led to the cancellation of that event.

Norway has also raised its terror threat alert to the highest level.

Israeli forces slammed for carrying out ‘field execution’ after shooting Palestinian terrorist. The full video shows a much different story.,"Pro-Palestinian leaders and activists decried a recent Israeli police response to a terrorist as a ""field execution"" over the weekend after a truncated video circulated on social media showing Israeli forces shooting the suspect while he lay on the ground. But then Israeli police released surveillance footage showing the whole incident.

What happened?

Israeli border police shot and killed a 25-year-old Palestinian man, Muhammad Salima, near the Old City of Jerusalem on Saturday after the suspect stabbed a young Orthodox Jewish man in the streets, the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported. It was the fifth such attack in Jerusalem since September.

Salima, who had reportedly entered the country illegally, repeatedly stabbed the Orthodox man before running toward approaching officers and lunging at them with his knife. The officers responded by shooting Salima several times, causing him to fall to the ground, where he died.

The Orthodox victim was transported to the hospital with moderate to severe wounds and is expected to recover, and Israel's internal police investigations unit launched a routine investigation into the incident.

But shortly after the attack, activists began sharing a shortened video of the confrontation that began after Salima had committed the stabbing. In the video, he can be seen lying on the ground as Israeli officers open fire on him.

(Warning: The following content is graphic in nature and may be disturbing to some viewers).

In one tweet, Mahmoud Refaat, president of the European Institute for International Law, said, ""Israeli forces carry out field execution of a young man in occupied city of Jerusalem today. It is clear from the clip the man is lying on ground and does NOT represent a danger, which makes the crime state terrorism.""

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry reportedly also called the shooting a ""field execution.""

""There was once talk of ‘neutralization.’ He’s on the ground and a homicide video is being made of him. Execution of a person who no longer poses a threat is a horrible and terrible crime. This is the reality that the occupation produces,” added Aida Touma-Sliman, a member of the Israeli Knesset from the Hadash party, according to the JTA.

“Field executions, no matter the context, are unjustified,” tweeted Mohammed El-Kurd, a prominent Palestinian commentator who lives in Jerusalem

What else?

However, full video of the incident released by the Israeli Foreign Ministry completely discredits claims that an ""execution"" occurred.

(Warning: The following content is graphic in nature and may be disturbing to some viewers).

In light of the two border officers' heroic actions, Public Security Minister Omer Barlev on Sunday offered public support for them, saying they “acted as required"" when they shot Salima.

“They entered into combat, did not hesitate, and neutralized [the target] appropriately. This is what we expect from police officers, the Border Police, and the IDF,” Barlev said, according to the Times of Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, too, praised the officers for “act[ing] very quickly and resolutely, as is expected of police officers, against a terrorist who tried to murder an Israeli civilian.""

“I wish to convey to them my full backing,"" he added. ""That is how our forces are expected to act and that is how they acted. We must not allow our capital to become a terror hotspot.”

Bennett also warned against rushing to judgment before the full set of facts is made available, as many did in response to the shooting.

The two border officers involved in the incident reportedly have since received their guns back and have returned to active duty.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/palestinian-terrorist-stabbing-jerusalem-video,2021-12-06
Palestinians attacked the tomb of Joseph in a 'frenzy of destruction',"The tomb where the biblical figure Joseph is said to be buried has been vandalized by Palestinians as violence and chaos continues to escalate in the region.

The site in Nablus was attacked in what Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett described as a “frenzy of destruction.”

The BBC reported that the tomb was vandalized Saturday as Israeli forces raided a town providing cover for a Palestinian terrorist who opened fire on a bar in Tel Aviv Thursday.

The Palestinian attack left three Israelis dead and 11 injured.

Videos posted on social media showed Palestinians vandalizing light fixtures hanging above the tomb and throwing chunks of rubble at the tomb itself.

The Israel Foreign Ministry tweeted, “On Friday, tens of thousands of Muslims prayed in Jerusalem on Ramadan. On Saturday, Palestinian extremists vandalized the holy site of Joseph’s tomb. Israel is committed to peaceful coexistence and to freedom of worship. Extremists must be shunned and condemned.”

The Palestinians reportedly also started fires in rooms adjacent to the tomb.

Brigadier Gen. Ran Kochav, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said that the perpetrators were detained by Palestinian security forces.

PM Bennett said that the Palestinian rioters had “simply vandalized a holy place for us, the Jews” and vowed to bring them to justice.

The tomb is an important landmark in both Islamic and Jewish cultures. Jews believe it to be the resting place of Joseph, and Muslims view it as either the tomb of Joseph or the resting place of an Islamic cleric named Sheikh Yousef Dawiqat.

The tomb has previously been at the center of Palestinian caused violence in 2000 and 2015.

Nablus is under Palestinian control, so Jewish pilgrims typically can typically visit the tomb only after coordinating with the IDF. Last Monday, two ultra-Orthodox Jewish men — who reportedly had not obtained permission from the IDF — were shot and wounded while trying to visit Joseph’s tomb.

The Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said that the scale of the IDF’s involvement in stopping terrorism is “dictated only by the operational need.”

Gantz indicated that the Israeli government is working to distinguish those who support terrorist plots and those who are active in carrying them out from the broader Palestinian population.

“We try to differentiate between the population and the perpetrators of terrorism, and between the different geographical environments,"" Gantz said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/palestinians-attacked-tomb-of-joseph-in-frenzy-of-destruction,2022-04-11
Parents org fires back over allegations parents angry at school boards have engaged in 'domestic terrorism',"Parents Defending Education, an organization representing hundreds of thousands of parents nationwide, has responded to allegations by the National School Board Association that vocal parents are engaging in ""domestic terrorism.""



What is the background?

Last month, the NSBA wrote President Joe Biden requesting federal intervention over alleged threats, intimidation, and violence against school board members.

The NSBA claimed school board members are under ""immediate threat"" from parents angry over a myriad of issues, but specifically cited COVID-related mandates, such as face masks in schools, and ""because of propaganda purporting the false inclusion of critical race theory within classroom instruction and curricula.""

The NSBA requested swift action from federal law enforcement agencies, and urged the government to classify the alleged threats and intimidation as ""domestic terrorism"" and ""hate crimes.""

How did PDE respond?

In response, PDE — which says it represents more than 427,000 parents — called out the NSBA for a ""thinly veiled threat"" to silence parents angry about COVID-related mandates and woke teaching.

""NSBA cites a tiny number of minor incidents in order to insinuate that parents who are criticizing and protesting the decisions of school boards are engaging in, or may be engaging in, 'domestic terrorism and hate crimes.' NSBA even invokes the PATRIOT Act,"" PDE said in a statement.

""The association of legitimate protest with terrorism and violence reveals both your contempt for parents and your unwillingness to understand and hear the sincere cries of parents on behalf of their children,"" the statement continued. ""To equate parents with terrorists dishonors the thousands of victims of actual terrorism around the world. Have you no shame?""



""Your letter to President Biden is a thinly veiled threat, intended to intimidate into silence and submission the very constituents that your members ostensibly represent,"" PDE added.

The statement explained parents are also angry, in part, about a lack of transparency in school boards.

Citizens are angry that school boards and school officials around the country are restricting access to public meetings, limiting public comment, and in some cases conducting business via text messages in violation of state open meetings laws. They are angry that schools are charging them thousands of dollars in public records requests to view curriculum and training materials that impact their children and that should be open to the public by default.



They are angry that pandemic-related learning losses have compounded the already-low reading, writing, and math proficiency rates in America's schools. They are angry that rather than focusing on declining student achievement, large numbers of districts have chosen to fund, often with hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money, ""social justice"" and ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" programs with finite resources.

""We will not be bullied. We will not have our speech chilled. We have a constitutional right to petition our elected officials, and we will continue to do so,"" the statement said.

How did the government respond?

Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Monday he had dispatched the FBI in response to the NSBA's request for federal law enforcement assistance.

Garland said the Justice Department is ""committed to using its authority and resources,"" and will, in the coming days, ""announce a series of measures designed to address the rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/parents-org-school-boards-domestic-terrorism,2021-10-06
Parents of suspected Michigan high school shooter charged in mass shooting; prosecutor says they 'contributed to this tragedy',"The parents of a teen accused of going on a killing rampage at a Michigan high school were charged on Friday. The prosecutor said the parents knew of their son's disturbing warning signs. The prosecutor claimed the parents committed ""egregious"" mistakes, which ultimately enabled the teen to purportedly murder four Oxford High School students.

Parents Jennifer and James Crumbley were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison.

""Under Michigan law, an involuntary manslaughter charge can be pursued if prosecutors believe someone contributed to a situation where harm or death was high,"" NBC News reported.

Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said the parents committed ""egregious"" acts and their actions went ""far beyond negligence.""

According to WMAQ-TV, ""McDonald said the parents 'were the only individuals in the position to know the access to weapons.' She said the gun used in the shootings 'seems to have been just freely available to that individual.'""

During a Friday press conference, McDonald said, ""These charges are intended to hold the individuals who contributed to this tragedy accountable and also send the message that gun owners have a responsibility. When they fail to uphold that responsibility, there are serious and criminal consequences.""

On Nov. 26, James Crumbley allegedly purchased a 9mm Sig Sauer SP 2022 – the firearm reportedly used in the shooting. A store employee at the gun store in Oxford confirmed to authorities that the shooter was with his father at the time of the purchase, the Detroit Free Press reported.

The prosecutor said on the same day that the gun was purchased, the 15-year-old posted photos of the handgun with the caption: ""Just got my new beauty today."" The next day, Jennifer Crumbley posted on social media with the caption: ""Mom and son day testing out his new Christmas present.""

The day before the shooting, a teacher at Oxford High School noticed the teen searching for ammunition on his cell phone during class. She reported that information to school officials, according to McDonald. School officials attempted to contact the boy's mother over the phone and by email.

McDonald said Jennifer Crumbley joked about him getting caught and texted her son, ""LOL, I'm not mad at you, you have to learn not to get caught.""

The night before the shooting, the suspect made a video ""wherein he talked about shooting and killing students the next day at Oxford High School,"" according to Lt. Tim Willis of the Oakland County Sheriff's Office.

On the day of the shooting, McDonald said the teen's teacher noticed him doodling a gun pointing at the words: ""The thoughts won't stop, help me."" He also purportedly drew a bullet and a person who appeared to be shot with the words ""blood everywhere."" The high school sophomore also wrote, ""My life is useless,"" and ""The world is dead.""

The boy was taken out of the classroom and brought to an office in the school. The boy's parents were summoned to the school and met with school officials around 10 a.m., according to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard.

During the meeting, James and Jennifer Crumbley were allegedly shown the drawing, which had been altered by that time. School administrators told the parents to get their son into counseling with 48 hours, according to the prosecutor.

""Both James and Jennifer Crumbley failed to ask if their son had his gun with him or where his gun was located and failed to inspect his backpack for the presence of the gun, which he had with him,"" McDonald said. ""The notion that a parent could read those words and also know their son had access to a deadly weapon, that they gave him, is unconscionable and I think it's criminal.""

The parents allegedly left the school without their son — who returned to class.

Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Marc Keast said surveillance cameras show the suspect entering a school bathroom ""just before 12:51 p.m."" with a backpack.

""A minute or two later, he exited the same bathroom without the backpack, but with a gun in hand,"" Keast said. ""At that point, he methodically and deliberately walked down a hallway, aiming the firearm at students and firing.""



McDonald said that once news broke that there was an active shooter at Oxford High School, Jennifer Crumbley texted her son at 1:22 p.m.: ""Don't do it.""

At 1:37 p.m., James Crumbley reportedly called 911 to report that his gun was missing from his house, and he believed that his son could be the school shooter.

McDonald said the gun had been stored in an unlocked drawer in the parents' bedroom.

Lt. Willis said a journal was recovered from the suspect's backpack ""detailing his desire to shoot up a school to include murdering students.""

The teen is accused of killing four students — Hana St. Juliana (14), Tate Myre (16), Madisyn Baldwin (17), and Justin Shilling (17). Seven others were injured during the mass shooting – three were in stable condition at hospitals at the time of this article.

The suspect was charged as an adult with two dozen crimes, including first-degree murder, attempted murder, gun crimes, and terrorism. He could face up to life in prison, if convicted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/parents-school-shooter-charged-timeline,2021-12-03
"PayPal walks back update to user policy that threatened a $2,500 penalty for spreading 'misinformation'","On September 26, the financial technology company PayPal announced updates to its user policy. Documents on the company's website as of Saturday evening indicated that the company would confiscate $2,500 directly from the accounts of users found guilty, at ""PayPal's sole discretion,"" of so-called ""misinformation"" or ""discrimination of protected groups.""

Although it was not made clear what might constitute ""misinformation"" or ""discrimination,"" the company's censorial alliances with the leftist Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League, as well as its track record of targeting conservative and religious groups prompted concerns of a politically biased application of the policy.

It appears, however, that PayPal is walking back the language included in the policy update.

A PayPal spokesman notified TheBlaze that an ""AUP notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information. PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy.""

""Our teams are working to correct our policy pages. We're sorry for the confusion this has caused.""

Ahead of the update, David Marcus, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Lightspark, tweeted ""@PayPal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with.""

Christina Pushaw, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' (R) rapid response director suggested that PayPal ought to pay a $2,500 fine for spreading ""misinformation"" about itself.

PayPal's policy

As of October 8, PayPal's new ""Acceptable Use Policy"" stated that, effective November 3, activities (i.e., the sending, posting, or publication of any messages, content, or materials) may qualify as violations if the company decides they are:

""harmful, obscene, harassing, or objectionable"";

""depict promote, or incite hatred or discrimination of protected groups or of individuals of groups based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, religion gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, etc.)""; or

""are fraudulent, promote misinformation, or are unlawful.""

For each violation, a user may be subject to ""damages, including liquidated damages of $2,500.00 U.S. dollars ... which may debited directly from your PayPal account(s).""

This document has since been taken down, although TheBlaze obtained a copy.

PayPal's AUP (October 8, 2022)

PayPal's track record

PayPal has previously made clear that it is not a neutral organization, politically, culturally or otherwise. Dan Schulman, the company's CEO, stated that ""businesses need to be a force for good in those values and issues they believe in.""

Despite claiming that the company respects and values ""uniqueness and diversity of thought,"" last month, PayPal shut down the accounts of the Free Speech Union and Gays Against Groomers ""with no clear explanation.""

The FSU had been critical of the proliferation of ""radical gender theory"" in British schools. FSU founder Toby Young suggested the de-platforming to have been politically motivated and ultimately a ""sinister form of cancel culture.""

Gays Against Groomers remarked after its ban that ""more and more companies are coming out in full support of the sexualization, indoctrination, and medicalization of minors.""

In September, PayPal also shut down UsForThem, a campaign group that advocated for reopening schools during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

In January, PayPal permanently banned journalist Ian Miles Cheong without giving an explicit reason why. Cheong indicated ""it had everything to do with my politics.""

It's not just journalists and advocacy groups that PayPal has clamped down on. In 2019, it similarly went after conservative street artist Sabo, reportedly banning him and withholding his earnings for six months.

Partners in censorship

In 2019, PayPal revealed it was working with the SPLC to identify users to ban.

Among the groups and organizations lumped in with terror groups on the SPLC's so-called ""hate map"" are: the Center for Immigration Studies; ACT for America; the American Freedom Law Center; Catholic Family News; the Family Research Council; the John Birch Society; Women Fighting For America; Idaho Constitutional Sheriffs; Protect America Now; and the RAIR Foundation.

According to the SPLC, an organization ""does not need to have engaged in criminal conduct or have followed their speech with actual unlawful action to be labeled a hate group.""

The SPLC, which has been sued numerous times for defamation, was accused by one former staffer of exaggerating hate to improve fundraising figures and ""bilk"" donors.

In addition to libeling law-abiding groups with whom it disagrees on political and cultural issues, the SPLC has reportedly opened up certain groups to violence. In 2012, a terrorist targeted the Family Research Council after having found it on the SPLC's so-called hate map.

Last year, PayPal announced it was also partnering with the ADL to ""fight extremism and protect marginalized communities.""

The ADL's threshold for what constitutes an extremist is exceptionally low.

For instance, Libs of TikTok, the Twitter account that has exposed liberals who sexualized children, made the ADL's ""Glossary of Extremism.""

Included in the lists of groups the ADL accuses of extremism and hate are those Christian organizations that do not support gay marriage, including the Family Research Council.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/paypal-updates-user-policy-to-include-2500-penalty-on-wrongthink,2022-10-09
"With 9/11-style commission stalled, Pelosi plans completely partisan probe of Capitol riot and surrounding events","With her pipe dream of launching a bipartisan ""independent 9/11-type commission"" to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol foiled, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) is reportedly moving on to a ""Plan B"" that won't require Republican cooperation.

The House speaker is said to be making arrangements for an entirely partisan probe to unearth the secret influences that she believes led to the incident, which Democratic lawmakers view as an attempted insurrection and a domestic terror attack instigated by former President Donald Trump.

In the new plan, according to Politico, Pelosi aims to effectively cut Republican influence out of the process by ""tapping three House committees, run by Democrats, to do their own probe of how a violent, pro-Trump mob managed to overwhelm police and terrorize legislators.""

So much for bipartisanship. Though it should be noted Pelosi's draft proposal for the grand commission would have given Democrats a 7-4 majority on the investigatory panel, anyway. In addition to that, Republicans in Congress suspected from the start that any 9/11-style commission into the incident spearheaded by Democrats would quickly turn into a political witch hunt.

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said as much last month when he threw cold water on the proposal, characterizing it as ""partisan by design."" He shot back at Pelosi by insisting that any ""broader analysis of toxic political violence"" must include a review of the Black Lives Matter riots that destroyed cities across the country last year.

According to Politico, even with talks stalled, Pelosi is still hopeful a commission can be formed and has recently circulated a ""discussion draft"" on the proposal to colleagues. But the House speaker is prepared to move on if no headway is made, the news outlet reported:

The speaker has made clear that her patience is not unlimited. And an aide indicated that the California Democrat is prepared to task the House Administration, Homeland Security and Appropriations committees with taking on the Jan. 6 inquiry if there are no bipartisan breakthroughs soon. The Appropriations panel has already gotten a head start, holding hearings on the Capitol Police budget that featured questions about the force's role in the response to the attack.

It's worth wondering whether Pelosi's partisan ""Plan B"" was her ""Plan A"" all along, given that the chances of a bipartisan commission being formed were always quite low.

After all, the House speaker's inclinations about what, or who, spurred on the attack would never have been embraced by Republicans in Congress. In a podcast conversation shortly after the riot, Pelosi and failed 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton floated a conspiracy theory that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin worked together to plan the attack.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-partisan-probe-capitol-riot,2021-03-19
Pennsylvania School Boards Association quits national group over letter calling parents 'domestic terrorists',"The Pennsylvania School Boards Association has voted to quit the National School Boards Association, writing that a recent NSBA letter to the Biden administration that likened protesting parents to ""domestic terrorists"" was the impetus for its decision.

""The most recent national controversy surrounding a letter to President Biden suggesting that some parents should be considered domestic terrorists was the final straw,"" the Pennsylvania association wrote in an internal memo.

In late September, the NSBA wrote to President Joe Biden stating that school board members nationwide were ""under an immediate threat"" from concerned parents and residents opposed to critical race theory, transgender policies, and COVID-19 mask and vaccine mandates. The letter requested federal assistance in response to incidents of violence at raucous school board protests and alleged threats made against some school board members.

The letter cited more than 20 examples of loud protests against school boards in recent months, as irate parents have confronted school officials over school mask mandates, prolonged school closures during the pandemic, pornographic material being taught in K-12 classrooms, ""racist"" lessons based on critical race theory, and more.

""As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes,"" the NSBA told Biden.

In response, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Oct. 4 that the Department of Justice is ""committed to using its authority and resources"" to address alleged threats and violence, drawing fire from critics who said the Biden administration was unfairly targeting concerned parents.

The Pennsylvania School Boards Association is among those critics. The state association wrote that the NSBA's ""misguided approach has made our work and that of many school boards more difficult. It has fomented more disputes and cast partisanship in our work on behalf of school directors.""

""PSBA abhors the fact that some boards have been met with threats and violence. We are absolutely opposed to such actions. A school board meeting needs to be the model of democracy in action — locally elected officials hearing from the public as local solutions are debated and formulated. ... However, attempting to solve the problems with a call for federal intervention is not the place to begin, nor a model for promoting greater civility and respect for the democratic process,"" the association wrote.

The PSBA said that among the other reasons to dissolve its ties to the national group are that the NSBA ""is not focused on bipartisanship, civility and seeking solutions to the internal problems that have plagued the national organization for so long.""

""The PSBA Governing Board has directed PSBA staff to develop additional services and resources to meet the ongoing, evolving needs of our membership. We intend to continue to work closely with other state school boards associations and remain hopeful that following this period of substantial tumult for the NSBA, we will find a new national organization ready and able to serve all its member states effectively,"" the memo concluded.

The Pennsylvania School Boards Association is a nonprofit association of public school boards in the state, representing more than 4,500 school board members. Founded in 1985, it was the first school boards association established in the United States.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pennsylvania-school-boards-association-quits-national-group-over-letter-calling-parents-domestic-terrorists,2021-10-15
Pentagon admits Taliban released ‘thousands’ of ISIS-K terrorists from Afghan prisons that US relinquished control of before evacuating,"In a stunning admission Friday morning, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby acknowledged that the Taliban released ""thousands"" of ISIS-K terrorists from prisons in Kabul and Bagram, Afghanistan, that the U.S. relinquished control of prior to evacuating the country.

Members of that same terrorist group are now suspected to have carried out attacks at Kabul airport Thursday that left at least 13 U.S. military service members and 60 Afghans dead, with hundreds more wounded.

What are the details?

Kirby's statement was offered in response to a pointed question from Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin during a press briefing Friday.

""How many ISIS-K prisoners were left at Bagram and believed to have been released from the prison there and why weren't they removed before the U.S. pulled out to some place like Gitmo?"" Griffin asked.

""Well, I don't know the exact number. Clearly, it's in the thousands when you considered both prisons,"" Kirby answered. ""Because both of them were taken over by the Taliban and emptied.""

The shocking admission comes as the Biden administration faces increased scrutiny over its botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, including speculation as to why it handed over control of Bagram Airfield — the U.S.'s largest military base in the country — before completely evacuating American citizens and Afghan nationals.



Kirby tried to cover for the administration by noting that withdrawing from Bagram and handing over control of prisons housing terrorists there and in Kabul was part of its retrograde plan to shift responsibilities to the Afghan government.

""As for emptying out, remember, we were turning things over to Afghan national security forces, that was part of the retrograde process,"" he explained. ""And, of course, as the Taliban advanced we didn't see the level of resistance by the Afghans to hold some territory, some bases, and unfortunately those (in Kabul and Bagram) were bases the Afghans didn't hold.""

But that argument likely won't sit well with many Americans as it becomes increasingly clear that the Biden administration retained far too great a trust in Afghan security and appeared to have been caught completely off-guard by the Taliban's rapid advance.

Anything else?

Kirby added earlier that while U.S. officials have determined ISIS-K terrorists are responsible for the deadly attacks, they haven't entirely ruled out the possibility that the Taliban aided the terrorists in some way.

But the Pentagon spokesman's tough talk on the Taliban is muffled by the administration's reported cooperation with the militant regime.

U.S. officials in Kabul reportedly supplied the Taliban with a list of names of U.S. citizens and Afghan nationals for the purpose of streamlining permitted access to the airport for evacuation. The list has since been decried as a ""kill list"" by critics and government officials alike.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-admits-taliban-released-thousands-isis-prisoners,2021-08-27
Pentagon unveils new rules on ‘extremism’ following January 6 riot — even ‘liking’ a social media post could land a service member in trouble,"The Pentagon issued new rules this week outlining what constitutes prohibited extremist behavior in military ranks and what will be the procedure for handling such behavior, the Associated Press reported.

What's the background?

The new rules, officially issued Monday, come nearly a year after some current and former service members participated in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, triggering a broad Department of Defense review.

Shortly after the Capitol riot, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also ordered an unprecedented one-day stand-down for all branches of the military to discuss the problem of extremism and extremist ideology in the ranks. The reported purpose for the stand-down was so that military leaders could gain a better grasp on the scope of the problem.

The Pentagon claimed that extremist behavior is on the rise within the military ranks, noting that roughly 100 substantiated cases of extremist activity have been documented in the past year, an increase over previous years.

What are the details?

In the policy release, the Pentagon lays out a new two-step process to determine that someone is responsible for extremist behavior. First, a military commander must determine that the actions a service member engaged in constituted ""extremist activity""; and second, the commander must determine that the service member ""actively participated"" in that activity.

The new policy broadly defines ""extremist activity"" as any behavior ranging from depriving people of their constitutional rights to supporting terrorism or the overthrow of the U.S. government or advocating for unlawful discrimination.

The new rules still maintain some level of vagueness, allowing ""extremist activity"" to be left up to interpretation. Below is the full list of what constitute “extremist activities,"" as shown in the policy release:

(a) Advocating or engaging in unlawful force, unlawful violence, or other illegal means to deprive individuals of their rights under the United States Constitution or the laws of the United States, including those of any State, Commonwealth, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision thereof.

(b) Advocating or engaging in unlawful force or violence to achieve goals that are political, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature.

(c) Advocating, engaging in, or supporting terrorism, within the United States or abroad.

(d) Advocating, engaging in, or supporting the overthrow of the government of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof, including that of any State, Commonwealth, Territory, or the District of Columbia, by force or violence; or seeking to alter the form of these governments by unconstitutional or other unlawful means (e.g., sedition).

(e) Advocating or encouraging military, civilian, or contractor personnel within the DoD or United States Coast Guard to violate the laws of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof, including that of any State, Commonwealth, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or to disobey lawful orders or regulations, for the purpose of disrupting military activities (e,g., subversion), or personally undertaking the same.

(f) Advocating widespread unlawful discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender identity, or sexual orientation.

After determining whether certain behavior constitutes ""extremist activity,"" commanders are given 14 categories by which they will judge whether the service member engaged in ""active participation.""

The categories are intended to root out formal membership in extremist groups, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. But when taken separately, something as small as ""liking"" a questionable post on social media could result in a service member being punished.

""The physical act of liking is, of course, advocating, right? And advocating for extremist groups, groups that advocate violating their oath to the Constitution, overthrow the government, terrorist activities ... Liking is an advocation and that’s laid out clearly in the instruction,” Kirby told reporters Monday, according to Defense One.

Anything else?

Other senior defense officials reportedly clarified that ""liking"" a post won't automatically initiate punishment. Such behavior will only be part of the review process.

""As an incident comes to light, and as authorities are looking at the context of that case, then that social media information could be one point among many that would be taken into consideration,"" a senior defense official told reporters, ABC News reported.

""There has to be a knowing element to it,"" another senior defense official added. ""There has to be sort of an amplification of the message is what we're looking at. So, somebody who just stumbled across content wouldn't be necessarily sufficient, depending on the facts, to violate this policy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-issues-new-rules-on-extremism,2021-12-21
Police release security video of Phoenix mass shooting,"A man dressed in tactical gear and armed with a rifle and Molotov cocktail went on a murderous rampage in Phoenix on the night of Aug. 28. On Friday, the Phoenix Police Department released harrowing video footage of the violent onslaught that left three people dead and five others injured – including two police officers.

The mass shooting suspect – later identified as 24-year-old Isaiah Williams – reportedly left his hotel room at a Days Inn around 8:30 p.m. He is seen on video dressed from head to toe in tactical gear – including a helmet, gas mask, knee pads, and a ballistic vest. He also is armed with a rifle, flash bangs, and a Molotov cocktail.

Immediately after exiting the hotel, the suspect began firing his weapon at vehicles and buildings. The suspect was walking through the parking lot, and spotted a white car driving. He opened fire on the vehicle. Two people in the car were shot and killed. The victims were later identified as Karla Garzona, 44, and Misael Arevalo, 36.

Three other people in the car fled for their lives as the suspect continued to shoot at the vehicle. They climbed over a fence in the parking lot behind a Waffle House.

Haunting security camera video shows the man continuing to fire off rounds in the parking lot.

The suspect then threw a Molotov cocktail at the window of the Waffle House. The window did not break, and the Molotov cocktail did not ignite.

The shooter then went to the glass door of the Days Inn reception area. He looked in, but did not fire his weapon at the three people inside.

The video shows the man continued to shoot his rifle indiscriminately, and wounded multiple people across the street.

As police arrived at the crime scene, the shooter unleashed a barrage of bullets at the officers. Two officers were shot.

A police officer is heard telling the dispatch, ""I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit! Let's get me help!""

The officer was pinned down by gunfire, so the other officers devised a plan to extract him. Officers did not have their body cameras activated, so there is no video. Another officer rushed the downed cop to a local hospital.

Phoenix police located Williams, and he was already dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

NBC News reported, ""Investigators who processed the aftermath of the Aug. 28 incident north of downtown Phoenix found 200 spent rifle casings, five magazine cartridges, unused flash bangs, and a Molotov cocktail, Phoenix Police Sgt. Vincent Cole said in a recorded statement.""

Police did not reveal a possible motive for the mass shooting.

The Phoenix Police Department has launched an investigation into the mass shooting.

Police feared 'Las Vegas style shooting' after hotel maid finds weapons cache near MLB All-Star stadium,"Denver law enforcement say a quick-thinking and fast-acting hotel maid may have thwarted what could have been a ""Las Vegas style shooting.""

The Las Vegas massacre resulted in the deaths of 60 concert-goers after a gunman opened fire on a crowd of people attending a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip in October 2017. The gunman positioned himself high above the Las Vegas Strip in a hotel adjacent to the concert space. No formal motive was ever revealed for the massacre, which left an additional 400 other concert-goers with gunshot wounds.

What are the details?

Police feared the ""Las Vegas style shooting,"" according to the Denver Post, after a maid alerted law enforcement to a weapons cache inside a hotel room near Coors Field.

Coors Field is home to the Colorado Rockies, a Major League Baseball team, and is the location of the MLB's All-Star festivities this year, slated to take place this week.

KMGH-TV reported:

Sources said police removed 16 long guns, body armor and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition from the room which featured a balcony overlooking the downtown area. The sources said they feared the number of weapons, ammo, vantage point and large crowds could have resulted in a ""Las Vegas-style shooting."" Based on the information provided by the hotel employee, police executed a search warrant and found the guns, ammo, body armor and a man inside the room on the eighth floor.

Police eventually arrested three men and one woman, charging the group with various firearm and drug-related offenses.

Law enforcement sources told KMGH that one of the arrested individuals recently posted on Facebook that, following a divorce, he hoped to ""go out in a big way.""

Drake Voell, who was staying at the hotel where the weapons were found, told KDVR-TV, ""[My family] heard a maid walked into the hotel room and she saw a bunch of guns laid out. Then they found a white SUV on the road and all doors were unlocked and there was a laptop on the dashboard open, so it was a very suspicious vehicle.""

Was there a threat?

Although the investigation remains ongoing, the FBI released a statement Sunday indicating there was no threat to the MLB's All-Star festivities.

""We have no reason to believe this incident was connected to terrorism or a threat directed at the All-Star Game. We are not aware of any threat to the All-Star Game events, venues, players, or the community at this time,"" the FBI said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-feared-las-vegas-style-shooting-mlb-all-star,2021-07-11
Man charged with allegedly issuing assassination threats to Illinois Republican gubernatorial candidate and his family: 'I'm going to skin Darren Bailey alive',"The latest alleged threats of political violence occurred in Illinois, where a Chicago man reportedly issued threats to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and his family. The 21-year-old suspect left a terrorizing voicemail threatening to assassinate Darren Bailey and later bragged to his friends about making the death threats, according to police.

Scott Lennox was charged with one felony count each of threatening a public official, telephone harassment, and harassment by electronic communications, according to the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. His bail was set at $75,000.

Prosecutor Lorraine Scaduto said Lennox was with friends at a bar on Friday when a political ad aired on TV that infuriated him. He allegedly got into a ""heated argument"" with his friends about Illinois state Sen. Darren Bailey – who is also the Republican candidate for governor.

Lennox left a voicemail at Bailey's office in Springfield at 10:27 p.m., according to the police report.

""I'm going to skin Darren Bailey alive, making sure he is still alive, and I’m going to feed his f***ing family to him as he is alive and screaming in f***ing pain,” Lennox said, according to prosecutors.

“He is a piece of white a** racist s**t, and honestly if he doesn’t kill himself, I will. You know what? I know where he lives. I know where he sleeps. I know where his kids sleep. And I know the f***ing school he works at,” Lennox reportedly threatened.

""The candidate teaching all this mother f***ing misinformation is going to die,"" Lennox allegedly said. ""So honestly he should just kill himself before anything else happens.”

“So f*** him for being a piece of s**t,” Lennox allegedly said of Bailey in the voicemail. “So you know what? I am going to take anything and everything possible. You know what? I am going to make him scream. I am going to make him scream and suffer. Yeah, that’s right. So he better kill himself, and if he doesn’t, I am going to kill him.""

Lennox reportedly said he does not like current Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker either, but loathes Bailey even more, to the point of making assassination threats.

Lennox reportedly also made comments about abortion in the voicemail, but prosecutors did not reveal his remarks.

Bailey's campaign website states:

As a man of faith, Darren is proudly pro-life and will always stand up to protect the rights of the unborn. Darren believes in the sanctity of life, and as a state legislator, voted against the extreme overhaul and expansion of abortion access in Illinois. Darren opposes state and taxpayer funding of abortions. As Governor, he will continue to defend innocent life.

Lennox's phone number was revealed by the caller ID. On Monday, a Bailey staff member reported the menacing message to the Illinois State Capitol Police and the Illinois State Police.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the threats caused the ""schools affiliated with Bailey and his family in southern Illinois"" to be ""placed on soft lockdown.""

Bailey was also provided with an extra security detail and was ""told to avoid appearing in public as police investigated.""

Chicago Police Department officers interviewed Lennox. Lennox allegedly told authorities that he made the disturbing voicemail ""for shock value to his friends,"" according to Scaduto.

The suspect allegedly showed police messages he wrote to friends about the intimidating message and even bragged about being a ""political terrorist.""

Lennox boasted about the threatening voicemail to four of his friends.

“Dude. Three f***ing cops showed up man. Bro, they told me that now [Bailey] is on lockdown and now he has to be surrounded by security,"" Lennox reportedly wrote in a Snapchat message that included four crying laughing emojis.

“I don’t feel bad about it at all,” Lennox said, according to CWBChicago.

“Dude, I’m a political terrorist,"" Lennox bragged. ""I sent a super ‘threatening’ – quotes for legal purposes – message to [Bailey] and now the cops are coming over to ‘ask me some questions.'”



One of the friends allegedly replied, “Not sending messages anonymously? Rookie mistake.”

Lennox reportedly responded, ""No, dude. Normally I did, but I left a voicemail cuz I wanted him to know it was me. Dude, his entire family is on lockdown. I feel so f***ing accomplished.”

The recipient allegedly praised Lennox, “Now THAT’S how you should be participating in elections. If the officials aren’t afraid, something is wrong.”



Lennox purportedly replied, “Haha. So f***ing true.""

Lennox reportedly wrote to another friend, “THE COOK COUNTY INVESTIGATIONS SQUAD NOW CONSIDERS ME A POLITICAL TERRORIST. LITERALLY I HAD 3 COPS PULL UP TO ME AND F**ING INTERROGATE ME FOR LIKE 30 MINUTES.”

Lennox allegedly told a third friend, ""Yeah bro. I’m a f***ing terrorist.”

The recipient reportedly responded, ""I don’t want to be associated with these texts in case the police investigate your phone, so please delete them.""

Lennox allegedly replied, ""Aight. I was gonna anyway. Also, technically, it’s illegal for a legal division to go looking into a Snapchat without a warrant. Literally I know all the laws behind this s**t.”

The friend allegedly mocked Lennox, ""OK. Of course you do. LOL.”

A friend asked who Darren Bailey was, and Lennox was said to have responded, ""It’s the butt f***ing motherf***ing person running for Illinois governor. He’s super racist. I literally made it so he and his entire family is on lockdown. I love it.""

After police reviewed the social media messages, Lennox was arrested at around 10 p.m. on Monday.

At the end of the bail hearing, Judge Susana Ortiz said of the threats, ""It's clear that the intent wasn’t merely just to leave some rambling message, but for this threat to be conveyed and have an impact on the public official.” Ortiz added that the social media conversations ""make it evident that there is certainly no remorse about this action and taking delight and pleasure in everything that flowed from this incident.""

“It simply will not be tolerated,"" Ortiz declared.

Bailey reacted by saying, “Divisive, inflammatory, and misleading rhetoric is driving hatred across our state as some attempt to label political opponents as dangerous threats.""

“Whether we agree or disagree on policies, we are all Americans,” Bailey said. “I pray this young man gets the help he needs. We must bring our state together and fight for the safety and prosperity of every Illinoisan.”

Pritzker tweeted, ""The violent rhetoric and division we're seeing across our country is unacceptable. Hatred in any form has no home in Illinois.""

Previously, Pritzker had labeled Bailey as a ""Trump extremist.""

“Darren Bailey is a threat to democracy. He’s surrounded himself with Jan. 6th insurrectionists,"" Prtizker said during last month's debate. ""He shouldn’t be let anywhere near the governor’s office.”

“He is, frankly, too extreme for Illinois,” Pritzker said during the final debate. “Darren Bailey is out of touch with the entire state of Illinois.”

Bailey responded, ""His gender issues are so extreme. Gov. Pritzker is perfectly fine injecting his gender curriculum, the first of its kind in the nation, into our schools. Woke ideology. I think that’s extreme.”

Pritzker is leading Bailey in the polls heading to the upcoming election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/political-violence-illinois-governor-darren-bailey-2658592871,2022-11-03
Poll: Biden's 5 most unpopular executive orders are on immigration,"President Joe Biden has not even held office for a full month but has already taken more than 40 executive actions that, according to a new Morning Consult poll, are mostly popular with one outstanding exception. That exception is Biden's executive order to greatly expand the number of refugees admitted to the United States.

According to the survey, Biden's refugee order is the only executive action he's taken that is downright unpopular, with 48% of voters opposing his plan to allow 110,000 more refugees to seek safe haven in the United States in the upcoming fiscal year and 39% of voters supporting the action.

Under President Donald Trump's administration, refugee admittance was capped at a historic low of 15,000 people, whereas Biden has increased the cap to a historic high of 125,000 refugees.

Biden's refugee order was the least popular of 28 executive actions tracked by Morning Consult since Inauguration Day.

""The finding from the latest survey, conducted Feb. 5-7 among 1,986 registered voters with a margin of error of 2 percentage points, reinforces the notion that immigration will be tricky political territory for the president,"" Cameron Easley writes for Morning Consult. ""Orders pertaining to immigration and immigrant rights constitute five of his seven least popular actions among voters, and are particularly animating for Republicans.""

Breaking down the numbers on Biden's refugee order shows 3 in 5 Republican voters ""strongly oppose"" raising the refugee cap to 125,000 people. A similar number of Republican voters strongly opposed Biden ending construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and also opposed ending the immigration and travel restrictions from Muslim-majority countries flagged as hotbeds of terrorism.

Republicans are most strongly opposed (66%) to the Biden administration's decision to reverse Trump's policy and count illegal immigrants in the census.

The other two most unpopular Biden executive orders have to do with energy policy. The cancelation of the Keystone XL Pipeline is Biden's third-most unpopular order, with 42% of voters supporting the decision to kill the pipeline project, 28% opposed, and 20% unsure. Biden's order to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies has 45% support, 34% opposition, and 21% unsure.

Biden's most popular executive action was his order mandating that people wear masks on public transit such as planes, trains, and buses to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. The survey found that 78% of voters supported the mask mandate and just 15% opposed it. Biden's second-most popular executive order was a similar mask mandate on federal property.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-bidens-5-most-unpopular-executive-orders-are-on-immigration,2021-02-10
Polls show Joe Biden's approval plummeting after disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,"The American public is souring on President Joe Biden after witnessing the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal that his administration facilitated.

What are the details?

According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, Biden's job performance has plummeted as Americans have witnessed his administration's Afghanistan blunder.

On Friday, the poll found that 53% of Americans approved of Biden's job performance. By Monday, that figure had fallen to 46%.

Unfortunately for Biden, the Reuters/Ipsos survey is not the only poll showing lopsided approval ratings. Rasmussen Reports surveys show similar figures — a majority of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance, especially after the fall of Kabul — while polling averages from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight show a majority of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance.

What about the Afghan withdrawal?

It's not just Biden. Americans, overall, are souring on withdrawing from Afghanistan.

In fact, a Morning Consult/Politico poll, conducted Aug. 13-16, showed that American support for the withdrawal plummeted 20 points in four months' time. In April, the poll found that 69% of registered voters supported the withdrawal. The most recent survey, however, showed that just 49% of registered voters continue to support the withdrawal after witnessing the Taliban's swift victory.

Support for the withdrawal dropped even further when respondents were confronted with the terrorism implications of America's botched Afghan withdrawal.

From Politico:

When asked whether the U.S. should still withdraw its military presence if this would create an opportunity for terrorist groups like al Qaeda to establish operations in Afghanistan, voters were less supportive. Just 35 percent of participants said the American military should withdraw in this case, with 48 percent saying it should not. This highlights the fear of terrorism coming from the country, as U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan began following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.



Of the voters surveyed, 38 percent said the U.S. should still withdraw if the Taliban regains control of most of Afghanistan. Forty-five percent of voters said the U.S. should probably or definitely not withdraw, a larger share than those who generally opposed the decision to withdraw.

Support for Biden's withdrawal is likely to drop even further.

Americans are being confronted with the Biden administration's potential abandonment of tens of thousands of Afghans — along with their families — who risked their lives to help America conduct its military mission in the country.

Seeing desperate Afghans cling to planes, some even falling to their tragic deaths, will drive support for the withdrawal, and Biden, further down.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/polls-biden-approval-plummets-afghanistan,2021-08-18
'American Friends for Hamas' asks Portland college students for donations to 'destroy Israel' — and the woke youngsters are only too happy to help,"Ami Horowitz — a creator of digital shorts that throw conservative light on sociopolitical issues — is at it again.

What are the details?

Horowitz decided to pay a visit recently to left-wing bastion Portland State University to pose as a worker for ""American Friends for Hamas"" — a made-up group — who asks students to pledge donations in order to assist the terrorism-loving organization to carry out its mission to ""destroy Israel.""

And boy, did Horowitz lay it on thick for the camera.

""We're not your father's terrorist organization,"" he told students without a hint of tongue in cheek. ""We've kind of evolved beyond that. It's still kind of what we do, but we've kind of rebuilt and rebranded ourselves and, you know ... Hamas is where it's at!""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Horowitz even added the telltale rolling tongue on the ""H"" for extra Middle Eastern authenticity.

He proceeded to tell students that his group was raising money to help ""fund operations against Israel"" — and that they were looking to hit ""soft targets"" in ""civilian populations"" such as cafes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship to ""make 'em feel it.""

And no students seen in the video ran for the hills upon hearing Horowitz's genocidal pitches.

""That's the only way you can fight back, really,"" he said.

Horowitz even likened a ""suicide bomber"" to ""kind of like the poor man's F-15.""

""Right, right,"" one student responded in apparent agreement.

'We're looking to destroy Israel'

Further on in the open-air chats, Horowitz described ""American Friends for Hamas"" as ""next-level BDS"" — the acronym for the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement — and ""we're looking to wipe Israel off the map … we're looking to destroy Israel.""

He added that ""we don't want just Gaza, we want to have all of Israel.""

Incredibly Horowitz also told at least one student that ""to get peace you first gotta destroy some stuff, you know?""

How did students react?

There was no apparent pushback from students on the video Horowitz produced.

""I actually have been learning in this last school year about everything that's going on over there,"" one student told him. ""So, I like the sound of what you're doing, it sounds like the right thing to do.""

Another student said, ""I'm totally against the Israeli genocide.""

The video captured a number of students pledging to ""American Friends for Hamas"" in relatively small dollar amounts — all for the cause of killing off Israel. Horowitz wrote in a Fox News op-ed that it took him only about an hour to raise ""hundreds of dollars for Hamas.""

President Biden's approval rating is heading south according to recent survey,"President Joe Biden's approval rating has fallen to 43%, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, which also found that 51% disapprove of the job that the president is doing.

The survey of 1,241 adults living in the U.S. was carried out Aug. 26-31 and has a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points for the full sample.

The 43% approval rating marks a sizable decline from the 49% approval rating that Biden had in a Marist survey conducted from July 21-29. Similarly, his disapproval rating has risen from 44% in the earlier poll to 51% in the new survey.



The new survey found that while 41% strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing, 10% disapprove, 23% approve, and 19% strongly approve.

While 56% disapprove of the way the commander in chief is handling foreign policy, and just 38% approve.

A whopping 61% indicated that overall they disapproved of how Biden handled America's Afghanistan withdrawal, while just 32% approve. While most Republicans disapprove of the president's handling of the withdrawal (94%), about a quarter of Democrats (26%), and a majority of Independents (71%) disapprove.

While 71% think that overall America's role in Afghanistan was a failure, 20% view it as a success.

The Biden administration has faced significant criticism in recent weeks for bungling the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, where the Taliban swiftly took over and the U.S. had been scrambling to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies before finally announcing the completion of the withdrawal on Monday. Thirteen American service members were among the many people killed in a terror attack in Kabul last Thursday.



Some U.S. citizens and Afghan allies still remain stranded in Afghanistan, with the Biden administration pledging to work to ensure they can get out.

President Biden signs executive order calling for declassification review and release of some documents related to Sept. 11 attacks,"President Joe Biden has signed an executive order calling for declassification reviews of documents pertaining to the infamous Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.

""Today, I signed an executive order directing the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to oversee a declassification review of documents related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's September 11th investigations,"" the president said in a statement. ""The executive order requires the Attorney General to release the declassified documents publicly over the next six months.""



The president's move comes a little more than a week before the nation will mark the two decade anniversary of the terror attacks that left thousands dead.



On that day 20 years ago hijackers crashed into New York City's Twin Towers, which both eventually collapsed, and into the Pentagon in Washington D.C.

Another plane went down in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. It was around 20 minutes by air from the nation's capital.

""We are thrilled to see the President forcing the release of more evidence about Saudi connections to the 9/11 Attacks,"" Terry Strada, whose husband was killed in the World Trade Center, said in a statement. ""We have been fighting the FBI and intelligence community for too long, but this looks like a true turning point.""



""President Biden is asking us to trust that the administration will bring justice to the 9/11 community and we certainly hope this is a genuine step forward,"" Brett Eagleson, whose father was killed in the terror attacks, said in a statement, according to the Guardian. ""We will closely watch this process to ensure the justice department and FBI follow through, act in good faith and help our families uncover the truth in our pursuit of justice against the Saudi government. The first test will be on 9/11, and the world will be watching.""

"President Biden vows US retaliation after attacks killed American troops, Afghan civilians","During his speech Thursday afternoon, President Biden pledged that the U.S. will retaliate in the wake of the terror attacks in Afghanistan that killed and wounded U.S. service members as well as Afghan civilians near the Kabul airport.

""To those who carried out this attack ... know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,"" Biden declared, blaming the attacks on ISIS-K.

The president said the U.S. will persist with evacuation efforts from Afghanistan and said that he has called for the development of operational plans to attack ISIS-K's assets leadership, and facilities.

Instead of walking away following this speech, Biden answered media questions. Biden said he had been provided a list, and noted that ""the first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O'Donnell of NBC.""

Some people criticized the president's speech on Twitter.



""Biden's speech was weak and demonstrated that he is not a Commander-in-Chief in control of the situation in #Afghanistan,"" GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn of Colorado tweeted.



""Biden's speech showed he does not have the ability to meet this moment, to effectively lead this nation, or to keep Americans safe,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted.

""At a time like this, we need a president who conveys strength, reassurance, comfort and steadiness,"" tweeted Ari Fleischer, who formerly served as White House press secretary for President George W. Bush. ""Biden's speech did not convey any of those four.""

""I have been as charitable to Biden as just about anyone during the collapse of Afghanistan. I have refrained from blaming him for problems that were many years in the making,"" conservative commentator Michael Knowles tweeted.

President Trump orders Pentagon to move majority of US troops out of Somalia,"President Donald Trump has ordered a majority of the U.S. military members serving in Somalia to be relocated out of the country, the Pentagon announced Friday.

According to The New York Times, there are roughly 700 American troops currently in Somalia, and the movements are set to occur by Jan. 15.

What are the details?

The Department of Defense explained in a statement that the order does not constitute ""a change in U.S. policy,"" noting that while ""some forces may be reassigned outside of East Africa,"" those personnel who remain in the region ""will be repositioned from Somalia into neighboring countries in order to allow cross-border operations by both U.S. and partner forces to maintain pressure against violent extremist organizations operating"" in the country.

The most notorious terrorist group operating out of Somalia is the Al-Qaida-linked organization Al-Shabaab.

As TheBlaze previously reported:

Al-Shabaab is a radical Islamist group that seeks to overthrow the existing government in Somalia and establish one that rules by the dictates of Sharia law. It has also conducted strikes outside of Somali borders, including terror attacks in Kenya and Uganda. The U.S. is allied with the Somali government and has been trying to help it defeat this threat.



ABC News reported Friday that ""for weeks there has been speculation that the U.S. military troop presence there might be reduced significantly or fully withdrawn,"" and ""that would have been in line with President Donald Trump's recent decisions to downsize the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

Earlier this month, acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller announced that U.S. forces stationed in Afghanistan would ""be cut by roughly half in Afghanistan to 2,500, and by 500 troops in Iraq to 2,500"" by the same Jan. 15, 2021, deadline.

Anything else?

President Trump's decision to move troops out of Somalia was met with mixed reviews from U.S. senators.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky), who has endorsed Trump's vows to end America's longstanding foreign military operations, tweeted in reaction to the news, ""Thank you ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ for bringing troops home from Africa!""

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) tweeted, ""This is another big mistake by the Trump Admin. Somalia is entering a fractious election season & Al Shabaab remains a potent force in the country. Hastily withdrawing U.S. troops without a political strategy will have serious consequences for the region.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-trump-orders-pentagon-to-move-majority-of-us-troops-out-of-somalia,2020-12-05
"WH press secretary confronted over Biden's travel ban hypocrisy, dodges question","As President Joe Biden moves to impose new coronavirus-related travel restrictions, some are noting the president's apparent hypocrisy considering that he called former President Donald Trump's travel restrictions ""xenophobic.""

President Biden on Monday will formally reinstate COVID-19 travel restrictions on non-U.S. travelers from Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and 26 other European countries. On Sunday, Reuters reported that South Africa would be added to the list of restricted countries because of concerns over a new variant of COVID-19 that has appeared in that country.



The new executive orders reverse a Jan. 18 decision by former President Trump to lift the restrictions on Brazil and Europe. It also appears to reverse a position previously held by Biden on Trump's travel restrictions.

In February 2020, when Trump introduced bans on travel from China and six African countries as a safety measure against the spread of coronavirus, then-candidate Biden criticized the policy as ""xenophobia"" and ""fear-mongering.""

During Monday's White House press briefing, Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked the president's press secretary, Jen Psaki, about the travel ban and Biden's apparent change of position.

""When President Trump was imposing travel restrictions in March, specifically on China, then-candidate Biden called it 'xenophobic' and 'fear-mongering.' Now President Biden is putting travel restrictions on people coming in from other countries, what word do we use to describe that?"" Doocy asked.

""I don't think that's quite a fair articulation,"" Psaki dodged. Redirecting the question, she said that Biden felt Trump's ban on travel from some foreign countries with majority-Muslim populations that were previously designated by the Obama administration as ""areas of concern"" for terrorism was ""xenophobic.""

""The president has been clear that he felt the Muslim Ban was xenophobic. He overturned the Muslim ban. He also though has supported ... travel restrictions in order to keep the American people safe to ensure that we are getting the pandemic under control. That's been part of his policy,"" Psaki said. ""But he was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time and more recently the importance of having a multi-faceted approach.""

Psaki of course failed to address Doocy's question, which was specifically about Biden's previous response to Trump's travel restrictions on China. Doocy did not ask about the so-called ""Muslim ban.""

Members of the Biden administration weren't the only ones to change their tune on coronavirus travel bans. The mainstream media, as documented by Hot Air's Jazz Shaw, is covering the two presidents very differently.

A headline from NBC News, for example, stated: ""Biden to reinstate Covid travel restrictions Trump rescinded, impose new ban on South Africa.""

Last February when Trump imposed his travel restrictions, NBC News covered the story with the headline: ""Civil rights groups condemn Trump's travel-ban expansion to six African countries."" The civil rights groups quoted in the article called the travel restrictions ""racist and unconstitutional.""

Other headlines from February collected by Shaw include:

So far, no mainstream news outlet has suggested that Biden's travel restrictions have anything to do with race.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/press-secretary-bidens-travel-ban-hypocrisy,2021-01-25
Prince Harry blasted as 'f***ing woke snowflake' by rock icon Noel Gallagher for ripping Royal Family,"Rock icon Noel Gallagher, formerly of hit-making band Oasis, blasted Prince Harry as a ""f***ing woke snowflake"" for ripping the Royal Family.

What are the details?

In an interview with the Sun, Gallagher — who led Oasis to worldwide superstardom in the '90s while feuding with his younger brother, Liam, the group's vocalist — said he sympathizes with Prince William for having a younger brother ""shooting his f***ing mouth off with s**t that is just so unnecessary. I'd like to think I was always the William.""

He added, ""Prince William. I feel that f***ing lad's pain,"" the Sun noted.

Gallagher, 54, has endured many verbal shots from his younger brother, who's 46, after Oasis called it quits a decade ago, the paper said.

Which more than likely fueled Gallagher calling out ""f***ing a**hole"" Prince Harry for publicly ""dissing your family"" — and the guitarist-songwriter told him to ""shut up,"" the paper said.

He even took a shot at the equally controversial Meghan Markle, Harry's outspoken wife, the Sun reported: ""This is what happens when you get involved with Americans. As simple as that.""

It's worth noting that Prince Harry also commanded top podcaster — and MMA fighter — Joe Rogan to ""just stay out of it"" after Rogan suggested that young people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine and soon after criticized the First Amendment as ""bonkers,"" which drew lots of backlash.

Kudos from Piers Morgan

Outspoken British TV personality Piers Morgan — who parted ways with ""Good Morning Britain"" earlier this year over his criticism of Markle — loved Gallagher's take:

Morgan also tweeted that Gallagher's interview with the Sun was ""brilliant"" and added ""thank God there are still stars like @NoelGallagher who speak their mind, don't care who gets 'offended' & never whine about how awful their pampered privileged lives are. More please.""

Not Gallagher's first shot across the bow

This wasn't the first time Gallagher addressed headline-grabbing subjects. Last September, he said he refused to wear masks in public and that ""there's too many f***ing liberties being taken away from us now."" And in 2017, he blasted the U.K. government for failing to stop terrorism.

""Our government are seemingly powerless to f***ing stop this s**t,"" Gallagher told the New Musical Express after a deadly bombing. ""I have children, and they're growing up in London, and they take the tube, I take the tube – we all take public transport because I can't drive. And there's bombers roaming free around the whole f***ing city, and the government and the one before them and the one after that will be powerless to stop it because of some hippy ideal about people's religious beliefs.""

Princeton University teaming up with the ADL to create database tracking non-criminal criticism of politicians,"The Anti-Defamation League has partnered with researchers from Princeton University on a new subjective ""data collection initiative"" to track so-called threats and criticism of elected officials. Although presently aimed at tracking ""incidents"" involving local politicians, the Bridging Divides Initiative is intended to ""expand beyond local officials to state and federal.""

There are already indicators that the BDI may inherit the ADL's partisan bias, as criticisms of politicians who promote critical race theory, draconian health measures, and ""LGBTQ+"" propaganda have already been tracked and recorded as threats and harassment. Threats made by pro-abortion activists didn't even register.

What is the BDI?

Princeton University announced that the BDI had been launched to ""systematically evaluate threats and harassment of local officials across the United States using public event-based data.""

""Data-driven analysis is critical in helping communities respond to emerging challenges,"" said Shannon Hiller, the executive director of the BDI. ""By observing incidents and events data over time, researchers and policy makers can take action to protect civic space.""

The ADL Center on Extremism, which touts itself as the ""foremost authority on extremism, terrorism and hate,"" partnered with with Princeton researchers on the BDI to do what they perceived law enforcement to be incapable of doing or unwilling to do.

Oren Segal, the vice president of the ADL Center on Extremism, stated, ""Threats and harassment against local officials present a significant challenge to American democracy.""



""We urge policymakers and communities to use these data to better understand this dangerous phenomenon and create better policy to more effectively count and counter future incidents,"" added Segal.

Segal did not elaborate on what countering future incidents might look like; whether that would involve censorship, preemptive arrests, surveillance, or other preventive measures.

Not crimes per se

According to the BDI's premier report released on Oct. 20, the ""threats and harassment"" are not in and of themselves crimes, but ""incidents beyond legal definitions of criminal conduct.""

""While incidents of attacks, arsons, and the like are critical in understanding elements of political violence, they are outside of the scope of consideration here since they are already captured in criminal data,"" said the report.

The threats the BDI is interested in are defined as ""instances in which one person communicates to another their intention to inflict pain, injury, damage or other hostile action at least in part due to that person's role as a public official.""

Intent is not important in qualifying a so-called threat, but rather perception — what ""a common person would find threatening or harassing."" The BDI explicitly notes that a ""threat can be present even if there is no intent on the part of the perpetrator to carry out the threat.""

The BDI defined harassment as ""instances of knowing and willful conduct directed at a specific person ... that a reasonable person would consider aggressively pressuring, intimidating, alarming, tormenting, or terrorizing ... without serving a legitimate purpose.""

The BDI did not expand on what would constitute a ""legitimate purpose.""

According to the ACLU, referring to a transsexual by the individual's real gender is traumatizing. Does this understanding represent the common consensus that the BDI would rely upon in its data collection? In which a biological male politician who claims to be otherwise, when called a man by a detractor, can claim to have been threatened or harassed?

The BDI's definitions may also have implications for media stunts and so-called art in which politicians, local or federal, are ostensibly threatened. It is not clear, for instance, whether Kathy Griffin's showcase of a fake severed head intended to represent former President Donald Trump would qualify as harassment.

The methods by which the so-called threats and harassment were communicated, according to the BDI report, were electronic, demonstration, verbal, multiple, unknown, written, display of symbols, defacing, and other.

Non-criminal memes, protest signs, and social media posts can be added to the initiative's tally of incidents that are ""undermining the work of public servants, and creating unprecedented stress on the cornerstones of democratic society.""

Just as the ADL lists Libs of TikTok, the Twitter account that has exposed liberals who sexualized children, in its ""Glossary of Extremism"" and registers Christian organizations such as the Family Research Council as hate groups, this initiative would log information on so-called ""perpetrators.""



According to its report, the BDI will address ""information on both perpetrators and targets of threats and harassment"" by collecting data from ""journalists, social media, crowd-sourcing, and other sources,"" and to collaborate with ""civil society monitors, government, and civil society organizations"" on its surveillance and logging of undesirable speech.

What has the BDI reported so far?

The BDI's preliminary findings detailed the types of threats and harassment encountered over the past two years; the geographies in which the incidents took place; and the kinds of persons targeted by such alleged abuse.

Thirty-five percent of threat targets were reportedly election officials or poll workers.

The incidents are reportedly driven in part by the fallout of political decisions such as homelessness and the cost of living.

Thirty-one percent of targets were school officials, and 12% were health officials.

The report indicated that ""education-related incidents revolved heavily around COVID-19"" (61%), followed by so-called ""critical race theory"" (7%) and LGBTQ+ related issues (7%).

Last year, parents who had spoken up about their kids' education were branded as ""domestic terrorists"" by the National School Boards Association.

The BDI might be duplicating some of the FBI's efforts by catalog such ""terrorist[ic]"" incidents as parents condemning school board officials for allegedly covering up rapes or for writing letters criticizing critical race theory.

Possible political blind spots

A great deal of attention has recently been given to the alleged attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, raising concerns about violent rhetoric and politically motivated threats. However, in past months and years, threats and violence against Republican politicians have been greatly downplayed.

The BDI, when expanded to document state and federal incidents, would not record the incident in May where a man was indicted for having gone to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home with the intention to kill him, as it was a criminal incident.

Despite its research director's pro-abortion stance, it would, however, on the basis of its own definitions, have to document how a pro-abortion activist group published the home addresses of the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices that month.



It would also have to document Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters' brand of ""dangerous rhetoric"" that some believe set the stage for the failed assassination of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise (La.) in 2017.

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was swatted on numerous occasions this year, any one of which could have proved fatal. Bannon suggested that President Joe Biden's inflammatory speech had been partly responsible. It is unclear whether Biden's noncriminal categorization of mass swathes of the electorate as ""extremists"" may have piqued the attention of the BDI or whether similar high-level ""harassment"" might qualify for BDI reporting.

Earlier this year, Jimmy Kimmel intimated on his television show that Will Smith should slap Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.). By the BDI's definitions and indication that perception of harassment, not intention, matter, the joke would have landed the sometime comedian on the initiative's naughty list.

A more detailed breakdown of the 400 incidents involving local politicians documented by the BDI between January 1, 2020, and September 23, 2022, along with the sources relied upon may shed light on whether the initiative's database is as politically skewed as the ADL's own.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/princeton-university-teaming-up-with-the-adl-to-create-s-database-tracking-non-criminal-criticism-of-politicians,2022-11-01
"'Act of malice': Pro-abortion terror group attacks another pro-life pregnancy center, issues death threats","On September 16, pro-abortion militants attacked the Mother and Unborn Baby Care pregnancy center in Southfield, Michigan, which serves nearly 200 women a year. The militants shattered windows and vandalized the establishment with spray paint, writing, ""If abortions aren't safe, neither are you."" They signed their death threat ""Jane.""

""Jane"" is in reference to the pro-abortion terror group ""Jane's Revenge,"" which began targeting pro-life institutions ahead of the Supreme Court's June 24 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The terror group has claimed responsibility for at least 18 out of the hundreds of similar attacks on pro-life centers, churches, and individuals. Some of these attacks have involved firebombings and resulted in injuries.

Their latest target, MAUBC, provides vulnerable women with confidential peer counseling, ultrasounds, diapers, formula, and clothing, as well as referrals for medical care, housingm and adoption services. It has served the metro Detroit community since 1984.



Two women, seen in surveillance footage wearing hoods, are believed to be responsible for the attack.

Jack McGrath, chairman of MAUBC's board of directors, indicated he and his team were shaken. ""We are saddened by this act of malice,"" he said, ""and pray that these persons repent.

McGrath told WJBK, ""I think these poor women are very misguided ... I pray for them. We all pray for them.""

This is not the first time MAUBC has been attacked in recent weeks.

On June 24, all 14 ground-floor windows were smashed and a threat was scrawled on the pavement, saying, ""If abortions aren't safe, neither are you!"" The building was also tagged with ""Jane was here.""

The ""Jane's Revenge"" blog, which has championed pro-abortion violence and taken credit for various attacks, referenced the June 24 attack on MAUBC in a post on July 3, smearing the center as a ""Fake Clinic"" ⁠— a term also used to refer to pro-life centers by President Joe Biden's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston, abortion advocate Julie Rikelman.

McGrath noted that he and his team ""are kind of in a state of shock right now.""



When asked whether the center plans on ""doing anything different security-wise"" after this second attack, McGrath noted they were considering everything. ""We are going to talk some more about what security we are going to enhance it with.""

Regarding his staff, McGrath indicated that they ""are nervous about it, but we're praying and hoping it doesn't happen again.""

The Southfield Police Department alerted the FBI to the incident. Although in June, the FBI opened a domestic violent extremism investigation into recent attacks by pro-abortion militants, months later the bureau still has reportedly not made a single arrest.

Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) recently referred to those presently eluding justice as ""far-Left domestic terrorist groups,"" and shared a post from ""Jane's Revenge"" highlighting the terror group's incitements of violence.

""Now the leash is off,"" said an email, alleged to be sent by the group. ""It's open season. ... Through attacking, we find joy.""

While the FBI, per Director Christopher Wray's August 4 suggestion, is currently investigating this string of attacks, the Department of Justice has a task force taking action against state and local governments that implement or enforce pro-life laws that affect federal employees' efforts to procure abortions.

Led by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, this task force and the DOJ more broadly will, according to Attorney General Merrick Garland, ""use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure that women can abort their children.

Despite this second attack and continued state efforts to promote abortion, MAUBC will continue to help mothers and their babies.

""We have shown women nothing but love and compassion,"" said McGrath. ""Mothers return with the child they were considering aborting to tell us how grateful they are that we were there for them when they were troubled and desperate. ... We trust in God's will and His power.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-abortion-terror-group-attacks,2022-09-23
Biden denounces planned violence by pro-abortion terrorists: ‘Threats and intimidation are not speech’,"President Joe Biden on Friday called for peaceful protests of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, denouncing planned violence by radical pro-abortion groups.

""I call on everyone, no matter how deeply they care about this decision, to keep all protests peaceful. Peaceful. Peaceful. Peaceful,"" Biden said in an address on the court's 6-3 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. ""No intimidation; violence is never acceptable.""

""Threats and intimidation are not speech,"" the president continued. ""We must stand against violence in any form, regardless of your rationale.""

The president's comments follow threats from the terrorist pro-abortion group Jane's Revenge, which has distributed flyers around Washington, D.C., calling for a ""night of rage"" against the Supreme Court's decision. This group has previously taken credit for firebombings and acts of vandalism committed against pro-life organizations and churches all over the country in the past two months.

""THE NIGHT SCOTUS OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE HIT THE STREETS,"" the fliers read. ""YOU SAID YOU'D RIOT.""

""TO OUR OPPRESSORS: IF ABORTIONS AREN'T SAFE, YOU'RE NOT EITHER,"" Jane's Revenge said.



The calls for violence prompted Republican lawmakers to urge the Biden administration to protect churches and pro-life pregnancy centers in the coming days.

""President Biden has a Constitutional duty to keep Americans safe—he must direct the Justice Department to deter and prevent violence against Supreme Court Justices, churches, and pro-life pregnancy centers. Now. Before it's too late,"" House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Friday.

Earlier this week, the White House denounced the threats from Jane's Revenge.

""Violence and destruction of property have no place in our country under any circumstance. And the president denounces this action,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday.

“Actions like this are completely unacceptable regardless of our politics,” Jean-Pierre added. “So we have denounced that and we will continue to denounce any violence or threats.”

Anything Else?



President Biden called the court's ruling a ""tragic error"" in his address and blasted the Republican-appointed justices in the majority as extreme.

He promised that if Democrats prevail in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take federal action to secure the right to abortion.



""Let me be very clear and unambiguous. The only way we can secure a woman's right to choose, the balance that existed, is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law. No executive action from the president can do that,"" Biden said.

The president urged voters to ""make their voices heard"" in the upcoming midterm elections, asking for Democrats to be given expanded majorities to codify abortion protections in federal law.

""This fall Roe is on the ballot,"" Biden said.

In the meantime, the president announced several executive actions he will take to protect abortion access nationwide, including access to abortion-inducing drugs and contraceptives. Biden will direct the Department of Health and Human Services to increase the availability of so-called medication abortions to the ""fullest extent possible,"" but he was vague on specifics.

He also said the federal government will defend the ""bedrock right"" of women in pro-life states to travel out of state to seek abortions.

“If any state or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack,” Biden said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-abortion-terrorists-plot-night-of-rage-as-biden-calls-for-peaceful-protests,2022-06-24
"Terrorists firebomb pro-life center in Buffalo, New York","Authorities in Buffalo, New York are investigating a fire at a pro-life pregnancy center early Tuesday morning as a case of arson.

CompassCare, a pro-life reproductive health organization that services patients in the Rochester and Buffalo area, said Tuesday that its Buffalo office was ""firebombed"" by pro-abortion terrorists.

The Amherst Police Department and firefighters responded to a fire alarm at CompassCare's location at 1230 Eggert Road that morning. Police said the building was on fire when first responders arrived.

Firefighters from the Eggertsville Hose Co. were assisted by the Getzville, N Bailey, and Snyder Fire Departments and worked to put the fire out, police said. Two firefighters were treated for minor injuries.

CompassCare wrote in a blog post that its office was firebombed. The pregnancy center said windows in the reception room and nurses' office were broken and fires were started within.

The apparent arsonists also left graffiti on the building that read, ""Jane Was Here."" CompassCare said this was a reference to the radical pro-abortion terorrist group Jane's Revenge, which took responsibility for firebombing a similar pro-life organization in Madison, Wisconsin last month.



In a May 31, 2022 post on an anarchist website, Jane's Revenge called for a ""night of rage"" when the U.S. Supreme Court hands down its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case concerning Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. A leaked draft majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito indicated the court has voted to uphold Mississippi's law and overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade abortion decision.

Jane's Revenge urged ""militant action"" and said ""we have selected a time of 8pm for actions nationwide to begin"" whenever the court hands down its decision.

“This is the pro-abortion ‘Kristallnacht.’ Because of this act of violence, the needs of women facing unplanned pregnancy will go unmet and babies will die,"" CompassCare CEO Jim Harden said in a statement.

CompassCare said pro-life service centers have been targeted with violence for months, both online and in-person.

""Ironically, New York’s Governor not only ignored the violence but instead earmarked $35 million in tax payer funds to increase security at abortion clinics. Adding insult to injury the New York legislature passed a bill investigating pro-life pregnancy centers precisely because they do not perform abortions,"" the organization wrote in its blog post.

Federal government officials warned last month that the Supreme Court's impending decision on Roe could lead to an increase of political violence. A May 13 memo from the Department of Homeland Security revealed that authorities were monitoring violent threats made by pro-abortion rights activists against the court, justices, lawmakers, churches, and both pro-life and abortion clinics.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Another pro-life pregnancy center was vandalized with threatening pro-abortion messages,"A pro-life crisis pregnancy center in Asheville, North Carolina was vandalized with spray-paint and threatening graffiti Tuesday, police said in news release.

Authorities are looking for the person(s) responsible for writing the words, ""If abortions aren't safe, neither are you!"" in front of Mountain Area Pregnancy Services in West Asheville. Police were called to the scene around 7:20 a.m. Tuesday to investigate the vandalism, according to the release.



Police said that someone had spray-painted the pregnancy center with red graffiti, writing threatening messages and an anarchist symbol in front of the building. More graffiti read, ""No forced birth"" on the side of the pregnancy center, and police said the building's windows were broken sometime overnight Monday.

Investigators found blood samples near a broken window at the scene of the crime and believe one of the vandals may have injured themselves, leaving behind a bloody trail.

Kristi Brown, the executive director of the pregnancy center, told the Asheville Citizen Times she was saddened by the crime.

""We're heartbroken over this. The emotions that our team is experiencing (are) all over the board, right? ... One moment you're sad, you're angry, you're frustrated. Then you're glad no one was harmed,"" she said.

No one was inside the building when the vandalism occurred and the center is still providing services for women, according to Brown.

Mountain Area Preg­nancy Ser­vices is a pro-life organization that ""provides compassionate care to women and men dealing with issues surrounding an at risk pregnancy,"" according to its website. The group offers pregnancy care and education for women, and provides resources for expecting mothers with unplanned or unwanted pregnancies as an alternative to an abortion.



""We don't refer for and we don't perform abortions, but we will engage them in conversations about what will happen if they make that choice,"" Brown said.



There has been a distressing uptick in violence against pro-life pregnancy centers in recent weeks since a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion in May indicated the court has voted to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision concerning abortion rights. A pro-life pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York was allegedly firebombed by pro-abortion terrorists Tuesday and another pro-life organization in Madison, Wisconsin was attacked with a Molotov cocktail last month.

"Progressive Seattle mayoral candidate refuses to pay rent, owes over $20K","""The rent is too damn high,"" reads a prompt on Seattle mayoral candidate Andrew Grant Houston's campaign website — and he means that literally.

According to a new report from conservative talk radio host Jason Rantz, the ""queer"" mayoral candidate — who also wants to raise the minimum wage to $23 an hour — has not paid rent since near the start of the pandemic and now owes the apartment complex where he is staying more than $20,000.

The aspiring politician, nicknamed ""Ace,"" is apparently one of many tenants taking advantage of nationwide eviction moratoriums put in place to shield renters from being kicked out of their homes during the pandemic-related economic crisis.

In April, the property management company that owns the $1,695-a-month Capitol Hill apartment that Houston rents emailed the candidate to check in on his payment plans.

""I understand you are running for mayor and on Teresa Mosqueda's staff,"" the email reportedly read. ""Our office recently received an inquiry from the press about the status of your rent balance. Before responding to them, we'd like to understand if you have any plans to get current on your outstanding balance of $14,485.""

Rantz reported that the property management company now claims Houston's debt has ballooned to $20,828.

It's unclear at this point whether Houston has plans to pay any of the rent money owed. But due to the eviction moratorium, the property management company is unable to kick him out of the apartment until the policy expires, which isn't until August.

In a statement to KTTH, Houston's team attempted to turn the issue into a campaign pitch showing how he is one with the people.

""Ace is one of an estimated 200,000 Washingtonians behind on their rents, in totals over $1 billion,"" the campaign's communications director, Dylan Austin, told the radio outlet. ""Ace is the only candidate in this race who doesn't own a home, and who has a stark contrast in personal wealth as compared to every other leading candidate (some in the millions).""

""Ace has the same lived experience of many Seattleites who struggled before (and struggle now) in a pandemic to keep up with soaring rent prices and affordability issues in our city,"" he added.

Not so ironically, one of Houston's major campaign issues happens to be ""housing justice,"" or more specifically, ""rent control."" On his campaign website, Houston proposes ""limit[ing] rental and commercial increases to 'inflation plus 2%' or 4%, whichever is higher.""

Before running for mayor, Houston operated an architecture practice in the city and also served as interim policy manager in Seattle councilmember Teresa Mosqueda's office.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/progressive-seattle-mayoral-candidate-owes-20k-rent,2021-07-19
Promise Keepers leader warns of pornography's extremely dangerous impact as reverend details what really happens to women in such films,"Promise Keepers ministry chair and CEO Ken Harrison says that pornography is one of the ultimate dividers between man and God — and more.

What are the details?

Harrison warned, during the 2022 Promise Keepers Marriage Summit, that men should be ""running in terror"" from pornography ""because it will separate us from God, from our kids, [and] from our wives.""

Harrison recounted a recent time with a group of men who insisted that they simply ""couldn't help themselves"" when it came to viewing pornography and who insisted that it was God who ""created them to be that way.""

Harrison recalled snapping, ""No, no, no. God didn't create you to be that way. God created you to have an intense longing for your wife. For the two to become one flesh. Sin created that same longing for every other woman.""

""The Bible,"" he continued, ""says we must flee from sin. It's an action. It's a running in terror from it, because it will separate us from God, from our kids, from our wives.""

Harrison added that struggling men don't have to live this way — so long as they turn over their whole lives to Jesus Christ.

""The Bible didn’t tell you to flee from lustful desires when it couldn’t actually happen,” he added. “You can’t get there in your flesh, you can’t get there by trying harder, you can’t get there by feeling guilty, but you can get there by giving your life over to Christ.”

The event, livestreamed on Monday, also featured National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference President Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, who said that women aren't participating in pornography because it's ""fun,"" but because they're being used.

""She's doing it because she's been sexually traumatized, or abused, or trafficked,"" Rodriguez said.

Harrison added, ""Those people who are making that movie are not doing it because they're your friends — they're doing it because every time you click on a mouse, they make more money to exploit more women.""

Rodriguez pointed out that the very institution of marriage is under ""unprecedented assault"" and should be defended to the death.

“Healthy marriages produce healthy families, healthy families assimilate and make up healthy churches, healthy churches produce healthy communities, a healthy community will produce a healthy state, a healthy state will be part of a healthy nation,” he reasoned.

VIDEO: Liberal protesters confront Biden's DHS secretary at his home and demand he stop deportations,"Illegal immigrant advocates targeted the home of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for a protest over the immigration policies they say are an extension of former President Donald Trump's policies.

Videos posted to the social media account of ""Never Again Action"" showed protesters at Mayorkas' home with a 30-foot banner accusing him of continuing policies of the previous administration.

""Never Again Action"" describes itself as a group of ""Jews, immigrants & allies"" banding together to abolish the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In another video, protesters appear to confront Mayorkas and his wife in front of their Washington, D.C., home.

""We talked briefly to the wife of DHS Secretary Mayorkas. She was very angry, and told us that this was her family home. And we really do understand that,"" the account tweeted.

""But again, there are families being torn apart every day,"" they added. ""There are people being deported from their home forever, every day.""



In a statement issued by the organization they specifically point to the ""Title 42 policy"" under which the Trump administration deported many migrants seeking refugee status out of the country while their application was processed. Biden has also used the same rationale to deport Haitian migrants who showed up by the thousands in Del Rio, Texas, asking for refugee status.

The group also claimed to have shut down all access through the gates at the DHS offices by blocking them with their cars.

On Friday, Mayorkas said that all the migrants who had been sheltering under a bridge in Del Rio had been removed, effectively ending the squalid encampment. Later on Sunday, he admitted under pressure from Chris Wallace of Fox News that many thousands of those migrants had not been deported to Haiti, but had been allowed into the United States.

The Biden administration has also been criticized from many on the right for relaxing other immigration policies. Some reports say the rhetoric from the Biden administration has precipitated the immigration crisis at the border by appearing to encourage illegal aliens to seek legal status or refugee status.

Protesters angry over Rittenhouse acquittal demand communist revolution: 'The only solution is communist revolution!',"Protesters angry that Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all criminal charges against him gathered in Chicago on Saturday and demanded a communist revolution.

What happened?

Jesse Jackson and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition led the protest in downtown Chicago. Jackson called the Rittenhouse verdict a ""major blow against justice and open season by the violence of right-wing military,"" according to WBBM-TV.

The protesters reportedly demanded the Justice Department intervene and investigate the Rittenhouse trial because the jury was ""mostly white."" However, data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that nearly 80% of Kenosha residents are, in fact, white.

Video taken from the rally showed demonstrators parading down Chicago streets with a large sign that read, ""Rittenhouse—Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! No Facist USA. Organize Now For Real Revolution."" Another sign read, ""End The Trump Era. Stop White Supremacy."" The crowd was chanting, ""If we don't get it— shut it down!"" and ""No Justice, No Peace!""

Content Warning:Strong language:



At one point during demonstrations, protesters began openly calling for a communist revolution.

""The only solution is communist revolution! The only solution is communist revolution! The only solution is communist revolution!"" the crowd chanted. ""That's right! We need communism. That's what we need. We need that! We need that, sister, we need that very much!""

Other protesters who spoke to local media voiced frustrations using trite talking points.

""I'm still very, very disappointed. Just a travesty of justice. The illegal gun possession, the Kenosha police basically deputizing him. All of it is based in racism,"" one protester told WGN-TV.

Another protester told the same outlet the Rittenhouse verdict represents ""a green light for more white supremacy vigilante terror.""

Can the DOJ do anything?

Despite demands for DOJ intervention into the decision by 12 of Rittenhouse's peers to conclude he acted in self-defense, thereby making him not guilty of committing murder, it remains unclear what the Justice Department could do, if anything at all.

Rittenhouse was never charged with a federal crime, nor did the murder accusations against Rittenhouse invoke violations of federal law.

More from WOFL-TV:

Rittenhouse was not accused of a hate crime and because he is not a member of law enforcement, he cannot be charged with depriving anyone of their civil rights as a federal agent. Rittenhouse was also not accused of a robbery on federal property or involving a federal business.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department's explains on its own website the agency cannot intervene in matters of state law.

""The Department of Justice has no authority to intervene in matters of state law. The Department of Justice can assume jurisdiction only when there has been a violation of federal law,"" the DOJ website states.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/protesters-angry-over-rittenhouse-acquittal-demand-communist-revolution-the-only-solution-is-communist-revolution,2021-11-21
Radicals call for violence in Georgia after police kill leftist militant who allegedly shot Georgia state trooper unprovoked,"Radical leftists have for months terrorized builders, first responders, and law-abiding Georgians near the new police training center in DeKalb County's South River Forest. In previous attacks — some of which have been branded instances of domestic terrorism — they have thrown Molotov cocktails at police and firefighters, sabotaged equipment, torched vehicles, and hurled gas bombs.

On Wednesday, one leftist crossed the blue line and paid the price.

Showdown in the woods

The GBI noted that law enforcement officers were conducting a coordinated operation to ""identify people who were trespassing and committing other crimes on the future Atlanta Public Safety Training Center,"" a center dubbed ""Cop City"" by radicals.

Several people were arrested over the course of the operation.

Troopers came across a trespasser inside a tent when clearing out a wooded area near Constitution Road around 9 a.m., where just a month earlier, six leftists had been arrested and charged with domestic terrorism.

According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, officers gave verbal commands to the man. Instead of complying, he reportedly fired multiple shots at officers without warning, striking a Georgia State Patrol trooper in the gut.

According to the Associated Press, officers answered back with a chorus of gunfire, killing the leftist gunman.

A handgun and shell casings were located at the scene.

The Atlanta Community Press Collective, an extremist-aligned online publication, claimed that the gunman was Manuel Teran who ""used they/it pronouns.""

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the wounded trooper, who has not yet been identified, was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital and is presently in stable condition.



Georgia State Patrol Col. Chris Wright indicated that while the trooper is in stable condition, ""he's not out of the woods yet.""

Georgia Bureau of Investigation update on trooper, protestor shot near 'Cop City' youtu.be

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) tweeted, ""Marty, the girls, and I are praying for this brave Trooper and public safety officers across all law enforcement agencies today. As our thoughts remain with him and his family, our resolve also remains steadfast and strong to see criminals brought to justice.""

Leftist extremists vow more violence

Leftists were apparently invigorated by this bloodletting.

Some reportedly took to the streets, blocking a busy intersection near the complex, chanting ""Stop Cop City!"" and ""If you build it, we will burn it!""

The website ""Scenes from the Atlanta Forest,"" whereon local leftists frequently coordinate and celebrate their attacks, published a post on Thursday calling for retaliation.

""The worst has come to pass,"" said the post. ""An unnamed forest defender has been shot and killed in Weelaunee. Consider this a call for reciprocal violence to be done to the police and their allies. On Friday, January 20th, wherever you are, you are invited to participate in a night of rage in order to honor the memory of our fallen comrade.""

""Make them pay,"" the author said, apparently hoping to incite further violence against officers of the law.

The post was signed, ""Defenders of the Forest.""

The group to whom the post was attributed told Fox News Digital that it is ""a broad, diverse, decentralized movement to defend the Atlanta forest"" and that they are not affiliated with Scenes from the Atlanta forest.

In a corresponding set of tweets from a now suspended account, the violent leftist group wrote, ""Now is the time for bravery. Take care of each other. Be dangerous together.""

The group claimed on its website that it seeks to ""create a peaceful society that does not treat human life as expendable,"" while calling the defensive shooting of an attempted cop-killer a ""tragedy.""

The Atlanta Community Press Collective, similarly linked to the violent leftists trespassing near the police training center, claimed that the man who allegedly attempted to murder law enforcement officers was a ""forest defender [killed] for loving this earth, for taking a stand against the ongoing destruction of the planet and its people.""

The collective said in a post, ""We will not go quietly into this dark night. RIP, with love and solidarity.""

GBI Director Mike Register told reporters, 'We're dealing not with protesters but with criminals.""

TheBlaze previously reported on the hard line law enforcement is taking on violence committed by leftists in the area.

Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum told the Journal-Constitution., ""The discourse of opposition is in city halls, it is in the public square, it is on the sidewalks. That is where you note your displeasure or your disagreement. ... It is not in Molotov cocktails. It is not in shooting fireworks at firefighters ... it is not throwing rocks at our squad cars. That is criminal activity.""

District Attorney Sherry Boston said in a release, ""I strongly believe in the right to peacefully protest for what one believes is right and just. However, I draw the line at violence, destruction of property, and threatening and causing harm to others. ... The alleged acts of violence at the training facility site put the public in grave danger, and will not be tolerated.""



Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) tweeted in December, ""We will not rest when it comes to bringing domestic terrorists to justice, and these arrests should serve as a strong reminder of that.""

Rand Paul blasts 'slanderous' domestic terrorism bill from Democrats,"Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul offered a blistering critique of a domestic terrorism bill supported by Democrats Tuesday, moments before GOP senators blocked the bill from advancing.

In remarks on the Senate floor, Paul called the legislation an ""insult"" to police officers and members of the armed services.



""The implication of this bill is that all people are bad. That there's this great and worrisome thing that is infecting America when the opposite is true,"" Paul said, referring to claims by Democrats and the media that white supremacist ideology and the so-called ""Great Replacement"" conspiracy theory are fueling domestic terror in the U.S.

""They're insulting everyone. They're insulting the police, they're insulting our Marines, they're insulting our armed services,"" he said.

Democrats brought the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022 up for debate in response to the recent deadly mass shootings at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, and an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. The bill passed in the House days after the Buffalo shooting, when a self-described white supremacist killed 10 people at a grocery store in a largely black neighborhood.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) characterized the bill as an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to address gun violence in America.

“The bill is so important because the mass shooting in Buffalo was an act of domestic terrorism. We need to call it what it is, domestic terrorism. It was terrorism that fed off the poison of conspiracy theories like white replacement theory,” Schumer said in a floor speech ahead of the vote, according to The Hill.

The legislation would create two new offices in the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security specifically assigned to combat domestic terrorism. It would also set up a task force to address white supremacy in the U.S. military. Each new agency would be required to submit a report every six months examining ""the domestic terrorism threat posed by White supremacists and neo-Nazis, including White supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and the uniformed service,"" CBS News reports.



Paul accused these proposed offices of being the ""thought police of the military"" and said Democrats know the bill has no chance of ever becoming law.

""It's a dumb Washington talking-points memo masquerading as legislation,"" Paul said. ""But it's also a grave insult to anyone involved in law enforcement, anyone involved in the military.""

A vote on the measure split 47-47 along party lines, falling well short of the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.

Republican congressman calls for Rashida Tlaib be removed from committee,"Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Penn.) is calling for the removal of Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from her congressional committees because he claims that she has engaged in a ""disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism,"" including attending an ""anti-Israel advocacy"" conference.

""This week, Democrat Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib participated in a forum led by one of the nation's most anti-Israel advocacy groups that featured other participants with reported connections to Hamas, terrorism financiers, and the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement,"" Reschenthaler wrote in a statement released on Saturday.



""Rep. Tlaib's participation in this conference, coupled with her recently deleted retweet of a slogan calling for the elimination of Israel, are just the latest examples of a deeply disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism that has been on display since she was elected,"" the GOP congressman stated. ""Yet Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats refuse to condemn her heinous behavior.""

Reschenthaler referred to the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, where 11 people were killed. Over 50 criminal charges, including 11 counts of hate crimes, were filed against the suspect, who the Justice Department will intend to seek the death penalty against.

""As a Member of Congress representing southwestern Pennsylvania, I have seen firsthand what happens when we stand by and allow anti-Semitism and intolerance to pervade our communities,"" Reschenthaler said. ""In 2018, eleven Jewish worshippers were killed and six others were wounded at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.""

""The day after this cowardly act of violence, I stood in solidarity with Americans of all religions, races, and ethnicities at a vigil honoring the victims of this heinous crime, and the first time I ever spoke on the House floor was to denounce hatred and bigotry in all forms,"" he said.



Reschenthaler cited how Republicans vehemently denounced Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) for his comments about white supremacy and white nationalism.

""House Republicans demonstrated we have zero tolerance for hateful speech in our ranks,"" Reschenthaler noted. ""When outgoing Republican Congressman Steve King made inexcusable racist remarks, not only did he receive widespread condemnation from both sides of the aisle, but Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy rightfully stripped him of his committee assignments.""



Reschenthaler said on Sunday, ""The lack of condemnation from the left regarding Rashida Tlaib's attendance at an anti-Israel conference last week is deeply disturbing.""

During Thanksgiving weekend, the Democratic representatives headlined the annual American Muslims for Palestine conference, which was virtual this year.

Tlaib, along with fellow Democratic representatives Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Betty McCollum (Minn.), reportedly attended a conference ""run by one of the nation's most prolific anti-Israel advocacy groups, lending their support to an organization that champions boycotts of Israel and has partnered with individuals tied to terrorism,"" according to the Free Beacon.

Last week, Tlaib retweeted and then deleted a tweet that stated, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""



""The phrase 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' first rose to prominence as the slogan of the Palestine Liberation Organization during its founding in 1964. It refers to the notion that the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea should be entirely under Arab control, with a Jewish state eliminated,"" the New York Post reported.

The tweet, which was posted for ""International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People,"" was later deleted by Tlaib.

4 people with names on terror watchlist arrested at US southern border since October 1: reports,"Four people whose names match those of suspects on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database have been arrested trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico since Oct. 1 of last year, according to multiple reports.

What are the details?

Axios first reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to Congress Tuesday that three of the individuals apprehended were Yemen nationals and another was Serbian, citing an unnamed congressional aide who was purportedly ""briefed on the correspondence.""

Fox News then confirmed the report, citing a congressional aide ""familiar with CBP information,"" noting that the ""Serbian national was encountered on Jan. 28, amid an increasing surge in migrant numbers in recent months.""

The outlet pointed out that ""House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy [R-Calif.] said on Monday, during a visit to the border, that Border Patrol agents had been warning lawmakers about foreign nationals on the terror watch list getting in,"" adding that ""McCarthy said migrants were coming from Yemen, China, Sri Lanka and Iran."" Fox also reported that ""Border Patrol agents arrested 11 Iranian citizens in Arizona last month.""

The Daily Wire reported that Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) also warned that terror suspects were ""starting to exploit the southern border"" under President Joe Biden's loosened policies on border security.

""Individuals that they have on the watch list for terrorism are now starting to exploit the southern border,"" Katko — the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee — said during a press conference at the border. ""People who they've got in the last few days… have been on the terror watchlist.""

Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that Democrats dismissed McCarthy's claims, even calling him a liar.

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) tweeted in reaction to the minority leader's comments, ""Weird as the Chairman of the subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations and a border state member of Congress haven't heard anything about this. Gonna ask for a briefing. Pretty sure he is either wrong or lying.""

The Post wrote:

McCarthy's claims echo repeated assertions by President Donald Trump and members of his administration that terrorists were using the southern border to sneak into the United States, a line Trump often used to justify his attempts to build a wall and tighten immigration rules.



But those claims withered under scrutiny.

McCarthy shared the Axios story on social media on Tuesday, tweeting, ""The crisis at the border is a national security vulnerability for the U.S. As I said yesterday and Border Patrol confirmed today, they have caught individuals on the Terrorist Watch List attempting to enter our country. We must secure our border now.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-4-people-with-names-on-terror-watchlist-arrested-at-us-southern-border-since-october-1-reports,2021-03-16
"At least one killed, 15 people injured in suspected terrorist attacks in Vienna","At least one victim was killed and 15 people wounded in suspected terrorist attacks at multiple locations Monday night in Vienna, Austria. One alleged perpetrator was also killed by law enforcement, and a police officer is among the wounded.

What are the details?

The Associated Press reported that police ""said several shots were fired"" in ""a lively street in the city center and that there were six different shooting locations,"" adding that ""Austria's top security official said authorities believe there were several gunmen involved and that a police operation was still ongoing.""

Gunfire broke out near the central synagogue in the Austrian capital shortly after 8 p.m. local time, but it is unclear whether the place of worship was a target because it was closed at the time.

Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told the media, ""At the moment I can confirm we believe this is an apparent terror attack,"" according to Reuters.

Authorities gave no indication of the identity of the assailants or reason for the attack.

Sky News reported that 15 people were transported to a hospital for treatment of injuries, and seven of them were seriously wounded. One of the injured is a law enforcement officer.

One civilian has been confirmed dead, and one suspect was killed by police.

Politico noted:

Viennese police on Twitter warned locals to stay away from public places and public transport. Monday is the last night before Austria's nationwide coronavirus lockdown begins, and some had therefore decided to go out to restaurants, bars and other venues. Many are now trapped in these places in the city center.

Vienna's chief Rabbi Scholomo Hofmeister told British radio outlet LBC that he witnessed ""at least two"" gunmen firing upon bar and restaurant patrons at the scene of one of the attack locations.

Anything else?

The attacks on Vienna follow two recent terrorist attacks in France that left four people dead — two of whom were decapitated — following the republishing of satirical cartoons by Charlie Hebdo magazine, which depicted the Islamic Prophet Muhammed.

France is now facing a boycott by hard-lined Muslims in countries across the globe, and demonstrations were held worldwide. Tens of thousands of Muslims have marched in the streets condemning the cartoons as blasphemy, even hanging and burning effigies of French President Emmanuel Macron after he condemned the murders and defended the right to free expression.

Macron tweeted in German on Monday, """"We, French people, share in the shock and sorrow of Austrians after an attack in Vienna. After France, another friendly country has been attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with. We will not give up.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-at-least-one-killed-several-injured-in-suspected-terrorist-attacks-in-vienna,2020-11-03
"Muslim protesters hang, burn effigies of French President Macron for his refusal to condemn satire","Protests against France continue to rage in countries across the world, with tens of thousands of Muslim demonstrators taking to the streets demanding the French ban satirical cartoons depicting Islamic Prophet Muhammad.

Demonstrators have burned and hanged effigies of President Emmanuel Macron due to his refusal to condemn the circulation of the cartoons published in Charlie Hebdo magazine, after a teacher was beheaded last week allegedly for sharing the materials in a lesson on free expression.

A second attack linked to terrorism left at least three churchgoers dead — with one beheaded — on Thursday in Nice, France, after calls for jihad over the blasphemy of mocking the religious figure.

What's the background?

In 2015, Charlie Hebdo's offices were attacked by gunmen, who left a dozen dead and another 11 injured in retaliation for the satirical magazine publishing cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammed.

Charlie Hebdo republished the cartoons earlier this year in conjunction with the trial of 14 people accused of assisting in the murders, leading to a reemergence of uproar from Muslims and renewed threats to the magazine's employees.

Following the second publication of the cartoons, French teacher Samuel Paty showed the images to his students earlier this month. As TheBlaze previously reported:

The father of one of his students began an internet campaign against Baty, uploading videos to YouTube and Facebook blasting the teacher and claiming that he showed cartoons of Muhammad with his genitals exposed. The campaign caught fire in the Muslim world, with worldwide calls for reprisal against Baty and against the French government, who naturally refused to take action against Baty.



Ultimately, Baty was murdered and beheaded on Oct. 16 by an 18-year-old Chechen Muslim refugee named Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov, who was himself caught and killed by police as he attempted to flee the scene.

Macron responded by holding a ceremony honoring the murdered teacher, where the French president declared, ""He was killed because Islamists want our future. They will never have it.""

Hard-line Muslims worldwide called for boycotting France following the ordeal. Meanwhile, some French citizens have showed their solidarity with Macron in honoring the teacher and free expression by displaying the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in windows of homes and shops.

What's happening now?

The Associated Press reported that ""tens of thousands of Muslims, from Pakistan to Lebanon to the Palestinian territories, poured out of prayer services to join anti-France protests on Friday, as the French president's vow to protect the right to caricature the Prophet Muhammad continues to roil the Muslim world.""

The outlet further reported:

Demonstrations in Pakistan's capital Islamabad turned violent as some 2,000 people who tried to march toward the French Embassy were pushed back by police firing tear gas and beating protesters with batons. Crowds of Islamist activists hanged an effigy of French President Emmanuel Macron from a highway overpass after pounding it furiously with their shoes. Several demonstrators were wounded in clashes with police as authorities pushed to evict activists from the area surrounding the embassy.

In Bangladesh, protesters set an effigy of Macron ablaze.

One cleric leading protests in Pakistan yelled, ""There's only one punishment for blasphemy,"" to which the crowd yelled back, ""Beheading! Beheading!""

Pakistan Supreme Court orders release of man convicted in murder of Daniel Pearl,"Pakistan's Supreme Court sparked international outrage Thursday by ordering the release of a man who was convicted in the gruesome 2002 murder of late Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl before being acquitted last year.

What are the details?

Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh has been on death row since his conviction for luring Pearl to his death at the hands of Al Qaeda, but was acquitted of his murder conviction in April 2020 along with three other individuals accused of lesser charges in connection to the killing, the Associated Press reported.

But all four men were tried together in the original case, and doubt cast regarding the guilt of other defendants caused two out of three judges to decide all should now be let free.

The Washington Post reported that the Pearl family's appeal to Sheikh's conviction being overturned was submitted quickly after last year's decision, ""but that was ultimately dismissed Thursday by Pakistan's Supreme Court,"" too.

Judea Pearl, Daniel's father, tweeted Thursday:

When a killer is behind bars, responsibility is absorbed by one deranged individual. When a killer is freed, society as a whole assumes responsibility for the crime. Today, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has handed an indictment to an entire nation, institutionally, culturally, and morally, for one of the most horrific crime[s] of the century, which forever will stain the moral standing of that nation. We urge the US Department of Justice to vigorously pursue a request for extraditing Omar Schiek to stand a trial in the US, and we hope Pakistan responds positively to such request, to rectify the injustice brought about today by two of the three judges.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the Pakistan high court's decision ""an affront to terror victims everywhere,"" saying that Washington is ""committed to securing justice for Daniel Pearl's family,"" according to Reuters.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement saying that the ""United States recognizes past Pakistani actions to hold Omar Sheikh accountable and notes that Sheikh currently remains detained under Pakistani law.""

Blinken added, ""We are also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States for his horrific crimes against an American citizen.""

What else?

Report: Biden State Department refuses to use term 'Abraham Accords' when discussing historic Trump achievement,"The Biden administration is reportedly discouraging State Department employees from using the name ""Abraham Accords"" when discussing the historic peace agreements brokered by former President Donald Trump and signed by Israel and several of its Arab neighbors to normalize relations.

The Washington Free Beacon reported Friday that the State Department has erased the name of the accords from their internal communications as officials are pressured to refer to the peace deals simply as ""normalization agreements.""

The Abraham Accords are a series of agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and several other Muslim nations that were once antagonistic towards the world's lone Jewish state to normalize relations. Speaking last year, President Trump declared the agreements ""the dawn of a new Middle East.""



But according to the Free Beacon's source, the Biden administration is seeking to purge the name ""Abraham Accords"" for some unknown reason.

From the report:

Following inquiries to the State Department about the emails and the source's information, a spokesman told the Free Beacon, ""the Department would refer to the Abraham Accords as such."" The department declined to comment on the emails in question or make clear whether its statement represents another shift in policy. A State Department official, speaking only on background, said, ""This administration is not focused on what these agreements are called but what they mean.""



It is unclear what impact the Biden administration believes the change will have. The State Department declined to explain its position. ""It's a name the Trump administration came up with, a branding they came up with, and they prefer not to use it because it's associated with President Trump. For the U.S. to shy away from that term, it's absurd, petty, and silly."" Team Biden, the source said, further saw the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas terror groups ""as an, 'Ah-ha!' moment to **** on the Abraham Accords.""





Evidence that this policy is in effect surfaced in early April, when Associated Press diplomatic correspondent Matthew Lee repeatedly tried to get State Department spokesman Ned Price to state the ""specific name"" of the agreements. Price bizarrely evaded the question several times before finally calling them the ""Abraham Accords.""

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reacted to the Free Beacon's story on social media, suggesting that the Biden administration's policy was implemented out of spite for Trump or ""they so despise religious freedom that the faith-driven name we gave to these historic deals upends their anti-religious outlook.""

""Maybe both?"" Pompeo mused.

"Report: Israel suspected in large explosion at Iranian nuclear site, a 'severe blow' that may prevent uranium enrichment there for rest of 2021","Israel is suspected of being behind a large explosion at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment site Sunday, which resulted in a blackout and the complete destruction of its power system. It could prevent the facility from enriching uranium for the rest of year, the New York Times reported, citing anonymous intelligence officials.

What are the details?

The Times cited two officials who described a classified Israeli operation that dealt a ""severe blow"" to Iran's ability to enrich uranium — and that it could take at least nine months to restore Natanz's production.



Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, called it an act of ""nuclear terrorism"" and said the international community must confront the threat, the paper reported.

""The action this morning against the Natanz enrichment site shows the defeat of those who oppose our country's nuclear and political development and the significant gains of our nuclear industry,"" Salehi said, according to Times, which cited Iranian news media. ""The incident shows the failure of those who oppose Iran negotiating for sanctions relief.""

The act also ""injected new uncertainty into diplomatic efforts that began last week to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal repudiated by the Trump administration,"" the paper noted.

More from the Times:

Iran did not say precisely what had caused the blackout at the heavily fortified site, which has been a target of previous sabotage, and Israel publicly declined to confirm or deny any responsibility. But American and Israeli intelligence officials said there had been an Israeli role. [...]



It was not immediately clear how much advance word — if any — the Biden administration received about the Natanz operation, which happened on the same morning that the American defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, was visiting Israel. But Israeli officials have made no secret of their unhappiness over Mr. Biden's desire to revive the nuclear agreement that his predecessor renounced in 2018.

The talks to salvage the nuclear agreement — i.e., Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — are set to resume this week, the paper added.

'Sabotage and infiltration'

Malek Shariati Niasar, an Iranian lawmaker and spokesman for the Parliament's energy committee, said on Twitter that the outage was ""very suspicious"" and raised the possibility of ""sabotage and infiltration,"" the Times reported.

More from the paper:

Some Iranian experts dismissed initial speculation that a cyberattack could have caused the power loss. The Natanz complex has its own power grid, multiple backup systems and layers of security protection intended to stop such an attack from abruptly shutting down its system.



""It's hard to imagine that it was a cyberattack,"" said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. ""The likely scenario is that it either targeted the facility indirectly or through physical infiltration."" The intelligence officials said it was indeed a detonation of explosives.

What else has gone down?

Iranian military leaders threatened Israel following mysterious explosions at Iranian nuclear and military sites last year, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

""We warn the Zionist liars and their puppeteers that if they continue their prattle, they will see the upper hand of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the resistance front in action,"" Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi was quoted as saying in the country's state-controlled press, the Free Beacon said.

In November Iran claimed one of its top nuclear scientists was assassinated with Israeli involvement. The Israeli government believed Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the mastermind directing Iran's nuclear weapons program in the early 2000s.

Immediately following Fakhrizadeh's death, the New York Times was blasted for calling Iran's nuclear program ""peaceful.""

In December Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he had ""no doubt"" that then-President-elect Joe Biden will ""bow"" to Iran and rejoin the nuclear deal.

Indeed, the Biden administration in February said it was ready to begin talks with Iran to rejoin the deal.

"Salon owner sues Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, accusing Democrat of retaliating over lockdown defiance","Oregon salon owner Lindsey Graham has filed a lawsuit against her state, its Democratic Gov. Kate Brown, and a number of agency officials, seeking $100,000 in damages after being hit with fines and even a visit from child welfare workers after Graham defied COVID-19 lockdown orders.

What are the details?

Graham says Brown retaliated against her, her business, and her family for reopening her Glamour salon in May, violating the state's stay-at-home order. After reopening, Oregon's Occupational Safety and Health Division hit her with a $14,000 fine and the state's Child Welfare Division sent workers to search her home, questioning her, her husband, and one of her kids.

""I've never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could have ever been done to me or my family,"" the business owner of 15 years said at the time.

Graham filed a lawsuit Dec. 18 against a slew of state officials including Brown herself, alleging that the defendants violated Graham's U.S. and state constitutional rights, intentionally inflicted emotional distress on the salon owner, and abused processes in order to target Graham in retaliation.

The lawsuit states:

""While individuals and businesses such as Graham and Glamour struggled to make ends meet for nearly six (6) weeks, government employees like Defendant Kate Brown and the other individual named defendants did not have to worry about where their next paycheck would come from.""

The suit also claims:

""Defendant Kate Brown grew increasingly frustrated with the fact that Graham and Glamour refused to bow down to her authority. Defendant Kate Brown publicly called Graham and Glamour's 're-opening' 'unfortunate' and 'irresponsible' — only further making Graham and Glamour a target by the government.""

'She came at me with the full weight of the state'

""As soon as I tried to open my doors against the governor's mandate back in May, she came at me with the full weight of the state,"" Graham told Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" with Laura Ingraham on Monday. ""She terrorized myself, she terrorized my stylists, and she terrorized my family. She took every government agency she could, and she put her full weight into intimidating me into closing, including sending Child Protective Services to my home and threatening the removal of my children.""

Graham noted that CPS showed up on her doorstep just a few days after her salon reopening, claiming they were acting on an anonymous call.

""[They] opened a full-blown case against me which was completely bogus and unwarranted, and it didn't come until I shot back at them with a threat of the lawsuit"" that they closed the case, she told Fox News.

Remembering 9/11: We must never forget the day America changed forever,"America changed forever 20 years ago this morning.

Nearly 3,000 Americans tragically died when Al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and crashed them into symbols of American power: The Twin Towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Brave Americans aboard United Airlines Flight 93 thwarted a fourth attack believed to be headed for the U.S. Capitol building or the White House. That plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania when passengers rushed the terrorists in the Boeing 757's flight deck.

The full-throttled response of the American military to the attack resulted in thousands of more American deaths, while even more Americans have died of illnesses and cancers related to 9/11 than actually died in the attacks themselves.

Today, we remember all of those people and their families.

The 9/11 Memorial in New York City. (David Handschuh-Pool/Getty Images)

America is now two decades removed from Sept. 11, 2001, and an entire generation of Americans have no memory of that day or the significance 9/11 plays in the American consciousness.

But we must never forget.

We must always remember the victims and continue tell their stories. We must remember The Falling Man, the first responders, and the way in which Americans rallied together in the aftermath of the cowardly attacks. We must remember how we felt when we heard then-President George W. Bush, while standing on rubble at Ground Zero, tell first responders, unable to hear him, that the world hears us.

""I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you— and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.""

From CBS News archives: Bush visits ground zero days after 9/11 www.youtube.com

The Founding Fathers envisioned America to be a beacon of hope, a place of independence and freedom, where everyone has opportunity to succeed and forge a flourishing life for themselves and their families.

Terrorists attacked those ideals when they attacked us. And while they may have succeeded in knocking down buildings, they ultimately failed in their mission to destroy America.

In the face of great evil, Americans demonstrated our great resolve.

From the ashes where terrorists attacked rose unity, hope, resilience, compassion, generosity, strength, fortitude, and everything that makes America great.

Today, 20 years later, we remember the victims, we remember the first responders, and we remember the U.S. service members who have died fighting to defend our freedoms. But let us also remember that American spirit, our common bond, and the love that held us together in the face of unspeakable tragedy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/remembering-sept-11-20-years-later,2021-09-11
Rep. Zeldin calls it 'infuriating' that the Taliban has control of Afghanistan on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks,"Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York is disturbed to see the Taliban in power in Afghanistan on the two-decade anniversary of the heinous Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

""With Americans remembering the 20th anniversary of September 11th, the Taliban is right where they were on that very day in 2001 - in control of Afghanistan. It's infuriating and it was preventable,"" Zeldin tweeted.

Zeldin characterized America's military withdrawal from Afghanistan as ""extremely flawed,"" according to Fox News, which interviewed the lawmaker.

""I would describe the emotion as infuriating,"" the congressman said, according to the outlet. ""The consequences of leaving Americans and billions of dollars of our weaponry behind in the hands of the Taliban is infuriating.""

""The deception, the poor planning, the poor execution certainly leads to all of us being so upset by the reality that the 20th anniversary of 9/11 is going to be spent with the Taliban back in control of Afghanistan, with a nation seen as a safe haven to terror, and the prospects of al Qaeda and ISIS rising as a result,"" Zeldin said.

""And the worst part of it was that it was foreseeable, predictable and avoidable, and should have been prevented,"" he noted, according to the outlet.

Zeldin, who has served in Congress since 2015, announced an Empire State gubernatorial bid earlier this year.

""After completing the Army ROTC program, Congressman Zeldin served four years on Active Duty,"" according to the biography on his website. He is presently an Army Reserve Lieutenant Colonel.

""Creating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely allowing the rise of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, that has ramifications beyond Afghanistan's borders,"" he noted, according to Fox News. ""Having a president and a commander in chief who doesn't seem to grasp how, and why, adversaries should be confronted, and how to communicate honestly on these foreign policy issues with the American public, all creates an increased vulnerability here at home.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-zeldin-notes-that-the-20th-anniversary-of-9-11-is-going-to-be-spent-with-the-taliban-back-in-control-of-afghanistan,2021-09-10
Report: 9/11 mastermind could escape death penalty with plea deal,"The United States government is reportedly negotiating plea deals that could take the death penalty off the table for the five defendants charged with planning and executing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and four other Guantánamo Bay detainees including Ramzi Binalshibh, Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, Walid bin Attash, and Ammar al-Baluchi were charged in 2008 with the murder of nearly 3,000 people, terrorism, providing material support to terrorism and plane hijacking, and various other crimes related to the terror attacks.

Prosecutors sought the death penalty for each of the five men, but they have evaded justice for their crimes for decades as their cases have progressed through the military commission system. The cases have been delayed by the defense's request for CIA evidence related to enhanced interrogation techniques, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, at the 21st anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, CBS News correspondent Catherine Herridge reported Sunday that military prosecutors and defense attorneys for the five Guantánamo detainees are negotiating plea deals that could remove the death penalty and keep the military base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, open indefinitely.

A spokesperson for the military trials confirmed that ""the parties are currently engaged in preliminary plea negotiations,"" according to CBS News.



""All five defendants and the government are all engaged in good faith negotiations, with the idea of bringing this trial which has become a forever trial to an end,"" said James Connell, a defense attorney for al-Baluchi.

""Mr. al-Baluchi's number one priority is obtaining medical care for his torture,"" Connell told CBS News. ""In order to get that medical care, he is willing to plead guilty to a substantial sentence at Guantánamo in exchange for a guarantee of medical care and dropping the death penalty.""

Before the defendants were transferred to Guantánamo Bay in 2006, they were held by the CIA and interrogated. Defense attorneys for the Guantánamo five have alleged that enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA amounted to torture.

Alka Pradhan, a human rights attorney on the al-Baluchi legal team, told CBS News the government repeatedly bashed his client's head against a wall, resulting in lasting brain damage.

""The United States government failed all of us after Sept. 11 in their decisions to use illegal techniques and illegal programs. … In doing so, it rather corrupted all the legal processes,"" Pradhan said.

But families of 9/11 victims said there can be no justice until the perpetrators of the attacks are executed for their crimes.

""I will not have closure as long as there is any possibility for some future president to commute their sentences or trade them away for something political that they want from some other country. That's a very real possibility because it's now been done over and over and over again,"" said Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles ""Chic"" Burlingame was a pilot killed when al Qaeda terrorists hijacked his plane, American Airlines Flight 77, and crashed it into the Pentagon.

Burlingame told Herridge she's afraid ""we've reached a point in our country where we just don't seem to have … the courage of our convictions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-911-mastermind-could-escape-death-penalty,2022-09-12
Report: At least 23 illegal immigrants caught in 2021 were on terror watch list,"At least 23 people attempting to illegally cross the southern border in 2021 were on the terror watch list maintained by the FBI, according to a report.

Fox News on Monday revealed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that between Jan. 20 and Dec. 27, 2021, there were 23 border encounters with individuals whose names were on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database.

Eleven encounters happened in Texas, four in Arizona, and eight in California, according to data Fox News reportedly obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed in December.

The terror watch list is maintained by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, which was established after the 9/11 attacks to consolidate several different terrorism watch lists. This watch list has information on people reasonably suspected to be involved in terrorism (or related activities),"" according to the FBI.



In March, Fox News reported that House Republicans on the Oversight and Homeland Security committees had asked the Biden administration to make public the number of migrants encountered at the southern border who are on the terror watch list.



""Reporting indicates that multiple individuals with terrorist ties have been recently apprehended after illegally crossing the border, and that such encounters may be increasing,"" Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.) and John Katko (R-N.Y.) wrote in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.



""The American people deserve to know whether President Biden’s weak border policies are allowing terrorists to enter our homeland,"" they said.

Republicans have argued for years that an unsecured southern border and rampant illegal immigration endanger national security by letting terrorists, drug cartels, human traffickers, and other criminal elements into the country. Former President Donald Trump, a Republican, won office in 2016 by bringing this issue to the forefront of his campaign, famously pledging to build a wall on the southern border and create other physical barriers to illegal immigrants.

Democrats say they also support border security, but have criticized hard-line Republican policies as unfair and exclusionary toward legitimate asylum-seekers. Democratic President Joe Biden, since assuming office in 2021, has worked to undo many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies and halted construction of the border wall.



Most recently, the Biden administration has announced it will end a Trump-era pandemic health order, called Title 42, which required migrants to wait outside the country for their asylum claims to be processed and gave expedited authority to border agents to deport those who entered the country illegally. The order will expire on May 23, but some administration officials have warned that illegal immigration will surge even higher once the policy is rolled back.

Officials estimate that as many as 18,000 additional migrants will be encountered at the border each day once Title 42 ends.

Illegal immigration has surged under Biden's watch as a result of perceptions that he is more lenient toward migrants than his predecessor. In March, border authorities arrested 210,000 migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, the highest number recorded since February 2000 and a 24% increase from the same month one year before, Reuters reported. About half of the migrants encountered in March were expelled under the Title 42 order, the report said.



Republicans and even some moderate Democrats have called on President Biden to delay rescinding Title 42 and have introduced legislation to that effect in the U.S. Senate.

"Report: Biden campaign is in direct contact with Palestinian Authority, which financially supports terrorists","Former Vice President Joe Biden's Democratic presidential campaign is directly communicating with the Palestinian Authority, reports say.

Two anonymous sources who spoke with The Media Line claimed that a Palestinian-American businessman helped the Biden campaign establish contact with Palestinian leadership, which supports terrorists and their families with government funds.



""Having dialogue with the Democratic candidate is important to the leadership,"" one of the officials said, The Media Line reported. ""We want to let Mr. Biden know that we are willing and ready to talk.""

The Palestinian government has vigorously opposed President Donald Trump's pro-Israel policies, halting all contact with the administration since 2017 after the president recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there. Trump has ended millions of dollars of American aid to the Palestinians, shut down Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington D.C., and pursued deals with Arab states to normalize their relations with Israel over Palestinian objections.

According to The Media Line's sources, the Palestinians believe a Biden administration will be far more favorable to their interests.

""We are sure that if he wins, he will reassert the US position on the two-state solution and order the PLO office in Washington reopened,"" the other PA official said.

Jihad Harb, a political analyst for several Palestinian media outlets, said the Palestinians are watching the U.S. election closely.

""The Palestinians have reestablished relations with an important segment of the congressional leadership in the past few years,"" he told The Media line. ""The Democratic Party has a majority in the House of Representatives, and there are certainly channels of communication.""

""They [Palestinian leaders] definitely want Trump to leave,"" he explained. ""He imposed a set of cruel, unfair and anti-Palestinian measures, and therefore they prefer Biden, at least because of their experience with him during his years as vice president in the Obama administration.""

""The Palestinians usually prefer the Democrats, and the Palestinian leadership prefers that the president be from the Democratic Party,"" he added.

Recently, the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh publicly opposed Trump's re-election in a Facebook post decrying the current U.S. administration.

""If we are going to live another four years with President Trump, God help us… and the whole world,"" Shtayyeh said, according to the Times of Israel.

""Four years have been really wasted,"" Shtayyeh continued. ""We were waiting for the ultimate deal and everyone was hoping that the ultimate deal would really be a deal and be ultimate. Unfortunately it has not been.""

Shtayyeh expressed hope that Biden would oust Trump from office.

""If things are going to change in the United States I think this will reflect itself directly on the Palestinian-Israeli relationship,"" he said. ""And it will reflect itself also on the bilateral Palestinian-American relationship.""

The Palestinian government financially supports terrorism through the Palestinian Liberation Organization and has continued to do so despite fiscal constraints, the Washington Free Beacon reported Friday.

From the Free Beacon:

Known as a policy of ""pay to slay,"" the Palestinian government uses money from international donors and other aid groups to financially support imprisoned terrorists and their families. The practice has long attracted international scorn and played a significant role in the Trump administration's 2018 decision to cut nearly $200 million in U.S. funding to the Palestinian government. While the move was meant to pressure Palestinian leaders into ending the payments, the PLO has continued the practice under the radar, according to a recent report submitted by the State Department to Congress.



""Despite fiscal constraints … the [Palestinian Authority] continued to make payments through the PLO to Palestinians connected to terrorism,"" according to the report. ""This is despite Israel's decision to suspend extension of sovereignty into the West Bank. The recipients of the payments included Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prison, released Palestinian terrorists, and the families of Palestinians who were wounded or died while committing terrorist acts or in connection with terrorism.""



The continuation of these payments is likely to frustrate lawmakers and U.S. diplomats who have been working to make the Palestinian government solvent and more likely to engage in peace talks with Israel. While the State Department did not say how much the Palestinian government spends on terrorists, outside groups put the number at upwards of $300 million a year. The pay-to-slay program has been a major roadblock with Israel, which moved in February to fine any banks that facilitate these payments. Palestinian leaders, however, have vowed to continue supporting terrorists.

The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Blaze.

Report: Biden officials made requests to Israel that mirrored demands from Hamas terrorists,"When tensions flared between Israel and Palestine two weeks ago, the Biden administration reportedly made requests of Israel that mirrored demands from Hamas terrorists, who have controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007.

What is the background?

Growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over on May 10 when Hamas began firing missiles at Israel.

Prior to the military escalation, Hamas had demanded Israel remove their security forces from and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which sits on the Temple Mount, a site holy to Jews and Muslims.

Israeli security forces only entered the compound after increasing violence from Palestinian activists. ""Anger had been mounting for weeks among Palestinians ahead of a now-delayed Israeli court ruling on whether authorities were able to evict dozens of Palestinians from the Old City's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and give their homes to Jewish settlers,"" the Guardian reported.

What did the Biden admin tell Israel?

As tensions escalated at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, top Biden administration officials reportedly spoke with their Israeli counterparts and made three demands of Israel.

The demands included canceling evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and canceling the annual Jerusalem Day flag parade.

Axios reported:

[W]ith tensions escalating fast, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had called his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat, while Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke to the director general of the Israeli foreign ministry, Alon Ushpiz.



The Biden administration had three immediate demands of Israel: stop the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah, lower tensions on the Temple Mount and cancel the annual Jerusalem Day flag parade, during which Israeli nationalists celebrate the unification of Jerusalem under Israeli control.

Israel reportedly rejected U.S. requests, though, as Axios noted, it appeared that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to thwart further escalation.

""[Netanyahu] asked the Supreme Court to postpone its verdict on the evictions, banned visits by Jews to the Temple Mount and rerouted the flag parade so it wouldn't pass through the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City,"" Axios reported.

What were Hamas' demands?

A Hamas spokesperson told Newsweek their goal in attacking Israel was ""to have the Israeli occupation authorities accept our demands.""

Those demands included ""giving free access to worshipers from all parts of Palestine to pray at Al Aqsa Mosque without restriction or harassment by the Israeli police or the Israeli settlers and halting the attempts to expel the Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah,"" the Hamas spokesperson told the media outlet.

An Israeli official reportedly responded to the demands by explaining they were ""already and partially the policy of Israel,"" as indicated by Axios' report.

Report: National Guard briefed on improvised explosive device threat in DC,"United States National Guard troops deployed in Washington, D.C., have been told to prepare for the possibility that individuals plotting violence in the Capitol during and around President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration may use improvised explosive devices like those found during the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.

Two Guardsmen who were reportedly briefed on the matter told Politico that law enforcement officials believe the pipe bombs discovered at the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters were not isolated events. The individual(s) who planted those bombs have not yet been identified by authorities. The FBI has posted a $50,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of the perpetrators.

In anticipation of armed protests on Inauguration Day, National Guard troops have been authorized to bear arms in the Capitol. A ""significant majority"" of troops are carrying M-4 rifles and many are also armed with M-9 handguns, Politico reports.

""Our primary objective is to provide support to local authorities,"" said Guard spokesperson Tracy O'Grady Walsh. While deployed, the Guard will be tasked with crowd management, traffic control, parking coordination and medical and logistical support to local authorities.

""The public's safety is our top priority,"" she added.

Local and federal officials say as many as 20,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in the Capitol for security purposes. The District of Columbia has received commitments from the Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York National Guards to send reinforcements, WTTG-TV reports. Other states will send troops as well.

In the week since the Jan. 6 riots, the Guard has constructed a 7-foot tall non-scalable wall around the perimeter of the Capitol building. Armed troops are stationed in the halls of the Capitol building.

Democratic lawmakers say they have been briefed by law enforcement on three plans for demonstrations in the Capitol that could potentially turn violent. One of these plans involves a call to arms for thousands of armed ""patriots"" who want to attempt to surround the Capitol building and prevent Democratic lawmakers from entering, according to Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) who described the briefing to CNN.

On Wednesday, the Daily Beast reported that the Secret Service has issued an intelligence briefing warning of additional armed protests as well. The briefing, which was unclassified but not distributed outside of law enforcement, states that one demonstration is scheduled to take place before the inauguration and that the organizers were encouraging attendees to bring weapons.

"Chilling audio played just moments before Christmas explosion in Nashville, possible human remains found","Authorities in Nashville, Tennessee, revealed late Friday that possible human remains had been discovered near the site of the explosion that rocked Nashville early Christmas morning.



Nashville Metro Police Chief John Drake said authorities ""had found tissue they believe could be connected to human remains near the site of the explosion,"" CBS News reported. However, law enforcement did not know whether the tissue belonged to a human, let alone an innocent victim or someone connected to the crime.

Nashville police said that officers were responding to a shots fired call early on Christmas morning when an RV parked in the heart of downtown Nashville began playing an eerie message that warned a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes.



""...if you can hear this message, evacuate now,"" the message said.

Police were evacuating nearby residents after calling the bomb squad when the RV exploded around 6:30 a.m.

Three people were transported to the hospital for injuries sustained by the explosion. Fortunately, they were in stable condition by Christmas evening, Mayor John Cooper (D) said.

The RV was parked near an AT&T transmissions building, which meant the blast knocked out critical infrastructure like telephone and internet communications. Investigators are probing whether the RV was strategically placed near the AT&T equipment to interrupt telecommunication services.

More from the Associated Press:

AT&T said the affected building is the central office of a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it. The blast interrupted service, but the company declined to say how widespread outages were. The AT&T outages site showed service issues in middle Tennessee and Kentucky. Several police agencies reported that their 911 systems were down because of the outage, including Knox County, home to Knoxville about 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of Nashville.



AT&T said that it was bringing in portable cell sites and was working with law enforcement to get access to make repairs to its equipment. The company noted that ""power is essential to restoring"" service.

Reporters grill top WH official for allowing Taliban to harbor al Qaeda — then Peter Doocy ratchets up the pressure,"National Security Council coordinator John Kirby was peppered with questions Tuesday over how the Biden administration will respond to the Taliban violating the Doha Agreement.

What is the background?

The United States carried out a successful counterterrorism strike against the leader of al Qaeda over the weekend, killing Ayman al-Zawahiri.

American operators were successful partly because al-Zawahiri was ""hiding"" in plain sight in a wealthy Kabul neighborhood, thus underscoring the type of impunity the Taliban have extended to al Qaeda after the fall of Afghanistan last year.

The close relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda violates the Doha Agreement, a peace treaty negotiated under former President Donald Trump between the U.S. and the Taliban. Specifically, the agreement bars the Taliban from allowing al Qaeda to operate in Afghanistan, a provision the Taliban have clearly violated.

What happened with Kirby?

With the Taliban in clear violation of the Doha Agreement — a reality Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged — reporters from multiple media outlets grilled Kirby over how exactly the Biden administration will respond.

""What will the repercussions be for the Taliban harboring al-Zawahiri?"" ABC News chief White House correspondent Cecilia Vega asked.

""I’m not going to telegraph moves and decisions that we might make,"" Kirby responded. ""I’m certainly not going to get ahead of anything at this point.""

Kirby, however, disclosed that U.S. leaders have spoken with Taliban leaders for harboring al-Zawahiri, which he admitted is a clear violation of the Doha Agreement.

But when NBC News chief White House correspondent Peter Alexander pressed Kirby on whether the Biden administration would hold accountable the Taliban, Kirby obfuscated, saying only that he will not ""telegraph punches"" and the Taliban know the U.S. is aware they violated the Doha Agreement.

Kirby even suggested the Taliban might shape up because they want legitimization from Western powers.

Then Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy ratcheted up the pressure.

""You guys gave a whole country to a bunch of people that are on the FBI Most Wanted list. What did you think was going to happen?"" Doocy pressed.

Kirby responded by saying he takes ""issue with the premise that we gave a whole country to terrorist groups.""

""The Taliban was harboring the world’s number-one terrorist. How is that not giving a country to a terrorist-sympathizing group, if not giving them permission to have terrorists just sit on a balcony?"" Doocy pressed.

Engaging in circular reasoning, Kirby then told Doocy the strike against al-Zawahiri is proof the U.S. is not idly permitting the Taliban to harbor al Qaeda terrorists. And in the end, Kirby praised Biden.

""I would go so far as to say not only the American people are safer as a result of President Biden’s decision, but the rest of the world is safer,"" Kirby said.

Other reporters asked Kirby similar questions about the Taliban and their violations of the Doha Agreement, but he never offered substantive answers.

Kirby said violations of the agreement will ""lead to consequences not just from the United States, but from the international community"" — but he never said what any of those consequences would be.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporters-grill-john-kirby-taliban-harboring-al-qaeda,2022-08-03
Republicans and Democrats strike deal on '9/11-style' commission to investigate Jan. 6 attack on US Capitol,"House lawmakers have reached a deal to create a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 ""domestic terror attack on the United States Capitol"" and to recommend changes to protect the building in the future.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) announced the legislation to create the commission on Friday, which will be co-sponsored by committee ranking member Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.).

""There has been a growing consensus that the January 6th attack is of a complexity and national significance that what we need an independent commission to investigate. I am pleased that after many months of intensive discussion, Ranking Member Katko and I were able to reach a bipartisan agreement,"" Thompson said.

The commission will be responsible for studying the facts and circumstances that led to the events of Jan. 6, when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College results and declaring President Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 election. Rioters trespassed in the Capitol building and assaulted several Capitol Police officers during the day's events. One woman, Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was shot by Capitol Police and later died of her injuries.

The makeup of the Jan. 6 commission will be similar to the 9/11 commission, featuring 10 commissioners, five Republicans and five Democrats, who will be appointed by House and Senate leaders in both parties.

""Commissioners must have significant expertise in the areas of law enforcement, civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, intelligence, and cybersecurity. Current government officers or employees are prohibited from appointment,"" Thompson's announcement said.

The commission will have the authority to issue subpoenas in the course of its investigation with joint agreement between the chair and vice chair or a vote by a majority of commission members.

A final report on the commissions findings and recommendations to prevent a future attack on the Capitol will be due by Dec. 31, 2021.

""Inaction – or just moving on – is simply not an option. The creation of this commission is our way of taking responsibility for protecting the U.S. Capitol. After all, the Capitol is not just a historic landmark, it is where our constituents come to see their democracy in action,"" Thompson said. ""As such, we owe it to the Capitol Police and all who enter our citadel of democracy to investigate the attack. The timing of this action is particularly poignant with this being National Police Week, when we honor those who gave their lives to protect us.""

Katko praised the agreement in a statement.

""Unfortunately the Capitol remains a target for extremists of all ideologies, as we also witnessed during the April 2 attack that took a Capitol Police officer's life. That's why we must do everything we can to ensure nothing like this can ever happen again,"" Katko said. ""An independent, bipartisan commission will remove politicization of the conversation and focus solely on the facts and circumstances surrounding the security breach at the Capitol as well as other instances of violence relevant to such a review.""

However, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) expressed concerns with the legislation shortly after it was announced, telling reporters that he hadn't approved the agreement and wasn't aware the announcement would be made Friday morning.

""That's very concerning to me,"" McCarthy said after a reporter informed him the commission's scope would be limited to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

""""You've got to look at what the build-up before and what has gone on afterwards, otherwise the commission does not work,"" he added.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement it is ""imperative that we seek the truth of what happened on January 6 with an independent, bipartisan 9/11-type Commission to examine and report upon the facts, causes and security relating to the terrorist mob attack.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-and-democrats-strike-deal-on-9-11-style-commission-to-investigate-jan-6,2021-05-14
"Republicans declare war on Facebook, Twitter censorship of New York Post, announce Senate hearings","After Facebook and Twitter sparked outrage by censoring several New York Post reports on emails allegedly from Hunter Biden's laptop, Republican lawmakers want Big Tech CEOs to testify in Congress and explain why the Post's stories are being suppressed.



Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) formally requested on Thursday that the CEOs of Twitter and Facebook both appear before the U.S. Senate to testify on their companies' individual decisions to censor the Post's reports. The letters, written to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, invite the Big Tech bosses to testify before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism in a hearing called ""Digital Platforms and Election Interference.""

Hawley's letters announce an inquiry into whether Facebook and Twitter violated federal election law by suppressing the distribution of the New York Post story, ""Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad.""



""As your company is no doubt aware, corporations are forbidden from contributing anything of value — financial or otherwise — to support the election of candidates for federal office,"" each letter states.



The letter to Dorsey noted that Twitter ""asymmetrically"" applied its terms of service against the Post story and suspended the official Donald Trump presidential campaign account for sharing the article. The hearing ""will also consider [Twitter's] decision to double down on that potential violation by, on October 15, 2020, suppressing the Post's follow-up story.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and committee member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also announced Thursday that the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Tuesday to serve Dorsey a subpoena to testify the following Friday. Cruz characterized Twitter's actions as ""election interference.""



""The Senate Judiciary Committee wants to know what the hell is going on,"" Cruz said, noting that the Nov. 3 election is 19 days away.



In the House, Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sent a letter to Facebook CEO Zuckerberg saying the actions taken by Facebook ""raises questions about Facebook's commitment to free speech and free and fair elections.""

Additionally, all House Committee on Oversight and Reform Republicans called on the committee's chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) to hold an emergency hearing before the Nov. 3 election on ""Big Tech's censorship and election interference.""

""Facebook and Twitter's censorship of American journalism is part of a broader pattern by Big Tech to selectively suppress news and silence conservative views that don't square with their liberal agenda. This is not the American way and cannot be tolerated,"" Oversight and Reform Committee ranking member James Comer (R-Ky.) said. ""Big Tech's censorship is election interference and we call on Chairwoman Maloney to hold an emergency hearing immediately in order to hold them accountable and protect the integrity of the election.""

On Wednesday, the New York Post published a story about a ""smoking gun"" 2015 email that appears to show Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, thanking Hunter Biden for setting up a meeting with his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic nominee for president. The email, if accurate, is significant because the elder Biden has repeatedly claimed he's never had discussions with his son about Hunter's ""overseas business dealings,"" a claim that this email directly contradicts.

Biden's critics and the Post's reports accuse the former vice president of having used his office as leverage to pressure the Ukrainian government to adopt policies that were favorable to Burisma while Hunter Biden served on the company's board, benefiting the younger Biden.

After the Post's initial report on the email was published, Facebook limited the distribution of the story pending a third-party fact check review, preventing users from seeing it in their news feeds. Twitter followed suit and went even further, banning the story from being shared by users and locking the accounts of prominent users who shared it, including the Trump campaign, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and the New York Post itself. On Thursday, Twitter even restricted access to an official government website after House Judiciary Committee Republicans re-posted the Post story and shared it on Twitter.

In response to the backlash Twitter received, Twitter CEO Dorsey admitted the ""communication around our actions on the @nypost article was not great."" He also said blocking the Post article's URL with ""zero context"" was ""unacceptable.""

Sen. Hawley found Dorsey's mea culpa unacceptable.

Speaking on Fox News Wednesday evening, Hawley accused Facebook and Twitter of wanting to ""rig an election.""

""It's basically at this point, Laura, Big Tech versus democracy,"" Hawley told host Laura Ingraham. ""These tech companies want to rig an election, they want to control what we read. They want to control journalists in this country. They want to control the news. And we just can't let them.



""That's why I will be inviting and asking Facebook and Twitter to come testify under oath to my subcommittee in the United States Senate,"" he added. ""The American people deserve answers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-war-facebook-twitter-censorship,2020-10-15
Riot declared in Portland after mayor cracked down on violence,"The mayor of Portland extended a state of emergency for the city through this weekend in an attempt to curtail potential violence and defacement of property. The state of emergency, which gives Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) power to declare a curfew and close public facilities, was first declared on Tuesday, the day of the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial.

""Tonight, the anarchists have called for more destruction,"" Wheeler said at a news conference on Friday afternoon. ""I've directed the police bureau to arrest and engage illegal activity whenever they can safely do so.""

Wheeler also threatened anyone committing destruction in Oregon's biggest city, and declared, ""Let's make it hurt them a little bit."" In his strongest words since the regular George Floyd protests and riots began nearly a year ago, Wheeler finally said he would crack down on Antifa and black bloc extremists who have terrorized the city.

""Our job is to unmask them, arrest them, and prosecute them,"" Wheeler said during the press conference. ""I want to personally thank neighbors, family, friends and others who have come forward with vital evidence. People know who these criminals are. They know what they're up to.""

""If you have any information, please contact the police,"" Wheeler said, as reported by the Post Millennial. ""I also want you to know that these people often arrive at their so-called direct actions, in cars. And they're all dressed in all black. If you see this, call the police. If you can provide a license plate, if you can do so safely, that information can help later. Together we can make a stand. We're doing what we can today. I'm also asking for your help to make a stand and take our city back.""

""There are ways that our other community partners and institutions can be helpful in making it crystal clear that the city of Portland will not tolerate criminal destruction or violence,"" Wheeler stated. ""Those who are engaged in it, let's make it hurt them a little bit.""

Wheeler has been a pushover for the far-left rabble-rousers in Portland, who have staged a sit-in protest inside the lobby of his condo, verbally abused him at a pub, punched the mayor while he was eating dinner at a restaurant, and threw objects at him when he showed up at a protest.

Despite the tough talk, yet another riot was declared in Portland on Friday night.



The Portland Police Bureau noted that ""about 75 people mostly dressed in all black, or 'bloc' attire designed to make it difficult for police to identify lawbreakers."" Within the first 15 minutes of the planned ""autonomous demonstration"" there were ""reports of broken windows and graffiti"" at businesses, including a Moroccan restaurant reportedly owned by an immigrant. A TriMet bus shelter was tagged with the anarchist symbol.

""Some members of the group briefly forced their way into a tavern/restaurant in the 2200 block of Northwest Hoyt Street, then other participants followed them in and pulled them out,"" the Portland Police said. ""A resident who was taking video of the march had a rock thrown through his window.""

Two people were arrested.









Last weekend, several stores in Portland were set on fire and vandalized, including large national retailers that donated millions of dollars to social justice campaigns, as well as a church that feeds the homeless.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/riots-portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-antifa,2021-04-24
Vandals destroy US flags of CA memorial honoring 13 service members killed in Afghanistan,"Police said that they were looking for individuals who destroyed flags that were set up in a memorial honoring the 13 service members killed in a terrorist bombing in Afghanistan.

The Riverside Police Department in southern California published photographs of the vandalized flags on their Facebook page.

Police said that they were informed about the vandalism to the memorial by members of a Facebook news group.

The photographs show the vandalized flags that were hung to honor eleven Marines, one Navy sailor, and one Army soldier, who were killed in a gruesome terrorist suicide attack while guarding the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. An affiliate of the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack that killed dozens of Afghans and injured many more.

Three of the Marines killed were from southern California.

To honor those who died, Riverside residents hung 13 U.S. flags and one Marine Corps flag on the overpass on the 91 Freeway.

Police said that they had no description of any suspect but that it was obvious the vandalism was intentional.

One photograph showed a police officer removing the damaged flags.

Police said the vandalized flags would be retired properly with the help of a local Boy Scout Troop.

The police Facebook post had more than 560 comments and 650 shares on Facebook after only being published for 6 hours.

Members of the community were already replacing the flags just a few hours later.

The police asked for help from the public in identifying who was responsible for the vandalism.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the lethal terror attack was the worst day of the Biden presidency.

"RNC accuses presidential debate commission of bias, withdraws from process","Any Republican who wants to run for president will be required to sign a pledge that they will only appear in party-sanctioned primary and general election debates after the Republican National Committee voted unanimously Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Republicans have for years complained that the nonprofit and self-described nonpartisan debate commission has been biased towards Democrats. Now the RNC has followed through on threats to pull Republican candidates out of the debate process. At a meeting in Tennessee, party leadership passed a resolution that reads in part: ""Any presidential primary candidate who does not agree in writing, or who participates in any debate that is not a sanctioned debate, shall not be eligible to participate in any further sanctioned debates.”

The Wall Street Journal reports that the RNC will form a working group to sanction debates based on input from presidential campaigns on the timing, frequency, format, media outlet, candidate qualifications, and whatever is in the ""best interest of the Republican Party,"" among other considerations.

“Debates are an important part of the democratic process, and the RNC is committed to free and fair debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates is biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms to help ensure fair debates including hosting debates before voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for candidates on the debate stage,"" RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.

""Today, the RNC voted to withdraw from the biased CPD, and we are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,” she added.



The RNC's decision to withdraw comes after former President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign made several complaints about the debate process and the moderators selected by the CPD in the last election.

During the first debate between Trump and Joe Biden, for instance, moderator Chris Wallace singled out Trump with a question asking him to condemn ""white supremacists and right-wing militia,"" even though Trump had already done so publicly. The former Fox News host did not ask Biden about Antifa and did not push back when Biden later claimed during the debate that the radical anarchist group ""is an idea, not an organization.""

The Trump campaign also lodged complaints about the CPD's decision to switch the second debate to a virtual format because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and about the planned moderator, then-CSPAN anchor Steve Scully, because he had once interned in Biden's senate office as a college student. The second debate was ultimately canceled because an agreement on the format could not be reached.

Before the third 2020 debate, Trump's team loudly objected to the exclusion of foreign policy as a topic, alleging that the topics selected by moderator Kristen Welker were picked so that Trump could not attack Biden over his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in foreign countries.

But Republican and conservative complaints about presidential debates moderated by liberal-leaning journalists existed well before Trump. The second debate between then-candidate Mitt Romney and former President Barack Obama in 2012 became controversial after CNN moderator Candy Crowley came to Obama's defense after Romney claimed he had hesitated to call the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi an act of terror. At one point, it appeared as if Romney was debating Crowley and Obama at the same time. The late conservative talk radio legend Rush Limbaugh called the episode ""an act of journalistic terror.""

The RNC's statement made several accusations of bias against the CPD, which was formed in 1987 and sponsors general election debates between the major candidates for president and vice president every four years.

Republicans charged that the CPD showed bias by:

Waiting until 26 states had begun early voting before hosting the first presidential debate in 2020.

Making unilateral changes to previously agreed-upon debate formats and conditions, in some cases without even notifying the candidates.

Selecting a moderator in 2020 who had once worked for Joe Biden.

Failing to maintain the organization’s strict nonpartisanship, with a majority of its Board Members publicly disparaging the Republican-nominee.

In response to the RNC's announcement, Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison accused Republicans gross moral corruption.

""Typical CYA… you didn’t pass a party platform… your leader praises Putin… your members hang out at cocaine orgies… actively trying to destroy Medicare, ACA & Social Security… rampant voter suppression ... can fully understand why you don’t want a debate,"" Harrison tweeted.

The RNC's statement emphasized, ""we are not walking away from debates. We are walking away from the CPD.""

"DeSantis slams Hamas, terrorist group to blame for Israel conflict","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis weighed in on the current Middle East conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The Republican governor blasted Hamas, placing blame on the group for the recent bloodshed in the tumultuous region, and emphasized that Israelis have the ""right to defend themselves.""

""I also wanted to just make a comment about what's happening in the Middle East,"" DeSantis said during a Wednesday press conference. ""I have friends over there who have been having to hide out in bomb shelters overnight, because of Hamas, which is a terrorist group, raining down rockets on civilians.""

""And make no mistake, Hamas is a terrorist group,"" DeSantis proclaimed. ""They are at fault on this. Israel has every right to defend itself against Hamas. And I think if you look at what's going on here, it really isn't so much about Israel, it's about Hamas trying to stake a claim to be the leader of the entire Palestinian Authority.""

""They kind of have their little place down in Gaza where they foment a lot of terrorism,"" DeSantis explained. ""They've had a lot of problems going on with the Palestinian Authority. I think this is Hamas' attempt to capitalize on that. But our ally Israel has a right to defend themselves and what's going on by Hamas is an absolute disgrace.""

Ron DeSantis' commentary on world conflicts could hint at presidential run



The Florida governor delivered his remarks about the violent situation on the other side of the world as speculation grows that DeSantis could be eyeing up a run for president in 2024. A new poll from the Trafalgar Group found that DeSantis is far and away the most popular Republican presidential candidate if Donald Trump decides not to run in 2024. The nationwide survey, conducted between April 30 and May 6, discovered that DeSantis currently gets almost 35% support from likely GOP voters in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, which is nearly the same amount as the next three potential candidates combined – Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, and Mike Pence.

An Echelon Insights poll from April declared DeSantis to be the early leader with 20% of the vote if Trump doesn't run for president. A Just the News survey from late February stated that DeSantis was the leading Republican 2024 candidate if former President Donald Trump sits out 2024, with 21% of the vote. During the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Republicans overwhelmingly supported DeSantis in the 2024 election, with 43% supporting his presidential run if Trump bows out.

Latest update on the Israel-Gaza conflict

More than 1,500 rockets have been launched from Gaza toward Israel since Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. There are a reported 83 deaths in Gaza and seven in Israel, according to the BBC. Four senior Hamas commanders and a dozen more Hamas operatives were killed by Israeli airstrikes, the Guardian reported.

Violence erupted in the streets of Israel late Wednesday as Arab and Jewish mobs attacked each other. Following the night of ""anarchy,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""nothing justifies"" the street violence and vowed to restore order ""with an iron fist if necessary.""

""It doesn't matter to me that your blood is boiling,"" Netanyahu said. ""You can't take the law in your hands.""

Israel has prepared combat troops along the Gaza border and is in ""various stages of preparing ground operations,"" a military spokesman said on Thursday.

""The chief of staff is inspecting those preparations and providing guidance,"" said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, international spokesperson of the IDF.

Hamas armed wing spokesman Abu Ubaida responded to Israel's troop buildup with a threat.

"Commanders' Ron Rivera fines coach Jack Del Rio $100,000 for 'extremely hurtful' comments about Jan. 6 rioting and BLM protests","The head coach of the Washington Commanders professional football team fined the team's defensive coach over what he called ""extremely hurtful"" comments comparing the rioting on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol and violent protests by Black Lives Matter.

Coach Ron Rivera posted his statement about defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio on the team's official Twitter account on Friday.

""This morning, I met with Coach Del Rio to express how disappointed I am in his comments on Wednesday. His comments do not reflect the organization’s views and are extremely hurtful to our great community here in the DMV,"" said Rivera in the statement, referring to the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia.



""As we saw last night in the hearings, what happened on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an act of domestic terrorism. A group of citizens attempted to overturn the results of a free and fair election, and as a result, lives were lost and the Capitol building was damaged,"" he explained.



""Coach Del Rio did apologize for his comments on Wednesday, and he understands the distinction between the events of that dark day and peaceful protests, which are a hallmark of our democracy,"" he added.

He want on to say that although Del Rio has the constitutional right to free speech, his words ""hurt a lot of people"" in the community and said the team would not ""tolerate"" anyone equating the Jan. 6 rioting to that of BLM.

""After reflecting on the situation and circumstances,"" I have decided to fine Coach Del Rio $100,000, which the team will donate to the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund. I feel strongly that after our conversation this morning, he will have a greater understanding for the impact of his language and the values that our team stands for.""

Del Rio had clarified comments he made on Twitter during a briefing with the media and then later apologized for his comments.

""I made comments earlier in referencing the attack that took place on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. Referencing that situation as a dust-up was irresponsible and negligent and I am sorry,"" wrote Del Rio in part.

Judges on 'The Masked Singer' walked off the show in protest when a contestant was revealed to be Rudy Giuliani,"Two of the judges on ""The Masked Singer"" reportedly walked off the show in protest after one of the contestants revealed himself to be Rudy Giuliani.

The incident was first reported by Deadline on Wednesday.

According to the report both Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong left the stage quickly after Giuliani revealed himself.

While he was previously praised as the former mayor of New York City during the 9/11 terror attacks, Giuliani has been excoriated by many on the left for working as an attorney for former President Donald Trump and arguing that the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats.

The popular primetime show on the Fox network features celebrity judges trying to guess the identity of other celebs disguised in colorful costumes by their singing talents. The show is in its seventh season.

The report said that after Thicke and Jeong left the stage, the other judges, Jenny McCarthy and Nicole Scherzinger, chatted with Giuliani. The other judges eventually came back.

The show has faced public outrage before when its host Nick Cannon had to apologize for anti-Semitic comments he made while speaking on his podcast in 2020. He later complained that many in his community called him a ""sell out"" for apologizing.

Giuliani was subpoenaed last month by the congressional committee investigating the rioting on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol, along with three other attorneys connected to Trump. Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said at the time that they were being probed over their role in the protest against the official results of the election.

“The four individuals we’ve subpoenaed today advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former President about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes,"" said Thompson.

"Top Russian diplomat brags about new Iran nuclear deal and suggests US taken to cleaners by China, Russia, and Iran","Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov celebrated the forthcoming new Iran nuclear deal in a recent interview, essentially saying the United States was taken to the cleaners by Iran, China, and Russia.

What is the background?

The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was originally negotiated under the Obama administration. But then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the controversial deal in May 2018.

President Joe Biden, during his campaignand after his election, expressed willingness to re-enter the JCPOA and lift sanctions on Iran that were imposed by the Trump administration.

Diplomats officially returned to negotiation last year in hopes of reviving the plan.

What did Ulyanov say?

Ulyanov, the top Russian diplomat working on JCPOA negotiations, boasted in a recent interview that Iran received more in the forthcoming deal than even he expected.

""Iranian clerics are fighting for Iranian nuclear national interests like lions,"" Ulyanov said. ""Indeed, I’m very serious. They fight for every comma, every word, and, as a rule, quite successfully. I must recognize that.""



""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" he added. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ulyanov said that Beijing and Moscow worked together to achieve their goals within the JCPOA.

""Our Chinese friends were also very efficient and useful as co-negotiators,"" Ulyanov said. ""We could rely on each other on many, many points. And on many, many points of joint differences we succeeded. I can recollect dozens of such cases, when on rather serious, significant questions, we managed together to get positive results close to what we wanted to achieve.""

The totality of concessions made by the U.S. and western allied powers will not become clear until the deal is finalized.

However, the Jerusalem Post reported:

Among the concessions to Iran that Israel has been concerned about are allowing Iran to keep its advanced centrifuges even when they are out of use, and lifting the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization by the US, as well as rescinding all sanctions placed by the previous US administration, including those put in place due to terrorism and human rights violations.

Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, corroborated on Monday that a finalized deal is nearing completion as long as the Biden administration makes the concessions that Tehran demands, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What is the US saying?

State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter said last week that ""significant progress"" had been made and a final deal is imminent.

""We are close to a possible deal, but a number of difficult issues still remain unsolved,"" she said. ""We will not have a deal unless we resolve quickly the remaining issues. If Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding of mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days.""

In a nod to Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken admitted Sunday that sanctions imposed by Washington on Moscow because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will be totally disconnected from the Iran nuclear deal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-diplomat-brags-iran-nuclear-deal-us-taken-to-cleaners-by-china-russia-iran,2022-03-07
Salon writer insults conservatives as ‘good Germans’ standing by amid Trump's reign of fascist terror,"Chauncey DeVega, a political columnist for the liberal outlet, Salon, recently blasted modern-day conservatives for ""enabling and defending"" former President Donald Trump's ""crimes"" in a scathing op-ed, comparing them to ""good Germans"" during Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party rule.

""Good Germans"" is an ironic term often used to describe German citizens during World War II who claimed not to support the Nazi regime but who, in practice, did little or nothing to combat its terrible reign.

And so, to DeVega, because Trump is ""a force of political, human, moral and economic destruction"" and the leader of a national ""neofascist and white supremacist movement"" — much like Hitler was — those who stand idly by while he commits his crimes are merely ""an extension of his political cult and crime family.""

DeVega's column, seething in vitriol toward conservatives, shows just how terrified the left is of Trump, fretting over his influence even now after he has been voted out of office. After all, in a recent survey, Democratic voters listed ""Trump supporters"" as the No. 1 issue causing them concern.

""Although Trump was defeated by Joe Biden at the polls,"" warned DeVega, he enjoys historic levels of support and ""is now positioning himself as a shadow president."" Though he never exactly clarified what he meant by the conspiracy-laden term.

But in an effort to prove his point, DeVega lamented the fact that even after Trump incited political violence at the Capitol — which he characterized as ""part of a larger plot to overthrow American democracy"" — public opinion polls show the Republican Party remains loyal to him.

He also recalled that a recent Gallup survey found that a majority of Republicans desire that the party move further right, rather than closer to the center. In the poll, 40% of Republicans said they wanted the party to become ""more conservative,"" while 34% want it to ""stay the same"" and only 24% wanted it to become ""more moderate.""

But this is where DeVega's argument completely breaks down. Today's conservatives are not, as he says, ""hid[ing] behind fictions of plausible deniability for the evils committed by their leader."" Rather, they are celebrating his achievements and openly supporting his platform.

Nevertheless, DeVega argues that conservatives, ""like the 'good Germans' of the Nazi era ... are calling themselves 'conservatives' [in] an effort to shield themselves from responsibility and complicity.""

""Whatever 'conservative' once meant in American politics, it's now just a flimsy rhetorical shield for fascism,"" he added, showing he has no understanding of the American conservative movement whatsoever.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/salon-writer-conservatives-good-germans,2021-02-26
"Salvation Army responds to critics of woke messaging, backpedals by withdrawing anti-racism guide for 'appropriate review'","The Salvation Army published a lengthy response late last week after numerous reports indicated the Christian charity organization had embraced woke corporate messaging.

What is the background?



The controversy surrounds two internal Salvation Army documents, a guidebook titled ""Let's Talk About Racism"" and another called the ""Study Guide on Racism.""

The National Review reported:

In a guidebook titled ""Let's Talk About Racism,"" the organization calls Christians to reflect on and rectify their contributions to the social inequities and prejudicial systems that have harmed minorities. Citing its ""International Position Statement on Racism,"" the organization writes that it ""acknowledges with regret, that Salvationists have sometimes shared in the sins of racism and conformed to economic, organisational and social pressures that perpetuate racism.""



An accompanying document created by the Salvation Army's International Social Justice Commission, called the ""Study Guide on Racism,"" claims that white people are responsible for ""unconscious bias,"" an idea promulgated by critical-race-theory advocate Ibram X. Kendi. Kendi argues that white people's legacy of racism is irredeemable, and that the only remedy is reverse discrimination as a matter of retributive justice to level the societal playing field.



In the ""Let's Talk About Racism"" document, the Salvation Army implores white donors to ""lament, repent and apologize for biases or racist ideologies held and actions committed,"" and urges them to adopt ""a posture of ... anti-racism,"" another moniker made famous by Kendi.

""In the absence of making anti-racist choices, we (un) consciously uphold aspects of White supremacy, White-dominant culture, and unequal institutions and society,"" the document states.

Meanwhile, the ""Study Guide on Racism"" states that white people are guilty ""unconscious bias"" and ""unwittingly perpetuate racial division,"" and declares that, ""We must stop denying the existence of individual and systemic/institutional racism. They exist, and are still at work to keep White Americans in power.""

TheBlaze further reported:

In the guide, the Salvation Army makes use of a litany of woke terms to articulate their message, including ""anti-racist,"" ""colonizer,"" ""domestic terrorism,"" ""fascism,"" ""institutional racism,"" ""microaggressions,"" ""systemic racism,"" and ""whiteness.""

As TheBlaze noted, the woke messaging forced some Christians to stop donating to the organization.

What did the Salvation Army say?

The Salvation Army released a statement flatly denying accusations the Christian organization is now peddling ideals of critical race theory and other woke messaging.

""[S]ome individuals and groups have recently attempted to mislabel our organization to serve their own agendas. They have claimed that we believe our donors should apologize for their skin color, that The Salvation Army believes America is an inherently racist society, and that we have abandoned our Christian faith for one ideology or another,"" the statement explained.

""Those claims are simply false, and they distort the very goal of our work,"" the statement added.

Responding to the core of the criticism — the ""Let's Talk About Racism"" study guide — the Salvation Army claimed it was issued to members as a ""voluntary resource.""

But despite claiming critics of the study guide ""have chosen to ignore"" attempts by the Salvation Army to provide ""accurate information"" about the guide, the statement said the Salvation Army has ""now withdrawn the guide for appropriate review.""

The statement, however, did not specify which specific parts of the study guide require clarification, nor did the statement address the ""Study Guide on Racism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/salvation-army-responds-woke-messaging,2021-11-28
"Salvation Army goes woke with​ new anti-racist message, asks white donors to apologize for their 'unconscious bias'","The Salvation Army — a massively popular Christian charity known for raising money through red collection boxes around the holidays — is now pushing ""anti-racist"" and critical race theory ideology onto donors.

What are the details?

This year, in addition to requesting monetary contribution towards the global mission, the organization is calling on donors to reckon with their deep-seated attitudes of racism, the National Review reports.

In a guidebook titled, ""Let's Talk About Racism,"" the charity asks donors to consider the ways in which they have ""consciously or unconsciously"" supported prejudicial systems that inflict harm on racial minorities, adding that it ""acknowledges with regret, that Salvationists have sometimes shared in the sins of racism and conformed to economic, organizational and social pressures that perpetuate racism.""

Elsewhere in the document, the charity calls on white donors to ""lament, repent and apologize for biases or racist ideologies held and actions committed.""

Going forward, the Salvation Army says it hopes white donors will recognize their own contributions to racism and adopt ""a posture of ... anti-racism,"" an ideological practice made popular by progressive author Ibram X. Kendi.

""In the absence of making anti-racist choices, we (un) consciously uphold aspects of White supremacy, White-dominant culture, and unequal institutions and society,"" the document states.

What else?

The charity reiterates its viewpoints in another document created by the Salvation Army's International Social Justice Commission, called the ""Study Guide on Racism.""

In that document, the Salvation Army plainly claims that racism is obvious and evident in nearly all facets of western society, and argues, ""We must stop denying the existence of individual and systemic/institutional racism. They exist, and are still at work to keep White Americans in power.""

White people are in fact guilty of ""unconscious bias"" and ""unwittingly perpetuate racial division"" even when they don't demonstrate overtly racist behavior.

""For instance, devout Christians who naively use racial epithets or a well-intentioned Sunday School curriculum that only uses white photography and imagery,"" the organization writes.

In the guide, the Salvation Army makes use of a litany of woke terms to articulate their message, including ""anti-racist,"" ""colonizer,"" ""domestic terrorism,"" ""fascism,"" ""institutional racism,"" ""microaggressions,"" ""systemic racism,"" and ""whiteness.""

Anything else?

The organization's support for progressive ""anti-racist"" teaching has drawn the ire from some of its conservative donors, according to Newsweek.

One of those former donors is Christian apologist and radio talk show host Greg Koukl, who reportedly called out the charity's progressive drift in a Facebook post earlier this month.

""In my estimation, CRT is a Trojan horse taking in well-intentioned Christian enterprises that — because they care about justice and oppose oppression — naively promote the most serious threat to biblical Christianity I have seen in 50 years,"" the Stand to Reason founder stated in the post.

The Daily Signal, too, slammed the organization last month for imposing ""radical wokeness"" among Christians.

In response to questions from Newsweek, however, a spokesperson for the Salvation Army denied that its position on addressing racism has changed.

""Our beliefs have always been rooted in scripture, and they still are. That includes our complete rejection of racism, which is in stark contrast to the biblical principle that we're all created in the image of God. We believe that, as God loves us all, so we should all love one another,"" the spokesperson said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/salvation-army-woke-anti-racist-message,2021-11-26
Saudi Arabia carries out largest mass execution in its history as rights groups issue condemnation,"Saudi Arabia on Saturday carried out the largest mass execution in its history, ending the lives of 81 people in one day for crimes ranging from murder to membership in militant groups, the Associated Press reported.

The massive figure surpassed the previous high of 63 carried out in January 1980 when the kingdom executed militants convicted of seizing the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

It was not immediately clear why the kingdom, which has in recent years has vowed to overhaul its archaic justice system, put the individuals to death in such a fashion.

In a statement published by the official Saudi Press Agency, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said the executed individuals ""were convicted of various crimes including murdering innocent men, women, and children."" It did not say how the individuals were executed.

""Crimes committed by these individuals also include pledging allegiance to foreign terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Houthis, targeting residents in the Kingdom and traveling to regional conflict zones to join terrorist organizations,"" the statement continued. ""They also include convictions for targeting government personnel and vital economic sites, the killing of law enforcement officers and maiming their bodies, and planting land mines to target police vehicles. Moreover, the convictions include crimes of kidnapping, torture, rape, smuggling arms and bombs into the Kingdom.""

The ministry said the executed individuals were arrested and tried in courts through trials overseen by judges and were afforded the full rights guaranteed under Saudi law.

But ultimately, the courts found the accused guilty of ""committing multiple heinous crimes that left a large number of civilians and law enforcement officers dead,"" according to the ministry.

The New York Times reported that those put to death were predominantly Saudi but included seven Yemenis and one Syrian.

The paper added that rights groups around the world quickly condemned the executions, arguing they were contrary to progressive claims made in recent years by the kingdom's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

""These executions are the opposite of justice,"" Ali Adubusi, the director of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, a watchdog group, reportedly said. He added that in many of the cases, the charges involved ""not a drop of blood.""

Adubusi’s rights group went on to tell the Times that many of the charges filed did not merit the death penalty under criteria the Saudi Arabian government has put forward, noting that some were related to participation in human rights demonstrations.

Other rights groups reportedly claimed that the executions included people from Saudi Arabia’s Shiite Muslim minority, a frequent target of the government.

""The world should know by now that when Mohammed bin Salman promises reform, bloodshed is bound to follow,"" said Soraya Bauwens, the deputy director of Reprieve, a London-based advocacy group, the AP noted.

In its statement, the ministry declared, ""The Kingdom will continue to take a strict and unwavering stance against terrorism and extremist ideologies that threaten the stability of the entire world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/saudi-arabia-carries-out-mass-execution,2022-03-14
Leftist Chuck Schumer uses resurrection imagery on Easter Sunday to laud Ketanji Brown Jackson's SCOTUS confirmation: 'The stone has been rolled away',"Far-left U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) used resurrection imagery during an Easter Sunday church service to laud Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.

""The stone has been rolled away from the tomb,"" Schumer, who is Jewish, said from the pulpit at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn after spending several minutes praising Jackson, who will be the first black woman to sit on the high court.

What are the details?

Schumer began his sermon of sorts by addressing his ""brothers and sisters"" and saying ""the last time we got together in person for Easter, it was 2019, I was still minority leader, Donald Trump was terrorizing New York and our nation with his hatred, his bigotry and lies, and little did we know what the future held in store for us. ... To sum it up, it's been a dark few years.""

He continued, curiously, by saying, ""But on this day, more than any other day, we remember God's promise to his people ... that was once thought lost will be redeemed and renewed and more glorious than ever before. That even in the darkest times, there are bright lights, and this month, folks, we witnessed one of the brightest that we hope is a metaphor, an indication, a good omen of more bright lights to come — the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson!""

Schumer then spent several minutes praising Jackson, noting that her confirmation is ""restoring balance to our judicial system that was thrown out of whack by Donald Trump and his vicious, nasty, and sometimes even outright racist [appointments] to the bench."" Schumer then praised himself by saying he ""made history by appointing for the time ever our three black U.S. attorneys in New York.""

Schumer finished up by saying, ""My brothers and sisters, in conclusion, this is what the changing of the seasons looks like. It looks like progress, it looks like growth, it looks like our everlasting struggle to perfect what was once imperfect. Lord knows it took too long to get here, but now that we're here, there's no going back. The stone has been rolled away from the tomb, and all those good things that we hoped and prayed for will come to pass. So happy Easter. God bless all of you.""

Here's the clip, which starts as Schumer heads to the pulpit. He begins speaking about Jackson at the 3:45 mark and then uses resurrection imagery just after the 7-minute mark:

Chuck Schumer Lauds KBJ Vote From A.R. Bernard's Pulpit On Easter: ""The Stone Has Been Rolled Away"" youtu.be

How did folks react?

Those commenting on the video were astonished by Schumer's sermon:

""Words fail,"" one commenter wrote. ""This is utter blasphemy.""

""How can true believers put up with this idolatry[?]"" another commenter wondered.

""I am speechless,"" another commenter said.

""This pulpit is literally shrouded in darkness,"" another commenter declared.

Earlier in the video, the church's pastor, A.R. Bernard, remarked that Schumer has come to the Christian Cultural Center ""every Easter to share a greeting with you."" That led another commenter to say, ""No need to be united in Christ if you are united in politics I guess.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/schumer-resurrection-imagery-easter-sunday-laud-ketanji-brown-jackson-scotus-confirmation,2022-04-20
Screaming Democrats rush stage at Dave Rubin event with Ron DeSantis,"A Democratic candidate for Congress interrupted a live event with BlazeTV host Dave Rubin of ""The Rubin Report"" and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in Orlando, Florida, Thursday evening, demanding action on gun violence.

Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a March for Our Lives organizer who is running for the Democratic nomination in Florida's 10th Congressional District, stood up and shouted at DeSantis as he was speaking on stage at The Plaza Live, yelling that ""Floridians are dying!""

The governor was in the middle of an interview with Rubin, who hosted the event as part of his book tour for ""Don't Burn This Country,"" a book criticizing ""woke"" left-wing politics and calling for ""Americans to live the freest life possible.""

""Governor DeSantis, we're losing 100 people a day due to gun violence,"" Frost said. ""We need action on gun violence!""

A video the candidate shared to Twitter shows security personnel escorting him away from the stage and out of the room.



""Hey buddy, nobody wants to hear from you,"" DeSantis said as Frost exited while the audience booed at the interruption.

""I just asked @GovRonDeSantis to take action on gun violence so we can save lives. That we lose 100 people a day,"" Frost tweeted Thursday. ""His response? 'Nobody wants to hear from you!' We are dying and our Governor is too busy helping @RubinReport make money.""

Rubin responded on Twitter, observing that Frost ""didn't ask the governor anything.""

""He/him/his bum rushed the stage at a sold out event and started yelling. The entire night was about freedom and liberty. Find something better to protest, perhaps. But either way, thanks for buying tickets!"" Rubin said.



Other Democratic activists who had planned protests of the event interrupted DeSantis and Rubin to make demands for gun control, Business Insider reports.



A producer for Rubin's BlazeTV show said there were more than six interruptions throughout the night. Videos posted to social media show activists screaming at the governor, demanding ""why don't you care about my life?""

Anti-gun activists have made a fevered pitch for gun control after two recent mass shootings at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

DeSantis, who is running for re-election, is not the only GOP official to be heckled by left-wing candidates on the gun issue. Last week in Texas, Democrat Beto O'Rourke disrupted a press briefing on the Uvalde shooting held by Gov. Gregg Abbott (R), demanding new gun control laws.

Earlier Thursday, Rubin had welcomed peaceful protests of his event, provided they did not ""interfere"" with the proceedings. After it was all said and done, he brushed off the dirsuptions.

“They came. The screamed about a bunch of stuff that had nothing to do with the event and they were escorted out,"" Rubin told TheBlaze. ""Frankly, I think they just need better hobbies, and should look into moving to Seattle or San Francisco.“

"Calls for Sears, Kmart boycott explode after ‘Ashli Babbitt American Patriot’ shirt goes up for sale","Social media users called for boycotts against Sears and Kmart over the last several days after a shirt depicting slain U.S. Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt as an ""American Patriot"" was found to be for sale.

The item appears to have been placed up for sale by a third-party merchandiser and not licensed by Sears or Kmart, both of which are owned by Sears Holdings Corporation.

According to a Wednesday report from MarketWatch, the shirts have been available on the sites since January.

What are the details?

The shirt features a battered American flag with Babbitt's name on top of the flag and ""American Patriot"" emblazoned below the flag.

Its presence on the stores' respective marketplaces drew heavy criticism from social media, with many users calling for a boycott of the stores.

Journalist Aaron Rupar tweeted about the shirt, writing, ""@Sears and @Kmart are selling Ashli Babbitt 'American Patriot' shirts[.]""

Rupar's tweet drew thousands of comments, retweets, and calls for boycotts of both stores.

Sears issued a statement announcing that the product was removed from both Sears.com and Kmart.com following the outrage.

The response to Rupar's tweet read, ""Thank you for bringing this product to our attention. This item is no longer available for purchase on Sears.com or kmart.com.""

What else?

Despite the company ultimately yanking the product from its virtual shelves, social media users continued to call for boycotts of both stores.



Journalist David Leavitt tweeted, ""F*** YOU @sears and @kmart for selling shirts that calls the insurrectionist 'Ashli Babbitt American Patriot' Retweet if Sears and Kmart should go out of business.""

Washington Post columnist Gene Weingarten added, ""Welp, no Sears and Kmart for me. Ashli Babbitt was a traitor. Deluded, perhaps. Naive, sure. Stupid, hard to argue. But she stormed the U.S. Capitol, menacing U.S. congresspeople, destroying property, challenging democracy and the rule of law.""

Writer Tara Dublin tweeted, ""Holy Not Okay, @sears & @kmart. I know you cater to the lowest common denominators, but this is abhorrent. Can anyone try to be better, or have we all given up as a society? JFC[.]""

Another user added, ""would say boycott Kmart and Sears but they appear to be going bankrupt plus there are no stores around me so they appear to be boycotting themselves.""

""Well, Sears and Kmart just joined Toyota on the boycott list,"" a clearly angry user tweeted.

Another user — whose Twitter name is ""Praise Black Jesus"" — added, ""Holy f***. This is seriously disturbing. Boycott @Kmart! Boycott @Sears! And boycott @Walmart.""

""#boycottSears if you can still find one #boycottkmart if you can still find one Both stores actively support domestic terrorism & we l, the #Resistance will see they shut their doors permanently over this,"" another user promised.

Lollapalooza security guard allegedly called in a terror threat to get off work early,"On Friday, July 29, 2022, Chicago Police arrested Janya Williams, 18, and charged her with terrorism and issuing false threats. Williams, a security guard at the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago, is said to have transmitted an anonymous message to her Andy Frain Services supervisor using the TextNow app, which said, ""Mass shooting at 4 pm location Lollapalooza. We have 150 targets."" She allegedly told her supervisor that her sister also saw a comparable threat made on Facebook.

According to WDBD, prosecutors say Williams had allegedly admitted to manufacturing the threat ""because she wanted to leave work early.""

After seeing the TextNow message, Williams' supervisor called Chicago Police. The FBI was subsequently notified.

Williams was instructed by her supervisor to screenshot the threat and is said to have then created a Facebook account for ""Ben Scott."" Under this alias, she posted another version of her original threat: ""Massive shooting at Lollapalooza Grant Park 6:00 p.m."" Williams screenshotted the resulting post and provided it to her supervisor.

CBS Chicago reported that FBI Joint Task Force members subsequently conducted an emergency disclosure request and determined the source of the message. Williams' IP address allegedly indicated she was the culprit.

In Illinois, falsely making a terrorist threat is a Class 1 felony.

Williams, who was has been arrested twice since May, is being held on $50,000 bail, per Cook County Judge Mary Marubio's orders.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/security-guard-called-in-terror-threat-to-get-off-work-early,2022-08-04
"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema stands firm on support for filibuster, gets accused of siding with 'white supremacy' and of plunging 'a knife in the heart of Democracy'","Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) delivered a speech on Thursday in which she reiterated her unwavering support for the filibuster, sparking the ire of those who want Democrats to unilaterally change the rules to enable the party to ram through election-related legislation.

The filibuster, a procedural hurdle that requires three-fifths of senators to agree in order to advance toward a vote, serves as a check on whichever party holds the majority.

While Sinema said that she supports both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, she also said that she continues to support the filibuster.

""And while I contintue to support these bills, I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country,"" Sinema said. ""There's no need for me to restate my longstanding support for the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation.""

But some on Twitter strongly condemned the senator.

""@SenatorSinema just put a knife in the heart of Democracy. My heart breaks how easily she was bought to support the Republican coup,"" tweeted MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance.

Keith Olbermann, who in the past has hosted programs on MSNBC, tweeted that Sinema ""needs to resign or be removed from office immediately."" In another tweet he added, ""For whatever reason, @SenatorSinema has become a menace to the continuation of American democracy.""

""To be blunt: @SenatorSinema chose her side - and that side is white supremacy. That's who she is. That's what defines her now,"" another person tweeted.

""Kyrsten Sinema is a monster. A grotesque, opportunistic, lying monster,"" tweeted Michelangelo Signorile, who hosts a SiriusXM radio show.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is also continuing to stand firm on his support for the filibuster.

""Allowing one party to exert complete control in the Senate with only a simple majority will only pour fuel onto the fire of political whiplash and dysfunction that is tearing this nation apart — especially when one party controls both Congress and the White House,"" Manchin said in a statement.

Senate Democrats allowed convicted murderers — like the Boston bomber — to receive stimulus checks,"Democratic lawmakers in the Senate blocked a Republican amendment to the American Rescue Plan of 2021 that would have barred convicted murderers such as Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from receiving stimulus money from the federal government.

The Boston Herald reported this week that Tsarnaev, who amazingly received a $1,400 COVID-19 relief payment last summer, was ordered by prosecutors to return the money in a court filing on Wednesday. In the filing, prosecutors argued that the money should be instead used as restitution to his victims.

The inmate — who was sentenced to death for his role in the 2013 terror attack that killed three and injured hundreds more — owes more than $101 million to his victims but has only paid $2,202.03 so far, according to Fox News. His death sentence was overturned in 2020, but an appeal seeking its reinstatement is currently before the Supreme Court.

Though unsettling, the fact that a known terrorist received money from the government as a part of a coronavirus relief package is not a surprise. Last March, before the rescue plan was passed, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.) warned that murderers like Tsarnaev would be unjustly awarded taxpayer money as a result of the bill, Fox News reported.

""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Bomber, murdered three people and terrorized a city. He'll be getting a $1,400 stimulus check as part of the Democrats' 'COVID relief' bill,"" Cotton wrote.

Fox News noted that Cotton, along with fellow Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.) and Ted Cruz (Texas), offered an amendment to prevent payments from being sent to prisoners, but it was rejected on a party-line vote.

Cotton's and Cassidy's opposition could be considered disingenuous, however, since both lawmakers previously voted in favor of issuing two stimulus checks — totaling $1,200 and $600, respectively — to Americans without excluding prisoners. Cruz, on the other hand, voted against both bills.

After passing the Senate by a 50-49 vote, the bill moved to the House, where it passed easily, with only one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition. President Joe Biden then signed the bill into law on March 11.

The COVID relief payment issued to Tsarnaev is only part of the $21,071 he has amassed in his inmate account while awaiting a decision on his death penalty. Tsarnaev has received $11,230 from the Office of Federal Defenders of New York and thousands more from individual donors.

In the Wednesday court filing, federal prosecutors sought all of the money.

“By Congressional mandate, the United States has a statutory duty to collect restitution owed to crime victims,” acting U.S. attorney in Massachusetts Nathaniel Mendell stated in the motion. “Further, the Crime Victim Rights Act affords victims of crime the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-democrats-boston-bomber-stimulus-check,2022-01-06
Senate Republicans introduce resolution to condemn anti-Semitism and denounce incendiary language from House Dems,"Republican senators on Tuesday introduced a resolution to condemn the recent rise in hateful violence committed against American Jews and denounce ""poisonous rhetoric"" from progressive lawmakers who have spoken out against Israel amid renewed conflict in the Middle East.

Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and 11 of their GOP colleagues co-sponsored the resolution, which condemns hatred and violence against Jews at home and around the world and denounces recent anti-Israel rhetoric from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), though those progressive lawmakers are not named.

""In recent weeks, Jewish people in the United States have been threatened and physically assaulted in nearly 200 documented attacks since the start of the most recent conflict between Israel and Palestine,"" the Republicans said in a press statement.

""The horrific spike in anti-Semitic violence and crimes in the United States and around the world serves as reminder that hateful rhetoric and lies can quickly turn into violence,"" Rubio said. ""We must be very clear that this ancient evil has no place in our society and ensure America's Jewish communities are protected.""

Hawley added that ""hateful anti-Israel rhetoric from politicians and the media"" inspires the ""sickening"" violence against Jews.

""We must ensure that Jewish people receive the full protection of law owed to them as citizens of the United States,"" he said.

The text of the resolution cites preliminary findings from the Anti-Defamation League that found at least 193 reports of possible anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. from May 7-14, the first week of renewed violence between Israel and Hamas. It also calls attention to several specific examples of disgusting attacks on Jews by pro-Palestinian activists in recent weeks, including incidents in New York City and Los Angeles.

The resolution also refers to and denounces recent anti-Israel statements from several Democratic members of Congress. It quotes, for example, Ilhan Omar calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ''ethno-nationalist"" on the floor of the House of Representatives and a tweet she sent accusing Israel of war crimes.

Other ""poisonous anti-Israel rhetoric"" cited includes Rashida Tlaib's declaration that Palestinian ""babies, children and their parents"" were ""being massacred"" by Israel, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's statement describing Israel as an ""apartheid state,"" and Cori Bush's tweet accusing Israel of ""ethnic cleansing.""

Further, the Republicans want the Senate to reject ""the biased, incomplete, and inaccurate information promulgated by the news media in the United States about Israel and the Government of Israel's efforts to protect its citizens from terrorism.""

The resolution is co-sponsored by GOP Sens. Rick Scott (Fla.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Ted Cruz (Texas), John Kennedy (La.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), and Bill Cassidy (La.).

Democratic leadership in Congress has condemned the anti-Semitic attacks against Jews, but so far remained silent on the anti-Israel statements made by Democrats in the House. Given the Democrats' apparent hesitance to condemn elected members of their own party, it is unlikely the GOP resolution will find bipartisan support in the Senate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-resolution-condemn-anti-semitism-dem-israel-attacks,2021-05-25
"Seoul stampede during Halloween festivities leaves hundreds dead, injured in South Korea","Halloween festivities held in South Korea spiraled into pure terror on Saturday night. A stampede disaster killed at least 146 people and injured another 150 in the South Korean capital of Seoul.

Revelers flocked to Seoul's entertainment district of Itaewon for Halloween festivities. The Halloween celebration attracted approximately 100,000 to the streets – which is believed to be the biggest in South Korea since the country recently eased its COVID-19 restrictions.

However, the merriment quickly turned into tragedy as young people reportedly rushed to see an unidentified celebrity at a nearby bar. Hundreds of partygoers poured into a narrow alley near the Hamilton Hotel. The massive influx of people caused many to fall to the ground and get crushed.

(WARNING: Graphic video)

The grisly aftermath shows lifeless bodies strewn on the pavement covered by blue blankets. Some unconscious people are seen getting CPR to try to save their lives. South Korean officials say approximately 50 people suffered from cardiac arrest.

There were so many dead bodies that they had to be transported to a nearby gymnasium for identification.

Roughly 850 emergency workers and police officers from around South Korea rushed to Seoul to treat the victims. Dozens of emergency vehicles were spotted at the chaotic scene.





The Daily Mail reported that there were 146 dead and 150 injured from the deadly Seoul stampede.

Choi Seong-beom – chief of Seoul’s Yongsan fire department – said the death toll could rise because there are an unspecified number of victims in critical condition.

Michelle Ye Hee – Washington Post'sTokyo/Seoul bureau chief – wrote on Twitter, ""There are still so many unidentified bodies and possibly even more casualties from Itaewon.

"Serial shooter terrorizes New York City and Washington, DC","Police in New York City and Washington, D.C., are on the hunt for a serial shooter who has been attacking homeless men in both cities, murdering two and wounding three others so far.

Authorities said the lone gunman is a ""cold-blooded killer"" who has targeted sleeping homeless men in a series of shootings. New York Mayor Eric Adams and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said they were coordinating with federal authorities to stop the killer in a joint statement released late Sunday night.

""The work to get this individual off our streets before he hurts or murders another individual is urgent,"" the mayors said.

“As our law enforcement agencies work quickly with federal partners to locate the suspect, we are also calling on unsheltered residents to seek shelter. Again, it is heartbreaking and tragic to know that in addition to all the dangers that unsheltered residents face, we now have a cold-blooded killer on the loose, but we are certain that we will get the suspect off the street and into police custody.”

The series of attacks began on March 3, when the suspect shot and wounded a male victim on the 1100 block of New York Avenue in the nation's capital, the New York Post reported.

A second victim was shot five days later on the 1700 block of H Street, authorities said. These first two victims sustained non-life threatening injuries.

But a third victim was fatally stabbed and shot last Wednesday, according to police. The victim's body was discovered on the 400 block of New York Avenue.

At some point before Saturday morning, the suspect traveled to New York, where he attacked two more people with the same M.O., authorities said.

The first New York victim was a 38-year-old homeless man who was shot and wounded as he slept on King Street in Soho. The victim was hospitalized in stable condition, according to the Post.

About one hour later, the suspect was caught on camera fatally shooting a homeless man as he slept in a sleeping bag about 15 blocks outside of 148 Lafayette Street.

Disturbing video shows the suspect kick the sleeping man several times, check to see if anyone is watching, and then take out a firearm and shoot the man in the head.

The video was first reported by WABC-TV.

Ballistics found at the two crime scenes in Soho matched shell casings found in Washington, D.C., the New York Post reported.



NYPD has issued new patrol guidance after the attacks, according to the Post. Officers have been directed to ""proactively engage with apparently homeless individuals,"" conduct wellness checks, and offer shelter services.



Police were also instructed to warn people about the shooter and show them wanted posters of the suspected gunman.

“Our homeless population is one of our most vulnerable and an individual preying on them as they sleep is an exceptionally heinous crime,” NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said in a statement Sunday night.

“We will use every tool, every technique and every partner to bring the killer to justice,” Sewell said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/serial-shooter-terrorizes-new-york-city-and-washington-dc,2022-03-14
Seth Meyers blames Tucker Carlson for inspiring Buffalo massacre — but Megyn Kelly issues blistering rebuke over politicizing the tragedy,"Late-night TV host Seth Meyers unloaded on Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Monday night, saying that the conservative TV host helped to inspire the horrific massacre that took the lives of at least 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket on Saturday.

Meyers made the remarks on the same day that broadcaster Megyn Kelly hit out at media figures attempting to politicize the tragedy.

What are the details?

Meyers addressed the mass killing during Monday night's ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" saying that he believed that Carlson was complicit in helping spread a conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement.

NPR defines the theory as stating ""that non-white individuals are being brought into the United States and other Western countries to 'replace' white voters to achieve a political agenda.""

“With prominent figures on the right embracing and parroting the dangerous white nationalist conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement, it’s worth noting that in addition to being deeply racist, bigoted, and dehumanizing, it’s also incredibly stupid,” Meyers said during a Monday night segment.



He accused Carlson of being guilty of downplaying right-wing domestic terrorism. In 2019, Carlson addressed white supremacy terrorism as small-scale and said that the movement's ""combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium.""

Meyers zeroed in on those remarks during the segment, saying, “First of all, a college football stadium can fit like 100,000 people, which is a ton of people! If I told you, ‘Don’t worry, I rounded up all the white supremacists' and walked you into here, I don’t think your reaction would be, ‘Phew!’”

He added that Carlson has ""openly and repeatedly promoted replacement theory on his show.”

“No one is being replaced. There’s no capacity limit here,"" he said. ""It’s not like there’s a bouncer who only lets two in when two leave. Just think about how breathtakingly dumb the logic here is. No one gets replaced when another person enters the country.”

The Right's Embrace of Racist Replacement Theory Is Both Dangerous and Dumb: A Closer Look www.youtube.com

What else?

During Monday's episode of ""The Megyn Kelly Show,"" Kelly said that those people trying to politicize the shooting are contributing to division.

“We will not be naming the shooter on this program, consistent with our policy of not naming mass shooters, who in part are out for infamy, and we decline to help,"" she said during the broadcast. ""He’s pleaded not guilty, but he also left behind a trove of information, including a 180-page manifesto filled with racist and anti-Semitic commentary. The shooter was white. Detailing how and why he picked his target.”

She added that media talking heads who tried to blame Carlson and other conservatives for the shooting are ""outrageous.""

“Some in the media have been quick to point fingers and even place blame on our friend and very popular Fox News host, Tucker Carlson,"" she pointed out. ""It’s outrageous. It’s wrong, both factually and morally.""

Becoming further outraged, Kelly added, ""Why do we have to go to that place immediately on these stories? Why can’t we spend two f***ing minutes mourning the people who are dead and trying to understand that we have insane people in this country? We have lunatics. It’s a huge country!”

Kelly pointed out that there's no way to eradicate the ""lunatics"" from the country, and attempting to politicize such a horrific tragedy will only further divide Americans.

""People have to inject their politics into everything. And this guy had a racist manifesto. There’s no question that doesn’t make it Tucker Carlson’s fault,"" she insisted. ""Just stop it. Just stop it!”

Sex cult dad Larry Ray sentenced to 60 years in prison,"A man convicted of sex-trafficking and abusing his daughter's college friends has been sentenced to 60 years in prison.

Lawrence Ray, 63, was convicted in April of 15 counts — including racketeering, sex trafficking, assault, forced labor, extortion, money laundering, and tax fraud. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman sentenced Ray to 60 years in prison.

Liman said Ray was an ""evil genius"" who used ""psychological terror and manipulation"" to coerce college students into doing activities ""for his profit and sadistic pleasure.""

""His crimes are particularly heinous,"" Liman said. ""After gaining control of their minds and bodies, he extorted them to do his bidding. They had to keep paying him. They had to remain his slaves.""



Liman added, ""He sought to take any light from his victims' lives. It was sadism, pure and simple.""

Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, said in a statement, ""Larry Ray is a monster. For years, he inflicted brutal and lifelong harm on innocent victims. Students who had their lives ahead of them. He groomed them and abused them into submission for his own gain. Through physical and psychological abuse, he took control over his victims’ minds and bodies and then extracted millions of dollars from them. The sentence imposed today will ensure that Ray will never harm victims again.""

In the autumn of 2010, Ray moved into his daughter's dorm at Sarah Lawrence College — a small liberal arts school in Bronxville, New York. Ray had just finished a prison stint for a securities fraud conviction.

His daughter, Talia Ray, introduced him to her college friends.

To manipulate the college students, Ray presented himself as a father figure. The father from Piscataway, New Jersey, learned ""intimate details about their private lives, vulnerabilities, and mental health struggles under the pretense of helping them,"" according to the indictment.

Ray, also known as ""Lawrence Grecco,"" would tell the college students that he worked in U.S. intelligence and had ties to powerful individuals such as former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev, ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and ex-New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik.

In the summer of 2011, some of the college students moved in with Ray at his Upper East Side, one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan.

Suddenly, Ray took a dark turn and accused his new roommates of attempting to poison him or damaging his property. He would demand the students pay him or face repercussions. Ray is accused of running a cult that forced the students to be subservient to him in physical and sexual ways.

He allegedly forced some of the young people to do physical labor at the North Carolina home of his stepfather in 2013.

Claudia Drury, one of Ray's victims, revealed some of the ""unremitting sadistic torture"" she endured. Drury accused Ray of forcing her into prostitution for four years and then extorting her. Ray reportedly took more than $2 million of her sex work earnings.

Drury said during the trial through a representative, ""Larry forced me to abject desperation.""



Drury said Ray ""stripped me naked, bound me to a chair, and suffocated me with a plastic bag over and over again until I begged for my life.""

She continued, ""The experience that I had while being sex trafficked haunt me today. I feel profoundly violated in a way that I cannot fully communicate.""

Daniel Levin, another victim, said Ray hit him in the ribs with a sledgehammer, pulled his tongue with pliers, squeezed his testicles with a garrote, and forced a sex toy in his mouth, according to Law & Crime.

Santos Rosario claimed that Ray held a knife to his genitals. Rosario testified that he ""contemplated suicide daily"" after Ray ""physically abused, degraded, and blackmailed"" him.

Virginia man accused of sexual assault is illegal immigrant,"A Virginia man accused of at least 22 crimes – including sexual battery and attempted rape – is an illegal immigrant who has been deported three times, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Since July 15, a sexual predator has terrorized females on the Washington and Old Dominion Trail. Juan Rodriguez Alfaro, 42, is believed to be the suspect in nearly a dozen attacks on women and girls on the popular walking trail in Virginia over the summer.

The suspect is said to have been naked from the waist down in some of the incidents.

Speaking about an attack that happened on Aug. 26, Herndon police Chief Maggie DeBoard said, ""That subject exposed himself and was engaging in obscene sexual behaviors and grabbed the victim’s genitals before fleeing the area.""

DeBoard suspects Rodriguez Alfaro is connected to multiple cases in Herndon, Virginia.

WJLA reported that Fairfax County police Lieutenant Ryan Lazisky linked Rodriguez Alfaro to eight cases in Herndon, plus an additional 13 indecent exposure cases in Fairfax County.

Lazisky noted that Rodriguez Alfaro has a lengthy arrest record, and said, ""There was no rape in these cases, but he did assault victims.""

Authorities believe that since January, Rodriguez Alfaro had been living in Herndon. Investigators suspect that Rodriguez Alfaro lived in Suffolk County, New York.

The accused serial sexual predator had an outstanding warrant for attempted rape and sexual assault for an alleged attack in Suffolk County.

Rodriguez Alfaro is accused of attacking a jogger in Suffolk in October 2021, according to a spokesperson from the U.S. Marshals Service. The jogger – who is married to a member of law enforcement – was able to fight him off and escape. During that attack, Rodriguez Alfaro was reportedly pantsless and only wearing a tank top.

Suffolk County Police Det. Tom Corso – who is assigned to the U.S. Marshals task force – believes Rodriguez Alfaro fled the area after the attack. He allegedly made stops in Boston and Maryland before making his way to Virginia.

Rodriguez Alfaro is being held at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center without bond.

ICE told Fox 5 DC that Rodriguez Alfaro is an illegal immigrant originally from Honduras who had been deported three times.

Fox 5 DC reported, ""The agency says it has lodged a detainer with Fairfax County so ICE would be alerted in the event Rodriguez Alfaro would be released. Fairfax County has adopted policies of not cooperating with ICE.""

Lazisky said Rodriguez Alfaro would face charges in Virginia while he is awaiting extradition to New York for the attempted rape charge.

""This is a good success story where we’re collaborating with federal partners as well as our neighboring jurisdictions,"" Lazisky said. ""We know that we were all out there on the trail, handing out flyers, canvassing, talking to the community. It feels good to be able to say you can feel safe again walking that path.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sexual-assault-virginia-illegal-immigrant,2022-09-16
"War zone in Mexico: 30 die during arrest of El Chapo's son; video shows Sinaloa Cartel retaliate by burning city, shooting commercial airplanes, trying to kidnap doctors","Mexican authorities arrested the son of notorious Mexican drug cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman on Thursday. The Sinaloa drug cartel has retaliated by turning a city in Mexico into a fiery war zone.

Mission to arrest El Chapo's son

A significant Mexican military force swooped into the city of Culiacan to take Ovidio Guzman into custody. The Mexican army ordered Blackhawk helicopter gunships to attack a convoy of 25 cartel vehicles – some sporting machine guns.

Mexican law enforcement was able to arrest Guzman. However, 10 Mexican military personnel and one Culiacan policeman were killed during the operation, according to Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval. There were 17 police officers and 35 military personnel injured during the firefight. Authorities believe 19 members of the Sinaloa drug cartel died during the mission.

A Mexican military aircraft conducted a strafing run against Sinaloa Cartel members, according to The Drive.

Sinaloa cartel launches violent campaign to free Ovidio Guzman



The Sinaloa Cartel set the city of Culiacan on fire in an attempt to force Mexican authorities to free Guzman.

According to Fox News, ""The violence became so heavy that Sinaloa Gov. Ruben Rocha said cartel members showed up at local hospitals attempting to kidnap doctors to take them back to the front lines and treat wounded fighters.""

Rocha said, ""It got to the point that at one moment, the doctors were saying, ‘We’re getting out of here.'""

El Pais reported, ""Witnesses who spoke to El Pais paint a picture of terror, where packs of armed criminals, on motorcycles or on foot, played cat and mouse with the authorities. Roberto, a painter who left home shortly before 10 a.m. on Thursday, said the criminals seized his car at gunpoint: 'I don’t know what a war zone is like, but I think it’s the same thing,' he said.""

The cartel set cars, buses, and tractor-trailers on fire as roadblocks across the city. The drug cartel blocked 19 roads and highways in Culiacan. The cartel wanted to prevent the Mexican military from transporting Guzman to the Culiacan airport.

Two military planes landed at the airport and deployed more troops to secure the airport.

Law enforcement was able to transport Guzman to the airport, but the cartel launched a last-ditch offensive. The Sinaloa Cartel shot at a military plane and a commercial airliner in an effort to stop Guzman from being flown out of the city.

The Aeromexico airliner attempted to take off from the runway, but was hit by gunfire. Passengers threw themselves to the floor of the plane to dodge the gunfire. The commercial airliner was forced to retreat to the terminal.

The New York Post reported that the plane's engine had been hit during the shooting, which caused a leak. None of the passengers were injured.

The Sinaloa Cartel grounded two military aircraft after the planes were hit with ""a significant number of impacts,"" Sandoval said. The cartel soldiers were reportedly firing Barrett .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles at the planes.

The U.S. wants Guzman

Mexican authorities snuck Guzman into a military helicopter and flew the 32-year-old drug kingpin to Mexico City. Guzman is reportedly in a maximum-security prison near Toluca.

""Guzman was indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges in 2018. According to both governments, he had assumed a growing role among his brothers in carrying on their father’s business, along with long- time cartel boss Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada,"" according to CNBC.



Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard confirmed the Mexican government received a 2019 request from the United States for Guzman's arrest, and that the U.S. wants to extradite the suspected drug lord.

Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is serving a life sentence at a Colorado supermax federal prison after being convicted of criminal enterprise and cocaine distribution in 2019.

"Sister of pilot killed on Sept. 11 absolutely excoriates leftists who liken Jan. 6 Capitol riot to 9/11 terror attack that claimed nearly 3,000 lives","We know that supposed conservative writer George Will infamously declared that he wants to see the Jan. 6 Capitol riot ""burned into the American mind as firmly as 9/11 because it was that scale of a shock to the system.""

We know that Huffington Post senior White House correspondent S.V. Dáte defended Will by saying the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was ""1000 percent worse"" than 9/11.

We know that Democratic lawmakers desperately want to slow-cook the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and investigate it as if it was on the scale of 9/11 — a desire that will have to fester a bit longer after the push failed to get off the ground in the U.S. Senate a few days ago.

But amid all of their politicizing, virtue-signaling short memories and short-sightedness, Debra Burlingame — sister of a pilot killed on 9/11 — splashed some cold water on leftist faces in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, telling them they're out of their minds if they believe honest Americans buy their tall tale that the Jan. 6 riot was in the same universe as 9/11.

What did Burlingame have to say?

""The attempt to reconfigure the 'domestic terrorist' narrative to fit the horrifying story of Sept. 11 is profoundly disheartening,"" Burlingame wrote. ""These two events are fundamentally different in nature, scope, and consequences. Mentioning them in the same breath not only diminishes the horror of what happened on 9/11; it tells a false story to the generation of Americans who are too young to remember that day nearly 20 years ago.""

She explained that her brother, Charles ""Chic"" Burlingame, was the pilot of American Airlines flight 77 and ""was murdered in his cockpit at age 51 in a 6½-minute struggle for control of the airplane"" — and then gave some facts to the fact-deprived.

More from her op-ed:

Members of Congress might have had a frightening day on Jan. 6, but on 9/11 some 200 people in the World Trade Center towers chose to jump from 80 to 100 floors above the ground rather than be consumed by fire. A woman waiting at a lobby elevator bank was burned over 82% of her body when jet fuel from the first plane sent a ball of fire down the elevator shaft and into the lobby. She spent three months in a hospital burn unit and was permanently disfigured.



There are countless harrowing stories like this—of death, destruction and heartbreaking loss. More than 3,000 children lost parents. Eight young children were killed on the planes. Recovery personnel found 19,000 human remains scattered all over lower Manhattan from river to river, including on rooftops and window ledges. Victims' remains were still being recovered years later by utility workers and construction crews. Some families received so many notifications of remains that they couldn't take it any more and asked for them to stop. More than 1,100 families received nothing. Their loved ones went to work that morning and disappeared.



The attack brought down our nationwide aviation system, shut down the New York Stock Exchange for days, destroyed or rendered uninhabitable 16 acres of Lower Manhattan including underground subway and commuter train lines and destroyed a section of the Pentagon. Rebuilding at ground zero is still incomplete, and U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan.

Burlingame then delivered a knockout blow to the gaslighting left: ""On Jan. 6, Congress resumed its session that evening.""

""It is deeply offensive and sad that the brutal and harrowing memories of the worst terrorist attack in American history are being deployed by political partisans,"" she added. ""They are using 9/11 not as an example of what the American people endured and overcame together, but explicitly to divide, to stoke hatred, and to further a political agenda aimed at stigmatizing the other party and marginalizing ordinary Americans from participating in the political process. That is the real threat to democracy.""

Anything else?

If that isn't refreshing enough to digest, Burlingame offered that there have been ""real terrorist attacks on the Capitol. But those must be forgotten because they came from the political left."" With that, she reminded us of the Weather Underground bombings of the Senate, Pentagon, and State Department in a four-year span in the early 1970s.

Here's a quick look at the unforgettable images of the Pentagon after hijacked flight 77 slammed into its side on 9/11:

"Minnesota man arrested on gun charges was plotting shoot-out with police and praised mass shooters, FBI says","A Minnesota man was arrested on gun charges after the FBI discovered evidence that he was plotting a shoot-out with police and had praised mass shooters.

The Department of Justice said in a statement Thursday that the FBI was tipped off in September to ""disturbing"" behavior of man who was later identified as 20-year-old River William Smith from the city of Savage.

A retired police officer and SWAT commander told police that he saw Smith conduct ""rapid reload drills"" with tactical gear.

When the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force investigated Smith, it concluded that he was plotting to have a violent exchange with police. Court documents said an informant spoke to Smith at the gun range, and the man allegedly told him he was preparing to fight the police and was ""dedicated to dying in the fight.""

He also reportedly explained that he became anti-police when they took away all his guns. The affidavit said that incident unfolded on Dec. 31, 2019 when he fired a weapon and accidentally shot his grandmother in another room of the house. A warrant search discovered numerous weapons, 15 fully loaded magazines, and tactical equipment.

The FBI also said that it found Smith had searched on the internet about Nazis and videos of ""homosexuals being killed.""

Smith went on to allegedly say to informants that he was in favor of mass shootings and sympathized with the Parkland shooter as well as the alleged shooter in the Colorado Springs LGTBQ club attack.

""I think he's a hero,"" Smith said, according to investigators.

He was arrested on Wednesday when he tried to purchase from an informant hand grenades and an illegal firearm mechanism that would convert his rifle to a full-automatic machine gun.

Smith was charged with one count of possession of a machine gun and with one count of an attempt to receive and possess destructive devices, which were the grenades.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/smith-arrest-police-shootout-fbi,2022-12-17
Northern Bronx suffers 30% spike in violent crime since electing 'defund the police' socialist Rep. Bowman,"Democratic socialist Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) was elected to represent New York's 16th Congressional District on December 29, 2020. His district, encompassing most if not all of precincts 45, 47, and 50 in the Northern Bronx region, has seen a marked spike in violent crime this year.

Fox News noted that so far in 2022, there have already been 3,396 violent crimes reported in these three precincts, whereas the total number in 2021 was 2,609. Violent crimes include rape, robbery, felonious assault, and murders committed with a firearm.

This spike in violent crime constitutes approximately a 30% rise over last year's figures.

Precinct 50 alone has witnessed a 73.8% overall increase this year, up 185% since Bowell's election in 2020.

On a list of the precincts in the Bronx with the most murders, Bowman's 47th ranks fourth highest.

Statistics indicate worsening crime elsewhere in Bowman's district. The city of Mount Vernon, for instance, has seen a 39.4% total increase, with 80.4% more grand and petit larceny and twice as many rapes. In July, Mount Vernon saw a 260% increase in robberies.

Shortly after his election, Bowman wrote, concerning American law enforcement: ""A system this cruel and inhumane can't be reformed. Defund the police, and defund the system that's terrorizing our communities.""

On February 12, 2021, Bowman reiterated his desire to defund the police, claiming that upon doing so, ""we need to scrutinize the ones that remain with the full force of the law.""

Bowman, also an advocate for reparations, had previously defined his terms: ""Defund the police means defund the occupation of black bodies and the militarization of our communities.""

In July 2020, around the time Bowman declared, ""We don't need to hire more police,"" former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cut approximately $1 billion from the NYPD's 2021 operating budget. According to the Citizens Budget Commission, the department thus incurred $322 million in cuts. The NYPD's head count was consequently reduced by 1,163 uniformed officers. By last estimate, the NYPD's authorized uniformed headcount stands at 34,771.

Despite his calls to defund the police, Bowman reportedly requested increased police presence at his home for a period of two weeks after the January 6 incident at the Capitol.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/socialist-democrat-jamaal-bowman-massive-crime-spike-in-the-bronx,2022-08-17
Outrage mounts over 'soft' treatment of Islamic terrorist responsible for abuse and deaths of four Americans,"Sudanese-born former British national El Shafee Elsheikh joined ISIS and committed atrocities in Iraq and Syria between 2012 and 2015. Elsheikh was personally involved in the kidnapping, torture, and murder of 26 journalists and aid workers, including four Americans. Spared the death penalty by former U.S. Attorney General William Barr so that British prosecutors would cooperate, the Islamic terrorist was ultimately brought to the U.S. to stand trial. He was subsequently given eight life sentences by a U.S. District Court in Virginia on August 19.

Although he was expected to spend the rest of his days in solitary confinement at an American supermax prison, the Daily Mail reported that he has been assigned to a laxer prison where he may be permitted to fraternize with other prisoners. This revelation has stoked outrage as well as fears that the 34-year-old terrorist may radicalize some of the prison population.

The terrorist will reportedly avoid the supermax on account of his lawyers suggesting he has exhibited ""signs of mental and physical deterioration from his present and past detention."" The lawyers reportedly cited several instances of prisoner suicides at supermax prison ADX Florence as additional cause for concern.

Research director at the Centre for Crime Prevention David Spencer told the MailOnline, ""If it's special treatment for him and it's on the grounds of his mental health it looks soft in light of what he's done and the impact of his horrific actions on his victims and their loved ones.""

Spencer noted that the decision not to confine Elsheikh to the supermax prison where other such terrorists and murderers posing threats to national security are kept demonstrates ""a lack of consistency.""

One U.S. prison insider told the Mirror that the victims' families have no idea how Elsheikh, the highest-profile ISIS fighter to stand trial in the U.S., avoided the supermax prison. ""They were sure he was to see out his days at ADX, but they have now been told he has been sent to the lesser penitentiary. It's a huge kick in the teeth.""

The difference

ADX Florence, dubbed the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies,"" is America's highest-security ""supermax"" prison. Run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ADX Florence is home to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who committed the Boston Marathon bombing; Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber; Ramzi Yousef, the architect of the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing; Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman; and a handful of other terrorists and violent degenerates.

The prison's 410 or so inmates are confined to single-person 7'x12' cells for 23 hours a day. In prisoners' single hour outside their concrete boxes, they are shackled and placed in a concrete ditch, ten steps wide.

ADX Florence inmates eat and sleep alone.

The Islamic hate preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri reportedly begged to be released, clawing on his door to get out. Hamza's lawyers deemed the prison's conditions ""inhuman and degrading.""

Elsheikh has reportedly been spared internment in ADX Florence, whose ""inhuman"" conditions are far more humane than those he subjected his victims to. Instead, he will spend his sentence at USP Florence High.

USP Florence High, located on the same site, is home to 638 inmates. Unlike ADX Florence, which is a super-maximum security prison/administrative maximum ""control-unit"" prison,"" Florence High is a high-security federal prison. The prison has visitation, educational program areas, a barbershop, a commissary, a chapel, and an exercise area.

Unlike ADX Florence, Florence High enables interaction among inmates and keeps prisoners in a less restrictive environment.

The crimes

Raj Parekh, lead prosecutor and first assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, had requested that Elsheikh's punishment reflect the Islamic terror group's engagement in ""the systematic torture and abuse of their victims, ultimately resulting in the horrific deaths of at least eight American, British and Japanese citizens, among others, including gruesome executions that were videotaped and broadcast globally.""

Elsheikh's captives were tortured in a variety of ways, including waterboarding, mock executions, food deprivation, electric shocks, and prolonged beatings. Some of those who survived the tortures were pitted to fight one another. Many were executed on camera. Videos of their beheadings were widely circulated on social media.

Elsheikh received his guilty verdict for hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder in April.

Judge T.S. Ellis III said the terrorist's conduct could only be described as ""horrific, barbaric, brutal, callous, and, of course, criminal.""

The radicalization risk

In England, the nation to which Elsheikh had fled as a child refugee, prisons are hotbeds for Islamic extremism and radicalization.

In 2014, former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick, who had spent time in over 40 jails, said he observed a trend of inmates convicted of terrorism offenses trying to influence and pressure others.

Counterterrorism expert Ian Acheson, tasked with investigating the spread of Islamic extremism, indicated that Islamic hate literature proliferated in prisons. ""My team found evidence that jihadist radicalization is such a serious problem inside some of Britain's jails that it threatens prison legitimacy.""

A number of terror attacks in Britain were executed by criminals who had been radicalized in U.K. prisons.

When the current prime minister of Britain, Liz Truss, then the justice minister, examined the trend, she noted, ""We cannot have a situation where we have extremist prisoners influencing others who are vulnerable to those messages.""

Islamists like Anjem Choudary, linked to a network of violent jihadists and brutal slayings, often find a receptive audience behind bars. Choudary, who ultimately was placed in solitary confinement, had radicalized a wave of Muslims and encouraged them to wage jihad.

Former al Qaeda recruiter Jesse Morton claimed in 2016 that ""when I was incarcerated for terrorist-related crimes, [radicalization] went on very frequently in general, mainstream or medium or high-security prisons as well.""

While radicalization in prison remains a problem in Britain, the U.S. has by no means been immune.

Former Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) acknowledged, ""Over the years, our Federal prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalization.""

Prison radicalization expert Mark Hamm, a professor at Indiana State University, told FoxNews.com, ""It is not the sheer number of prisoners following extremist interpretations of religious doctrines that poses a threat ... Rather, it is the potential for the single individual to become radicalized.""

While not immune to prison radicalization, a 2018 George Washington University policy paper indicated that American prisons like ADX Florence benefit from ""isolation strategies.""

Unlike in some European countries that use co-location strategies, in which extremists are concentrated in one facility to lessen the likelihood they will radicalize those who do not already share their views, in certain American prisons, extremists can be locked down and atomized ""so that they can neither form ties to other extremists nor radicalize others.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/soft-treatment-islamic-terrorist-prisoner,2022-09-27
Somali Islamist who lived in California and Minnesota sentenced to 20 years for financing Islamic terrorism,"On Monday, Judge Thomas J. Whelan sentenced former San Diego resident Abdullahi Ahmed Abdullahi to 20 years in prison for conspiring with other Islamists to provide material support to ISIS terrorists engaged in murder, kidnapping, and butchery.

According to the U.S. attorney's office of the Southern District of California, Abdullahi provided both money and personnel to support ""the violent jihadist activities of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a foreign terrorist organization.""

U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman said of the sentence: ""Today we have delivered justice to a man who directly funded violent acts of terrorism.""

""Abdullahi committed violent, unlawful acts to obtain money, then used that money to support the murder, torture, and extreme violence that ISIS represents,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy.

Abdullahi was a Somali national who immigrated to the U.S. and later became a naturalized Canadian citizen. From November 2013 to March 2014, he bankrolled and encouraged both American and Canadian Islamists to travel to Syria to engage in ""battles to gain control of the territories and civilian populations within Syria.""

The six terrorists Abdullahi financially supported — all now dead — proved to be bad investments.



One of them, Douglas McCain, also a San Diego resident formerly of Minnesota, was reportedly the first American killed while fighting for ISIS. McCain had expressed his hatred for white people, stating, ""Ok its official f--- white people."" Prior to his elimination, he wrote on Facebook, the ""soldiers of Allah"" are ""coming back.""

McCain's brother Marchello McCain, also involved in the Islamist conspiracy, was sentenced to 10 years in custody for illegal possession of a cache of firearms and for lying to the FBI about his knowledge of Abdullahi's involvement with ISIS.

Abdullahi paid the way of his three cousins from Edmonton, Canada, and an 18-year-old cousin from Minneapolis. His cousins made their way to their Syrian graves by way of Turkey.

One cousin, Hanad Abdullahi Mohallim, formerly of St. Louis, died fighting for ISIS along with fellow terrorists Mahad Hirsi, Hamsa Kariye, and Hersi Kariye in 2015.

Extra to providing encouragement and money, Abdullahi helped with terrorists' ""logistical needs"" as well as with recruitment.

Court filings indicated that Abdullahi and his family came to America from Mogadishu, Somalia. He resided in Minneapolis and then moved to San Diego, where he lived for nearly six years. In 2012, he moved to Edmonton, Alberta.

It was in Canada that he committed an armed robbery against jewelry store VJ Jewellers in Edmonton, on January 9, 2014. He subsequently wired $3,100 of the stolen funds to ISIS terrorists.

Abdullahi was indicted by a grand jury in 2017 and arrested on September 15 of that year by Canadian authorities.

A Canadian court stayed the armed robbery charges against Abdullahi in October 2019, noting both that a conviction would have been unlikely and that he might soon face justice in the United States.

On October 24, 2019, Court of Queen's Bench Justice John Little granted the extradition order, and Abdullahi was sent to California.

Last year, Abdullahi pled guilty, admitting to a scheme to provide $4,650 to a group of Islamists planning to carry out terrorist attacks in Syria. He also admitted that he transferred funds to third-party intermediaries in Gaziantep, Turkey, near the Syrian border, with the purpose of supporting terrorist activity in Syria.

Correspondence between Abdullahi and other terrorists revealed his contempt for non-Muslims, whom they referred to as ""kuffar."" In the mutual encouragement given to steal from and commit fraud against non-Muslims, the terrorists appealed to Sharia law, reasoning that it permitted such criminal activity.

Although Abdullahi's attorney Marc Carlos intimated that his client was just helping out his ""young and impressionable"" cousins, prosecutors highlighted one of his messages wherein he wrote, ""(M)ay allah bless ur hearts and fill it with joy and happiness on the front and may u brothers bring destruction to the cowards.""

In March 2014, Abdullahi also expressed his intention to join his fellow terrorists, writing, ""inshallah we[']ll be all together on the front lines just like I been dreaming about lately.""

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the terrorist's family asked for leniency, describing Abdullahi as the son of Somali immigrants who had cared for elderly family members and younger cousins.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/somali-islamist-sentenced-20-years-terrorism,2022-10-18
Border Patrol agents arrest 11 Iranians who entered US from Mexico,"U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 11 Iranian citizens on Monday night after they illegally entered the United States from Mexico. Border Patrol agents arrested the group on a bridge near San Luis, Arizona.

""There were five women, ages 28, 30, 35, 35 and 37, who were arrested,"" KPNX reported. ""Four men, ages 24, 31, 36 and 43, were taken into custody along with two boys, ages 10 and 2. These people had previously lived in Iran.""

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told KPNX that it was not yet clear as to why the group was attempting to illegally enter the United States. The Iranians have yet to be fully processed and interviewed. The group was arrested and taken to Yuma Station for processing.



""Yuma Sector agents regularly encounter people from all over the world, including Special Interest Countries,"" the U.S. Customs and Border Protection statement said. ""Agents adjudicate each arrest in accordance with law and policy in order to secure our nation's borders.""

In the 2021 fiscal year, Yuma Sector agents have apprehended 14 nationals from Iran. In 2020, eight Iranians were arrested by Yuma Sector agents.

The group was from Iran, which is classified as a ""special interest country."" Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar defined ""special interest countries"" as ""basically countries designated by our intelligence community as countries that could export individuals that could bring harm to our country in the way of terrorism.""

The Department of Homeland Security describes ""special interest aliens"" as ""non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism.""

The DHS encountered more than 3,000 special interest aliens at the southern Border in 2018.

As TheBlaze reported last month, thousands of migrants from Central America are making their way to the United States. The caravan is traveling to the U.S. southern border because some believe that President Joe Biden will have a more relaxed stance on illegal immigration than former President Donald Trump was.

Migrant rights group Pueblo Sin Fronteras issued a statement on behalf of the people participating in the caravan.

""We recognize the importance of the incoming Government of the United States having shown a strong commitment to migrants and asylum seekers, which presents an opportunity for the governments of Mexico and Central America to develop policies and a migration management that respect and promote the human rights of the population in mobility,"" the statement reads. ""We will advocate that the Biden government honors its commitments.""

Last week, the Daily Mail reported: ""U.S. Border Patrol agents reported a 436 percent increase in migrants apprehended in so-called stash houses near Laredo, Texas since October when compared to the same time last year. The stash houses at the Texas-Mexico border are operated by human trafficking organizations to hide undocumented immigrants.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/southern-border-patrol-arrest-iranians,2021-02-05
Sports columnist torched for saying Jack Del Rio 'lucky to still have a job' after un-woke Jan. 6 comments: 'Clownishly dumb take even for this leftist rag',"Miami Herald sports columnist Greg Cote got torched on social media for his piece ripping Jack Del Rio's decidedly un-woke comments about the 2021 Capitol riots — and adding that the Washington Commanders' defensive coordinator is ""lucky to still have a job.""

What's the background?

In regard to the Jan. 6 commission hearings, Del Rio recently tweeted: ""Would love to understand 'the whole story' about why the summer of riots, looting, burning, and the destruction of personal property is never discussed but this is???""

He followed that up at a media briefing by saying, ""Let's get right down to it. What did I ask? A simple question. Why are we not looking into those things?"" He added, ""I see the images on TV. People's livelihoods are being destroyed. Businesses are being burned down, no problem. And then we have a dust-up at the Capitol, nothing burned down. And we're not gonna talk about, we're gonna make that a major deal."" Del Rio then said, ""Let's have a discussion. We're Americans. Let's talk it through.""

After a torrent of backlash, Del Rio apologized on Twitter: ""I made comments earlier in referencing the attack that took place on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. Referencing that situation as a dust-up was irresponsible and negligent and I am sorry.""

He added: ""I stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. I say that while also expressing my support as an American citizen for peaceful protest in our country. I have fully supported all peaceful protest in America.""

But it wasn't enough.

Commanders' Head Coach Ron Rivera soon fined Del Rio $100,000 for his ""extremely hurtful"" comments and added a couple of sentences in a statement that read like it was penned by a Democratic speechwriter: ""As we saw last night in the hearings, what happened on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an act of domestic terrorism. A group of citizens attempted to overturn the results of a free and fair election, and as a result, lives were lost and the Capitol building was damaged.""

Rivera also said the Commanders wouldn't ""tolerate"" anyone equating the Jan. 6 riots BLM rioting. Del Rio soon deleted his Twitter account.

Enter Cotes' column

In addition to saying Del Rio is ""lucky to still have a job,"" Cotes dropped just about every left-wing bomb you can think of upon the coach. He called Del Rio's comments ""dumb"" and ""tone-deaf-insensitive""

Cotes added, ""Doubling down on the stupidity, the coach managed to also demonize the street demonstrations that erupted nationwide in protest of the police killing of George Floyd, and blamed the ... Black Lives Matter movement.""

He also wrote that ""three officers defending the Capitol were among the seven persons who died related to the 'dust-up'"" and then took the time to define ""insurrection"" (“A violent uprising against an authority or government"") and ""dust-up"" (""You and the wife arguing in the car over where to go for dinner""). Gee, thanks, Greg.

How are folks reacting?

If the comments under the Herald's tweet about Cotes' column are any indication, readers for the most part sure don't seem pleased by it. Here are but a few of the scathing comments:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sportswriter-torched-jack-del-rio,2022-06-14
"Conservative actress Stacey Dash denounces her support for Trump, says she's done with politics","Conservative actress and ex-Fox News contributor Stacey Dash denounced her past support of former President Donald Trump and apologized for past comments she made while on the network during a recent interview.

The former ""Clueless"" star told the Daily Mail this week that she's done with politics and never plans to work in political media again. She also claimed the network typecast her as an ""angry, conservative black woman,"" and said that role eventually wore her down.

""I've lived my life being angry, which is what I was on Fox News. I was the angry, conservative black woman. And at that time in my life it was who I was,"" she said. ""I realized in 2016 that anger is unsustainable and it will destroy you. I made a lot of mistakes because of that anger.

""There are things that I am sorry for,"" she continued. ""Things that I did say, that I should not have said them the way I said them. They were very arrogant and prideful and angry. And that's who Stacey was, but that's not who Stacey is now. Stacey's someone who has compassion, empathy.""

Dash became a darling of conservatives ahead of the 2016 election cycle by passionately speaking out about conservative values and taking aim at the Hollywood liberal elite.



At times, her passion sparked controversy. One such example was in 2015 when she claimed on-air that former President Barack Obama ""couldn't give a s**t"" about terrorism. Another occurred in 2018 during an interview with MSNBC, when she defended comments Trump made about the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Now she says, ""God has forgiven me, how dare I not forgive someone else. I don't want to be judged, so how dare I judge anyone else. So if anyone has ever felt that way about me, like I've judged, that I apologize for because that's not who I am.""

Dash didn't deny personal responsibility in stirring up political controversy while at Fox News, but she did claim the network paid her to do as much.

""I'm not a victim of anyone. Working for Fox at the time, that was my job. I did my job from the place I was at. Stacey now would never work at Fox, would never work for a news network or be a news contributor,"" she said.

As for her support of Trump, Dash said, ""He is not the president. We have a new president. Being a supporter of Trump has put me in some kind of box that I don't belong in. But he's not the president. I'm going to give the president that we have right now a chance.""

Dash, who also ran unsuccessfully for Congress in California in 2018, added that the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was an important turning point for her.

""I think the Capitol Riots were appalling,"" she said. ""When that happened I was like 'Ok, I'm done. I'm truly done.' Because senseless violence of any kind I denounce. What happened on January 6 was just appalling and stupid.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-dash-denounces-trump-support,2021-03-11
Stephen Colbert likens Taliban militants who took over Kabul to Jan. 6 Capitol rioters — and critics eat him alive,"Late-night TV host Stephen Colbert on Monday noted the disastrous Taliban takeover of Kabul and all other major Afghanistan cities following the rapid exit of U.S. troops from the Middle Eastern nation under the leadership of President Joe Biden.

But one part of Colbert's monologue, not surprisingly, took the focus off the horrific practices of radical Islam and ridiculed his political enemies here in the U.S.

What did he say?

""We've had troops there for 20 years. They fought. They sacrificed. Their families sacrificed, so we wouldn't have a terrorist attack in America planned in a foreign country,"" he said before turning the observation to a perverted perspective.

""Why should our soldiers be fighting radicals in a civil war in Afghanistan? We've got our own on Capitol Hill."" And as Colbert recited his lines, an image of the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters flashed on the screen to enthusiastic applause.

Check it out:

How did folks react?

Democratic congressman: National Guardsmen who voted for Trump should be ‘suspects’ of an insider attack,"As more than 25,000 National Guard troops head into Washington, D.C., ahead of Inauguration Day, new concerns over the potential of an ""insider threat"" have reportedly risen to the surface — and now one Democratic lawmaker is suggesting that every Guardsmen who voted for President Trump should be a ""suspect.""

What did he say?

Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen (Tenn.), who chairs the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, made the wild suggestion during an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto on Monday.

""This morning I was reading about this on my Twitter account I guess, and people were reminding people of Anwar Sadat and Indira Gandhi who were killed by their own people,"" Cohen said in reference to two political leaders who were assassinated by those tasked with protecting them.

""You know, I was thinking, the [National] Guard is 90 some odd percent I believe male, only about 20% of white males voted for Biden. You got to figure that in the Guard which is predominately more conservative — and I see that on my social media and we know it — there's probably not more than 25% of the people that are there protecting us who voted for [President-elect Joe Biden]. The other 75% are in the class that would be the large class of folks who might want to do something,"" he continued. ""And there were military people and police who took oaths to defend the Constitution and to protect and defend who didn't do it, who were in the insurrection. So, it does concern me ...""

When Sciutto cut in to push back at Cohen's suggestion that simply having voted for President Trump should make someone a threat, the Democratic lawmaker dug his heels in.

""You draw circles of people, and in the first circle is people who were for Trump and not for Biden as far as people who would be within the zone of folks who you would be suspect of, and the suspect group is large,"" he said.

What's the background?

The Associated Press reported Sunday that the FBI began vetting thousands of service members stationed in the nation's capital after U.S. defense officials express concern over the potential that individuals charged with protecting the city may present a threat to Biden or other government officials.

Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy reportedly told the news agency that commanders have been instructed to be on the lookout for problems within their ranks. He added that no issue has been discovered yet.

"Steven Ray Hessler cold case solved, rapist sentenced to 650 years in prison","An Indiana man convicted in a series of home invasions and sexual assaults in the 1980s was finally sentenced to a total of 650 years in prison for his crimes. A utility bill helped law enforcement apprehend the man who terrorized women in Shelby County some 30 years ago.

Steven Ray Hessler sentenced to 650 years in prison

Steven Ray Hessler, 59, was found guilty on March 3 of 19 felony charges for crimes against 10 victims between 1982 and 1985.

Following an eight-day trial in Shelby Circuit Court, Hessler was convicted on two counts of rape, six counts of unlawful deviate conduct, seven counts of burglary resulting in bodily injury, three counts of criminal deviate conduct, and one count of robbery, according to WXIN.

Shelby Circuit Court Judge Trent Metzler described Hessler's crimes as ""monstrous"" and ""horrific."" The judge gave Hessler the maximum of 50 years on each count, all of which were Class A felonies, WRTV reported.

How a utility bill broke open the cold case

Hessler was arrested at his home in Greensburg in August 2020 after investigators linked him to the cold case crimes through DNA evidence.



In 2019, the Shelby County Sheriff's Department decided to renew interest in the cold case after learning of advances in forensic technology. ""A detective asked prosecutors if they would pay for samples to be sent to a company that uses the same sort of DNA testing that resulted in the capture of ""the Golden State Killer,"" according to the Associated Press.

The prosecutors agreed and sent a DNA sample left in the victim's garage from the last reported assault on Aug. 17, 1985. Investigators also sent a licked utility bill that they had intercepted in the mail to Parabon NanoLabs. The DNA on the sample and the utility bill matched.

""Police said there was a one trillion-to-one chance the DNA found at the scene belonged to anyone but Hessler,"" the Indianapolis Star reported. ""A subsequent test by Indiana State Police of DNA from Hessler's arrest confirmed the match.""

Police found other evidence linking Hessler to the crimes, including pictures stolen from one of the victims was found in his possession. Law enforcement also determined that he searched for some of the victims on his computer.

The 'monstrous' crimes committed by the 'Coward Sadist'

In the middle of the night, Hessler – wearing a ski mask or tights to conceal his face – would break into the houses of women who were often home alone and force them to perform sexual acts while threatening harm if they did not do as he said, according to police. Hessler would bind, rape, and sexually torture his victims at gunpoint and knifepoint, investigators said. He also stole money and valuables from his victims.



""In a few cases, men who were in the home were made to watch or participate,"" according to the Indianapolis Star. ""The man would sometimes lecture his victims about the lack of security in their homes, according to police. Before he left, some victims reported he would unplug phones and take their money.""



Hessler allegedly took photos of the victims to blackmail them not to inform the authorities and said if they told the police, he would come back and kill them.

Several of the victims testified during the sentencing hearing about the trauma they experienced from the heinous attacks. Some expressed fears that Hessler would return to kill them or their children.

Shelby County Prosecutor Brad Landwerlen issued a statement:

Steven Ray Hessler is one of the most evil, dangerous, sadistic predators that I’ve had the pleasure of prosecuting in my 30+ year career. He derived great pleasure from his unnecessarily brutal methods of terrorizing and sexually torturing his victims. I promised the victims early-on that my goal would be that he go to prison the rest of his life, and all involved are very happy that we have achieved that goal.

Landwerlen dubbed Hessler the ""Coward Sadist.""

""He's a sadist because he loves getting pleasure from hurting other people,"" Landwerlen said. ""He's a coward because he would only do it when he was armed.""

In his closing arguments, defense attorney Bryan Cook said, ""It's a hot mess of a case the state has.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/steven-ray-hessler-cold-case-rapist,2022-04-01
CNN confirms suicide bomber who killed 13 US troops at Kabul airport was released from Bagram prison just days before,"In late August, an ISIS-K suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. troops at the Kabul airport as President Joe Biden's disastrous Afghanistan pullout was underway.

It turns out, according to a new CNN report, that the bomber, whose attack also killed at least 170 Afghans, according to the Washington Post, had been released from a prison near Kabul just days earlier.

The killer had been behind bars at the Parwan prison, which had been run by Afghan authorities since 2013 and was located at the U.S.-controlled Bagram Air Base. When the U.S. quickly abandoned the base in July, chaos ensued and the prisoners were freed by the Taliban, with which the Biden Administration had already begun making deals to get U.S. personnel out of the south Asian country.

From CNN:

The Parwan prison at Bagram, along with the Pul-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul, housed several hundred members of ISIS-K, as well as thousands of other prisoners when the Taliban took control of both facilities hours before taking over the capital with barely a shot fired in mid-August, a regional counter-terrorism source told CNN at the time. The Taliban emptied out both prisons, releasing their own members who had been imprisoned but also members of ISIS-K, which is the terror group's affiliate in Afghanistan.



Eleven days later, on August 26, it was one of those prisoners who carried out the suicide bombing at Abbey Gate, killing the 13 US service members, including 11 Marines, one soldier and one sailor. They would be the last US troops killed in Afghanistan as part of America's longest war.

Multiple U.S. officials confirmed the identity of the bomber to CNN, echoing ISIS-K's claims that one of their own, Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri, carried out the attack.

The CNN report backs up California Republican Rep. Ken Calvert's claims last week that national security officials had told him the attacker was a recently released Parwan prisoner.

Critics of Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal — both on the left and the right — blamed the admiration's insistence on a quick pullout as well as the decision to abandon Bagram for much of the disaster that was seen worldwide.



More from CNN:

The Biden administration faced widespread criticism for its withdrawal from Bagram, not only because of the decision to abandon a sprawling military complex that was the heart of the US military operations in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, but also for the way in which it was done.



Some Afghan officials said the US left the base in the middle of the night with little warning. The Pentagon insisted there had been communication and coordination about the handover of the base about 48 hours before the US left, but that the exact time of the final departure from Bagram was never given to the Afghan government.

Leaving the prison at Bagram in the hands of the Taliban should have been a known problem, CNN's reporting indicated.

The vast majority of the 5,000 prisoners at Bagram's Parwan prison were terrorists. Only a few hundred were criminals, according to an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman's statement to CNN. Those terrorists included members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and ISIS.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/suicide-bomber-kabul-airport-released-from-bagram-prison,2021-10-06
"Socialist Reddit group posts home addresses of Supreme Court justices, discusses hunting them down at their churches. TikTok user hint at using pipe bombs in retaliation to Roe v. Wade reversal.","One of the top posts in a socialist subreddit featured the addresses of Supreme Court justices that voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Reddit users in the anti-capitalist group discussed hunting down Supreme Court justices at their churches and possibly sending them mail bombs.

The alarming threats were made in r/WorkersStrikeBack – a self-described ""leftist, anti-capitalist, socialist subreddit that is dedicated to support worker strikes, protests and unions all over the world, address the obvious problems related to an average worker's workplace, offer advice to a fellow worker struggling with their workplace problems and mock or satirize any kind of anti-worker sentiment.""

The post broadcasted the home addresses of Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, and Neil Gorsuch.

At the time of publication, the post doxxing the Supreme Court justices had been allowed up in the subreddit for more than 22 hours. What is most concerning is the post received nearly 27,000 upvotes in the online socialist community of 97,000 users.

There were over 2,000 comments to the doxxing post – some suggested violence in retaliation for overturning Roe v. Wade.

A Reddit user urged people to hunt Supreme Court justices at their churches.

""Find their churches. The area they live in is super wealthy and they all definitely are part of local bloated churches. Find their churches, they can never be free, because you can track when they're home by when they they go to their local church.""

One Reddit user asks, ""Where are the 2nd homes?""

A mail carrier appears to request that domestic terrorists don't use the mail service to deliver bombs to Supreme Court justices, but instead called for ""more direct action.""

""Socialist mailman here, please don't send anything that could hurt your mail handlers,"" the Redditor wrote. ""Accidental tearing happens to mail all the time. I would encourage more direct action at a time like this.""

A Redditor ranted, ""Six of these fascist creeps. A mere SIX. 330 MILLION of us. Why are we putting up with this? This is a f***ing WAR now.""

Another Redditor stated, ""Politicians are way too comfortable in this country when they're willing to break precedent to go against 70% of the population to fit their own agenda. Maybe it's time they felt less comfortable and safe.""

One person said, ""Violence is never the answer. It's the question. And right now, the answer is yes.""



Someone else in the subreddit suggests that they ""need to target the police"" because ""it'll be them enforcing the abortion bans.""

A user ominously adds, ""I've been looking for a life purpose.""

Meanwhile on TikTok, a user hinted at unleashing pipe bombs against Supreme Court justices. In a comment to a photo of Clarence Thomas with his home address, a user listed the components needed to make a pipe bomb.

Supreme Court reinstates death penalty for Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,"The United States Supreme Court on Friday upheld the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, an Islamic terrorist who was convicted of perpetrating the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds more, including 17 who lost limbs.

The court voted 6-3 to reverse a lower court decision that had overturned Tsarnaev's death sentence, with the three liberal justices dissenting.

""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev committed heinous crimes. The Sixth Amendment nonetheless guaranteed him a fair trial before an impartial jury. He received one,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court majority. ""The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed.""

Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015 in the deaths of Krystle Campbell, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, who died in the bombing, and also in the death of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, who was killed several days later, among other charges. He and his older brother Tamerlan, both immigrants to Massachusetts from Kyrgysztan, planted pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013, and detonated them as an act of jihad.

Days later on April 18, after the FBI identified the brothers as suspects, they murdered Collier at the MIT campus, in a failed attempt to steal his gun, and later that night engaged in a shootout with police. Tamerlan was killed when Dzhokhar escaped the scene in an SUV, running over his brother. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured the next day after a manhunt in Watertown, Massachusetts.

During police questioning, Tsarnaev admitted that the brothers had intended to detonate bombs in Times Square, New York, next.

Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 federal charges related to the bombing and the events that followed. He was sentenced to death on June 24, 2015. He appealed his sentence, arguing that he didn't get a fair trial because the proceedings took place in Boston, where the jury would be biased. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed, holding that the trial court had erred in issues related to pretrial publicity and had excluded evidence that might have bolstered Tsarnaev's defense.

Then-President Donald Trump sounded off on the court's decision, demanding the ""death penalty"" for Tsarnaev and later directing his administration to ask the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court ruling. The Biden administration renewed the request, surprising many of the President Joe Biden's supporters, given that the president made a campaign promise to eliminate the federal death penalty. Biden's Department of Justice referred to Tsarnaev as a ""terrorist"" who acted in ""furtherance of Jihad"" and who must receive the just penalty for causing ""carnage at the finish line.""

The Biden administration is currently enforcing a moratorium on federal executions while the government reviews the policy. It is unclear whether Tsarnaev's sentence will be carried out under Biden's presidency.

Supreme Court set to hear cases challenging Section 230 protections for social media companies,"On Monday, the Supreme Court announced it will hear a case challenging Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, the provision that protects social media companies from liability for what third parties post to their sites, reports the Washington Post.

The case was brought by the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old woman from California who was killed in a 2015 ISIS attack in Paris.

The lawsuit accuses Google — which, along with YouTube, is owned by Alphabet — of materially supporting terrorism in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act, a law that allows Americans to recover damages related to ""an act of international terrorism,"" reports Reuters. Gonzalez’s family argues that YouTube's algorithm helped ISIS spread its militant message by recommending the group's videos to YouTube users and that YouTube’s ""assistance"" was a cause of the 2015 attack.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the lawsuit in 2021, relying largely on the tech companies' Section 230 protection.

In a similar case against Twitter, American family members brought suit on behalf of Nawras Alassaf, a Jordanian citizen who died in a 2017 mass shooting in Istanbul. ISIS also claimed responsibility for that attack. Alassaf’s family accused Twitter of violating the Anti-Terrorism Act by failing to remove accounts and posts related to ISIS.

The Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court’s decision to dismiss the case against Twitter. The court did not consider Twitter's claim of immunity under Section 230.

People on all sides of the political debate have found cause for criticizing Section 230 in recent years. “Democrats have faulted it for giving social media companies a pass for spreading hate speech and misinformation. Republicans painted it as a tool for censorship of voices on the right, especially after Twitter and other platforms banned then-President Donald Trump,” explains Reuters.

Where the Supreme Court comes down on the issue could have a fundamental impact on the future of online speech. “The entire scope of Section 230 could be at stake, depending on what the Supreme Court wants to do,” said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-set-to-hear-cases-on-social-media-and-online-speech,2022-10-03
Surveillance video shows Jewish man being chased down by cars waving Palestinian flags. He says he ran for his life as they began shouting 'Allahu akbar!',"New video footage from Los Angeles this week shows the terrifying moment that a Jewish man was being chased down by at least two Palestinian flag-bearing cars in a parking lot on his way home from synagogue. The anonymous man revealed just how harrowing the incident was, telling Fox News he definitely feared for his life as his pursuers were chanting ""Allahu akbar.""

What happened?

As Middle East tensions between Hamas terrorists and Israel have escalated, pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel attacks on Jews around the world — including in the United States — have also risen.

Reports across the globe have documented cases of pro-Palestine activists verbally and physically harassing and attacking Jews:

In Vienna, Austria, a pro-Palestinian crowd was shown on video cheering a fellow counter-demonstrator when he shouted at pro-Israel activists to ""stick the Holocaust up your ass!""

A longtime CNN contributor was caught tweeting, ""The world today needs a Hitler."" Turns out he had a history of nasty pro-Nazi, anti-Jewish postings.

A small pro-Israel rally in Toronto required police protection after pro-Palestine protesters attacked them.

In London, a pro-Palestinian convoy drove around the city screaming, ""F*** the Jews! F*** their daughters! F*** their mothers! Rape their daughters! We have to send a message!""

A famous Muslim actress tweeted a Hitler-esque quote: ""I would have killed all the Jews of the world ... but I kept some to show the world why I killed them.""

A mob of pro-Palestinian thugs who went around a Los Angeles neighborhood asking restaurant diners if they were Jewish were videoed beating up two Jewish men.

In New York City, pro-Israel protesters found themselves being sworn at — ""F*** you, Zionists!"" — and on the wrong end of a firework attack.

Facebook removed a popular pro-Israel prayer page with 75 million followers after Islamic radicals launched a ""cyber terrorism"" campaign on the page.

Beloved actress Gal Gadot (aka Wonder Woman) faced ugly, nasty responses for daring to be Jewish and issuing a call for peace in the Middle East.

Now a new video out of L.A. shows at least two cars waving Palestinian flags chasing down an unnamed man. The man running from the cars, who said he is Jewish, spoke with Fox News this week about the incident that happened Monday.

According to the victim, he was on his way home from synagogue when cars began speeding toward him, chasing him into a bank parking lot.



""I've taken this route a million times and I've never been afraid,"" he told Fox News. ""I was waiting by the light for it to change and suddenly I saw a bunch of cars coming and I see out of the corner of my eye they were waving the Palestinian flag. They started speeding up and I heard them chanting 'Allahu akbar.' That's when I started running for my life.""

Image source: Fox News video screenshot

""I ran as fast as I could,"" he added. ""They were picking up speed and I really thought they were going to run me over, that it would all be over.""



He told the outlet that he escaped by running back into the synagogue, praying all the way. When he entered the house of worship, he recruited others to help secure the entrances.

""I was petrified,"" he said. ""I just kept thinking, 'I'm a father of six and I want to come home to them tonight.' I thought they were going to kill me. My mind was racing.""

He told the outlet he was shocked to see this in America where freedom of religion is paramount.

""You'll never see any Jews in my community attacking pro-Palestinians in a residential neighborhood like you saw here. And yet, I don't feel safe walking around,"" he said.

The LAPD told Fox News the incident is under investigation and that they could not give specifics, but they assured the community they are aggressively searching for the perpetrators.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/surveillance-video-palestinian-cars-chasing-jewish-man-allah-akbar,2021-05-21
"Survey: GOP is concerned about policy issues, while Democrats are most concerned about 'Trump supporters'","A new survey found that while Republican voters are mostly concerned with policy issues, Democratic voters are primarily concerned with Trump supporters and the growth of various ""-isms"" in the country such as ""systemic racism"" and ""white nationalism.""

What are the details?

The survey, conducted by Echelon Insights last week, found that the top concern among Republican voters was illegal immigration, with 81% of respondents reporting that they are very concerned about the issue. Following behind is the lack of support for police in the country, with 79% being very concerned, and high taxes, an issue that 77% said they were very concerned about.

Republicans also did express concern over issues not necessarily related to specific policy — such as liberal bias in the media, the general moral decline of the country, and socialism — but those concerns did not top the list.

Among Democratic voters, however, non-policy-related issues were of greatest concern. In fact, the No. 1 ""problem"" causing concern for Democratic respondents was not an issue at all, but a group of people — Donald Trump supporters — at 82%.

Moreover, given Trump's popularity within the Republican Party at-large, you might as well refer to Trump supporters as Republican voters. In the 2020 presidential election, more than 74 million Americans voted for Trump.

Following behind Trump supporters, Democratic respondents listed white nationalism and systemic racism as the issues they are most concerned about at 79% and 77%, respectively.

Commenting on the survey results on Twitter, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro noted that many of the consequent concerns among Democrats, were ""rooted in slanderous notions about Republicans."" You might include issues such as ""domestic terrorism,"" ""police brutality,"" ""discrimination against LGBTQ Americans,"" and ""sexism"" in that list along with ""white nationalism"" and ""systemic racism.""



This writer's perspective

The aforementioned issues, again, have little do with policy, but rather are negative characteristics often associated with Republicans by Democratic lawmakers and members of the mainstream media.

What's more is the survey results indicate that for Democrats, though not necessarily Republicans, compromise is simply not an option. For example, in a hypothetical scenario where Democrats adopted a tougher approach to illegal immigration, Republicans would theoretically work across the aisle. However, Democrats would seemingly never work with Republicans on an issue because their problems are not necessarily with issues supported by Republicans but with Republicans themselves.

"Attempted murder suspect freed from jail after allegedly plowing through 25 LA sheriff's recruits and leaving behind 'bodies everywhere, bones sticking out and bleeding'","The driver accused of plowing through a large group of 75 law enforcement recruits in Los Angeles County on Wednesday has been named, charged, and released. Investigators now believe the incident to have been intentional.

Building an 'ironclad, iron proof' case

In a statement on Nov. 17, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department indicated that 22-year-old Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez was charged with attempted murder on peace officers and that additional charges were pending.

CNN reported that while investigators have strong suspicions that the suspect meant to inflict harm on the recruits, they first need to shore up those suspicions with substantial evidence.

Since the department is usually required to present a case to the district attorney within 48 hours of a suspect's arrest, they provisionally cut Gutierrez loose after his initial arrest. According to the Los Angeles Times, Gutierrez's original arrest was deemed a detention.

LASD Deputy Deanna Mares told CNN: ""It's not like they arrested the wrong suspect. ... They just want to make sure the investigation is going to be complete.""

Sgt. Gerardo Magos similarly suggested that there was ample evidence but that law enforcement just wanted ""to make sure it's properly presented.""

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva suggested that part of the reason investigators are taking more time is that they don't trust the leftist district attorney to do his job.

The sheriff told NewsNation, ""We operate under prosecutor George Gascón. We definitely have grave concerns about his ability to prosecute. We are actually going to provisionally release him (Gutierrez) until we can have the case ironclad, iron-proof, and submitted to the DA for filing consideration. Right now, we want to tie up all the loose ends on the case and then present it to the DA.""

Gutierrez is reportedly due in court on Friday.

A 'deliberate act'

Gutierrez allegedly drove 30 to 40 mph the wrong way up a street near the sheriff's STARS Center Academy in Whittier, California, where 75 sheriff's deputy recruits were jogging. The suspect is said to have mowed down 25 recruits, some of whom reportedly lost limbs.



Twenty of the victims are with the LASD; two are with the Glendale PD; two are with the Bell PD; and one is with the Pasadena PD.

The Independent reported that were it not for a light pole, even more people could have been injured.

Captain Pat MacDonald said, ""Thank God for that light pole, because the vehicle ultimately hit it and stopped, as opposed to possibly hitting more recruits.""

Five recruits were left in critical condition. According to the Los Angeles Times, over a dozen others suffered ""life-altering"" injuries of varying severity.

Villanueva described the aftermath to NewsNation: ""It was a bedlam, chaos, you know, there were bodies everywhere, bones sticking out and bleeding profusely. It was a pretty traumatic scene.""

""In fact, the paramedics that were there had never seen something of that scale. It was almost like an airplane accident, but everyone was alive, thankfully,"" added Villanueva.

As of Thursday night, seven recruits were reportedly still in the hospital, two of whom remained in critical condition.

The LASD noted that homicide investigators would present the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office on Friday for filing considerations.

Villanueva believes the vehicular attack to have been a ""deliberate act.""

In one video of the incident caught on a nearby security camera, it appears as though the suspect oriented his vehicle toward the victims:

The sheriff said on Wednesday that there were no skid marks at the scene, suggestive of a failure or a refusal to apply the brakes when driving toward the recruits. After allegedly mowing down the prospective deputies, Gutierrez allegedly remained in the Honda CR-V with his foot still on the accelerator.

A field sobriety test indicated that Gutierrez was not drunk on the morning of the brutal incident. The Los Angeles Times indicated that marijuana may have been recovered from the suspect's vehicle.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/suspect-accused-of-plowing-through-25-la-sheriffs-recruits-freed-from-jail-despite-attempted-murder-charges,2022-11-18
Suspect stabs Pentagon police officer to death at transit station: report,"A Pentagon police officer is dead after a suspect stabbed him to death outside the Pentagon Metro entrance on Tuesday morning, NBC News reported.

On Wednesday, WBAL-TV reported that the late officer was identified as Officer George Gonzalez, a New York native and Army veteran who previously served in Iraq.

What are the details?

The suspect, identified by the Associated Press as 27-year-old Austin William Lanz of Georgia, reportedly stabbed the police officer in the neck multiple times during an incident that took place at 10:37 a.m.

Gonzalez was able to fire on the assailant after the stabbing took place, and the suspect died at the scene after additional responding law enforcement officials began firing.

According to the report, ""the ensuing violence, which included a volley of gunshots, resulted in 'several casualties,'"" and officers said they believe two bystanders were injured in the attack.

During an afternoon briefing, Pentagon Police Chief Woodrow Kusse said that the scene, which prompted a lockdown, was quickly secured following the incident.

Kusse declined to provide what the outlet said was ""basic information"" about how the Tuesday morning violence unfolded or even how many deaths occurred as a result of the attack, and would only say that ""gunfire was exchanged.""

""Kusse and other officials declined to rule out terrorism or provide any other potential motive,"" the report continued.

""I can't compromise the ongoing investigation,"" Kusse added in his remarks during the press conference.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the attack.

What else?

In a statement, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency said it ""mourns the tragic loss of a Pentagon Police Officer, killed during this morning's incident at the Pentagon bus platform.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Officer's family,"" the statement added, according to NBC News.

In a statement on the officer's murder, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered flags to be flown at half-staff.

""This fallen officer died in the line of duty,"" Austin said, ""helping protect the tens of thousands of people who work in — and who visit — the Pentagon on a daily basis.""

Austin's statement continued, ""He and his fellow officers are members of the Pentagon family, and known to us all as professional, skilled, and brave. This tragic death today is a stark reminder of the dangers they face and the sacrifices they make. We are forever grateful for that service and the courage with which it is rendered.""

The Associated Press reported that Georgia authorities arrested Lanz in April on criminal trespassing and burglary charges. That same day, the report added, a separate criminal case was filed against the suspect with six additional charges including two counts of aggravated battery on police, a count of making a terrorist threat, and a charge for rioting in a penal institution.

On Wednesday morning, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency tweeted about Gonzalez's murder, writing, ""End of Watch Aug. 3, 2021. Last night, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency observed End of Watch for Pentagon Police Officer George Gonzalez who was tragically killed yesterday during the incident at the Pentagon bus platform.""

""A native of Brooklyn, New York, he was a die-hard Yankees fan. He was a graduate of New York City's Canarsie High School. George Gonzalez joined the @PFPAOfficial as a police officer on July 22, 2018,"" the statement continued. ""As a Pentagon Police officer, he took our mission of 'protecting those who protect our nation' to heart. He was promoted twice and attained the rank of Senior Officer in 2020.""

""A gregarious officer, he was well-liked and respected by his fellow officers,"" the post added. ""As a military and police veteran, Officer Gonzalez had served previously with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Transportation Security Administration, and United States Army. He was awarded the Army Commendation Medal for his service in Iraq. Officer Gonzalez embodied our values of integrity and service to others. As we mourn the loss of Officer Gonzalez, our commitment to serve and protect is stronger. Officer Gonzalez's family is in our thoughts and prayers. May he rest in peace.""

Illegal alien with MS-13 ties arrested for rape and murder of 20-year-old American autistic woman,"Maryland police announced Thursday that a 17-year-old illegal alien has been arrested for the July 2022 murder of 20-year-old Kayla Hamilton.

Hamilton's body was found in a mobile home at the Rancho Estates on E. Inca Street in Aberdeen on July 27.

The Aberdeen Police Department indicated that the victim was autistic and had recently moved to the area from Norfolk, Virginia, with her 22-year-old boyfriend whom police have clarified had nothing to do with the crime.

The Maryland chief medical examiner determined that the cause of death was strangulation.



""The Hamilton family, the community and the police department were distraught because it was a very senseless act,"" said APD Lt. William Reiber. ""Homicides don’t happen often in Aberdeen, so when this happens, people ask why.”

According to the APD, Hamilton's suspected murderer is a criminal noncitizen from El Salvador in the U.S. illegally, whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection have verified is a member of the terroristic gang Malva Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13).



The APD noted the suspect's DNA was compared to evidence recovered at the crime scene by the Maryland State Police Forensic Sciences Division. The test results were evidently more than enough to secure an arrest warrant for first degree murder.

On Jan. 15, the criminal noncitizen was arrested in Edgewood, Maryland.

The illegal alien believed responsible for Hamilton's death is being held without bail at the Harford County Detention Center. He has reportedly been charged with first- and second-degree murder, a third-degree sex offense, robbery, assault and theft.



Reiber said the criminal noncitizen's arrest helped ensure that Kayla ""just wasn’t a number ... That this meant something.""

Hamilton's mother, Tammy Nobles, told CBS, ""I'm her mother, I’m supposed to be there to protect her, but you can’t protect your kids when they’re adults. ... But, I just feel responsible. I was supposed to keep her safe.”



The job of keeping Americans safe is made more difficult by the ease with which foreign criminals can steal into the nation.

ICE indicated that so far this fiscal year, over 717,660 illegal aliens have stolen across the border. Over four million illegal aliens were encountered at the border in the previous two fiscal years.

Over 12,000 criminal noncitizens were arrested last year on suspicion of having committed various serious crimes. 62 were convicted for murder and over 365 were convicted for sexual offenses.

In fiscal year 2021, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations arrested ""12,025 individuals with aggravated felony convictions. Offenses associated with noncitizens arrested in FY 2021 included 1,506 homicide related offenses, 3,415 sexual assaults, 19,549 assaults, 2,717 robberies and 1,063 kidnappings.""

ICE recently announced that they had apprehended twice-deported MS-13 gangster Herberth Bonilla-Garcia, on El Salvador's top 100 list of most-wanted criminals, in Virginia on Dec. 1.



Next week, MS-13 gangster Kareem Ernesto Leiva, 37, will be tried next week for torturing a little boy in California in a horrific fashion before allegedly slaying the 10-year-old. Leiva, similarly in the U.S. illegally, was also accused of battering women and stabbing a fellow inmate while in jail.

The Department of Justice stated on Dec. 19 that Ms-13, ""one of the largest street gangs in the United States, is a national and international gang composed primarily of immigrants or descendants from El Salvador and other central American countries.""

MS-13 has ""mottos consistent with its rules, beliefs, expectations, and reputation including 'mata, viola, controla,' which translates as, 'kill, rape, control,' and 'ver, oir y callar,' which means, 'see nothing, hear nothing and say nothing,"" the DOJ reported. ""One of the principal rules of MS-13 is that its members must attack and kill rivals, often referred to as 'chavalas,' whenever possible.""

Editor's note: This article has been corrected to state that the suspect has been charged with first- and second-degree murder, not first- and second-degree rape.

"Eric Swalwell sues Trump and allies over Capitol riot, says he's suffering from 'severe emotional distress'","Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California is suing former President Donald Trump and his allies over the Capitol riot. Swalwell claims that the unrest in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 caused him to suffer from ""severe emotional distress.""

The civil lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Washington, alleges that Trump and his allies are ""responsible for the injury and destruction"" from the riot at the U.S. Capitol. The suit targets Trump, his personal attorney Rudy Guiliani, Donald Trump Jr., and Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama for their alleged roles in January's violence at the Capitol.

""Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., his advisor Rudy Giuliani, and Congressman Mo Brooks, together with many others, defiled that sacrament through a campaign of lies and incendiary rhetoric, which led to the sacking of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,"" the lawsuit reads.

The 65-page complaint claims that the defendants engaged in ""conspiracy to violate civil rights,"" ""neglect to prevent interference with civil rights,"" ""incitement to riot,"" ""inciting assault,"" ""disorderly conduct,"" and ""terrorism.""

""In claiming for weeks that President Biden's victory was in fact the largest act of fraud in American history; in seeing that some of Trump's supporters were willing to engage in violence in response to such claims; and in using highly inflammatory language in repeating the false claims of fraud at the rally before sending the crowd to the Capitol, the Defendants at a minimum acted negligently,"" the complaint alleges.

The suit alleges that the defendants ""by force, intimidation, or threat, agreed and conspired among themselves and with others to prevent members of Congress, including the Plaintiff, and Vice President Mike Pence from counting the Electoral College Votes and certifying President Biden and Vice President Harris as the winners of the 2020 presidential election.""

The lawsuit also sues all four defendants for ""infliction of emotional distress"" over the Capitol riot.

""Defendants intentionally, or at a minimum recklessly, caused the severe emotional distress suffered by the Plaintiff in connection with the January 6 attack,"" the complaint states. ""Defendants are furthermore vicariously liable for, and aided and abetted, the rioters' negligent infliction of emotional distress upon the Plaintiff.""

The lawsuit claims that Swalwell ""took off his jacket and tie"" to prepare to engage in a physical altercation against the crowd who had infiltrated the Capitol building.

""The Plaintiff prepared himself for possible hand-to-hand combat as he took off his jacket and tie and searched for makeshift instruments of self-defense,"" the lawsuit claims. ""He listened in shock as the House Chaplain — a veteran of war herself — began praying for the members from the Rostrum. As the Plaintiff watched this horror unfold, he texted with his wife in what he felt could be his last moments, telling her 'I love you very much. And our babies.'""



The lawsuit seeks monetary damages against the defendants, including punitive damages.

Trump spokesman Jason Miller told Reuters that Swalwell ""is a low-life with no credibility.""

Swalwell served as one of the impeachment managers prosecuting Trump, who argued that the former president incited violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6. The Senate voted to acquit Trump on Feb. 13.

Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, filed a lawsuit last month against Trump, Giuliani, the Proud Boys, and Oath Keepers over for allegedly conspiring to incite the Capitol riots.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/swalwell-sues-trump-capitol-riot-distress,2021-03-05
Taliban allegedly executes Afghan folk singer days after terror group declares 'music is forbidden in Islam',"The Taliban executed an Afghan folk singer just days after the terrorist group declared ""music is forbidden in Islam,"" the New York Post reported, citing the singer's family.

The Post noted that Fawad Andarabi's family told the Associated Press that he was shot dead Friday when ""enforcers returned to his home after earlier searching it and even drinking tea with him.""

""They shot him in the head on the farm,"" the folk singer's son, Jawad, said of his father's execution in the Andarabi Valley after which he was named, the paper reported.

""He was innocent, a singer who only was entertaining people,"" Andarabi's son said, the Post noted, adding that the folk singer also played a bowed lute called a ghichak and sang traditional songs about his country.

More from the paper:

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the AP that the insurgents would investigate the incident, but had no other details on the killing in the area about 60 miles north of Kabul.



It came just days after Mujahid told the New York Times that music was being outlawed, just as it had been during the group's brutal rule from 1996 until 2001.



""Music is forbidden in Islam,"" Mujahid told the paper, while insisting, ""We're hoping that we can persuade people not to do such things, instead of pressuring them.""



Afghanistan's former interior minister, Masoud Andarabi — who is not related — shared footage of the singer performing, saying he was ""brutally killed"" simply for ""bringing joy to this valley and its people.""

""Taliban's brutality continues in Andarab. Today they brutally killed folkloric singer, Fawad Andarabi who simply was brining [sic] joy to this valley and its people,"" Masoud Andarabi tweeted. ""As he sang here 'our beautiful valley….land of our forefathers…' will not submit to Taliban's brutality.""

Anything else?

Karima Bennoune — the United Nations special rapporteur on cultural rights — said she felt ""grave concern"" in regard to Andarabi's killing, the Post reported.

""We call on governments to demand the Taliban respect the #humanrights of #artists,"" she tweeted, according to the paper.

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, tweeted in regard to Andarabi's reported execution that ""there is mounting evidence that the Taliban of 2021 is the same as the intolerant, violent, repressive Taliban of 2001. 20 years later. Nothing has changed on that front.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-allegedly-executes-afghan-folk-singer-days-after-terror-group-declares-music-is-forbidden-in-islam,2021-08-31
30 Taliban militants killed during bomb-making class in mosque when bomb accidentally explodes,"Taliban militants learning how to make bombs and improvised explosive devices were killed in a massive explosion when a bomb was accidentally ignited.

At least 30 militants were killed in the blast Saturday, according to Khaama Press, the Afghan news agency.

The incident unfolded in the village of Qultaq in Dowlatabad district of Balkh province in the northern region of Afghanistan.

The Afghan National Army said in a statement that six foreign nationals were included in the death toll, but the explosion was so massive that they could not be identified from the remains.

Khaama Press reported that two children were killed by an EID planted by the Taliban in a village in Kunduz province.

The Taliban signed a peace treaty with former President Donald Trump in February 2020, signaling the end of the longest war in U.S. history, the Afghanistan War. A month later, U.S. officials said that the Taliban did not intend to abide by the terms in the peace deal.

""We recognize that America shouldn't fight in perpetuity in the graveyard of empires if we can help Afghans forge peace,"" said Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state at the time.

The deal set a deadline in May by which all U.S. troops would be removed from Afghanistan, but that was dependent on the Taliban relinquishing all ties to the al-Qaeda terror group. President Joe Biden has not indicated whether he would honor the commitment made by his presidential predecessor.

NATO is also reportedly mulling over when to pull troops, which number about 9,600, out of Afghanistan. Some are calling for a delay in the exit in order to prevent more bloodshed and chaos.

The Taliban has promised that the violence would continue in Afghanistan until the U.S. withdrew from the nation.

Report: Taliban could conquer Afghanistan capital within 90 days as Biden pulls US troops,"U.S. intelligence estimates that the Taliban could take over Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul, within 90 days as the radical Islamist group continues its sweeping conquest of the northern part of the country, according to a report.

Reuters reported that Taliban forces have taken control of 65% of Afghanistan, now occupying eight provincial capitals and within reach of taking three more. A U.S. intelligence assessment found that Kabul could be isolated within the next 30 days.

Speaking to Reuters, an anonymous defense official said it is not a ""foregone conclusion"" that the Taliban will take control of Kabul, observing that Afghan security forces can still resist the insurgents.

""It was not immediately clear if this was consensus view of the intelligence community or if different intelligence agencies had different views, which would not be uncommon,"" Reuters reported.

The speed with which the Taliban has rapidly exerted control of the country since President Joe Biden began withdrawing U.S. forces has stunned military and national security officials, Axios reported Wednesday, though the president intends to complete the withdrawal of U.S. troops by Aug. 31.

""Senior U.S. officials privately express little confidence in the Afghan security forces, citing military incompetence, disorganization and poor communications skills rendering them unable to adequately coordinate U.S. air support to protect territory against the Taliban,"" Axios reported.

On Tuesday, the Taliban overran three towns and a day later forced hundreds of Afghan soldiers to surrender near the provincial capital of Kunduz, the Washington Post reported. Taliban fighters received supplies and equipment from the Afghan soldiers, who were promised they would not be harmed in exchange for their surrender.

""I don't know why the commanders did not gather their forces and fight until the last drop of their blood, with all the guns, resources and ammunition they had in the airport and the corps,"" Zargul Alemi, a member of the Kunduz provincial council who fled the province before the soldiers surrendered, said.

She told the Post that the Taliban were given Humvees, weapons, and other supplies after the soldiers gave up the fight.

The U.S. is still supporting Afghan forces with airstrikes, but Biden's troop withdrawal is progressing with the goal of going to zero American soldiers in combat by September.

Despite the Taliban's gains, Biden told reporters Tuesday, ""I do not regret my decision"" to withdraw from Afghanistan.

""We spent over a trillion dollars, over 20 years. We trained and equipped with modern equipment over 300,000 Afghan forces ... they've got to fight for themselves,"" the president said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-conquer-afghanistan-capital-90-days,2021-08-11
Taliban hunts down and kills Afghan sniper who helped British Army and was abandoned after disastrous America-led pullout: 'Entirely predictable this would happen',"President Joe Biden's much-maligned pullout of U.S. personnel from Afghanistan that stranded Americans and American allies in the region also forced international allies to make similar moves. And now the world is learning just how dangerous the retreat was for many of the stranded Afghans who helped the West in the fight against the Taliban and terrorism in the South Asian country.

A Tuesday report from the Times of London told the tragic story of an Afghan sniper who was trained by and served with British special forces and was then left behind when the Biden-instigated pullout chaos ensued.

The Taliban executed the Afghan sniper, identified only as ""N"" in order to protect his relatives, the Times said. He was ""shot multiple times in front of his family in Kabul,"" former British Army Col. Ash Alexander-Cooper told the paper.

Alexander-Cooper, who served with ""N"" on the same operations and served eight tours in Afghanistan, said the 28-year-old man was the father of five and had been hiding in the capital city but was found and killed Monday. The murdered Afghan was part of a British-trained ""elite unit"" who had fought on the front line.

The colonel told the Times that authorities should have seen this coming.

""It was entirely predictable this would happen for all of those left behind who were given no guidance,"" he said. ""He's been in hiding because of the threat he faced but they found him and he was shot multiple times, executed in front of his family.""

Alexander-Cooper posted a censored photo of ""N"" to Twitter on Monday, with a warning that the world could expect more of this kind of horror from the Taliban.

""For those leaders still unsure, this is not a game,"" he wrote. ""'N' was a executed by the Taliban in cold blood just a few hours ago. His crime? Years of loyal & professional service, mentored by British units. There is no 'amnesty'. Abandoned by us, this murder will not be the last.""

""Murdered in front of his family, he is survived by his wife & 5 children under the age of 9, the youngest of which was only 10 days old,"" the colonel wrote in a subsequent tweet. ""This is the reality of the 'new Taliban'. Talk of inclusivity, diversity & amnesty is a joke & some are falling for it. Wake up.""

Another source, former Afghan interpreter Rafi Hottak who now lives in the U.K., told the Times that ""N"" was on a list Hottak had compiled of 700 Afghans who wanted to go to England but had ultimately been left behind. He confirmed to the Times that ""N"" was indeed a sniper and a member of the U.K.-trained elite unit of Afghans known as CF333.

According to Hottak, he had been ""asking the UK government for years and especially in recent months to evacuate all those who served alongside the British forces as they were their eyes and ears.""

Since the pullout ended, the British government has been telling Afghans eligible for resettlement in the U.K. to make their way to third countries, but for many, the journey is too dangerous, the Times said.

The Ministry of Defense said the nation's forces were able to get 15,000 people out of Kabul during the pullout and that the ""commitment to Afghanistan and those who supported our mission there endures.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-hunts-down-kills-afghan-who-helped-british,2021-09-14
"Former Afghan official says Taliban is killing children and the elderly, posts graphic photos of reported victims","The man who was recently the interior minister for Afghanistan under now-former President Ashraf Ghani alleged on Twitter this week that the Taliban is currently killing Afghan children and elderly citizens. He also inncluded graphic photos of purported child victims of the terror group.

As things in Afghanistan continue to deteriorate under the Taliban following President Joe Biden's disastrous policy of pulling out of the South Asian country while negotiating and relying upon the goodwill of the terrorist organization, Masoud Andarabi, the onetime government official dismissed by the former Afghan president, posted a stark notice to the social media site.

""Taliban are trying to rule over people by terrorizing, killing young children and elderly citizens,"" Andarabi wrote. ""Taliban can not govern the nation by such actions. In Andarab, taliban [sic] have been carrying out unwarranted searches of homes, capturing people without reason or justification and killing innocent citizens.""

""As a result,"" he continued, ""people have had to rise against their brutality to protect their lives, honor, dignity and property.""

Included with the messages were heartbreaking photos of a baby and children who were allegedly beaten and killed by the Taliban.

You can read the original tweets here, as well as see the photos he attached to the post. WARNING: The photos are graphic and disturbing.

Insight on the fall

Andarabi was fired from his post of interior minister by Ghani back in March, Reuters reported, during a series of attacks against Afghan security forces.

One official reportedly told the outlet that Andarabi ""had failed to arrest a militia commander whose forces shot down a helicopter in central Wardak province ... killing nine security force members."" Andarabi, the unnamed official said, had been ordered to arrest the militia member weeks earlier for his involvement in multiple other attacks against Afghan forces.

However, according to ""India Today,"" Andarabi was removed by Ghani after warning against a hasty retreat by U.S. forces in the decimated country.

During an interview with ""India Today,"" the former minister told viewers that the country still has a chance to avoid a ""very dark future,"" but it will require changing current policies that will leave Afghanistan alone.

""This was a classic miscalculation of the active government, particularly the national security council and president's advisers,"" Andarabi said of the now-defunct Ghani government, adding, ""They really misplayed it.""

Taliban kills Afghan pregnant police officer front of family,"Taliban militants shot and killed a pregnant police officer in front of her family in Afghanistan, the BBC reports.

The woman, who was identified as Banu Negar by local media, was reportedly murdered in front of her children and husband on Saturday outside the family's home in Firozkoh, the capital of central Ghor province. Negar allegedly worked at the local prison, and she was eight months pregnant when she was executed.

Three sources told the BBC that three Taliban gunmen entered Negar's home and searched it before tying members of the family up.

""Relatives supplied graphic images showing blood spattered on a wall in the corner of a room and a body, the face heavily disfigured,"" according to the BBC.

The Taliban denied any involvement in Negar's death and told the BBC that they are investigating the murder.

""We are aware of the incident and I am confirming that the Taliban have not killed her, our investigation is ongoing,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said.



Mujahid blamed the murder on ""personal enmity or something else"" and noted that the Taliban already announced it would grant amnesty for people who worked for the previous government of Afghanistan.

Last month, Mujahid promised the new government would offer full amnesty to Afghans who worked for the previous U.S.-backed administration, the Associated Press reported. ""Nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped,"" he said.

Mujahid also said the new Taliban government would honor women's rights within the Islamic law, but did not provide specifics.



However, there have already been several disturbing reports that dispute the claim of a more inclusive Taliban regime.

Last month, there was a report that Taliban militants hunted down journalists and other dissidents in house-to-house revenge searches to kill them.

Also in August, the Taliban reportedly murdered a woman for not wearing a burqa on the same day the group promised to honor women's rights.

Taliban enforcers purportedly executed Afghan folk singer Fawad Andarabi days after the radical Islamic organization declared that ""music is forbidden in Islam.""

In July, an Afghan mother of four was brutally killed by Taliban militants because she was too poor to feed soldiers, according to CNN.

Amnesty International said the Taliban viciously tortured and ""massacred"" several members of the Hazara ethnic minority in July.



On Monday, the Taliban claimed they had taken control of the Panjshir province, north of Kabul, which had been the last holdout of anti-Taliban forces in the country. However, rebel forces contend they are still fighting.

The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan's account wrote on Twitter, ""Taliban's claim of occupying Panjshir is false. The NRF forces are present in all strategic positions across the valley to continue the fight.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-kills-pregnant-mother-afghanistan,2021-09-06
Taliban spokesman claims 'There is no evidence' Osama bin Laden was involved in 9/11 terror attacks,"During an interview with NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Ricard Engel, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed that ""there is no evidence"" that Osama bin Laden was involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks executed against the U.S.

Engel noted that the war began when bin Laden orchestrated the terror attacks while he was a guest of the Taliban. The reporter then asked: ""Can you guarantee that this country will never again be a base for terrorism?""

""Although there was no proof he was involved, now we have given promises that Afghan soil won't be used against anyone,"" Mujahid said. The outlet's report included translations of the man's remarks.

Engel pressed the issue: ""You still don't think that Osama bin Laden carried out 9/11?""

""There is no evidence, even after 20 years of war, we have no proof he was involved,"" Mujahid responded.

Fox News noted that in a message released in 2004 bin Laden admitted that he had ordered the terror attacks. He was killed by the U.S. in 2011 in Pakistan.



During the infamous 9/11 attacks, hijackers crashed commercial aircraft into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, and into the Pentagon building in Washington, D.C. The Twin Towers eventually collapsed. Another plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field following a passenger revolt, according to Fox News.

""The 9/11 attack was driven by Usama Bin Ladin,"" according to the 9/11 Commission Report executive summary.

""As final preparations were under way during the summer of 2001, dissent emerged among al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan over whether to proceed. The Taliban's chief, Mullah Omar, opposed attacking the United States. Although facing opposition from many of his senior lieutenants, Bin Ladin effectively overruled their objections, and the attacks went forward,"" the summary stated.

The Biden administration has been facing significant criticism for bungling U.S. efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan, where the Taliban has swiftly seized control, taking over the capital city of Kabul earlier this month. The U.S. is currently scrambling to evacuate citizens and others from the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-spokesman-claims-there-is-no-evidence-osama-bin-laden-was-responsible-for-9-11-terror-attacks,2021-08-26
Ted Cruz gets FBI director to make 'astonishing' admission about agent who was in charge during Whitmer kidnapping plot investigation,"FBI Director Christopher Wray admitted Thursday the FBI agent in-charge of the Washington, D.C., field office is the same agent who was in charge of the Detroit field office when the FBI allegedly uncovered a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D).

What are the details?

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) pressed Wray over whether the same FBI agent who was in charge during the Whitmer incident is now in charge of the Jan. 6 investigations.

The alleged plot by far-right militia members to kidnap Whitmer has tarnished the FBI because many of the defendants essentially accuse the FBI of entrapment. To date, none of the defendants in the case have been convicted of any crime. Some have been acquitted at trial, while others are awaiting a new trial after a mistrial.

""The special agent in charge of that case has now been sent to D.C. to the Washington, D.C., office and now leads the investigation regarding January 6. Is that correct? Cruz asked.

""The name of the individual is Steven D’Antuono. He was run out of the FBI Detroit field office,"" Cruz added.

After back-and-forth about another matter — regarding a lead FBI agent involved in the Whitmer investigation who was fired last year after he allegedly assaulted his wife — Wray answered Cruz's question.

""To clarify the first part of your question, Mr. D’Antuono was the special agent in charge of the Detroit field office and is now the assistant director in charge of the Washington field office,"" Wray explained.

""So the guy in charge got promoted and is now in charge of the January 6 investigation?"" Cruz followed up.

""The guy in charge of the whole Detroit field office is now in charge of the whole Washington field office,"" Wray clarified.

""That is astonishing,"" Cruz shot back.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-chris-wray-agent-whitmer-plot-jan-6,2022-08-04
Ted Cruz and John Brennan battle on Twitter over Logan Act,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former CIA director John Brennan traded barbs regarding the killing of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.

""This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict,"" Brennan wrote on Twitter. ""Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits.""



""I do not know whether a foreign government authorized or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh,"" Brennan continued. ""Such an act of state-sponsored terrorism would be a flagrant violation of international law & encourage more governments to carry out lethal attacks against foreign officials.""

""These assassinations are far different than strikes against terrorist leaders & operatives of groups like al-Qaida & Islamic State, which are not sovereign states,"" he tweeted. ""As illegitimate combatants under international law, they can be targeted in order to stop deadly terrorist attacks.""

Cruz reacted by saying, ""It's bizarre to see a former head of the CIA consistently side with Iranian zealots who chant 'Death to America.' And reflexively condemn Israel. Does Joe Biden agree?""

Brennan, who was director of the CIA between 2013 and 2017, retorted, ""It is typical for you to mischaracterize my comment.""

""Your lawless attitude & simple-minded approach to serious national security matters demonstrate that you are unworthy to represent the good people of Texas,"" Brennan said, besmirching the senator.

Cruz then hit back, by pointing out that Brennan voted for Gus Hall, a U.S. Communist Party candidate who only secured 0.07% of the vote in 1976.

""Gosh, I touched a nerve. Facts matter,"" Cruz tweeted. ""FACT 1: you've admitted, in 1976 you voted for the Communist candidate for President because, I guess, Jimmy Carter wasn't liberal enough for you.""

Then the Texas senator took aim at the Obama administration's cozy relationship with the Iranian government.

""FACT 2: you gave $150 Bn to Ayatollah Khamenei, knowing it would be used to kill Americans,"" Cruz said.

The two then exchanged blows about the Logan Act, which ""forbids private citizens from engaging in unauthorized correspondence with foreign governments,"" and nobody has been indicted on the legislation since 1852.

""@tedcruz is now misrepresenting the Logan Act. Apparently, he is a poor Senator & a bad lawyer,"" Brennan wrote. ""A private citizen publicly criticizing what could be a state-sponsored assassination of a government official & cautioning against retaliatory killing is called freedom of speech.""

""In contrast, an individual tapped to be National Security Advisor (but not yet one) in an incoming Administration who privately contacts a foreign government official & advises how to conduct relations with the U.S. could be in violation of the Logan Act,"" Brennan said.

""My commitment to Israel's security & my efforts to counter Iran's malign activities are well documented throughout my 33 years of national security work serving Republican & Democratic Administrations,"" Brennan stated, then attacked Cruz. ""Aside from his tiresome rhetoric, what has Senator Cruz ever done?""



Cruz fired back, ""Ok, let's apply your proffered standard: Ben Rhodes has publicly stated, 'foreign leaders are already having phone calls with Joe Biden, talking about the agenda they're going to pursue on Jan. 20.' Does that mean you think Joe Biden should be prosecuted under the Logan Act?""

""The only coherent answer is NO, neither Biden nor Gen. Flynn violated the Logan Act bc it's unconstitutional—which is why nobody has been convicted of violating it in the history of the US,"" Cruz contended. ""But you want to use it as a partisan cudgel, a weapon to attack your political opponents.""

Fakhrizadeh, who was considered the top architect of Iran's nuclear program, was gunned down in a road ambush in broad daylight on Friday. The black sedan the scientist was traveling in was riddled with bullets.



Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the assassination was ""an act of state terror,"" there were ""serious indications"" of Israeli involvement.

On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader promised to retaliate for the killing of Fakhrizadeh. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demanded that Iranian officials make a pledge into ""pursuing this crime and punishing its perpetrators and those who commanded it.""

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani vowed that the Islamic republic ""will respond in time to the assassination of Martyr Fakhrizadeh.""



""Once again, the evil hands of Global Arrogance and the Zionist mercenaries were stained with the blood of an Iranian son,"" Rouhani added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-john-brennan-iran-logan-act,2020-11-28
Teen McDonald's employee leaps through drive-through window to save choking customer,"A 15-year-old McDonald's employee executed a dramatic rescue after a customer began choking in her vehicle, which was idling outside the restaurant's drive-through window.

What are the details?

Sydney Raley of Edina, Minnesota, said that her Saturday shift at the chain restaurant's Eden Prairie location began uneventfully, just like many others.

She told CNN that the day had been fairly routine, ""making coffee, making drinks. Going into the lunch rush, it was all normal.""

Sydney told KARE-TV that all changed as she was handing food out through the service window and a woman in apparent distress caught her eye.

""I noticed that she was coughing profusely and her daughter just had this look on her face like sheer terror,"" the teen recalled. ""I could tell oh, crap, she’s choking! Just seeing that visceral reaction I knew we need to act fast.""

Sydney said that she jumped out of the window and helped the woman out of the car while telling the woman's young daughter to call 911.

""I started doing the Heimlich maneuver, but I’m not really strong so it didn’t work the first couple times,"" the 15-year-old hero continued — and that's when she called over a bystander who was parked in the lot waiting for food.

The bystander, who remains unnamed at the time of this reporting, was able to successfully dislodge a chicken nugget from the panicked woman's throat.

Police said that the teen's quick-thinking bravery earned her two fresh $50 bills from the responding officers.

""Our crime fund gave every officer fifty dollars to hand out to wherever we feel the need, [including] if somebody did outstanding work, above and beyond,"" Sgt. Scott Mittelstadt told KARE. ""She is well-deserving of that money.""

Sydney added, ""It could’ve ended a lot worse but I am super thankful for that bystander who helped so much. Because I am decent at first aid, but if it weren’t for him and our efforts together, it could’ve ended so much worse.""

'She can remember anything — do anything'

Sydney's parents, Tom and Stephanie, told the outlet that their daughter was diagnosed with autism when she was younger and that her condition has only enhanced her abilities for quick thinking.

""I always tell her she has a gift, because she's autistic,"" Tom told the station. ""She can remember anything — do anything. It's crazy.""

Stephanie added, ""She remembered all of the [first aid] training as a script in her head and was able to jump into action right away, just because it was stored up there and she can recall anything she reads and hears.""

Sydney said that she feels accomplished and emboldened to serve her fellow man.

""You feel as though like — huh — I’m actually capable of contributing to society and actually like capable of making a difference.""

Tom told CNN that his daughter and her autism diagnosis are nothing short of inspiring.

""We always worried it was going to be a challenge for her, and it's done a complete 180,"" he said. ""It's actually been a blessing and a gift at this point. All the things we worried about never happened.""

'Sydney truly personifies what it is to be a hero'

Franchise owner-operator Paul Ostergaard told CNN that he and the rest of the staff couldn't be more proud of Sydney and her heroism.

""We are incredibly proud of Sydney and her quick, heroic actions over the weekend to help one of our valued customers,"" Ostergaard told CNN in a written statement. ""Sydney truly personifies what it is to be a hero and we are incredibly lucky to have her as a highly-valued crew member at our Eden Prairie restaurant location. We are excited to see all of the well-deserved recognition she has received from the community and will continue to celebrate her courageous efforts of literally jumping out of the drive-thru window to provide aid to a customer in need.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teen-mcdonalds-employee-leaps-through-drive-thru-window-to-save-choking-customer,2021-12-21
"Teen sat on video of popular classmate saying N-word, waited to release it to ruin her college career","In a shocking story published by the New York Times on Saturday, a biracial teenager admitted he has no regrets for holding on to an old video of a high school classmate using a racial slur, only to make it public when it would cause her the most damage.

What are the details?

Last year, Jimmy Galligan, 18, was sent a video of Heritage High School classmate Mimi Groves, who is white and was the captain of the varsity cheerleading team, repeating the N-word while singing along to a rap song. The video was three years old, taken when Groves was just a freshman.

Galligan said he never saw the video prior to receiving it, but he immediately devised a plan to make Groves pay for her transgression. ""I wanted to get her where she would understand the severity of that word,"" he told the newspaper.

And so that's exactly what Galligan did.



After George Floyd's murder in May, Groves, who had just made the cheerleading team at the University of Tennessee, urged her friends on Instagram to support the Black Lives Matter movement.

Galligan then seized the moment, exploiting the racial unrest caused by Floyd's murder to make Groves pay. On the same afternoon that Groves posted in support of Black Lives Matter, Galligan posted the video of Groves using the N-word on social media, triggering a social media firestorm.

As the Times reported, the backlash against Groves was swift:

Once the video went viral, the backlash was swift, and relentless. A photograph of Ms. Groves, captioned with a racial slur, also began circulating online, but she and her parents say someone else wrote it to further tarnish her reputation. On social media, people tagged the University of Tennessee and its cheer team, demanding her admission be rescinded. Some threatened her with physical violence if she came to the university campus. The next day, local media outlets in Virginia and Tennessee published articles about the uproar.

...

The day after the video went viral, Ms. Groves tried to defend herself in tense calls with the university. But the athletics department swiftly removed Ms. Groves from the cheer team. And then came the call in which admissions officials began trying to persuade her to withdraw, saying they feared she would not feel comfortable on campus.

Groves, who, the Times emphasized, comes from an affluent family, has since enrolled at a local community college.

What did Galligan say about the controversy?

The young man told the Times he has no remorse for making Groves pay for her mistake. The Times positively reported Galligan's premeditated actions as holding Groves ""accountable.""

""If I never posted that video, nothing would have ever happened,"" Galligan said. ""I'm going to remind myself, you started something. You taught someone a lesson.""

Anything else?

Not all of Groves' classmates held the same vindictive attitude as Galligan.

When the social media firestorm against Groves erupted over the summer, one of Groves' friends, who is black, publicly defended her. Groves reportedly apologized to her friend for using the racial slur long before Groves was embroiled in controversy.

""We're supposed to educate people, not ruin their lives all because you want to feel a sense of empowerment,"" the friend said on social media.

Sadly, the friend then became the target of outrage and criticism, according to the Times.

What was the reaction?

After the Times published its story, Galligan was ridiculed online for his vindictive behavior. One person called him ""psychopathic,"" while others described his actions as ""malice posing as social justice.""

But perhaps conservative writer Rod Dreher said it best, noting how Galligan's actions will likely backfire on him in the future.

""This Times story will follow Jimmy Galligan everywhere too. If that kid applied for a job at my firm, I would never hire him. If he were my co-worker, I would stay away from him, lest I offend him and get the Little- Anthony-from-The-Twilight-Zone treatment. He has shown the kind of person he is: a hateful progressive who takes pleasure in causing others unnecessary pain and suffering for the sake of virtue. He wants to terrorize others. Everybody who goes to college with him now, and who crosses his path, should consider themselves forewarned,"" Dreher wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teen-video-classmate-saying-n-word,2020-12-28
Terrorism experts uncover glaring problem with successful strike against Ayman al-Zawahiri: 'Masks the undeniable truth',"The United States carried out a successful counterterrorism operation to kill top al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend.

But terrorism experts quickly pointed out the glaring problem with the operation: al-Zawahiri was targeted while standing on the balcony of a house in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the country in which Americans died for 20 years before President Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal one year ago.

What did experts say?

The successful operation was only possible because of the close relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda, which itself was only possible because of the collapse of the Afghanistan government last year.

According to expert terrorism analyst Bill Roggio, the narrative that al-Zawahiri's death was a counterterrorism success ""masks the undeniable truth that Taliban-controlled Afghanistan is a safe haven for al-Qaeda.""

That is because, as Roggio explained, al-Zawahiri was ""hiding"" in plain-sight, i.e., he was not hiding at all.

""Zawahiri was killed in the Sherpur neighborhood, in a home run by a deputy of Sirajuddin Haqqani. Sirajuddin is of course one of two deputy Taliban emirs as well as the interior minister,"" Roggio explained. ""Zawahiri could not operate in Afghanistan — particularly in Kabul — without the consent of the Taliban. He wasn't in the remote mountains of Kunar, Nuristan, or Nangarhar, or distant provinces of Ghazni, Helmand, or Kandahar. He was in the Taliban's capital.""

The tight-knit relationship between the Taliban and Al Qaeda is no secret.

In fact, a United Nations report from last month disclosed, ""Al-Qaida leadership reportedly plays an advisory role with the Taliban, and the groups remain close."" The report also admitted, ""Al-Qaida enjoys greater freedom in Afghanistan under Taliban rule.""

Meanwhile, terrorism analyst Ritz Katz echoed Roggio's reaction.

""That Zawahiri, after years of hiding and immense [operations security], was killed on a balcony in a wealthy downtown neighborhood of Kabul--it just shows what a drastic sense of empowerment al-Qaeda leadership has felt under Taliban-ruled Afghanistan,"" Ratz wrote on Twitter.

What did the US government say?

Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement blasting the Taliban for violating the Doha Agreement, which stipulated that al-Qaeda could not find a safe harbor in Afghanistan under Taliban control.

But Blinken did not say the Taliban would face any consequences for violating the controversial peace agreement.

""In the face of the Taliban’s unwillingness or inability to abide by their commitments, we will continue to support the Afghan people with robust humanitarian assistance and to advocate for the protection of their human rights, especially of women and girls,"" Blinken said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/terrorism-experts-problem-zawahiri-strike,2022-08-02
Man claiming to be Iranian faces terrorism charge after allegedly lighting his car on fire inside solar plant near Las Vegas,"A man disabled a large solar power plant in Las Vegas, Nevada, by setting his car on fire after breaking into the facility, according to police.

Las Vegas Metro police said they were called to the Mega Solar Array facility on Wednesday at about 11:30 a.m. after employees found a car smoldering in a generator pit.

Documents obtained by KLAS-TV said that the driver of the car was identified as 34-year-old Mohammad Mesmarian and that the car was registered in Idaho.

Investigators said that surveillance video showed Mesmarian setting fire to the car at 12:00 a.m. Wednesday after they suspect he had rammed the fence earlier on Tuesday afternoon. He reportedly sat in a chair and watched the car burn for about 15 minutes before walking away.

Police said they found the man at a campground on Boulder Beach at Lake Mead the next day about 30 miles away from the facility.

“Mesmarian clarified he burned the Toyota Camry a couple of days ago,” investigators wrote. “Mesmarian stated he burned the vehicle at a Tesla solar plant and did it ‘for the future.'”

Police also said he told them that he was born in Iran. Investigators found an iPhone in the car belonging to Mesmarian and also two laptops.

The solar array facility provides power to MGM properties but has been shut down due to the damage sustained in the attack.

A spokesperson for Invenergy, the company that runs the power plant, released a statement saying no one was injured in the incident.

“Following an incident at the Mega Solar Array facility, on-site personnel immediately notified authorities and shut down the plant’s operations as a precaution in accordance with industry-standard safety protocols,” the statement read.

Mesmarian was arrested on terrorism charges, including first-degree arson and third-degree arson, and denied bail.

Some critics online noted that the story did not appear to get as much coverage in the mainstream news as other, less important stories.

"Man who attacked police station after killing Lyft driver could have been 'inspired' by terrorism, FBI says","The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that a man who shot and killed a Lyft driver before attacking a police station could have been ""inspired"" by a foreign terrorist organization.

The revelation about the Sunday attack was made by Matthew DeSarno, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Dallas, in a media briefing on Monday.

Police said Imran Ali Rasheed, 32, shot and killed a Lyft driver and then took her car to the Plano Police Department and fired shots in the lobby. Police officers fired back at him and he died later from his injuries at a hospital.

""We have not found an indication at this point of the investigation, that Rasheed was either directed by or in contact with foreign terrorist organization actors,"" DeSarno said.

""We believe at this point he was inspired by, you know, rhetoric, and or propaganda by a foreign terrorist organization,"" he explained. ""We define 'inspired' as the lack of direction but the inspiration for the attack.""

Plano police said that they found a letter left in the Lyft car that they said led them to believe he was inspired by terrorism.

The FBI said Rasheed was likely acting alone and they don't believe other attacks were imminent.

Police identified the Lyft driver as Isabella Lewis, 26, and said that they didn't think she had any relation to Rasheed but that she was a random victim who was killed because she responded to his request for a Lyft ride.

The FBI said that Rasheed had previously been investigated as a possible terror threat in 2010 by the Dallas FBI counterterrorism team.

""Over the course of three years, all investigative steps were taken, that investigation has been reviewed,"" said DeSarno.

""I'm comfortable that the investigation was done thoroughly and properly,"" he added, ""and in 2013, after the exhaustion of all investigative steps, that investigation was closed when the case team determined that Rasheed at that time did not pose a threat.""

Plano Mayor John Muns released a statement praising the officers for limiting the bloodshed of the attack.

""What could have been a horrific tragedy was avoided, thanks to the swift and effective action of our Plano police officers,"" Muns said. ""I applaud the response of the officers who responded who stopped a dangerous situation from taking a deadly turn.""

DeSarno said the FBI investigation was still ongoing.

"DHS releases terrorism threat advisory, includes 'grievances' over COVID-19 restrictions","The Department of Homeland Security released an updated terrorism threat advisory on Friday ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that outlined the potential terrorism threats facing the U.S.

Included on the list is anti-government rhetoric and ""grievances over public health safety measures"" related to COVID-19.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The bulletin read:



The Homeland continues to face a diverse and challenging threat environment leading up to and following the 20th Anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks as well religious holidays we assess could serve as a catalyst for acts of targeted violence. These threats include those posed by domestic terrorists, individuals and groups engaged in grievance-based violence, and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists and other malign foreign influences.



These actors are increasingly exploiting online forums to influence and spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity. Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions.

The advisory goes on to state that ""anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists ... may seek to exploit the emergence of COVID-19 variants by viewing the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions across the United States as a rationale to conduct attacks. Pandemic-related stressors have contributed to increased societal strains and tensions, driving several plots by domestic violent extremists, and they may contribute to more violence this year.""

The Homeland Security bulletin also warns of ""non-specific calls for violence on multiple online platforms"" related to ""conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud and alleged reinstatement,"" a reference to some claims that former President Donald Trump will be reinstated as president.

However, according to NBC News correspondent Pete Williams, the advisory ""is not based on any actual threats or plots.""

"Texas GOP lawmaker refutes claims his bill would drop Ku Klux Klan, civil rights, and women's suffrage from curriculum","The author of a Texas bill that would restrict the teaching of critical race theory in schools said claims that his bill would strip lessons on the Ku Klux Klan, civil rights, and other topics from the state curriculum were outright false.

Sen. Bryan Hughes (R) responded to critics of his bill on ""The Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Wednesday, explaining that the legislation he's offering would not make a single change to requirements in Texas administrative code for the teaching of slavery, the civil rights movement, the Ku Klux Klan, and other topics Republicans have been accused of trying to ""cancel"" by passing bills banning critical race theory in schools.

""Anyone can go to Chapter 113, of the Texas administrative code. That's where our curriculum elements are found,"" Hughes told BlazeTV host Glenn Beck. ""Chapter 113, Texas administrative code. That's before my bill. That's after my bill. It's still there, and you will find many specific references to difficult subjects, like slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, eugenics. Things like the women's suffrage movement. A lot of that, Dr. King, we adore and look up to Dr. King so much. You'll find many references to him, to Susan B. Anthony, to the civil rights movement. The underground railroad. The very things -- the very things that we're accused of removing — are specifically set out in the curriculum standards today.""

Hughes' bill, S.B. 3, is legislation that would follow-up and amend a House bill signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) in May that restricts the teaching of critical race theory in schools. The law specifically prohibits teaching that one race or sex is inherently superior to another; that an individual, by virtue of race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously; that an individual bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of their race or sex; that the advent of slavery in the United States constituted the true founding of the nation; and other tenets of critical race theory that Republicans across the nation have sought to remove from school curriculums.

The House bill that became law was amended by Democrats to require teaching ""the history of white supremacy, including but not limited to the institution of slavery, the eugenics movement, and the Ku Klux Klan, and the ways in which it is morally wrong,"" along with readings related to ""the civic accomplishments of marginalized populations,"" including Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech and writings by Susan B. Anthony.

The Senate bill would amend the law to remove several of the specific requirements Democrats added, a change that Hughes explained was requested by teachers and the State Board of Education, who asked for the law to cover broad topics and let schools decide which specific documents they should teach.

But a report from the Huffington Post seized on S.B. 3 and accused Republicans of trying to ""eliminate a requirement that public schools teach that the Ku Klux Klan and its white supremacist campaign of terror are 'morally wrong.'""

The report said that the ""cut is among some two dozen curriculum requirements dropped from the new measure, along with studying Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech, the works of United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez, Susan B. Anthony's writings about the women's suffragist movement, and Native American history.""

What followed was a wave of backlash and outrage from journalists on social media falsely accusing Republicans of trying to ban teaching about the Ku Klux Klan.

""We've dealt with media bias for a long time. Everybody gets that. But to falsely state objective facts, and to do it again and again. And to have this echo chamber ... it is remarkable."" Hughes said.

He told Beck that what S.B. 3 actually does is ""teach our students to judge people, based on the content of their character, not the color of their skin.""

""It specifically says, in Texas public schools we do not teach that one race is inherently superior to another. That one sex is inherently superior. It specifically rejects white supremacy, or any racial supremacy. Or inferiority. It also says, one race -- members of one race are not inherently racist, and unable to overcome their racism,"" Hughes said.

""Do we have problems in America's past? Of course. And we teach American history. And Texas history. Good, bad, and ugly. But we teach our students how we overcome it, by coming together as Americans, not by being racists,"" he added.

The lawmaker went on to criticize critical race theory as a ""toxic, evil doctrine"" that ""attacks the very heart of the American dream.""

""In critical race theory, they're teaching little white children that they should feel guilty about bad acts by previous generations of white folks,"" he said. ""Even worse, they're telling little children, from the Nordic communities, little black children, brown children. They're telling them, oh, you can never make it in America. It's so against you. You'll always be second class.

""What a horrible message to teach those children. Let's teach them, that we can all succeed. Are there problems? Yes. We'll overcome them as Americans. But everyone gets a chance. Everyone can succeed in America. And critical race theory, as you said, undermines, the very heart of the American dream.""

Texas Governor Abbott demands Biden label drug cartels as terrorists,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott fired off a letter to the Biden administration, and demanded that the federal government designate Mexican drug cartels — such as the Los Zetas, Sinaloa, and the Gulf Cartel — as foreign terrorist organizations. In the letter addressed to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Abbott urged ""immediate action to combat the dangerous and deadly Mexican drug cartels"" that ""bring terror into our communities.""

""They smuggle narcotics and weapons into the United States to fund their illegal enterprises,"" Abbott said of the Mexican drug cartels on Thursday. ""They force women and children into human and sex trafficking—enriching themselves on the misery and enslavement of immigrants. They murder innocent people, including women and children.""

""These Mexican drug cartels are foreign terrorist organizations, and it is time for the federal government to designate them as such,"" the Republican governor of Texas said in the letter, which was the fourth letter he sent to the Biden administration.



Abbott noted that the Biden administration could designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In order for a group to be designated a foreign terrorist organization: ""The organization engages in terrorist activity, or retains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism,"" and ""the terrorist activity or terrorism of the organization threatens the security of United States nationals or the national security of the United States.""

In 2019, the Trump administration designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its Quds Force, as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Last month, Abbott announced that Texas had launched Operation Lone Star to ""combat the smuggling of people and drugs into Texas,"" which has been exacerbated by the current border crisis.

""The Operation integrates DPS with the Texas National Guard and deploys air, ground, marine, and tactical border security assets to high threat areas to deny Mexican Cartels and other smugglers the ability to move drugs and people into Texas,"" Abbott said.



The Texas governor placed blame on the massive surge of migrants across the southern U.S. border on the Biden administration.

""The crisis at our southern border continues to escalate because of Biden administration policies that refuse to secure the border and invite illegal immigration,"" Abbott stated. ""Texas supports legal immigration but will not be an accomplice to the open border policies that cause, rather than prevent, a humanitarian crisis in our state and endanger the lives of Texans. We will surge the resources and law enforcement personnel needed to confront this crisis.""

Also in March, Abbott claimed that Border Patrol agents informed him that drug cartels are getting rich because of Biden's ""open borders policies.""

""They also said that the reason for the change, the reason for the increase and the influx is because of the policy change by the Biden administration,"" Abbott told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. ""More importantly, though is ... Border Patrol officers told me that the Biden administration policies, they are enriching and they are empowering the drug cartels in Mexico, who make money off of the people that they assist in smuggling them into the state of Texas.""

""The cartels make money off of these migrants that you and your viewers see on TV,"" Abbott continued. ""They also told me about the escalating numbers of the people coming across the border.""

Abbott said that Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector caught ""78 sex offenders, and 62 gang members, which include MS-13 gangs.""

Abbott has been an outspoken critic of the Biden administration's handling of the migrant crisis, saying the detainment of unaccompanied minors has been an ""abject failure.""



""The Biden Administration has been an abject failure when it comes to ensuring the safety of unaccompanied minors who cross our border,"" Abbott said in March. ""The conditions unaccompanied minors face in these federally run facilities is unacceptable and inhumane.""



""This is a crisis that is being made worse by the fact that the Biden administration is subjecting even more children to come into Texas or coming across our border who are going to be victimized by these cartels,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-governor-abbott-biden-drug-cartels-terrorist,2021-04-17
Texas judge blocks governor's order to investigate 'sex-change' procedures for trans youth as child abuse,"A judge in Texas temporarily blocked an order from Gov. Greg Abbott (R) to investigate parents obtaining ""sex-change"" procedures for their transgender children as incidents of child abuse.

District Judge Amy Clark Meachum issued a temporary injunction Friday based on a lawsuit from a family with a transgender teenager against the governor's order. They argue that the order violates the constitutional rights of families with transgender children.

Meacham scheduled the trial in the lawsuit to begin on July 11.

Abbott issued the order in a letter to the Department of Family and Protective Services in February.

“Texas law imposes reporting requirements upon all licensed professionals who have direct contact with children who may be subject to such abuse, including doctors, nurses, and teachers, and provides criminal penalties for failure to report such child abuse,” Abbott wrote in the letter.

The order was preceded by a non-legally binding statement from Texas attorney general Ken Paxton saying that gender transitioning ""procedures and treatments, when performed on children, can legally constitute child abuse.""

Critics of the order claim that the investigations amount to terrorizing transgender children and their families.

“The judge’s decision reflects the recognition that the governor and department circumvented the legislative process and started a rule that terrorized families who love, support and seek the best care for transgender children,” said Paul Castillo, an attorney with Lambda Legal which represents the victims along with the ACLU.

Castillo argued to the court that Abbott did not have the authority to define what child abuse is and had thereby violated his clients' rights.

The Biden administration has vowed to take action against Texas over the order, but they have declined to say exactly what that action might be.

The DFPS said that it had opened at least nine investigations into ""gender-transitioning procedures"" identified as ""child abuse"" by Abbott.

Texas man's COVID hoax lands him 15 months behind bars,"A Texas man has been sentenced to 15 months in prison for spreading a hoax related to the COVID-19 pandemic on social media, federal prosecutors said this week.

Christopher Charles Perez, 40, of San Antonio, was found guilty on two counts for violating a federal law that criminalizes the spread of false information and hoaxes related to biological weapons, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas said in a news release Monday.

Specifically, Perez ""posted two threatening messages on Facebook in which he claimed to have paid someone who was infected with COVID-19 to lick items at grocery stores in the San Antonio area to scare people away from visiting the stores,"" prosecutors alleged.

After the Southwest Texas Fusion Center received an online tip on April 5, 2020, the FBI launched an investigation into the matter.

Authorities were sure to note that Perez's claims were found to be false based on the ensuing investigation and Perez's own admission.

Perez was also ordered to pay a $1,000 fine in addition to the prison sentence.

""Trying to scare people with the threat of spreading dangerous diseases is no joking matter,"" U.S. Attorney Ashley C. Hoff said in a statement. ""This office takes seriously threats to harm the community and will prosecute them to the full extent of the law.""

FBI San Antonio Division Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs added, ""Those who would threaten to use COVID-19 as a weapon against others will be held accountable for their actions, even if the threat was a hoax.""

""Perez's actions were knowingly designed to spread fear and panic and today's sentencing illustrates the seriousness of this crime,"" Combs said.

Though Perez's claims were found to be a lie, similar behavior was reported at the start of the pandemic last year.

In late March 2020, authorities in Missouri charged a man with a terroristic threat after he filmed himself licking Walmart deodorants and posted the video to social media. At around the same time, another man was charged with intentionally coughing on a grocery store clerk at a Wegmans in New Jersey.

And in May 2020, a South Carolina woman was arrested on charges that she licked her hands, coughed, and touched food items at a grocery store as well as several surfaces at a nearby fast-food restaurant.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-man-covid-hoax-prison-time,2021-10-06
Texas threatens to sue Biden administration for 'illegal' deportation pause,"The state of Texas is planning to sue the Biden administration after President Joe Biden signed an executive order halting deportations of illegal immigrants for a period of 100 days.

""President Biden is trying to halt deportations of illegal aliens who already have a final order of removal from the U.S.,"" Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tweeted Friday. ""This abandons the obligation to enforce federal immigration laws. Texas is fighting this attempt to grant blanket amnesty.""

Abbott shared a letter from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton addressed to acting Secretary of Homeland Security David Pekoske announcing that the state will sue the Biden administration for its ""illegal deportation freeze."" The Department of Homeland Security, acting on Biden's orders, on Wednesday paused removals for some non-citizens ordered deported as the agency conducts a ""review and reset"" of its immigration enforcement policies.

""The pause will allow DHS to ensure that its resources are dedicated to responding to the most pressing challenges that the United States faces, including immediate operational challenges at the southwest border in the midst of the most serious global public health crisis in a century,"" the agency said in a statement.

Biden's deportation pause is the fulfillment of a campaign promise to radically reverse former President Donald Trump's immigration policies. On his first day in office, President Biden called on Congress to take up legislation granting amnesty with a path to citizenship for up to 11 million illegal immigrants.

Until Congress is able to consider legislation, Biden has vowed to take executive action. Including the deportation pause, Biden took 17 executive actions on his first day in office fulfilling various campaign promises to reverse Trump's policies on climate change, immigration, COVID-19 response management, and more.

The DHS memoranda announcing the new deportation policy lists some individuals who will not be protected from deportation, including those who are suspected of terrorism or espionage, anyone not physically present in the United States before Nov. 1, 2020, and for individual cases where the acting director of ICE and the general counsel make an individual determination that a non-citizen should be removed.

Paxton's letter characterizes this ""blanket halt on nearly all deportations of illegal aliens"" as a ""complete abdication of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) obligation to enforce federal immigration law.""



He argues that allowing the executive order to go unchallenged could ""allow the Biden Administration to grant blanket amnesty to the vast majority of the illegal aliens in this country with the stroke of a pen and without congressional approval.""

""Border states like Texas pay a particularly high price when the federal government fails to faithfully execute our country's immigration laws,"" Paxton wrote. ""Your attempted halt on almost all deportations would increase the cost to Texas caused by illegal immigration.""

Paxton demanded that the federal government rescind the order halting deportations or else the state would sue in court for relief.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-threatens-to-sue-biden-administration,2021-01-22
The US military has executed an unmanned airstrike targeting an ISIS-K planner,"The U.S. has executed an unmanned airstrike targeting an ISIS-K planner on the heels of the deadly terror attack in Kabul that left many dead, including 13 American service members.

""U.S. military forces conducted an over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation today against an ISIS-K planner,"" U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban, USN, said in a statement. ""The unmanned airstrike occurred in the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan. Initial indications are that we killed the target. We know of no civilian casualties.""

During a speech on Thursday President Joe Biden pledged U.S. retaliation in response to the attack and noted that he had called for the development of operational plans to attack ISIS-K's assets, leadership, and facilities.



""To those who carried out this attack ... know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,"" Biden declared during remarks on Thursday after the terror attack.



The deaths of the 13 U.S. service members in Afghanistan marked the first American military combat fatalities in that country since February 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Even before the Thursday attack the Biden administration had been facing heavy criticism from Republicans for botching efforts to pull the U.S. out of Afghanistan. The Taliban has swiftly taken over in the country, seizing the capital city of Kabul earlier this month, and the U.S. has been scrambling to evacuate citizens and others.

Details have been emerging about the American service members who died as a result of the attack. One of the victims was 20-year-old Marine Rylee McCollum, whose wife is expecting to give birth in three weeks, his sister Cheyenne McCollum said, according to the Associated Press.

""We want to make sure that people know that these are the kids that are sacrificing themselves, and he's got a family who loves him and a wife who loves him and a baby that he'll never get to meet,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-u-s-military-has-executed-a-strike-against-an-isis-k-target-on-the-heels-of-deadly-kabul-terror-attack,2021-08-28
'There’s no heart in sawmill wood': Experts trained in medieval carpentry work to restore roof at Notre Dame cathedral,"Glad tidings of great joy for those hoping to see the iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France, fully restored to its former glory. A team of medieval wood specialists in France believe they have the skills and the materials necessary to rebuild the roof almost exactly as it was originally constructed 800 years ago.

The return to medieval building practices actually began 25 years ago when people from all walks of life began gathering in northern Burgundy to restore Guédelon Castle. In order to approximate the original structure of the castle as closely as possible, workers there learned how to build using the same tools and techniques as they did centuries ago. They also utilize locally-sourced materials whenever possible, according to the Guardian.

Now, some of these well-trained carpentry artisans have already been commissioned to help rebuild the cathedral which was partially destroyed by a fire in April 2019. Construction companies looking to help in the rebuild have already hired experts from Guédelon, and despite doubts expressed by millions around the world, those experts believe they are up to the task.

""After the fire, there were a lot of people saying it would take thousands of trees, and we didn’t have enough of the right ones, and the wood would have to be dried for years, and nobody even knew anything about how to produce beams like they did in the Middle Ages,"" said Guédelon carpenter Frédéric Épaud. ""They said it was impossible.""

""But we knew it could be done because Guédelon has been doing it for years,"" he added.

Perhaps the only major impediment to their success would be speed, they said. Without the use of modern equipment, medieval construction methods require a lot of time. The process may be long and tedious, but the experts at Guédelon say it's the only means of restoring Notre Dame.

""There’s no heart in sawmill wood,"" said Stéphane Boudy, another Guédelon carpenter.

""We have 25 years’ experience of cutting, squaring and hewing wood by hand,” Boudy also said. “It’s what we [have done] every day for 25 years. There are people outside of here who can do it now.""

However, French President Emmanuel Macron has already pledged to reopen the cathedral by 2024, in time for the Summer Olympics, which will be held in Paris that year.

""[I]t shouldn’t be rushed,"" Épaud said. ""Macron’s insistence that the cathedral be open by 2024 is idiotic. We are talking about a cathedral. We’re not in a hurry, and we have the money to do it the right way. If we rush it, there’s a risk it [will] be done badly and something is missed. Sadly, I fear Macron doesn’t understand that.""

According to co-founder Maryline Martin, the Guédelon project receives no public funds. Though the organization does partner with some ""state research bodies,"" she claims that it depends entirely on private donations and on the fees collected from visitors.

""Now, after 25 years, we are the only ones who can understand and are able to do what has to be done,"" Martin said, ""and they discover we have not sold our soul to the devil. Our people will be working on Notre Dame, one way or another.""

Experts have estimated that the restoration of Notre Dame will cost a staggering $72 million.

"'This is Kristallnacht': Palestinians continue attacks on Israelis with rockets, street violence","Hamas militants continued their barrage of rocket fire at Israel on Tuesday, and the violence escalated in the streets to the point that the mayor of one Israeli town called for help and likened the attacks to the Nazi pogrom against German Jews, declaring: ""This is Kristallnacht.""

What are the details?

The mayor of the central Israeli city of Lod called for the nation's prime minister to declare a state of emergency amid attacks by ""Islamists,"" The Times of Israel reported.

""This is Kristallnacht in Lod,"" said Mayor Yair Revivo. ""I have called on the prime minister to declare a state of emergency in Lod. To call in the [Israel Defense Forces]. To impose a curfew. To restore quiet… There is a failure of governance… This is a giant incident — an Intifada of Arab Israelis. All the work we have done here for years [on coexistence] has gone down the drain.""

Revivo went on to say:

""All of Israel should know, this is a complete loss of control… This is unthinkable. Synagogues are being burned. Hundreds of cars set alight. Hundreds of Arab thugs are roaming the streets… Civil war has erupted in Lod… The Orthodox-nationalist community here has guns. I'm imploring them to go back home but they understandably want to protect their homes. Petrol bombs are being thrown into [Jewish] homes. The situation is incendiary.""

The New York Post reported that Hamas fired 130 rockets Tuesday just at the city of Tel Aviv alone — which has a population of nearly half a million people.

Video posted online shows Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepting the rockets. Newsmax foreign correspondant Alex Salvi tweeted of the footage, ""Imagine the carnage if these ≈150 rockets landed in Tel Aviv (population of 450,000).""

But Israel has been fighting back. The IDF announced Tuesday that they ""killed the commander of the Hamas anti-tank missile unit, Iyad Fathi Faik Sharir,"" who ""was in charge of carrying out anti-tank missile attacks on Israel.""

The IDF added, ""Our aircraft are currently striking additional terror targets in Gaza.""

Reuters reported that over the past two days, 30 Palestinians (including children) and three Israelis (all women) have been killed in the attacks from both sides.

'Tiger King' star Bhagavan 'Doc' Antle arrested by the FBI,"“Tiger King” star Bhagavan “Doc” Antle was arrested by the FBI on Friday. Several media outlets reported that Antle would face federal money laundering charges.

Antle – who owns the Myrtle Beach Safari in South Carolina – was arrested by the FBI and booked into the J. Reuben Long Detention Center in Conway, South Carolina, at 5:38 p.m. on Friday, according to Horry County online booking records.

The Associated Press reported, ""The charges relate to allegations of money laundering, a person familiar with the matter told the AP on Saturday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.""

The charges against Antle are expected to be formally announced during a court proceeding on Monday in Florence, South Carolina.

In October 2020, Antle was indicted on wildlife trafficking charges in Virginia. He was charged with one felony count of wildlife trafficking, one felony count of conspiracy to wildlife traffic, and 13 additional misdemeanor charges relating to animal cruelty and the Endangered Species Act.

National Geographic details Doc's alleged wildlife trafficking allegations:

The charges stem from a months-long investigation into illegal selling and transport of lions between Antle and Keith Wilson, owner of Wilson’s Wild Animal Park in Winchester, Virginia. Wilson has been indicted on identical charges to Antle, plus four additional counts of conspiracy. (Wilson already was facing 46 counts of animal cruelty in relation to a November 2019 raid that resulted in authorities confiscating 119 of his animals.)

Doc's daughters were also charged with misdemeanors. Tawny Antle was charged with one misdemeanor count of cruelty to animals. Tilakum Watterson was charged with two misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals and two misdemeanor counts of violating the Endangered Species Act.

The trial for the wildlife trafficking charges is scheduled for next month.

NBC News reported, ""Antle has a history of recorded violations, going as far back as 1989, when he was fined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for abandoning deer and peacocks at his zoo in Virginia. Over the years, he has more than 35 USDA violations for mistreating animals.""

In May, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) requested that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) launch a probe into Antle's Rare Species Fund – a nonprofit that raises money for wildlife conservation. PETA accused Dov of using some of the fund's money to subsidize the Myrtle Beach Safari.

""It's fitting that 'Doc' Antle is behind bars after years of locking up the endangered animals he uses in tawdry photo ops. His legal woes are mounting, as PETA recently blew the whistle on his apparent ‘charity’ scam, and the end to his reign of terrorizing tiger cubs can’t come soon enough,"" Debbie Metzler, associate director of PETA’s Captive Animal Law Enforcement division said in a statement.

Rashida Tlaib and the 'Squad' lead charge against expanding national security powers after Capitol riot,"Ten progressive Democrats in the House of Representatives are calling on congressional leaders to refrain from any attempts to expand the United States government's national security powers in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot in the Capitol.

The lawmakers, led by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warning that an expansion of national security powers could threaten American civil liberties. The letter comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers will re-introduce the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to give federal law enforcement more powers to act against domestic terrorism.

""The Trump mob's success in breaching the Capitol was not due to a lack of resources at the disposal of federal law enforcement, and in this moment we must resist the erosion of our civil liberties and Constitutional freedoms, however well-intentioned proposed security reforms may be,"" the Democrats wrote. ""While we are not necessarily opposed to reforms to address the law enforcement and intelligence communities' inability or unwillingness to seriously confront domestic white nationalist violence, we firmly believe that the national security and surveillance powers of the U.S. government are already too broad, undefined, and unaccountable to the people.""

The letter comes as some politicians and national security experts have characterized the Capitol riot as an act of domestic terror and described the participants with terms once reserved for ISIS and Al Qaeda. The events of Jan. 6 have even been compared to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.



""Don't dare call them protesters,"" President Joe Biden said the day after the riot, speaking in Wilmington, Delaware. ""They were a riotous mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It's that basic. It's that simple.""

Last Wednesday, as she presided over impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, Pelosi also called the rioters ""domestic terrorists."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that the ""insurrectionists"" who invaded the Capitol building should be added to the federal ""no fly"" list. ""It is an attempt to stop democracy as we know it, using domestic terrorism to assault our system of government, thereby qualifying these insurrectionists for the No-Fly List,"" Schumer wrote in a letter to the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. Other Democrats have made similar remarks.

Commentators in the media have called for a new ""Domestic War on Terror"" and for law enforcement to adopt tactics used against Islamic terrorism abroad to fight ""white supremacy"" and extremism in the United States. CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem labeled Trump the ""spiritual leader for domestic terrorists"" before becoming their ""operational leader"" on Jan. 6. She called for the U.S. government to implement counterterrorism strategies against those Trump supporters who went to the Capitol.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) is leading the effort in Congress to expand national security powers by passing the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. The legislation would establish new offices in the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the FBI to investigate domestic terrorism in the U.S.

""It is not enough to just condemn hate, we need to equip law enforcement with the tools needed to identify threats and prevent violent acts of domestic terrorism,"" said the bill's sponsor in the House, Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.). ""The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act improves coordination between our federal agencies and makes sure they are focused on the most serious domestic threats.""



In response Tlaib, joined by other members of the progressive ""Squad,"" Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), wrote to express their opposition to any effort to expand the government's national security powers.

""To expand the government's national security powers once again at the expense of the human and civil rights of the American people would only serve to further undermine our democracy, not protect it,"" their letter states.

The letter goes on to cite the House Un-American Activities Committee, the FBI's Counterintelligence Program, the USA Patriot Act, and the FBI's Assessment Authority and Operation IRON FIST programs as examples of ""tools used for the mass violation of human and civil rights.""



They propose the following initiatives instead of new legislation to expand the government's power:

Fully investigate the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack in a non-partisan, transparent manner. Commit today to release all findings from any investigations into the attack to the public. Recognize white nationalist and QAnon groups as the national security threat that they are and take action to combat them through existing laws, powers and regulations. Recognize that the reason that the threat posed by these groups hasn't already been adequately addressed is because of a deeply ingrained unwillingness and/or hesitancy to act against these groups within all three branches of government, especially in the law enforcement community, including the Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and intelligence agencies, not the result of insufficient domestic national security and/or surveillance powers.

""In the face of great tragedy, we call on you to reject reactionary demands to further erode the rights and liberties of the American people,"" the letter concluded. ""For our part, we pledge to oppose any attempts to expand the domestic national security or surveillance powers of the United States government at the expense of the rights of the people with every tool available to us as duly elected Members of Congress.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tlaib-squad-national-security-powers-after-capitol-riot,2021-01-20
Top Biden adviser refuses to say whether Taliban is an enemy of the US: 'Hard to put a label on it',"Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to President Joe Biden, refused to say Tuesday whether the Biden administration views the Taliban as an enemy of the United States.

Technically, the Taliban group that now controls Afghanistan is not a designated terrorist organization. The Taliban group that operates in Pakistan, however, is a designated terrorist group.

What did Sullivan say?

During an interview on MSNBC, network host Nicolle Wallace asked Sullivan about the U.S. government's posture toward the Taliban.

""Are they are frenemy? Are they our adversary? Are they our enemy? Are they — what are they?"" Wallace asked.

Despite decades of witnessing barbaric rule by Taliban leaders and fighters, Sullivan responded by saying the Biden administration would not place a ""label"" on the Taliban because they don't yet know, allegedly, how the Taliban will rule Afghanistan (this time around).

""Well, it's hard to put a label on it, in part because we have yet to see what they are going to be now that they are in control, physical control of Afghanistan,"" Sullivan said.

""They will, in the coming days, announce a government,"" he continued. ""That government is gonna go around seeking diplomatic engagement, even recognition from other countries, including the United States. In fact, the Taliban spokesman today said he was looking for positive relations on behalf of the Taliban, especially with the United States.""

""We're not just going to grant positive relations to the Taliban; they are going to have to earn everything from the international community through actions — not words,"" Sullivan claimed. ""That begins with safe passage for Americans and Afghan allies, and that also includes them living up to their counterterrorism commitments, including that Afghanistan can never again be used as a base from which to attack the United States or our allies again.""

Biden Thinks We Can 'Fight Terrorism Without Endless Wars': Jake Sullivan youtu.be

The Taliban have claimed they are ""reformed,"" that Afghanistan will be ""inclusive"" under their control, and that everyone in the country, including those who worked with Americans, has been granted ""forgiveness"" and ""amnesty.""



But out of the other side of their mouths, the Taliban have said they will rule according to a strict interpretation of Sharia law. Indeed, there have been numerous reports already of extrajudicial killings and the hunting down of Afghans who worked with Western military forces.

Anything else?

Not only is the Biden administration refusing to a place a ""label"" on the Taliban, Sullivan explained in an interview on ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday that the Biden administration is planning to send taxpayer-funded aid to Afghanistan.

""We do believe there is an important dimension of humanitarian assistance that should go directly to the people of Afghanistan,"" Sullivan said.

""When it comes to our economic and development assistance relationship with the Taliban, that will be about the Taliban's actions. It will be about whether they follow through on their commitments, their commitments to safe passage for Americans and its allies,"" he qualified.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-biden-adviser-refuses-to-say-taliban-enemy,2021-09-01
"Top House Democrat says 'no question' Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley may be added to 'no-fly' list if found liable for Capitol violence","A top House Democrat said Monday that Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) should be added to the ""no-fly"" list — which prohibits individuals from traveling on commercial airlines into, out of, or within the United States — if they are found liable for instigating violence at the U.S. Capitol last week.

What's the background?

Democratic lawmakers have partially blamed Cruz and Hawley for last week's deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol, claiming their efforts to oppose the Electoral College certification of Joe Biden's win sowed legitimacy into claims that the election had been ""stolen"" from President Donald Trump.

Although Cruz and Hawley have not been accused of criminal acts, Democratic senators and representatives have increasingly called for both men to resign, alleging they have violated their oaths of office.

What is being said now?

Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Monday there is ""no doubt"" that Cruz and Hawley should be placed on the no-fly list as a way to hold them liable for ""inciting"" the violence.

""There's no question about it,"" Thompson said on SiriusXM's ""The Joe Madison Show.""

""There's no exemption for being put on the no-fly list,"" Thompson added. ""Even a member of Congress that commits a crime, you know, they're expelled from the body. There are ethics charges that can be brought against those individuals. And people are looking at all of this.""



Thompson went on to include freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) among those who may need to be punished.

""What Hawley did and what Cruz did was horrible,"" Thompson said. ""What the new member from Colorado — who basically tweeted directions and everything that was going on — that's not something you do. Somebody said, 'Well she's new.' Well the point is ignorance of the law is no excuse. So if you don't know, you've still done something wrong.""

What about the protesters themselves?

Thompson made it clear what he thought of those who participated in the Capitol riots, calling them ""domestic terrorists.""

""First of all, these folks, in my opinion, can be classified as domestic terrorists because of the actions they participated in on Wednesday,"" he said, as TheBlaze reported Monday.

""Now under normal circumstances international terrorists are out on no-fly lists. These are domestic terrorists — same thing. A terrorist is a terrorist, no matter who you are,"" Thompson added.

Democrats are, in fact, doing everything in their power to ensure that those who participated in the violence on the Capitol face any and all consequences.

While many of the rioters have been identified and arrested, two members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration this week demanding the agency do everything in its power to ensure the protestors, and future agitators, are prevented from traveling to violently disrupt President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.

Reps. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) and Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) told FAA administrator Stephen Dickson:

We write, therefore, to urge you to take every appropriate action within your statutory authority, and to work with air carriers to persuade them to take complementary action, (1) to prevent civil unrest from jeopardizing aviation safety and leading to injury or worse during flight, and (2) to limit the chance that the Nation's commercial airline system could be used as a means of mass transportation to Washington, D.C., for further violence in connection with the inauguration.

There is no indication that any participants in last week's riots have been added to the federal no-fly list, CNN reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-house-democrat-cruz-hawley-no-fly,2021-01-12
COVID response doesn't even rank in top 5 most important issues to voters. Economy stays No. 1: poll,"If you consume only the mainstream media and follow only the social media posts Facebook and Twitter let you see, you probably think the sole issue impacting the 2020 presidential election is the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The networks, CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and nearly every other liberal-leaning outlet want Americans to believe that the only things that matter in this election are that President Donald Trump refuses to wear a mask, Vice President Mike Pence failed in his leadership of the White House Coronavirus Task Force (not to mention his reported opposition to having plexiglass at the vice presidential debate Wednesday night), and the White House is a COVID-19 cesspool.

But it turns out the issues American voters consider most important in the election are the issues they've long considered the most important, a new Gallup poll revealed. And the No. 1 issue for voters hasn't changed: ""It's the economy, stupid.""

That's not to say the coronavirus response isn't important to voters — it is — but it sure doesn't rank where one might expect considering the level of coverage it has received.

What are the top 5 issues?

Of 16 issues Americans said were either ""extremely important"" or ""very important"" to their vote for president, the economy came in as the clear top issue at 89% (44% ""extremely""; 45% ""very). It was followed by terrorism and national security (83%), education (82%), health care (80%), and crime (79%).

Top 5 most important issues for 2020 election

No. 1: Economy — 89%

No. 2: Terrorism and National Security — 83%

No. 3: Education — 82%

No. 4: Health Care — 80%

No. 5: Crime — 79%

Where did the COVID response rank?

Don't let the fact that the coronavirus response's ranking is seemingly incongruous with the media coverage it has received fool you.

The fact that other topics were considered more important does not mean the coronavirus is not a concern for voters. In fact, more than three-quarters of Americans say it's an issue important to their vote.

The response to the coronavirus came in sixth place on the most-important-issues ranking (77%), followed closely by race relations (76%).

Partisan breakdown



When broken down by political party, the results are not terribly surprising.

For Democrats, the five most important issues are health care (95%), coronavirus response (93%), relations (89%), climate change (88%), and the economy (85%)

Among Republicans, the top five issues are the economy (93%), terrorism and national security (93%), crime (85%), education (79%), and gun policy (76%).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-issues-for-2020-election,2020-10-07
Top Netanyahu adviser hits back at criticism from Democratic politicians: 'No one should make excuses for' Hamas,"Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, responded to American critics on Sunday, defending Israel's right to defend itself from attacks from Islamic terrorists in the Palestinian territories.

What is the background?

Members of the so-called ""Squad"" — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — amplified anti-Israel rhetoric last week as Israel continued its military campaign against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip.

Ocasio-Cortez called Israel an ""apartheid state,"" Omar accused Israel of committing acts of terrorism, while Tlaib called Netanyahu the ""Apartheid-in-chief"" and accused him of ""committing war crimes.""

Tlaib and Omar even said after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire that a ceasefire was not enough. Omar, instead, demanded ""accountability for every war crime committed."" Meanwhile, Tlaib said the U.S. should stop sending aid to Israel if the Jewish nation doesn't ""uphold human rights,"" claiming the ceasefire ""will not alone achieve freedom, justice, and equality for all who live under Israel's apartheid government.""

What did Regev say?

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" the top Israeli diplomat dismissed criticism from Democrats, saying they don't represent the views of a majority of Americans.

Regev also reiterated that Hamas is not just an enemy of Israel's — but of the free world.

""I can tell you this morning before coming to this interview, I looked at the polling. And I saw that the overwhelming majority of the American people stand with Israel, support Israel, are favorable toward Israel,"" Regev said. ""A majority of people who identify as Democrats also support Israel or favor Israel.""

""People need to understand — Hamas is not just Israel's enemy. Hamas is the enemy of everyone who wants to seek peace and reconciliation in our part of the world. There were brutal jihadist terrorist group,"" Regev added. ""No one should make excuses for them.""

When pressed on the issue further — including on criticism from Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who rebuked Israel for targeting a building that housed an Associated Press bureau and Hamas intelligence offices — Regev further explained why criticism of Israel is unwarranted.

In that building that the senator was concerned about, Hamas had its elite scientific research unit that was working on ways to try to counteract the guiding systems on our rockets. If they would have succeeded, not only couldn't we have shut down incoming rockets coming into Israel to kill our people, but we wouldn't have been able to be surgical in our strikes against Hamas' military machine, so that definitely was a legitimate military target.



That Hamas was using journalists as a human shield shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but we notify the journalists in advance and I'm happy to tell you that there was not a single civilian casualty from that operation. In fact, from my point of view, it was an Israeli tactical success because we took out a legitimate Hamas target, a dangerous Hamas target and at the same time, not a single innocent civilian was killed. That's a good thing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-netanyahu-adviser-responds-democratic-politicians,2021-05-24
Transgender death row inmate who raped and murdered ex-girlfriend begs for clemency: 'I'm mentally ill',"A biological male on death row, whose execution date is looming, is now begging his state's governor for clemency on account of his mental health issues.

Amber McLaughlin — who until recently was known as Scott McLaughlin — is scheduled to be executed in Missouri on January 3 for the vicious murder of his ex-girlfriend, 45-year-old Beverly Guenther. On November 20, 2003, McLaughlin forcibly raped Guenther before stabbing her to death and then dumping her body near the Mississippi River.

Prior to the murder, Guenther had filed a restraining order against McLaughlin because he had reportedly been terrorizing her and stalking her since their breakup that summer. Guenther had also accused McLaughlin of domestic violence, and he was scheduled to appear in court regarding that allegation the day after she went missing.



McLaughlin, now 49 and in the midst of a so-called gender transition, is asking Missouri Governor Mike Parson, a Republican, to grant him clemency on account of mental health issues. According to reports, McLaughlin suffered tremendous abuse as a child, both in and out of the foster care system. A letter to Parson claimed that a foster parent once rubbed human waste in McLaughlin's face and that his adoptive father even used a taser on him. McLaughlin's attorneys claimed that the jury that convicted their client never heard about the abuse because a psychiatrist who examined McLaughlin never took the stand.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch also reported that McLaughlin still struggles with the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and often suffers from bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide. ""People should know I’m mentally ill,"" McLaughlin told the outlet on Monday.

When McLaughlin began undergoing so-called gender transition treatment is unclear, but McLaughlin still went by the first name ""Scott"" and maintained the appearance of a male as recently as 2017.

Screen shot of Missouri DOC website

Though a jury readily convicted McLaughlin in 2006 of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, and forcible rape, the jury could not determine whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison. A judge ultimately settled on the death penalty. A federal judge then reconsidered that sentence in 2016, but a panel of the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overruled that judge in 2021 and once again restored the death sentence given to McLaughlin, who also previously served five years for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.

Five inmates have been executed in Missouri since Parson assumed office in 2018, and Parson did not grant clemency to any of them. McLaughlin's attorneys are scheduled to meet with the governor on Tuesday, and they remain optimistic.

""It's wrong when anyone's executed regardless,"" stated federal public defender Larry Komp, ""but I hope that this is a first that doesn't occur.""

""Amber has shown great courage in embracing who she is as a transgender woman, in spite of the potential for people reacting with hate,"" Komp continued. ""So I admire her display of courage.""

McLaughlin, whose death warrant still lists his first name as ""Scott,"" is trying to remain hopeful as well, calling his pending execution ""a sad thing"" and reiterating that he doesn't ""agree with it.""

""I’m trying to stay calm,"" he insisted to the Post-Dispatch.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-death-row-inmate-who-raped-and-murdered-ex-girlfriend-begs-for-clemency-i-m-mentally-ill,2022-12-15
Transsexual admits to burning down 118-year-old Christian church in Portland: Report,"A 27-year-old transsexual has reportedly admitted to burning down a historic Korean church in Portland, Oregon, underscoring how he wanted to ""take credit"" for this act of apparent anti-Christian hatred.

What are the details?

The 118-year-old, 3,000-square-foot Portland Korean Church at Southwest 10th and Southwest Clay Street, formerly the First German Evangelical Church, was set ablaze around 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 3.

In response to multiple reports indicating that the structure was fast becoming an inferno, 12 fire engines, six ladder trucks, four battalion chiefs, and 75 Portland Fire and Rescue Personnel arrived on the scene.



Portland Fire and Rescue indicated that the church was not occupied when the three-alarm fire broke out.

According to the Multnomah County District Attorney's office, by 5:40 p.m., the south side of the church had partially collapsed along with the roof. The fire had also spread to a neighboring home, which was evacuated.



KOIN reported that demolition crews began tearing down the remainder of the church this week.

The toppling of its 35-foot steeple, which reached a height of 70 feet, was captured on video:



Mike Schmidt, the leftist Multnomah County District Attorney who made a name for himself by refusing to prosecute BLM rioters and other violent suspects, announced that 25-year-old Cameron David Storer was arraigned on four charges, including two counts of arson in the first degree, one count of arson in the second degree, and two counts of burglary in the second degree.



Storer, a transsexual who prefers to be called by a woman's name, reportedly walked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on Jan. 4 to confess to setting the fire, claiming that he wanted to ""take credit"" for the attack and detailing how he had gone about doing so with a Bic lighter.

Court documents indicated that Storer lit papers on fire in the church, waited nearby to make sure it had spread, then walked over to Plaid Pantry to observe his handiwork.

The alleged arsonist claimed to have taken 10 oxycodone daily and to have been addled by schizophrenia. He also suggested that voices had told him to burn down the church.

Andy Ngô reported that the bearded suspect is currently being jailed in a co-ed medical dorm in a single cell.



In light of Schmidt's recent admission that Multnomah County can't bring all dangerous criminals to justice — letting alleged stranglers, domestic abusers, sex offenders, human traffickers, child abusers, and berserkers of various intensities off without any penalty for their misdeeds — it is presently unclear if Storer will ultimately be penalized for the alleged crimes for which he has taken credit.

The Portland Korean Church, which the Oregonian noted was owned by Hadi Nouredine, a Beaverton and Lake Oswego dentist, was also targeted in September 2020.

Christian churches have been routinely targeted in Portland, primarily by leftist marauders.

A transsexual Antifa militant was charged with a Nov. 3, 2020, attack on Saint André Bessette Catholic Church — a church known for housing, cleaning, and feeding the city's poor.

Father Tom Gaughan said, ""The actions of this one individual has forced us to cease our outreach and its hundreds of people we normally give food to.""

In April 2021, the First Christian Church was targeted in an attack, having its windows shattered.

At least four Catholic churches were vandalized by radicals with threatening and vulgar remarks in summer 2021.

The century-old Portland Stake Tabernacle in southeast Portland was abandoned in summer 2022, after its Mormon congregants fled the state, citing the leftist violence plaguing the city.



The Democrat-run city scores a three on Neighborhood Scout's crime index, where 100 is safest. The chances of becoming a victim of a violent crime are one in 187.

Trump releases statement on loss of US service members: 'Should never have been allowed to happen',"Twelve U.S. service members and at least 60 Afghans were killed in the terrorist attacks near the Kabul airport on Thursday. Former President Donald Trump declared that the loss of service members ""should never have been allowed to happen.""

Trump released a statement on the suicide attacks near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan that also wounded 15 U.S. service members and 143 Afghans.

""Melania and I send our deepest condolences to the families of our brilliant and brave Service Members whose duty to the U.S.A. meant so much to them,"" Trump said. ""Our thoughts are also with the families of the innocent civilians who died today in the savage Kabul attack.

""This tragedy should never have been allowed to happen, which makes our grief even deeper and more difficult to understand,"" the former president added. ""May God Bless the U.S.A.""

Earlier Thursday morning, shortly before the terror attacks in Afghanistan, Trump appeared on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show.""

Trump said the Biden administration made ""some horrible, stupid decisions"" in the past week and a half during the U.S. withdrawal, the worst being ""allowing our military to leave before the civilians and before we get all of our equipment back, $83 billion dollars.

""And not, nobody can even comprehend that much equipment. Thousands of vehicles,"" he continued.

""I think it's the most embarrassing moment for our military and for our country,"" Trump said of Biden's withdrawal. ""And for some reason, it doesn't make sense, he pulled the military out first.""

Trump outlined how he would have withdrawn from Afghanistan.

""I would have gotten all Americans out,"" Trump said would have been his first step in withdrawal. ""I would have gotten all of the people that helped us out that were in danger, if they were good people. Some were not good people.""



Trump said he would not have taken U.S. troops out of Bagram Air Base before the withdrawal was completed. President Joe Biden had U.S. forces vacate Bagram Air Base on July 2.



Trump noted that the second step would have been to take all military equipment.

""I want every single nail, screw, and bolt,"" he said of U.S. equipment in Afghanistan. ""I then would have, with the exception of Bagram, which I would have kept, I would have bombed all of the bases, because I don't want to give those bases to Russia, China, or even the Taliban. I would have bombed every base.""

Trump alleged that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley advised him that ""it's cheaper to leave the equipment than to take it out."" He responded that Milley's remark is ""one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard.""

In the interview that was done before the deadly terror attacks, Trump said the agreement he had with Taliban leader Abdul Qahar Balkhi is why there were no American soldiers killed in Afghanistan for 18 months.

""And I had a very, very tough conversation with him about what we're going to do to them if anything happens,"" Trump said of his relationship with the Taliban leader. ""But you really have to add to your three points, also add the fact that nobody was to be killed, harmed in any way, and nobody was. It was an amazing thing. We had a very strong agreement. It was conditions-based.""

Trump said he threatened Balkhi, ""If you do anything bad to the United States of America, if you do anything bad to any of our civilians, to any American citizen, I will hit you harder than anybody has ever been hit in world history. You will be hit harder than any country and any person has ever been hit in world history.""

Trump claimed that the current conditions in Kabul are allowing ""some very, very bad terrorists"" to get on planes leaving the country because there is a lack of vetting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-afghanistan-biden-kabul-attack,2021-08-26
"President Trump takes new action against Antifa, one step closer to terrorist organization designation","President Donald Trump took new action against Antifa on Tuesday, signing an executive order asking the State Department to evaluate whether the far-left anarchist group should be classified as a terrorist organization.

What's the background?

Antifa has become an infamous staple throughout Trump's presidency, often making headlines for engaging in violent clashes with right-wing demonstrators in cities nationwide.

Because of the group's penchant for violence, Trump has toyed with the idea of officially designating Antifa as a terrorist organization.

Trump said in July 2019, ""Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!""

In August 2019, Trump said, ""Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.'""

And in May 2020, Trump declared, ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.""

What did the EO say?

Despite Trump's public declarations, Antifa has not been classified as a terrorist organization. However, Tuesday's executive order was a concrete step toward such a designation becoming reality.

Trump's executive order calls on the State Department, Justice Department, and Homeland Security Department to evaluate whether Antifa should be classified as a terrorist organization.

The executive order says:

The Secretary of State shall, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, review information received from the Department of Justice and other authorities to assess whether to classify Antifa as a terrorist organization under section 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi) of title 8, United States Code.



The Secretary of State shall take all appropriate steps, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to consider listing Antifa in 9 FAM 302.5-4(B)(2)(U) Aliens Who Are Members of an Identified Criminal Organization.

""The Department of Justice has already publicly confirmed that actions by Antifa and similar groups meet the standard for domestic terrorism,"" the executive order declares.

""The violence spurred on by Antifa — such as hurling projectiles and incendiary devices at police, burning vehicles, and violently confronting police in defiance of local curfews — is dangerous to human life and to the fabric of our Nation. These violent acts undermine the rights of peaceful protestors and destroy the lives, liberty, and property of the people of this Nation, especially those most vulnerable,"" the order says.

Anything else?

Critics say designating Antifa as a terrorist organization is not possible because the group does not have centralized leadership like, say, Al Qaeda.

However, leaked emails from the Department of Homeland Security regarding violence in Portland last summer revealed that Antifa is, in fact, organized.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-antifa-terrorist-organization-designation,2021-01-06
"Why is Trump banned on Twitter, but the Taliban isn't? Experts say the terror group simply follows the rules of the far-left social media platform.","Twitter is well-known for its bent to ban any user — even former President Donald Trump — for not adhering to rules interpreted by gatekeepers at the decidedly left-wing social media platform.

So why does the un-woke Taliban — with its bloodthirsty reputation and unapologetic, misogynistic codes — manage to survive on Twitter?

Simply put, according to the Washington Post, the Taliban and its numerous agents have become adept at following the rules of Twitter.

What are the details?

""The Taliban of today is immensely savvy with technology and social media — nothing like the group it was 20 years ago,"" Rita Katz, executive director of SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online extremism, told the Post.



Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen, for example, sports over 350,000 Twitter followers, the paper said.

""The Islamic Emirate has ordered its Mujahideen and once again instructs them that no one is allowed to enter anyone's house without permission,"" Shaheen tweeted Sunday as the Taliban rolled through Afghanistan and took over Kabul. ""Life, property and honor of none shall be harmed but must be protected by the Mujahedeen.""

Trump — the former leader of the free world who still enjoys an immense following — couldn't tweet about his latest round of golf at Mar-a-Lago if he got down on his knees and begged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

The Post noted that ""Trump's posts for years challenged platform rules against hate speech and inciting violence"" while the Taliban does not. Katz added to the paper that the Taliban ""is clearly threading the needle regarding social media content policies and is not yet crossing the very distinct policy-violating lines that Trump crossed.""

However, Katz added to the Post that what's happening at present ""doesn't mean at all that the Taliban shouldn't be removed from social media, because the waves of propaganda and messaging it is spreading — permissible as it may seem by some content policy standards — is fueling a newly emboldened and extremely dangerous global Islamist militant movement.""

More from the Post:

The tactics overall show such a high degree of skill that analysts believe at least one public relations firm is advising the Taliban on how to push key themes, amplify messages across platforms, and create potentially viral images and video snippets — much like corporate and political campaigns do across the world.



One image from a video circulated online in Afghanistan shows Taliban fighters dressed in camouflage and brandishing machines guns while posing unmolested in an eastern province, not far from Kabul, under a gorgeous pink and blue sky. The text below, in Pashto and English, reads, ""IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FREEDOM.""



Wide distribution of such propaganda imagery would have been almost impossible for an insurgent movement there a generation ago, before the arrival of smartphones, Internet connections, and free social media services brought unprecedented online reach to Afghanistan. The nation lags the world in Internet connectivity but it has grown sharply over the past decade amid a gush of international investment.

What does Twitter have to say?

While the likes of Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok are resolute in their determination to shut down Taliban-related posts and videos, the paper said Twitter is not removing accounts purporting to speak for the Taliban.

Mediaite reported that when a Twitter spokesman was asked if the social media giant would join other tech companies in banning the terror group, he ""sidestepped the question"" and said in a statement that Twitter would ""continue to proactively enforce"" its rules on the ""glorification of violence, platform manipulation and spam.""

Anything else?

The Post also reported that the Taliban and its supporters ""have large numbers of accounts linked across numerous platforms to keep its messaging machinery from being easily squelched by the actions of one or two tech companies.""

""Based on the sheer volume of output, several of the accounts are run by individuals whose primary job may well be social media,"" Darren Linvill, lead researcher for the Clemson University Media Forensics Hub, told the paper. ""These accounts aren't run by Taliban leaders or fighters; they are run by individuals with uninterrupted Internet access on both a desktop and handheld device, as well as decent English language skills.""

More from the Post:

As it became clear in recent months that the Americans were going to finally leave, the Taliban's tactics grew still more sophisticated, with messages heralding each advance on the battlefield and promising that a better Afghanistan lay ahead.



One message on the Taliban's English-language website in April attacked feminism as ""a colonial tool"" and claimed that it ""attacks the institution of family in a family-centric Muslim society."" Another the following month espoused the importance of freedom of the press, calling it ""essential for every society and country.""



The Taliban's social media tactics in recent months can be seen as fitting a broader charm offensive — including recent conciliatory public remarks about pardoning those who worked with Americans and urging skilled people not to flee the country. At a news conference Tuesday, spokesman Shaheen made a point of calling on a female journalist and foreign reporters.

But Emerson Brooking — a resident senior fellow for the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, which is a Washington-based think tank — told the paper that skepticism may not be bad idea when it comes to the Taliban's social media machinations.

""We should be deeply distrustful of it,"" Brooking told the Post. ""Recriminations will come later.""

Trump bashed President Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal at rally,"Former President Donald Trump blasted President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan during a rally on Saturday in Cullman, Alabama. Trump also notched a viral moment by blasting wokeness, but the huge crowd wasn't as enthusiastic with the ex-president's stance on COVID-19 vaccinations.





At the rally in support of Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who is running for a Senate seat in the upcoming midterm elections, Trump took aim at the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal that has helped drop Biden's approval rating to the lowest of his presidency. Trump called Biden's calamitous Afghanistan withdrawal ""the greatest foreign policy humiliation in the history of the United States of America.""



""It didn't have to happen. All [Biden] had to do was leave the soldiers until everyone was out, our citizens, the weapons, and then you bomb the hell out of the bases and say, 'Bye-bye,'"" Trump told his supporters at the packed rally.

The Taliban has flaunted the possession of American weaponry, which the U.S. had supplied billions of dollars of military equipment to the now-fallen Afghan government.

""Joe Biden was going on vacation as Afghanistan was going to hell,"" Trump exclaimed. ""This is what you get when you have weakness in the White House. You can't have weakness in the White House.""



""They have to respect your president,"" he added. ""When I was president, we only had strength.""

Trump said the Biden administration ""tore up our really good plan"" on exiting Afghanistan. Trump added that his administration and the Taliban ""had a good understanding,"" and that if conditions were not met during the withdrawal that the U.S. would ""start dropping bombs all over the place,"" and told the fundamentalist organization's leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, that he would ""reign terror upon you"" if Americans were harmed.

""Vietnam looks like a Masterclass in strategy compared to Joe Biden's catastrophe,"" Trump told the exuberant crowd of an estimated 40,000 people.



""This will go down as one of the great military defeats of all time and it did not have to happen that way,"" Trump stated. ""This was not a withdrawal, this was a total surrender, for no reason.""

""He surrendered our airbase, he surrendered our weapons, he surrendered our embassy,"" Trump continued to bombard Biden.

""Biden's botched exit from Afghanistan is the most astonishing display of gross incompetence by a nation's leader, perhaps at any time,"" Trump said. ""And the nations of the world, both friend and foe, are looking at us and saying, ""What the hell happened to the United States of America so quickly?'""

""We could have gotten out with honor,"" the former president said. ""We should have gotten out with honor. And instead we got out with the exact opposite of honor.""

""Very soon we're going to have September 11 and we're going to have — because of Biden — the Taliban flag flying over the embassy,"" Trump declared.





""I warned the entire country of the disastrous consequences of a Biden presidency,"" Trump boasted. ""I understood, a lot of you understood it. I said Joe Biden would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a pandemic. He did.""



""I predicted that he would unleash a wave of violent crime that would turn our cities into a nightmare of killing and bloodshed,"" Trump proclaimed at his fourth post-presidential rally.

Before he took the stage in Alabama, a video clip from the movie ""Patton"" starring George C. Scott played for the large audience.

""Do you think that [General George S. Patton] was woke? I don't think so. He was the exact opposite,"" Trump declared, and then skewered current ""woke"" U.S. military leaders, such as General Mark A. Milley who defended studying critical race theory in the military.

Trump also blasted ""woke generals"" in his first post-presidential rally that was held in June.

""You know what woke means? It means you're a loser,"" Trump gibed. ""It's true. Everything woke turns to sh**.""



Trump then applauded U.S. soccer star Carli Lloyd, who stood up at the Tokyo Olympics while her teammates kneeled as a form of protest against discrimination.

Tucker Carlson: Bank of America secretly handed over private customer data to the FBI following Capitol riot,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed in a bombshell report Thursday night that Bank of America, the nation's second-largest bank serving more than 60 million people, secretly surveilled customers considered to be persons of interest following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and handed over their private information to federal investigators.

Carlson reported on air Thursday that his team exclusively obtained evidence that ""in the days after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, Bank of America went through its own customers' financial and transaction records"" at the request of federal law enforcement investigators, searching its databases for ""people who fit a specific profile.""

The profile went as follows, according to Carlson: ""1. Customers confirmed as transacting, either through bank account, debit card, or credit card, purchases in Washington, D.C. between 1/5 and 1/6. 2. Purchases made for Hotel/Airbnb RSVPs in DC, VA, and MD after 1/6. 3. Any purchase of weapons or at a weapons-related merchant between 1/7 and their upcoming suspected stay in D.C. area around Inauguration Day. 4. Airline related purchases since 1/6.""

During the probe, Bank of America eventually identified 211 customers who met the ""thresholds of interest"" and proceeded to turn those customers' information over to investigators without their knowledge or consent.

Tucker: Bank of America secretly turned over customer data to FBI youtu.be

FBI investigators reportedly used the information to interview at least one of the unsuspecting customers, although that person was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.

""Imagine if you were that person,"" said Carlson. ""The FBI hauls you in for questioning in a terror investigation, not because you've done anything suspicious, but because you bought plane tickets and visited your country's capital. Now they're sweating you because your bank, which you trust with your most private information, has ratted you out without your knowledge. Because Bank of America did that, you are being treated like a member of Al Qaeda.""

When Carlson's team reached out to Bank of America, the bank responded without denying the claim.

""We don't comment on our communications with law enforcement. All banks have responsibilities under federal law to cooperate with law enforcement inquiries in full compliance with the law,"" the statement reportedly said.

A Bank of America spokesperson gave the same exact response to the Washington Examiner.

Carlson suggested that while Bank of America's actions are certainly troubling, they may also be illegal. A relevant law on the books is 12 U.S.C. 3403, a federal law that protects the confidentiality of financial records. Though the law does appear to allow banks to tip off government authorities to information that ""may be relevant to a possible violation of any statute or regulation.""

The question becomes, what constitutes information relevant to a crime?

""Does buying a muffin in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5 make you a potential domestic extremist?"" Carlson asked. ""According to Bank of America, yes. Yes, it does.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tucker-carlson-bank-of-america,2021-02-05
"Tucker Carlson says he was 'scared' after learning of NSA spying allegations, 'felt like kind of a lunatic' by going public","Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Wednesday that when he first learned that the National Security Agency was allegedly monitoring his communications, the news ""scared"" him.

Carlson, who hosts the No. 1 cable TV news show with an average of more than 3 million viewers in July, made a bold accusation against the Biden administration in late June when he claimed the NSA was ""monitoring our electronic communications"" and ""planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air.""

His claims sparked a media firestorm and prompted a rare response from the agency denying his allegations and stating that Carlson ""has never been an intelligence target."" Shortly after Carlson made the allegations, Axios reported that the cable TV host was communicating with U.S.-based Kremlin intermediaries to set up an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that the government had learned of his outreach.

In an interview with BlazeTV host Glenn Beck on Wednesday, Carlson described the moment he says he learned that the NSA was monitoring his communications.

""I was in Washington for a funeral. I moved out of Washington after 35 years, I didn't have much choice. And I was back. I ran into a very old, very close friend of mine who said, 'let's get together, and talk about something.' Who said, in person, 'you're planning this trip to Russia,'"" Carlson said.

""And I said, well, I haven't told anyone that. So I don't know how you would know. Because — and then this person told me, that the NSA had been reading my electronic communications. My texts and emails. And had unmasked me. And was going to spread this to news organizations, to suggest that I was somehow a disloyal American.""

""And it actually scared me,"" Carlson told Beck. ""I'm not normally rattled by stuff. But that's so over the top.""

After being told the NSA had allegedly looked at his emails, Carlson said he sought the advice of an unnamed U.S. senator, who suggested that he go public with the allegations ""as a self-defense move.""

""I felt like kind of a lunatic,"" Carlson admitted. ""You don't want to go on TV — would you want to go on the air and say, they're spying on me? No. You sound like a nutcase. But I didn't feel like I had a choice.""

The NSA denied the allegation that Carlson was an intelligence target or that anyone at the agency sought to have his show taken off the air. But critics pointed out that the careful wording of the NSA's public statement did not rule out that Carlson's communications had been incidentally collected or that he had been unmasked by someone working for the government.



The NSA's internal watchdog announced Tuesday that it would open an investigation into Carlson's allegations. Inspector General Robert Storch will examine the agency's ""compliance with applicable legal authorities"" and its policies on collecting and sharing information. Storch will also examine whether the agency's actions were based on ""improper considerations.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of the critics of the agency's public denial of Carlson's allegations, welcomed the review as ""an important step toward ensuring public confidence. It is important that this review is as transparent as possible so it doesn't fuel further public suspicion and distrust.""

But Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, told the Associated Press that Carlson's allegations were the ""latest right-wing attempt to damage our security services.""

""People like Tucker Carlson can't help themselves,"" Himes said. ""They're badly hurting our intelligence community with outright lies.""

Speaking with Beck, Carlson said that his critics are angry with him because he has opinions that dissent from the government-approved narratives.

""You should have the expectation, if you live in America, you criticize the regime, then you they read your email,"" Carlson said. ""So, I thought that was illegal, and un-American. And an assault on civil liberties. But I learned from the Daily Beast, that actually if you complain about it, then you hate America. So just shut up and accept it. You have no privacy. The War on Terror has been turned against American citizens. But you deserve it, because you're a white supremacist. That's what I've been told.""

Carlson said that the idea that the law enforcement and national security power of the federal government could be turned against American citizens was a ""nightmare scenario"" that all Americans should be concerned about.

""You can't turn the awesome law enforcement, and intel-gathering powers of the federal government, against American citizens, on a wholesale basis,"" Carlson said. ""Like, that's the nightmare scenario. We have a lot of laws in place designed to prevent it. Now, it's happening. And it's just bewildering to me, that nobody says anything about it. This is totally cool. This is the way it works. It's not cool. It's not the way it works. If you care about democracy, you're opposed to this, with everything that you have.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tucker-carlson-scared-nsa-spying,2021-08-11
'Soviet-style politics': Tucker Carlson punches back at Rep. Crenshaw for calling McCarthy opponents 'terrorists',"Fox News host Tucker Carlson sharply rebuked Rep. Dan Crenshaw on Wednesday after the Texas Republican rhetorically condemned some of his fellow Republicans as ""terrorists.""

What did Crenshaw say?

Crenshaw has described the faction of Republicans blocking McCarthy as ""enemies,"" claiming they are choosing ""notoriety over principle.""

On Wednesday, Crenshaw elevated his rhetoric. He accused his fellow Republicans of engaging in ""terrorism tactics"" and declared that Republicans ""cannot let the terrorists win.""

Crenshaw's accusations came as Republican infighting has effectively rendered the House of Representatives useless. The legislative body cannot begin operations until a new speaker is chosen, and unless McCarthy bows out of the race or makes concessions, it may be many more days until the impasse is resolved.

What did Carlson say?

Responding to Crenshaw on his Fox News show, Carlson rebuked Crenshaw for constructing uncharitable dichotomies of McCarthy's opponents.

Referring to Crenshaw as a ""neocon,"" Carlson said, ""They're coming out and telling you what they told you about Iraq: Either you're with us or against us. You're on the side of light or darkness. You're good or evil.""

Crenshaw, according to Carlson, is engaging in ""Soviet-style politics"" when he refers to the McCarthy opposition as ""enemies.""

""You may like Kevin McCarthy or not. Both are allowed,"" Carlson explained. ""But no matter how you feel, you have to acknowledge, if you're being honest, that people who don't like Kevin McCarthy have a reason for that. They have real concerns, real issues.

""Instead he impugned their motive, their character, their intelligence, their moral standing,"" he continued. ""They're 'narcissists.' In fact, and we're quoting, they're 'enemies' now.



""What you just saw as Dan Crenshaw spoke is the snarling face of the donor class revealed for all to see, finally. The deep loathing of disobedient voters that may be their most passionate secret emotion,"" he said. ""But they're not bothering to hide that emotion anymore. Now you know how they really feel.""

Did Crenshaw respond?

The Texas congressman hit back at Carlson late Wednesday, telling him to ""unclutch your pearls"" and ""grow thicker skin.""

""Unclutch your pearls,"" Crenshaw wrote on Twitter. ""It's a figure of speech. You can't insult, slander, and hold everyone hostage with no way out — and not expect me to punch back. Grow thicker skin.""

"Tulsi Gabbard labels Adam Schiff, John Brennan as 'domestic enemies' of the US","Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard issued a dire warning to the American people on Tuesday, expressing concern that ""domestic enemies"" of the United States, in the national security community and Big Tech industry, are plotting to create a ""police state"" in America.

Gabbard, who served as the U.S. representative for Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District from 2013 to 2021, posted a video to social media in which she spoke out against efforts to expand the federal government's national security powers after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. In the video, she called out former CIA Director John Brennan and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), two leading proponents of expanding national security powers, labeling them ""domestic enemies"" of the country.

""The mob who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop Congress from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities were behaving like domestic enemies of our country,"" Gabbard said. ""But let's be clear, the John Brennans, Adam Schiffs and the oligarchs in Big Tech who are trying to undermine our constitutionally protected rights and turn our country into a police state with KGB-style surveillance are also domestic enemies — and much more powerful, and therefore dangerous, than the mob that stormed the Capitol.""

The video cuts to a clip from MSNBC of Brennan saying that members of the Biden administration ""are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we see overseas."" Brennan was speaking of individuals and groups like those that formed the mob that laid siege to the Capitol.

The events of Jan. 6 have been compared in the media to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a comparison some have used to call for a ""Domestic War on Terror,"" demanding that the U.S. employ strategies here at home akin to those used against ISIS and al-Qaeda abroad. Rep. Schiff in 2019 introduced legislation that would create a federal domestic terrorism criminal statute. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) would establish new offices in the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the FBI to investigate domestic terrorism in the U.S.

Civil liberties advocates like Gabbard have spoken out against a war on terror here at home. A group of progressive representatives, led by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), last week called on congressional leaders to reject efforts to pass Durbin's Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act and oppose new legislation that would expand the national security state.

Gabbard is calling on President Joe Biden and the Congress to defend American civil liberties.

""President Biden, I call upon you & all of Congress from both parties to denounce efforts by Brennan & others to take away our civil liberties endowed to us by our Creator & guaranteed in our Constitution. If you don't stand up to them now, then our country will be in great peril,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-adam-schiff-john-brennan-domestic-enemies,2021-01-26
"Tulsi Gabbard blasts cancel culture, warns that its 'final expression' is found in Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda","Former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard blasted cancel culture and warned that its adherents who shut down those they disagree with are walking a dangerous path, as the ""final expression"" of cancel culture can be found in Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda.

What are the details?

The Hawaii Democrat — who sounds more and more like a Republican every day — offered her take during a Tuesday interview with Fox News' Trey Gowdy, saying ""the foundation of our democracy"" is based on ""freedom of speech, freedom for every single one of us to be able to share our ideas and debate them, to argue them, to agree or to disagree.""

Gabbard also addressed the misinformation goblin that's led to much leftist pearl-clutching of late. She argued that ideas ""that may be misleading or dangerous"" can be countered — not be silencing them — but by defeating them with ""superior"" ideas in the ""free marketplace."" Then people can ""choose what they want to believe or not to believe, or what they want to adhere to,"" she said.

""Cancel culture is the opposite of this,"" Gabbard continued. ""It is exactly the opposite of this foundational principle of our democracy. It means that in a cancel culture, you have some people who believe that they are special, that they are superior, that they have the power to be able to shut down those who have ideas and views that are different, who may follow a path that they deem to be the wrong path."" She said that such cancel-happy folk ""will therefore say, 'No, we're going to place obstacles in front of you, we're going to silence certain voices'"" — except for ""those who agree with us and the path that we deem to be right.""

'Where does this cancel culture lead us?'

Gabbard said the core of her belief in free expression and conviction that cancel culture is wrong is ""based on the fact that we are all children of God. And recognizing that, we then treat each other with respect and respect this freedom that we have.""

""So, let's look down the path and say, 'OK ... where does this cancel culture lead us?' You see the final expression of cancel culture in Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda who basically go and behead those who … they deem to be infidels or heretics in order to silence them — in order to 'protect' others from being misled,"" she said.

""And so when we look at cancel culture here at home, we see those efforts to cancel or silence those that … they don't want the people to hear from, those who may offer a different idea than the one that those in power want people to see or to hear, or to be exposed to,"" Gabbard reasoned, adding that ""this is the danger of where this path leads us — unless we as individuals stand up against it.""

She also decried frequent outcomes of cancel culture: people who've fallen victim to its ""fearmongering"" and ""bullying"" and have lost jobs, family and friends, popularity, and even ""likes on social media.""

""This requires us to ask the question of ourselves, 'Who are we trying to please?'"" Gabbard wondered.

'Pleasing to God'

Gabbard concluded by telling Gowdy that ""life is short, death can come at any time, and I was happiest — and am happiest — when trying to live my life to be pleasing to God, to my best friend. And so as I've gone through my life — and especially in politics, the media is coming at you with attacks, political opponents, social media — I have always found that peace and that strength ... in knowing that God has unconditional love for all of us.""

Tulsi Gabbard slams Biden for calling MAGA terrorists,"President Joe Biden lashed out at the ""MAGA crowd"" and supporters of former President Donald Trump on Wednesday. The harsh and derogatory disparagement against tens of millions of Americans prodded former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to condemn President Biden.

On Wednesday, Biden suggested that the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade was a slippery slope.

Biden proposed a hypothetical situation, ""What happens if you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children?""

President Biden told reporters at the White House, ""Is that legit under the way the decision is written? What are the next things that are going to be attacked?""

""Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history,"" Biden said, making a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.

Some are comparing Biden's insults against millions of Americans to Hillary Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" remark that she made leading up to the 2016 presidential election.

""You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said at an LGBT-centered fundraiser. ""The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.""

CNN host Michael Smerconish warned that Biden risks suffering backlash to attack Americans in the same way that Clinton did.

""I think that that backfired on her,"" Smerconish said of Clinton's comments. ""I think that she regretted it. I think it became a rallying cry. You remember there was merchandise, there was merch at the time. People were wearing T-shirts proudly proclaiming that they were part of the deplorables.""

Smerconish noted that ""it’s a fine line"" to besmirch fellow Americans who may not vote the way you want them to.

Gabbard was incensed by Biden's incendiary remarks and slammed the president during an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

""When you look at the President of the United States of America calling millions of Americans, essentially terrorists, people who politically opposed him or voted against him, he's calling them terrorists in an attempt to intimidate them into silence. And we know this because we've heard this before from both him and his attorney general.""

Gabbard pointed to the Justice Department's newly-formed ""Domestic Terrorism Unit"" that will target the ""elevated threat from domestic violent extremists.""

""You remember when his attorney general said, you know, anyone who holds extremist or anti-authority views will be targeted for investigation and potential prosecution by their domestic terrorist unit,"" Gabbard said. ""So he's essentially saying that this, quote-unquote 'MAGA' crowd are worse than terrorists. This is outrageous.""

""And so for every American who's watching, every American who's seen this, no matter how you feel about the MAGA crowd, this is an authoritarian assault on our freedom,"" the former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii proclaimed. ""And we need to stand together very strongly against this attempt to intimidate and silence anyone who holds political views that are different from or opposed to what this president and his administration are furthering. This is an assault on our democracy.""

Tulsi Gabbard rips Biden's comments on the MAGA crowd: 'Outrageous' www.youtube.com

In January, Gabbard trashed Biden for ""pouring fuel on the fire of divisiveness.""

""Biden promised to unite our country,"" Gabbard wrote on Twitter. ""Instead he betrayed us, pouring fuel on the fire of divisiveness, tearing our country apart. Biden compares those who disagree with him to racists, traitors & enemies, & has his AG target Americans as domestic terrorists. Unfit to lead.""

One of Biden's most consistent messages during the 2020 presidential campaign was ""unity.""

""Unity"" took center stage during Biden's inaugural speech.

""History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity,"" Biden said. ""We can see each other, not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.""

""No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward,"" Biden declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-joe-biden-maga-terrorists,2022-05-05
"Tulsi Gabbard bashes Joe Biden as 'unfit to lead,' blames him for 'pouring fuel on the fire of divisiveness, tearing our country apart'","Democrat Tulsi Gabbard — who has never been shy about criticizing her own party — took President Joe Biden to task for failing to deliver on a major campaign promise. Gabbard roasted President Biden in two videos shared on social media this week, accusing him of ""doing all he can do divide us.""

Gabbard shared a video clip of Biden's speech on voting rights he delivered on Tuesday in Atlanta.

""I will defend the right to vote, our democracy against all enemies — foreign and, yes, domestic,"" Biden said.

Biden then equated anyone supporting voting rights legislation that Democrats are in favor of — even if it means altering Senate rules to get the bill past a Republican filibuster — to virtuous civil rights leaders while villainizing anyone who doesn't support the Democratic legislation by comparing them to segregationists and a leader of the Confederacy.



Biden stated, ""At consequential moments in history, they present a choice: Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis? This is the moment to decide to defend our elections, to defend our democracy.""

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) – the No. 2 Senate Democrat – admitted Wednesday, ""Perhaps the President went a little too far in his rhetoric — some of us do — but the fundamental principles and values at stake are very, very similar.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) described Biden's speech as ""profoundly unpresidential.""

""I have known, liked, and personally respected Joe Biden for many years,"" McConnell said Wednesday from the Senate floor. ""I did not recognize the man at the podium yesterday.""

Gabbard denounced Biden's speech, and said it was worse than in 2016 when then-candidate Hillary Clinton called 50% of supporters of former President Donald Trump as fitting into a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Hillary’s calling tens of millions of Americans deplorables was divisive & disgusting,"" Gabbard wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. ""But Biden has gone further, calling those who disagree with his actions & policies domestic enemies, traitors, and racists. Biden promised to unite us, but he is doing all he can do divide us.""

Biden repeatedly promised to bring ""unity"" back to the United States during his presidential campaign and in his inaugural address.

On Friday, Gabbard chewed out President Biden again for not uniting the country as he promised.

""Biden promised to unite our country,"" Gabbard tweeted. ""Instead he betrayed us, pouring fuel on the fire of divisiveness, tearing our country apart. Biden compares those who disagree with him to racists, traitors & enemies, & has his AG target Americans as domestic terrorists. Unfit to lead.""



Gabbard noted in the video, ""I supported Joe Biden, and millions of other Americans voted for Joe Biden because he promised to unite us. He promised to bring us together, to end the divisiveness.""

""Sadly, not only has he failed to do this, he has betrayed us all by pouring fuel on the fires of divisiveness that are tearing our country apart,"" Gabbard said.

""Now Biden compares those who disagree with him to racists, traitors, to enemies of bygone eras,"" the former Democratic presidential candidate said. ""And Biden now has his attorney general targeting millions of Americans as domestic terrorists.""

The video included a clip of Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen announcing that the Justice Department will launch a new unit that will target domestic terrorism.

""We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists — that is, individuals in the United States who seek to commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of domestic social or political goals,"" Olsen said on Tuesday while testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""Domestic violent extremists are often motivated by a mix of ideologies and personal grievances. We have seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies.""

Gabbard warned, ""If we allow this to continue, our country, our country, the country that we love, the land of the free, the home of the brave, it’ll be unrecognizable, and it will be lost forever.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-joe-biden-unity,2022-01-14

UK boarding school turns over its chaplain to anti-terrorism authorities — after he preached against school's LGBTQ policies,"A boarding school in the United Kingdom secretly turned over its chaplain to an anti-terrorism program after preaching a sermon in which he defended students' rights to question the school's new LGBTQ policies, the Daily Mail reported.

What are the details?

The Rev. Dr. Bernard Randall told students at independent Trent College near Nottingham that it was OK for them to disagree with the policies, especially if they go against Church of England principles, the outlet said.

One of the school's new policies was to ""develop a whole school LGBT+ inclusive curriculum,"" the Daily Mail said.

But when the powers that be at the boarding school deemed Randall's sermon ""harmful"" to LGBTQ students, the school turned him in to Prevent, which the outlet said normally identifies individuals at risk of radicalization.

However, after police investigated the tip, they told Trent College that the 48-year-old chaplain posed ""no counter terrorism risk, or risk of radicalization,"" the Daily Mail said, adding that Derbyshire Police confirmed the case ""did not meet the threshold for a Prevent referral.""

But it wasn't over

But the outlet added that Randall — a former Cambridge University chaplain and Oxford graduate — revealed that Trent College later informed him that his future sermons would be censored in advance and that his chapel services would be monitored ""to ensure that ... requirements are met.""

And then Randall was fired, the Daily Mail said.

While the outlet said he's suing for discrimination, harassment, victimization, and unfair dismissal, he shared that ""my career and life are in tatters.""

What did he say in his sermon?

Randall said his June 2019 sermon in the school chapel was prompted by concerns from students about an organization called Educate & Celebrate, which was invited to ""embed gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the fabric"" of the school, the Daily Mail said.



""You should no more be told you have to accept LGBT ideology than you should be told you must be in favor of Brexit or must be Muslim,"" Randall preached, according to the outlet.

However, he also encouraged students to ""treat each other with respect,"" the Daily Mail said.

And then a few days later, Randall said he was called to a meeting and told the sermon was inflammatory, divisive, and ""harmful to LGBT pupils,"" the outlet noted.

The Daily Mail said Randall only discovered the anti-terrorism referral because it was mentioned in documents given to him ahead of a disciplinary hearing: ""I had visions of being investigated by MI5, of men knocking down the front door.""

The school finally made Randall ""redundant"" on Dec. 31, 2020, according to Staffordshire Live, which cited the Christian Legal Centre, the organization supporting Randall.

Toby Young of the Free Speech Union told the outlet that Randall's sermon was ""fantastic"" and that it insists ""no one has a monopoly on moral truth. For Bernard Randall to lose his job as a result of this sermon is scandalous. What's so depressing about his treatment is the message it sends to the pupils. The central theme of his sermon is that children shouldn't be afraid to think for themselves. But the message the school has sent is the opposite. Schools should be teaching children how to think, not what to think.""

Andrea Williams — chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre — asked, ""Who are the extremists in this story? The partisan agency who teach young children that they can be born in the wrong body, or the school chaplain moderately presenting what the Christian church has taught about marriage, sex, and gender for the past 2,000 years?"" the Daily Mail said.

Randall's case is scheduled for a hearing in June, the outlet said, adding that Trent College declined to comment.

Ukraine says Russia kidnapped Melitopol mayor,"Ukraine is saying that Russia has abuducted Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol.



""They have transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared in a video address Friday, according to the Associated Press.

Zelenskyy's comments come as Ukraine fights to repel Russian invaders who have been conducting a brutal campaign that has wreaked death and destruction.

Video: Huge fireball erupts after Russian tank-landing ship explodes; Ukrainian navy says vessel was 'destroyed',"A massive fireball erupted from a Russian Navy amphibious ship while it was docked in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk in southern Ukraine on Thursday. The Ukrainian navy asserted the tank-landing ship had been ""destroyed.""

Video shows a huge explosion and fire on the Project 1171 Alligator-class landing ship Orsk. A thick black plume of smoke billowed from the fiery ship and spread over the harbor.

БЕРДЯНСК: взрывы и пожар в порту 24 марта 2022 года www.youtube.com

""There have been claims made that the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an attack on the Orsk, potentially using one of their Tochka (SS-21 Scarab) short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), but there’s so far no evidence to confirm exactly what led to the inferno on the vessel,"" the Drive reported.



The Ukrainian navy claimed on Facebook, ""In the temporarily captured Russian port Berdyansk, a large paratrooper ship 'Orsk' of the Black Sea Fleet of occupiers was destroyed.""

Ukraine’s armed forces celebrated on social media by saying, ""The morning starts with good news! The large landing ship 'Orsk' of the Black Sea Fleet of the occupiers was destroyed in the captured Russian port of Berdyansk.""

""That’s only the beginning,” a Ukrainian military source told the Times.

The 370-foot ship can transport as many as 425 troops as well as 20 tanks or 40 armored vehicles and is beachable to unload vehicles on land.

Two Project 775 Ropucha-II class landing ships — Tsesar Kunikov and Novocherkassk — had burning debris on their decks, and the fires were quickly extinguished, according to military analyst H.I. Sutton.



""It marks the largest ship that Ukrainian forces have managed to strike so-far and represents another embarrassing loss for Vladimir Putin's beleaguered army,"" according to the Daily Mail.



A day before the strike, Russian state media was touting the ships supplying reinforcements at the captured port city on the Sea of Azov. The video shows armored personnel carriers being extracted from the Orsk.

""By land, air and now sea, Russian troops continue to advance and reinforce into Ukraine,"" RT reporter Murad Gazdiev said in the video. ""The Azov Sea, with its ports and towns, is now under Russian control...which has allowed Russia's Black Sea fleet to and the Orsk landing ship to stage this operation.""

Berdyansk was captured by Russian military forces on Feb. 27. The port city is roughly 50 miles southwest of the besieged city of Mariupol.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that approximately 100,000 people are enduring ""inhumane conditions"" in Mariupol.

""For more than a week now, we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror,"" Zelenskyy said during a televised address.

Zelenskyy said the people of Maiupol have ""no food, no water, no medicine.""

The local council in Mariupol said Russian airstrikes were turning the city into the ""ashes of a dead land.""

Drone footage released this week by Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs shows the devastation to Mariupol after weeks of heavy shelling by the Russian military. Russian bombardments from artillery, airstrikes, and naval vessels have turned the city into ruins.

Communist Chinese government flexes international 'clout' by defeating UN vote to debate China's genocide of the Uyghurs,"On Thursday, the United Nations' human rights council voted on an American-led motion to hold a debate about human rights abuses committed by communist China against Uyghurs in the nation's western region of Xinjiang. Of the council's 47 nation state members, 36 voted: 19 against and 17 for the motion. The result, said to be an ""abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims"" by Human Rights Watch's China director, Sophie Richardson, is regarded as a win for the communist regime.

The motion proposed debate regarding the findings of a 48-page U.N. rights office report published on August 31 that detailed potential ""crimes against humanity"" in Xinjiang. While the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and a number of other countries have already formally declared the Chinese communist party's (CCP) internment and ethnic cleansing of the country's Uyghur population a genocide, this debate would have invited greater international scrutiny.

The result of the vote also revealed China's growing international influence and leverage over third-world countries.



The vote

The following countries voted against the motion to debate whether the CCP's genocide constitutes a human rights concern: Bolivia; Cameroon; China; Cote d'Ivoire; Cuba; Eritrea; Gabon; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Mauritania; Namibia; Nepal; Pakistan; Qatar; Senegal; Sudan; United Aram Emirates; Uzbekistan; and Venezuela.



A number of countries abstained from voting, including Brazil, India, Mexico and Ukraine.

In addition to the European powers, a handful of countries supported the American motion including the Republic of Korea, Japan and Somalia.

The response

Though not surprised by the result, Olaf Wientzek of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation suggested that it damaged the credibility of the UN and ""shows China's diplomatic clout."" He emphasized that the motion did not propose a monitoring mechanism, but simply debate, but ""that was too much for many members.""

The U.K. ambassador in Geneva, Simon Manley, stated: ""China's attempts to stifle debate and hide the truth will not succeed.""

Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group said, ""It's a serious blow for the credibility of the council and a clear victory for China ... Many developing countries will see it as an adjustment away from Western predominance in the UN human rights system.""

Zhang Meifang, consul general of China in Belfast, tweeted ""Justice prevails!""

A spokesman for the communist Chinese regime's ministry of foreign affairs stated, ""The issues related to Xinjiang are not about human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism.""

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said, ""Today's vote protects the perpetrators of human rights violations rather than the victims — a dismaying result that puts the U.N.’s main human rights body in the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the U.N.’s own human rights office.""

The report

The topic for the precluded debate was the Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner's report. This report countered the CCP's claims that its suppression, internment, and murder of Uyghurs were justifiable as part of a broader ""counter-extremism"" strategy.

Among the report's recommendations, it suggested that a thorough investigation be undertaken into ""allegations of torture, sexual violence, ill-treatment, forced medical treatment, as well as forced labour and reports of deaths in custody.""

Uyghurs who have escaped China have detailed forced late-term abortions, routine tortures, and forced labor in China's re-education camps (called ""Vocational Education and Training Centers"" by the CCP) where an estimated 1 million people have been confined in recent years.

Xinjiang itself has reportedly been transformed into an open air prison camp.

Uyghur neighborhoods are surrounded by militarized checkpoints. Those who want to leave are retinal-scanned. Each neighborhood is assigned a ""grid monitor"" who surveils their activities and ensures against their adherence to religious customs.

According to Nury Turkel, the chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Uyghurs outside the camps are subjected to ""a barrage of scans, tests and examinations ... [including] retinal scans and fingerprints ... blood or hair samples ... for DNA profiling.""

The New York Post reported that they must also ""read from a set text for forty-five minutes so their voices could be recorded and identified,"" enabling spies to determine who was talking in tapped and taped communications.

Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote that Xinjiang, home to nearly 12 million Uyghurs, ""may be the most tightly controlled media environment on Earth, on part with North Korea.""

A 2020 report from the Washington-based Center for Global Policy indicated that under the pretenses of a ""poverty alleviation"" scheme, the CCP forces an estimated 570,000 Uyghurs to to pick cotton by hand for the CCP.

The UN high commissioner's report suggested that the CCP's actions may also ""constitute international crimes.""



Just as Christians who have fled China are hunted down internationally by the CCP, so too are Uyghurs. In fact, the recently exposed international network of communist Chinese police stations that operate in the U.S., Canada and Europe, reportedly help keep tabs on those who have escaped persecution in Xinjiang.

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" documenting these extralegal forward operating communist bases.

While touted as pseudo-embassies, the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law. Uyghurs who have fled China are regarded by the regime as lawbreakers.

In fact, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

According to a 2021 Freedom House report, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

International implications

All of the nations that voted against the motion have been pulled into China's sphere of international influence.

China, which has been materially supporting Russia during its war on Ukraine, has expanded this influence, in part, through its Belt and Road Initiative. Through its BRI, the CCP helps poorer nations build ports, rail lines and telecommunications networks, as well as secure financing. Since this assistance is usually unaffordable by design, the BRI transforms countries into politically malleable debtors. The Economic Times characterized BRI as one of ""China's colonial advances wrapped in benign global treaties.""

The New York Times reported that extra to economic leverage, some in the U.S. suspect that BRI is enabling China to build ""a globe-spanning bloc of nations that will mostly buy Chinese goods and tilt toward China's authoritarian political model.""

Every one of the countries on the human rights council that voted with China are part of the BRI. Somalia was the outlier, which is part of BRI but nevertheless took a stand.

Liu Mingfu, a retired colonel in the Chinese communist military, wrote a book to which Chinese president Xi Jinping has referred, entitled ""The China Dream."" Liu, a proponent for communist Chinese global supremacy, characterized the competition between China and the U.S. not a ""shooting duel"" or ""boxing match,"" but as a ""track and field"" competition, or a marathon.

Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, indicated in the book ""The Hundred-Year Marathon"" that elements of the communist Chinese regime have long aspired to ""replace the United States as the economic, military, and political leader of the world by the year 2049 (the one hundredth anniversary of the Communist Revolution),"" in part to ""avenge or 'wipe clean' (xi xue) past foreign humiliations,"" such as the Chinese addiction to opium in the 19th century.

Pillsbury stated that the CCP's aim is ""a world without American global supremacy.""

Pillsbury detailed how Liu and other influential Chinese political thinkers believe China to have a responsibility ""to 'improve' all the nations and people of the world by 'harmonizing' them—spreading Chinese values, language, and culture so they can better fit into under heaven. This empire 'values order over freedom, ethics over law, and elite governance over democracy and human rights.'""

In addition to evidencing China's growing political clout, Thursday's UN vote hints at the nature and priorities of the world order the CCP seeks to establish.



'Cesspool of political bias'

The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the council because of its inclusion of numerous human rights abusers such as China, Cuba, Pakistan and Venezuela. The U.S. was the first country in the council's 12-year history to drop out voluntarily.

Then-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, ""We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights."" She added, ""the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.""

Report: Head of US Central Command met with Taliban to beg for non-interference with evacuation at Kabul airport,"The head of U.S. Central Command met face-to-face with senior Taliban leaders Sunday to plead with the Islamist militants for non-interference with the U.S. military's evacuation efforts at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan, the Associated Press reported.

According to an anonymous defense official, Gen. Frank McKenzie met with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, and won their agreement to establish a ""deconfliction mechanism"" — an agreement to permit evacuation operations at the airport without interference from the new Taliban government in Kabul.

McKenzie reportedly told the Taliban that the U.S. military would respond forcefully to defend the airport should the Islamist militants interfere with evacuation efforts.

The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan Sunday after taking control of the capital in Kabul and overthrowing the Western-backed government there. President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and the U.S.-trained Afghani security forces collapsed.

Desperate Afghani citizens have rushed to the Hamid Karzai International Airport seeking to board international flights and flee the country. Videos posted to social media show the airport in utter chaos, with people clinging to a departing U.S. Air Force C-17 transport plane and the tarmac severely overcrowded.

The mass confusion forced U.S. troops to temporarily suspended evacuations until the tarmac could be cleared. According to Reuters, U.S. troops fired into the air to deter people from attempting to force their way onto a military flight evacuating U.S. diplomats and embassy staff.

The Pentagon said Monday that an additional 1,000 troops would be sent to join the 5,000 troops already stationed in Afghanistan to protect evacuation efforts and defend the airport. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that American forces killed two armed individuals at the airport during the evacuation.

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul was evacuated Sunday and diplomats were relocated to the airport. Ambassador Ross Wilson is still in Afghanistan, according to ABC News. He will remain in the country with the ""core"" team of diplomats to continue the embassy's work as evacuation efforts proceed.

The fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban follows President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw U.S. forces before the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that led to the U.S. war on terror. Over two decades, the U.S. spent billions of dollars on counter-insurgency strategies against Taliban fighters and training for the Afghani military to secure their country.

"US drone airstrike killed family, not ISIS, NYT report says","A United States military airstrike against a suspected terrorist in Afghanistan may have actually killed an innocent man who worked for a U.S. aid group in Kabul and his family, a new report claimed.

The U.S. launched an airstrike on Aug. 29, one day before the final American evacuation flights out of Kabul.

""U.S. military forces conducted a self-defense unmanned over-the-horizon airstrike today on a vehicle in Kabul, eliminating an imminent ISIS-K threat to [Hamid] Karzai International airport,"" Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said on the day of the bombing.

""We are confident we successfully hit the target,"" Urban asserted. ""Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.""

""We are assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time,"" he concluded. ""We remain vigilant for potential future threats.""

On Aug. 30, Major General William Taylor told reporters, ""U.S. military forces conducted an unmanned over-the-horizon air strike on a vehicle known to be an imminent ISIS-K threat. This self-defense strike successfully hit the target near Kabul airport. Significant secondary explosions from the targeted vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.""

On Sept. 1, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ""We had very good intelligence that ISIS-K was preparing a specific-type vehicle at a specific-type location. We monitored that through various means, and all of the engagement criteria were being met. We went through the same level of rigor that we've done for years.""

""I don't want to influence the outcome of an investigation — but at this point we think that the procedures were correctly followed and it was a righteous strike,"" Milley stated.

During an Aug. 31 speech marking the end of nearly 20 years of U.S. military action in Afghanistan, President Joe Biden boasted of the Kabul airstrike and the drone attack in the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan.

""We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our servicemembers and dozens of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet,"" Biden stated in the White House State Dining Room.



However, a New York Times article disputed the Biden administration's account of what actually happened during the Kabul airstrike, and contended that the airstrike killed an innocent family and not ISIS terrorists.

According to the report, drone operators began tracking a car belonging to Zemari Ahmadi, a white Toyota Corolla, which is reportedly the same type of vehicle that ISIS militants used to escape after launching rockets at the Kabul airport.

Newly released security camera footage shows Ahmadi filling containers with water at his employer's office and loading them into his car. He was transporting colleagues to and from work, and they were seen carrying laptop computers.

""According to his relatives, as Mr. Ahmadi pulled into his courtyard, several of his children and his brothers' children came out, excited to see him, and sat in the car as he backed it inside,"" the Times reported.

The U.S. military launched a Hellfire missile fired from a Reaper drone at the vehicle, believing that it was being packed with explosives for an attack on the airport.

""At first I thought it was the Taliban,"" Samia Ahmadi, Ahmadi's daughter who was inside the family's home when the missile attack occurred, told the New York Times. ""But the Americans themselves did it.""

""I saw the whole scene,"" Samia Ahmadi said. ""There were burnt pieces of flesh everywhere.""

Zemari Ahmadi and nine members of his family, including seven children, were killed by the drone strike, according to his brother, Romal Ahmadi. The drone strike allegedly killed Ahmadi, three of his children, three of his brother's children, two 3-year-old girls, and one of his cousins.

Samia's fiancé, Ahmad Naser, a former army officer and contractor with the U.S. military, was allegedly among the 10 people killed in the drone strike.

The Pentagon claimed there were secondary explosions from the airstrike when explosive materials in the car burst into flames. However, the New York Times disputes that assertion.

""But an examination of the scene of the strike, conducted by the Times visual investigations team and a Times reporter the morning afterward, and followed up with a second visit four days later, found no evidence of a second, more powerful explosion,"" the report declared.

Three weapons experts told the NYT that the small crater underneath the car was consistent with a Hellfire missile.

Zemari Ahmadi, who is believed to be the target of the drone strike, worked for 14 years as a technical engineer in Afghanistan for the California-based non-governmental charity organization Nutrition and Education International, which helps feed hungry Afghans.

Steven Kwon, the president of NEI, said Ahmadi ""was well respected by his colleagues and compassionate towards the poor and needy,"" and that he had recently ""prepared and delivered soy-based meals to hungry women and children at local refugee camps in Kabul.""



The charity reportedly applied for him to move to the U.S. as a refugee.

The drone strike in Kabul happened three days after the suicide bomb attack at the Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby doubled down the assertion that the airstrike eliminated an ""imminent threat.""

""U.S. Central Command continues to assess the results of the airstrike in Kabul on Aug. 29. We won't get ahead of that assessment,"" Kirby said. ""However, as we have said, no other military works harder than we do to prevent civilian casualties.""

""Additionally, as Chairman Milley said, the strike was based on good intelligence, and we still believe that it prevented an imminent threat to the airport and to our men and women that were still serving at the airport,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-drone-airstrike-kabul-family,2021-09-11
Reactions to US embassy to Iran sharing Kamala tweet,"The Biden administration's U.S. virtual embassy to Iran shared a post featuring a quote from Vice President Kamala Harris across multiple social media platforms this week that many critics lambasted as an ""insult to all Americans.""

The United States has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran since the 444-day hostage crisis where Iranians sieged and captured the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and detained over 50 hostages.

The U.S. instead has a virtual embassy to Iran, which touts itself as ""the primary official resource for the Iranian people to get information directly from the U.S. government about U.S. policy and American values and culture."" It adds, ""But, in the absence of direct contact, we hope it can serve as a bridge between the American and Iranian people.""

On Wednesday, the U.S. virtual embassy to Iran posted a quote from Vice President Harris to its social media accounts, including Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

The post includes a photo of Vice President Harris with her quote that was written in Farsi, and translated says:

The truth is: There is segregation in America. Xenophobia exists in America. Antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, all exist. Wherever injustice is dealt with, there is activity ahead.

The original Harris quote was said in May during the ceremony to mark President Joe Biden signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, the White House confirmed to the New York Post.

In January, the U.S. Department of State used the quote on its social media platforms to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

The tweet from the U.S. virtual embassy to Iran using the vice president's quote was vehemently denounced by many online.

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: ""For Vice President Harris to suggest moral equivalence between the Iranian regime's desire to eliminate Israel and a national policy of gender apartheid with American equality under the law is truly dangerous and ungrounded in reality. Americans are better than this.""

Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich: ""Why would VP Kamala Harris tweet this to Iran? What level of hating America does it take for the vice president to attack her own country.""

Fellow at the Independent Women's Forum Ellie Cohanim: ""This is *appalling* coming from a USG account. Why is the US @VP messaging as do America’s worst enemies? This is demeaning to Iranians who are being executed for being gay, oppressed for being Jewish…and an insult to all Americans!""

Former Congressman Scott Taylor: ""We have democracy, freedom of speech, rule of law and equality under it. We have the ability to move towards a more perfect union. None of this is true in Iran. This is a disgraceful tweet by our vice president.""

Iranian-American journalist Karmel Melamed: ""MORE GARBAGE from the @StateDept Persian lang handle. Instead of calling out Jew-hatred, misogyny, anti-gay beliefs & overall bigotry of the Ayatollah regime, these fools call America xenophobic, Islamophobic, etc. Wake up CLOWNS, when will you focus on mullahs' evil?! SMH.""

Iranian-American activist Mariam Memarsadeghi: ""There’s constant reason Iranians across the political spectrum are insulted and irate at Biden’s Iran policy: the admin actively seeks ways to minimize their oppression, even suggesting moral equivalence between the grotesque, systematic inequality they suffer and life in America.""

Former Senior Advisor for Public Affairs in the Iran Action Group for the U.S. Department of State Len Khodorkovsky: ""Posting this from the @StateDept’s Farsi channel knowing full well it will arm the Iranian regime, the world’s top sponsor of terrorism and sworn enemy of the United States, with propaganda talking points is shocking.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-embassy-iran-kamala-quote-reactions,2022-02-18
"Military admits Biden admin’s 'righteous strike' in Afghanistan killed 10 civilians — including 7 children, aid worker — zero ISIS-K terrorists","The Biden administration's Aug. 29 retaliatory drone strike on supposed ISIS-K terrorists in Afghanistan failed to kill any terrorists but resulted in the deaths of 10 civilians — including an aid worker and 7 children — a U.S. military investigation has determined.

Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., commander of the U.S. Central Command, made the announcement Friday afternoon in a Pentagon news conference, saying, ""I am now convinced that as many as 10 civilians, including up to seven children, were tragically killed in that strike.""

""Moreover,"" he continued, ""It is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS Khorasan or were a direct threat to U.S. forces.""

""This strike was taken in the earnest belief that it would prevent an imminent threat to our forces and the evacuees at the airport, but it was a mistake, and I offer my sincere apology,"" McKenzie added.

#BREAKING: ""It was a mistake"" 10 civilians, 7 children KILLED in US drone strike www.youtube.com

The drone strike came on the heels of an ISIS-K terror attack at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members and at least 100 Afghan civilians while injuring hundreds more.

Following that attack, President Joe Biden vowed that the U.S. would retaliate, declaring in a speech from the White House, ""To those who carried out this attack ... know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.""

And so the U.S. military did retaliate on Aug. 29 by striking a supposed ISIS-K planner believed to be transporting explosives in the trunk of his Toyota sedan.

""Initial indications are that we killed the target. We know of no civilian casualties,"" said U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Bill Urban, USN, in a statement. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, later touted the revenge attack as a ""righteous strike.""

But in the days following, the success of the strike was called into question, namely by the New York Times. The paper, through an investigation of its own, concluded that the attack did not terminate an ISIS-K terrorist but actually killed an innocent man who worked for a U.S. aid group along with his family.

On Friday, the Times saw its reporting confirmed by the U.S. military.

""The explosives the military claimed were loaded in the trunk of a white Toyota sedan struck by the drone's Hellfire missile were most likely water bottles, and a secondary explosion in the courtyard in a densely populated Kabul neighborhood where that attack took place was probably a propane or gas tank, [McKenzie] said,"" the paper reported. ""In short, the car posed no threat at all, investigators concluded.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-isis-afghanistan-strike-killed-civilians-no-terrorists,2021-09-17
"US military bracing for Iranian attack as anniversary of Soleimani's death approaches, officials say","The United States military suspects that an Iranian-linked attack on American personnel and interests in Iraq could be immanent as the one-year anniversary of Iranian terrorist leader Qassem Soleimani's death approaches.

On Jan. 2, 2020, the U.S. launched a drone strike on an envoy near the Baghdad airport that killed the renowned Iranian military leader along with Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

What are the details?

Defense officials reportedly expressed their suspicions of a retaliatory attack on Wednesday as two B-52 bombers finished a round-trip, 30-hour mission from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to the Middle East. The mission was part of an effort to demonstrate American military might in the region and deter any action by Iran.

""The United States continues to deploy combat-ready capabilities into the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to deter any potential adversary, and make clear that we are ready and able to respond to any aggression directed at Americans or our interests,"" said Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, chief of U.S. Central Command, according to the Washington Post.

""We do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack,"" he added.

Another defense official speaking anonymously told the Post that ""the threat streams are very real"" and that a ""fair amount of advanced conventional weaponry"" has flowed over the border from Iran into Iraq in recent weeks.

Last week, McKenzie similarly indicated to ABC News that U.S. forces remained ""in a period of heightened risk,"" but emphasized that the military is ""not looking for war with Iran.""

Those comments came as the U.S. Navy acknowledged that it sent a submarine into the Persian Gulf, ""a move widely seen as sending a message to Iran,"" the outlet reported.

What else?

Soleimani's death was a major blow to the terror-sponsoring Iranian regime as he was the leader of the elite Quds Force, a special wing of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. For years, he had coordinated attacks on U.S. forces and assets in the Middle East.

Given how high profile a leader he was, a retaliatory attack near the anniversary of his death is certainly a possibility, especially as tensions rise in the region.

Last week, unknown attackers launched more than 20 rockets on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, killing at least one Iraqi civilian, though no Americans were hurt. Iran denied any involvement, but the Post reported that U.S. officials believe the attack was carried out by militias coordinating with the regime.

President Trump responded to the attack with a sober warning for Iran:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-military-iran-attack-soleimani,2020-12-30
"Amid roaring inflation, US spends big bucks to help Ukraine","As Americans endure the painful financial consequences of raging inflation, the U.S. continues spending massive sums of money to help Ukraine defend itself against a brutal Russian invasion.

""President Biden has been clear we will support the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted in a Thursday statement.

""Pursuant to a delegation of authority from the President, I am authorizing our twenty-first drawdown of U.S. arms and equipment for Ukraine since September 2021.

This drawdown will bring the total U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to approximately $15.8 billion since the beginning of this Administration,"" Blinken said.

In a tweet on Sunday, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia noted that she has not spoken to anyone advocating for the U.S. to shell out billions more for Ukraine. ""I have not talked to a single person asking to send more billions to Ukraine. Not one,"" she tweeted.

GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky responded by noting, ""All calls and conversations I've had are with people who want us to stop sending their money to Ukraine.""

""No country is entitled to receive tax dollars from hard working Americans,"" Massie tweeted on Monday. ""But what about country _______ ? Send them your own money.""

""I was just appalled at how a teacher could say that because he knows he is an influence on all the younger generation,"" Harris said.

Harris informed his teacher, ""I'm coming for your job.""

The former student said he is writing a letter to the school board asking for Townsend to face some consequences for his calls to harm conservative senators.

Townsend has since changed his Twitter account to ""protected,"" so his tweets can't be seen.



The Iron County School Board released a statement on Wednesday, where they announced that they had launched an investigation into the disturbing messages.



""We've only recently become aware of these tweets,"" the school board stated. ""In light of the impact on the educational process and on Iron County School District, we are reviewing with legal counsel our appropriate response and we are investigating the matter.""

""His statements do not represent a statement or the opinions of the Iron County School District,"" the statement read. ""In fact, the school district ensures that where it may be a matter of free speech we are very serious about protecting free speech. However, all matters that affect the educational system adversely are not protected and above all we want to make sure that the educational process and the education for our students is protected.""

KSL-TV said they reached out to Townsend, but he did not return their calls.

In response to the Capitol riots, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Thursday that it is allocating at least $77 million to combat domestic violent extremism.

""Today the most significant terrorist threat facing the nation comes from lone offenders and small groups of individuals who commit acts of violence motivated by domestic extremist ideological beliefs,"" Alejandro Mayorkas, Homeland Security Secretary, said in a statement. ""While we continue to lawfully protect against threats posed by foreign terrorist organizations, we also must ensure adequate focus and funding is provided to combat domestic terrorism, some of which is motivated by false narratives and extremist rhetoric spread through social media and other online platforms.""



It is part of $1.8 billion in grants to state and local jurisdictions to protect against terrorism and other disasters.

Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin told reporters on Friday, ""The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing public safety and national security threat.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/utah-teacher-calls-violence-republican-senators,2021-02-27
"Vandals attack 4 power substations on Christmas – 17,000 without electricity","Vandals in Pierce County, Washington, attacked four power substations on Christmas Day, causing at least 17,000 residents to lose power, KING-TV reported.



Around 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, Pierce County sheriff's deputies received a call about a break-in at a Tacoma Power Utilities substation. When authorities arrived at the scene, they observed that vandals had broken into the fenced area and damaged the equipment.

Later that morning, a second Tacoma Power Utilities substation was broken into and damaged, causing additional power outages.

At approximately 11:25 a.m., a third incident was reported at a Puget Sound Energy substation. Authorities noted that the attack occurred at 2:39 a.m., which resulted in power outages to 7,300 customers.

On Sunday evening, a second Puget Sound Energy substation was damaged. Law enforcement reported that arsonists set the substation on fire, causing another 3,000 customers to go without power on Christmas.

Pierce County Sgt. Darren Moss told KING-TV, ""There's a good possibility they are related. We are going to be investigating to see if this was coordinated by a specific group or people, but at this time, all we know is that we have burglaries where the power was purposefully knocked out.""

Tacoma Power distribution manager Joseph Wilson stated that the company is considering adding more security patrols near the substations, particularly around national holidays.

""There are means to harden some of these facilities, but it's a very expensive endeavor,"" Wilson stated.

The recent attacks are currently under investigation. Pierce County sheriff's deputies said they are reluctant to declare the incidents a result of domestic terrorism since they do not currently have any suspects.

However, that did not stop the media from baselessly pointing fingers at the ""extreme right wing,"" likely due in part to a terrorism advisory bulletin posted by the Department of Homeland Security last month.

The DHS warned that ""threat actors could exploit several upcoming events to justify or commit acts of violence, including certifications related to the midterm elections, the holiday season and associated large gatherings, the marking of two years since the breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and potential sociopolitical developments connected to ideological beliefs or personal hostility.""

""Targets of potential violence include public gatherings, faith-based institutions, the LGBTQI+ community, schools, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, U.S. critical infrastructure, the media, and perceived ideological opponents,"" the bulletin continued.

Ali Winston, an independent journalist, told KING-TV, ""The trope of attacking power infrastructure, of hitting the electrical grid, critical infrastructure, is an old tenet of the American extreme right wing.""

According to Washington law enforcement officials, the FBI warned authorities about similar power station attacks in the Pacific Northwest following a recent string of vandalism.

In November, bad actors attacked two Puget Sound Energy stations. According to the Bonneville Power Administration, a substation in Clackamas County, Oregon, was vandalized on Thanksgiving morning.

Two electrical substations in North Carolina were damaged earlier this month, causing 45,000 residents to go without power.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/vandals-attack-4-power-substations-on-christmas-17000-without-electricity,2022-12-26
Vice President Kamala Harris praises GOP Rep. Liz Cheney: 'I applaud her courage to speak truth',"During an interview on PBS NewsHour, Vice President Kamala Harris praised GOP Rep. Liz Cheney's ""courage to speak truth.""

Last January, Cheney issued a statement attributing blame for the violent and chaotic Jan. 6 episode to then-President Donald Trump. In part of that statement, she declared that Trump ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.""

Judy Woodruff of PBS read Cheney's quote and asked Harris whether the lawmaker was correct.

""Yes,"" Harris said. ""I applaud her courage to speak truth.""

Cheney, who was one of 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of impeaching then-President Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, has been an outspoken Trump critic, and was ousted last year from her role as House Republican Conference chair.

The lawmaker from Wyoming is one of the only two Republicans members on the select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 episode.

During a speech marking the one-year anniversary of Jan. 6, 2021 on Thursday, Harris drew a parallel between that day and two other infamous dates in the nation's history, namely, the date the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor during World War II and the date of the 9/11 terror attacks.



""Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them where they were, and what they were doing, when our democracy came under assault,"" Harris said. ""Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory: December 7th, 1941, September 11th, 2001, and January 6th, 2021.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/vice-president-kamala-harris-praises-gop-rep-liz-cheney-i-applaud-her-courage-to-speak-truth,2022-01-07
Video shows gang of young bicyclists in 'animalistic attack' on BMW in Manhattan in broad daylight: 'Welcome to de Blasio's NYC',"A disturbing video posted Tuesday night shows a gang of bicyclists attacking a BMW in Manhattan in broad daylight and terrorizing the man and woman who were inside the vehicle.

One police officer noted that the attack was just another example of how far the city has fallen recently under current elected leadership.

What happened?

The recorded attack happened around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday at the intersection of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and 21st Street, the New York Post reported.

The video was posted to Instagram by Breaking911. The outlet's post said the BMW bore ""physician plates"" and that the male driver was trying to take his mother to see Christmas lights around Manhattan when the pack of thugs launched their attack unprovoked.

""WELCOME TO DE BLASIO'S #NYC,"" Breaking911 wrote, referring to NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""Gang of thugs vandalize BMW with physician plates as a son was reportedly taking his elderly mother to see Christmas lights in Manhattan. Bystanders say the driver did nothing to provoke the attack. The elderly woman was crying & scared for her life.""

The attackers can be seen trying to get into the BMW, doing body slams on the hood of the car, and beating the vehicle with their bikes.

Then one of the thugs gets a running start, launches himself off the hood of the car, and comes down with both feet slamming into the car's windshield, shattering and caving it in.

All the while, the perpetrators were being cheered on by their peers.

An unnamed Manhattan cop didn't mince words in his description of the attack to the Post — and what the crime symbolizes for the Big Apple.



""This was an animalistic attack in broad daylight,"" the officer told the Post.

After noting that the pair in the car were clearly scared for their lives, the cop added, ""It shows how far the city has deteriorated and the politicians better get their heads out of the sand and start to deal with these problems before there is nothing left.""

A source told the Post that the same group of thugs attacked a taxi not long after this incident was caught on video.

It remains unclear if any arrests have been made in connection to the attack, the Post said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-gang-nyc-bicyclists-attack-bmw,2020-12-30
VIDEO: Gun-toting restaurant patron puts scare into Black Lives Matter protesters in Louisville,"A Louisville restaurant patron put a bit of a scare into Black Lives Matter marchers Saturday night when video caught him pointing a handgun at the protesters in a wild scene amid tables on the sidewalk in front of La Chasse, the Courier-Journal reported.

What are the details?

The paper said the protesters' demonstration coincided with the 147th Kentucky Derby and was in memory of Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot by police last year.

Just after 8:30 p.m., protesters stopped outside La Chasse on Bardstown Road, which is about five miles northeast of Churchill Downs, and the Courier-Journal reported that a man watching from the restaurant's patio pulled a gun and pointed it at protesters during a confrontation.

It's not clear what led to the confrontation, but there are numerous examples of leftist protesters caught on videoharassing and terrorizing restaurant patrons at their tablesin the name of their causes — such as this courageous mob in Washington, D.C., last August:

But apparently the armed restaurant patron in Louisville wasn't about to let anything like that happen to him.

Video of the confrontation begins with an image of the white-haired man in a blue dress shirt and light-colored pants standing near one of the outdoor tables and pointing a small handgun at the protesters, who are hollering and making gestures — but not daring to get anywhere near him.

Image source: Courier-Journal video screenshot

In the clip, one of the protesters can be heard hollering at the man, ""You're not the only one with a gun!""

Indeed, a pair of men armed with rifles and handguns who appeared to be acting as security for the protesters were seen facing down the white-haired patron and arguing with him.

Image source: Courier-Journal video screenshot

A woman who appeared to be one of the protesters and man who appeared to be restaurant employee did their best to keep things calm.

Image source: Courier-Journal video screenshot

The paper said other protesters told the group to keep moving, and a few minutes later several Louisville police cruisers pulled up in front of the restaurant. The Courier-Journal didn't indicate if any arrests were made.

The video ends with the white-haired man and another man being led inside the restaurant as the more heavily armed men watch them leave the scene:

Anything else?

A number of Twitter commenters weighed in on a separate video of the incident posted by a Courier-Journal reporter.

While no context for the confrontation was noted in the tweet, it was clear where folks who observed the clip stand on the issue:

Nika Nikoubin confesses on video to stabbing Las Vegas man over Qasem Soleimani death,"A woman born in Iran is seen on video making a shocking confession of seducing a Nevada man and then stabbing him as revenge for the deadly U.S. drone strike on Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.

On March 5, Nika Nikoubin allegedly met a man on the dating site Plenty of Fish. The pair rented a room at the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino in Henderson, Nevada.

The couple allegedly began to engage in sexual activity. Police said Nikoubin put a blindfold on the victim, turned off the lights, and then stabbed him in the hotel room near Las Vegas.

The victim told the grand jury, ""She turned off the light and then afterwards I started to feel a pressure on my neck, and it got sharp, so I panicked and said, 'What the [expletive] are you doing?' I screamed. 'What the [expletive] are you doing?' And I shoved her off me, you know, still yelling like, 'What the [expletive] are you doing?' And then she says, 'Sorry,' and then she ran out of the room.""

Around 10:30 p.m., the man called the police. The victim reportedly suffered at least two puncture wounds from the attack.

Police said they found Nikoubin naked in a utility area on the 14th floor of the hotel. Law enforcement interviewed the 22-year-old, and she admitted to stabbing the man as retaliation for the lethal U.S. military strike on Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 3, 2020.

On Friday, KLAS-TV published the video of police interviewing Nikoubin.

Nikoubin told a police officer in the video, ""We were drinking a little bit and then — I guess we started to get into it and then I stabbed him.""

The officer asked, ""Did you plan on meeting [the victim] to hurt him?""

She replied, ""Yes.""

When questioned if she stabbed him to hurt him or kill him, Nikoubin replied, ""Hurt him.""

She confessed that she stabbed the man as revenge for the deadly drone strike on Soleimani.

She told the investigator that she stabbed him ""out of spite and revenge.""

""I mean the U.S. killed Soleimani. Lots of blood spilled,"" Nikoubin added. ""So, I feel like, it’s fair that American blood be spilled.”

Nikoubin – who was a UCLA student – said, ""Americans are cool, just I don’t think it was fair.""

""I just felt like somebody on American soil should die because he also died,"" she declared.

A Clark County grand jury indicted Nikoubin on charges of attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon because of certain, actual, or perceived characteristics of a person, and two counts of battery.

A doctor diagnosed Nikoubin with generalized anxiety order, major depressive disorder, and paranoid personality disorder.

The doctor wrote, ""According to clinical observation and client’s self-report, Nika’s paranoia may result in risky and unsafe behavior such as harm to self or others.""

A spokesperson for Nikoubin said she received mental health treatment and was on house arrest in Texas.

In April, a judge found Nikoubin competent to stand trial.

Nikoubin moved to the United States in 2012 with her family, according to her website promoting her music.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-iranian-nika-nikoubin-qasem-soleimani,2022-12-16
Video: Veteran interpreter breaks into tears while translating Zelenskyy’s speech as Ukraine survives another night,"A veteran video interpreter who was translating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Sunday speech broke into tears while detailing Ukraine's resolve against attacking Russian forces.

What are the details?

Video shared to social media showed the interpreter — a woman who remains unidentified at the time of this post and working for a German news outlet — pausing, choking up, and finally breaking into tears while translating Zeleskyy's speech while on the air.

Zelenskyy in the speech was describing how the war-torn country had sustained another day of Russian attacks.

""Russia is on the path of evil,"" Zelenskyy said in the speech. ""The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote on the U.N. Security Council.""



The interpreter then paused and began to choke up while delivering Zelenskyy's following lines.

""Ukrainians,"" the country's president continued, ""we know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win. Last night was brutal in Ukraine. Again, the shelling, again the bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure.""

As she continued speaking, she broke once more and took a breath, reportedly saying ""sorry"" before going off the air.

Zelenskyy added that the country is set to fight for as long as it takes to ""liberate the country"" and that Russian forces would only come in heavier and in a more vicious way.

“The night was hard,” he added. “The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror. They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.”

He added, ""If children are born in shelters, even when the shelling continues, then the enemy has no chance in this — undoubtedly — people's war. To victory!

Video: Veteran disarms knife-wielding man threatening Walmart,"A viral video shows a military veteran unleashing a world of hurt on a knife-wielding man who was threatening shoppers and employees at a South Carolina Walmart.

Last Wednesday, an unstable man was threatening shoppers inside a Walmart store in Columbia. Customers were taken aback by a man brandishing a knife and yelling at everyone in the store. One woman recorded video of the unnerving incident.

An individual calmly approached the troubled individual in an attempt to quash the potentially dangerous situation. The unhinged person screamed at the peacemaker and began swinging the pocket knife around. The man attempted to snatch the knife from the hostile individual, but failed to take away the weapon. This angered the man even more so, and he swiped the knife at the other man's face.

Demario Davis was shopping at the Walmart with his son when he heard the commotion.

""I was at the checkout when my son noticed the guy walk in with the knife open,"" Davis said, according to the New York Post. ""He then proceeded to the service desk waving the knife at a few female employees.""

The man allegedly screamed, ""When the cops get here, I’m going to start cutting you all up.""

""As I'm walking towards the area where the gentleman waving the knife is terrorizing other customers and employees,"" Davis said he saw the armed man attempt to cut the other man, prompting home to spring into action.

Davis told Fox News, ""Another customer tried to subdue the gentleman waving the knife, but the guy tried to cut him in the face. That's when my military training kicked in, and I casually walked over to the object not only to take him down but also protect myself in case I failed, but with my great military training, I was able to neutralize the threat until law enforcement arrived.""

Davis grabbed a stanchion, swung the weighted pole over his head, and bludgeoned the knife-wielding man in the back. The ferocious comeuppance caused the man to crash to the ground and drop the weapon. Another customer rushed over to confiscate the knife. Customers held the man on the ground until police arrived at the crime scene.

Video shows the suspect on the ground as he was being arrested by two deputies from the Richland County Sheriff’s Department. The man attempted to resist arrest, but officers quickly handcuffed the suspect.

The Richland County Sheriff’s Department said the man was taken to a hospital for evaluation.

A woman is heard on the video saying that the man threatened to stab people because he wanted $20.

Davis explained, ""My first instinct was to neutralize the situation, so I just casually walked over and waited until I had an opportunity to get him, and I got 'em, I guess.""

He added, ""I'm a community person, so if I see something in the community that’s not right, with all the violence and things and attacks going on, gun violence, you know, you want your people in the community to step up as well.""

Davis said sometimes citizens have to become vigilantes because ""the cops can't do it all by themselves.""

Davis revealed, ""I have received so many heartfelt comments and compliments from civilians and veterans all over for my brave act and quick response.""

Virginia mom who survived Mao's purge says DOJ and school board association use 'communist tactics',"A Virginia woman who lived through Mao's Cultural Revolution in China before emigrating to the United States said actions taken by the National School Boards Association and the Justice Department remind her of tactics adopted by the Chinese Communist Party to stop parents from speaking out.

Xi Van Fleet, who made national headlines in June when she spoke at a meeting of the Loudoun County school board and criticized critical race theory, said the likening of protesting parents to ""domestic terrorists"" is meant to divide people.

""When I was in China, I spent my entire school years in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, so I'm very, very familiar with the communist tactics of how to divide people, how they canceled the Chinese traditional culture and destroyed our heritage,"" Xi Van Fleet told Fox News in an interview Wednesday. ""All this is happening here in America.""

She said that opponents of protests against critical race theory and transgender policies are now calling parents ""domestic terrorists"" because calling them ""racists"" didn't work.

Earlier this month, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a memorandum announcing the Department of Justice is ""committed to using its authority and resources"" to investigate alleged threats of violence against school officials. The directive came in response to a letter from the National School Boards Association that claimed school officials nationwide were ""under immediate threat"" because of rowdy protests by concerned parents and residents.

The NSBA letter cited more than 20 examples of disorderly conduct or protests at school board meetings that involved intimidation, threats, or violence, likening these incidents to ""domestic terrorism"" or ""hate crimes.""

Critics blasted the letter and the DOJ's response, accusing the Biden administration of demonizing concerned parents and arguing it is not the role of the federal government to police school board meetings and that local law enforcement is more then capable of handling threats against school officials.

""I have to say, this will backfire. If intimidation works, America has fallen a long time ago,"" Van Fleet said.

""I do have a question: What's [the] next step? Is the Tiananmen Square crackdown the next, or the parents who one day risked their lives just to speak out for the children? That's why I'm here,"" she added.

Van Fleet's son graduated from Loudoun High School in 2015. She said protesting parents must not be intimidated because their children's futures are at stake.

""For me, I'm fighting it because it is about our future. The future of this country. So we cannot be intimidated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-mom-maos-purge-doj-school-board-communist-tactics,2021-10-14
Washington state Democrat celebrates vandalism of pro-life billboard,"A Washington state Democratic lawmaker is gleeful that a pro-life billboard in Gorst has been vandalized by pro-abortion activists.

In an Instagram video, state Sen. Emily Randall celebrates how a pro-life message was ""decorated"" by pro-abortion activists. Smiling, she tells her followers that she ""had to pull over when I saw the decorated/corrected billboard.""

The billboard was paid for by the Anti-Choice Project, a pro-life nonprofit group that wants to ""end abortion by showing Americans what abortion does to a helpless baby, since injustices which are covered up have no hope of ending,"" according to the group's website.

It originally stated, ""Some choices are wrong,"" and ""End abortion,"" and featured a picture of a developing fetus. But it was defaced — the word ""wrong"" was crossed out with graffiti and replaced with ""healthcare."" Vandals also crossed out the phrase, ""End abortion.""



""Abortion is healthcare. Fight for your rights,"" Randall posted in a caption for her video, which was first reported by the Jason Rantz Show on KKTH.

Watch:







In a statement to Rantz, Randall's Republican opponent, State Rep. Jesse Young, condemned the senator for celebrating vandalism against pro-life organizations at a time when churches and pro-life pregnancy centers have come under attack from abortion rights extremists.

“Senator Randall’s reckless attitude toward crime is why I’m leaving my safe seat and running to unseat her,” Young said. “This isn’t a game and real lives are being impacted while she ignores the hurt in our communities and blames our police.”

He raised concerns that Randall's supporters may interpret her video ""as license to step up their vandalism to more serious crime.""

“For the safety of our constituents, she should not just apologize for her unprofessional post and disavow the vandalism, she should also actively advocate for peaceful and respectful consideration as we work through incredibly tough and divisive issues,” Young said.

Randall did not respond to requests for comment from the ""Jason Rantz Show.""

In her time in Washington's state legislature, Randall has earned a reputation as a staunch pro-choice legislator. Last month, she declared her intention to introduce a bill that would prevent hospital mergers involving faith-based organizations if those deals would limit abortion access.

The bill has the support of Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, who believes the state should have the authority to block hospital mergers if they would limit access to abortion, transgender medical procedures or hormone regimens, or physician-assisted suicide.

""It doesn't do you a lot of good if you have the legal protection — if you are safe from the Republican Party and the Supreme Court — but there's no one to provide the service,"" Inslee told Axios last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-state-democrat-celebrates-vandalism-of-pro-life-billboard,2022-07-07
'But CNN said ... ': Waukesha police chief dismantles narrative that rampage suspect was in a police chase that led to the ramming of parade-goers,"The Waukesha, Wisconsin, police chief shot down reports and suggestions that parade terror suspect Darrell E. Brooks was fleeing from police when he rammed revelers during Sunday night's Christmas parade and said that it appears Brooks intentionally ran them down with intent to inflict carnage.

Several news outlets including CNN and the Washington Post suggested that Brooks — who has a decades-long criminal rap sheet including arrests for drugs, battery, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, and more — didn't mean to run into a parade and may have accidentally killed at least five people and injured dozens more while trying to flee from police.

Authorities charged Brooks with five counts of intentional homicide in connection with the attack. Further charges may come as police continue to investigate.

What are the details?

In a Monday statement on the horrific attack, Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson responded to such reports saying, ""I want to dispel some rumors: There was no police pursuit that led up to this incident.""

He added, ""The Waukesha Police Department website is the only source for information. Do not release information from any other source as it has not been vetted and could lead to false information.""



Earlier this week, CNN's S.E. Cupp tweeted, ""BREAKING: CNN reports Waukesha driver who plowed into parade was fleeing another crime scene, not an act of terrorism or retaliation."" Minutes later, CNN Breaking News tweeted, ""There are indications the person held in the deadly Wisconsin parade incident was fleeing another scene, sources say.""

Wall Street Journal editor Anthony DeRosa added, ""A law-enforcement [sic] official said one possibility that authorities are examining in Waukesha is whether the driver was fleeing from the scene of a crime. The official said there had been an earlier altercation involving a knife[.]""

The Washington Post soon piled on with a story of its own and in reporting quoted an unnamed ""law enforcement official"" who insisted the suspect's intent in ramming and running over adults, children, and the elderly was a desperate bid to ""escape the police.""

ABC News added, ""Investigators are looking into whether the SUV driver who plowed through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee, killing at least five people and injuring more than 40, was fleeing a crime, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.""

Twitter user Polly Karr summed up much of the internet's ire with one cleverly worded tweet: ""But CNN said ...""

Karr's jab accompanied digital strategist Greg Price's tweet, which included a video snippet of Thompson's remarks.

Price captioned the video, ""Waukesha Police say Darrell Brooks 'intentionally drove his maroon SUV through barricades into a crowd of people' at the Christmas parade. 5 dead. 48 injured.""

Waukesha residents feel abandoned after parade terror attack: Media doesn't care because it doesn't fit its leftist narrative,"Victims of the Waukesha, Wisconsin, Christmas parade terror attack say that the media has largely forgotten them because the attack didn't fit the buzzy media narrative, the New York Post reports.

What's a brief history here?

Authorities arrested suspect Darrell Brooks after he reportedly drove his SUV into crowds of people at the Waukesha Christmas parade.

The attack took the lives of at least six people including an 8-year-old boy and injured dozens more.

Brooks — a hardened, violent career criminal and registered sex offender whose Facebook page was once rife with anti-white sentiment — faces six counts of intentional homicide in connection with the attack.

Here are the witnesses' stories

Sharon Millard, a 68-year-old performer with the Dancing Grannies, said that she witnessed her friend, 79-year-old Virginia Sorenson, ""tossed up in the air like a rag doll"" after being struck by Brooks' red SUV.

""No one ever saw him coming,"" she recalled. ""He was going so fast. All I knew is I saw Ginny fly up in the air and land in front of me. I saw her curled up and blood was coming out of her like a river. I was standing in blood.”

Millard added that myriad witnesses saw Brooks drive down the parade route in a zig-zag pattern — as if to ensure maximum carnage — and aim ""to get as many people as he could.""

“They should put him in a room and let us have a go at him,"" the 68-year-old said. ""I think he deserves the death penalty. He will burn in hell.”

Sorenson died as a result of the attack.

“I can’t stop seeing Ginny dying in front of me in my head,” Millard said. “I know I’m not the only one who was affected like that. I can’t imagine us getting over this.”

Two other Dancing Grannies — 71-year-old LeAnna Owen and 52-year-old Tamara Durand — were also killed during the parade.

William Hospel, the 81-year-old husband of a Dancing Granny, was killed, as was 52-year-old Jane Kulich and 8-year-old Jackson Sparks.

Crystal Ruloff, another bystander, said that she'll never forget the terror that unfolded that fateful day.

“It was absolutely horrible,” Ruloff said. “There were bodies everywhere. I felt like I was watching something on TV and it wasn’t real. This kind of thing doesn’t happen in Waukesha.”

Angry outcry

Waukesha resident and State Rep. Cindi Duchow (R) told the outlet that there are children injured so grievously during the attack that they have to learn how to walk all over again.

“We’ve got six people dead and teenagers so badly injured they will have to learn to walk again — at Christmas,"" Duchow said. “Because this was a black guy who did it, the media doesn’t want to cover it. They were all over the Rittenhouse case because that kid was white. Race doesn’t matter to us here, but the media makes everything about race.”

State Sen. Chris Kapenga (R) also blasted what he said was the media's narrative surrounding the events, dropping the story and its victims like a hot potato once finding out that the suspect is a hardened criminal who isn't white.

“The left was so sympathetic to Kyle Rittenhouse’s victims but they’re not saying a word about the victims here,” Kapenga spat. “It’s not fitting their narrative. The reality is that this person [Brooks] is pure evil and the left’s soft-on-crime policies are blowing up in their face. But they want to ignore it and hope it goes away. Meanwhile the parents of the 8-year-old boy killed at the parade are having to face their first Christmas without him.”

Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly said that it's going to take a long time for the community to heal following the inexplicable tragedy.

“It’s taken away some of our innocence,” Reilly admitted. “I don’t think we’ll ever feel the same about going to the parade. We feel great sadness for those affected. Some of the injuries were terrible. A lot of people were run over by cars so there are a lot of head injuries. A lot saw the carnage right in front of them. We are going to be dealing with this for a long time.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/waukesha-residents-feel-abandoned-after-parade-terror-attack-media-doesn-t-care-because-it-doesn-t-fit-its-narrative,2021-12-14
A 'wave of Arab terrorism' leaves 11 Israelis dead in 3 attacks over 8 days,"An Islamic terrorist group has claimed credit for a shooting that killed five Israelis in a Tel Aviv suburb Tuesday, in what was the third terror attack in Israel in eight days.

A 27-year-old Palestinian terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Bnei Brak Tuesday night, firing at people who were out walking, riding bikes, or driving their cars in the suburb. Two police officers shot the terrorist dead, but not before he claimed the lives of several people. One of the two officers sustained injuries and later died in the hospital, the Times of Israel reported.

The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a militant group within the Palestinian nationalist socialist political party Fatah, claimed responsibility for the violence in a video. The terrorists said they had sent ""a clear message written in blood in response to the Negev summit,"" referring to the recent meeting with leaders from four Arab countries and the United States hosted by Israel earlier this week.

The foreign ministers of Morocco, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain, U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Israeli officials participated in the summit. The meeting was called ""treacherous"" by the terrorists of Hezbollah in Lebanon and was also opposed by Islamic factions in Gaza, reports said.



On Sunday, ISIS took credit for two other recent terror attacks in Israel — a stabbing attack in Beersheba on March 22 that left four Israelis dead and a shooting in Hadera on March 27 where two police officers were killed.

Israeli authorities are investigating whether the three attacks were coordinated or whether the perpetrators acted independently, according to Fox News.



Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Wednesday that his nation ""stands before a wave of murderous Arab terrorism.""

""My heart goes out to the families who lost their loved ones tonight, and I pray for the well-being of the wounded,"" he tweeted. ""The security forces are working. We will fight terror with perseverance, stubbornness and an iron fist. They will not move us from here.""

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also condemned the attack in a statement reported by the Wafa news agency



""The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to further deterioration of the situation and instability, which we all strive to achieve, especially as we are approaching the holy month of Ramadan and Christian and Jewish holidays,"" he said, according to the Guardian.

He added that the violence ""confirms that permanent, comprehensive and just peace is the shortest way to provide security and stability for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.""

"'We're in dangerous times': After 'terroristic threat' shuts down her HQ, Kari Lake remains steadfast, notes media's role","Kari Lake's campaign headquarters was targeted over the weekend by what her team reckoned to be a ""terroristic attack."" Lake noted that the alleged threat wasn't the first her team has had to deal with, but that it would be dealt with and the person responsible identified.

Dangerous times

On Sunday, Republican nominee for Arizona governor Kari Lake spoke to reporters in Queen Creek, Arizona, about her campaign headquarter's weekend encounter with suspicious packages, which allegedly contained white powder and threats.

Concerning the Oct. 5 discovery of the threats, Lake said, ""We're in dangerous times. ... This is not the first time we've been threatened. I've been threatened many times. Our tires have been slashed. We've had screws drilled into our tires so that our tires would blow out while we're on the road.""

Reiterating that these are dangerous times, Lake suggested ""that's why we need to elect somebody who's strong and a fighter and not a coward. We'll get to the bottom of this. I really don't want to get too far ahead of it.""

Katie Hobbs, the Democrat gubernatorial candidate who refuses to debate Lake, wrote in an op-ed on Saturday, ""The new GOP is led by extremist, radical stone throwers like Kari Lake.""



Hobbs, who has not recused herself from official duties overseeing the midterm election, also claimed, ""We can't risk Kari Lake.""

Arizona state Senator Wendy Rogers suggested that the potential risk to Lake's life must be addressed, demanding that the gubernatorial candidate be protected by the Arizona Department of Public Safety to ""err on the side of caution.""



What happened in Phoenix?

Around 10 p.m. on Saturday, two envelopes allegedly containing a ""suspicious white powder"" and ""abusive messages"" were discovered at Lake's campaign headquarters in Phoenix.

Just days after former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stressed that Lake should not be elected, one of Lake's staffers reportedly opened one of the suspicious envelopes and was exposed to the powder.

A source told the DailyMail.com that in addition to the white substance, the envelope contained a letter with ""a bunch of vulgarities and ranting and raving about Kari.""

Having noticed that the second package resembled the first one, the young employee reported it.

The FBI, Phoenix Police, Phoenix firefighters, bomb squad units, and hazmat crews were dispatched to the scene



""When officers arrived, they learned there were suspicious items located inside the mail. Additional resources responded to collect the items and secure the area,"" said Sgt. Phil Krynsky.

Lake told reporters that ""a couple"" of staffers had been exposed, but that ""so far they're doing okay.""

""We're monitoring them,"" said Lake, ""and we want to make sure that everything's okay.""

Krynsky confirmed that there had been no reports of injury, but that the investigation was ongoing.

Although Colton Duncan, spokesman for the Lake campaign, indicated on Sunday that the powder was initially headed to Quantico for testing, Lake confirmed later in the day that it was now being tested at a local lab.

Lake said, ""We're going to find out what it was.""

Duncan emphasized that the Lake campaign's ""resolve has never been higher, and we cannot be intimidated. We continue to push full speed ahead to win this election on Tuesday.""

Media myopia, polarization



The alleged ""terroristic act"" that targeted the Lake campaign has not been met with the kind of media attention that the alleged attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband garnered in recent days.

GOP Chairman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, ""More violent threats against Republicans that most of the media refuses to cover - the same media that has attacked @KariLake relentlessly. This is completely unacceptable.""

Lake, who previously was a TV news anchor, has long criticized the mainstream news media and its bias.

Fox News Digital reported that Lake emphasized that the ""fake news media"" has been a big part of political polarization in the nation and ramping up tensions.

""We are in such polarized times, and this is one of the reasons I walked away from the fake news media, because I realized that the media is a big part of it, pitting people against one another,"" said Lake.

Referencing the threats her campaign has faced from anti-conservative, anti-Republican forces, she posed the question to reporters, ""You guys want us like this?""

Republican Senate nominee Don Bolduc was reportedly attacked before his New Hampshire debate last Wednesday.



Earlier this month, a Chicago man allegedly left a terrorizing voicemail threatening to assassinate the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Illinois, Darren Bailey.

On Oct. 18, the home of Republican congressional candidate Pat Harrigan's parents was reportedly riddled with bullets with his children sleeping inside.

In June, 26-year-old California resident Nicholas John Roske, who identified himself as a ""trans gamer girl,"" allegedly attempted to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh. Roske was armed with a Glock 17 pistol and had in his possession a tactical knife, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crowbar, and duct tape.

Hundreds of pro-life pregnancy centers, pro-lifers, and churches were targeted in a series of attacks by pro-abortion terrorists in the lead up to and following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.

"Whistleblower email shows the FBI is, in fact, using counterterrorism tactics to monitor parents protesting school boards","Despite Attorney General Merrick Garland's insistence otherwise, the FBI has, in fact, begun using counterterrorism tactics to track and investigate concerned parents protesting at school board meetings, according to a whistleblower email released this week by House Republican lawmakers.

What are the details?

The email, obtained and posted to Twitter by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, shows that FBI leadership instructed agents to monitor and ""track"" any ""threats of violence or fear"" against ""school board administrators, members, teachers, and staff"" to determine whether the alleged threats violated federal law.

To do so, the bureau created a ""threat tag, EDUOFFICIALS,"" for agents to use to ""identify"" the motivation behind the threats and decipher whether there are ""federal violations that can be investigated and charged.""

In the email, sent on Oct. 20, FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Timothy Langan specifically mentions that these actions were taken in accordance with an internal Department of Justice memo sent by Garland on Oct. 4.

Yet during testimony in front of Congress last month, Garland emphatically dismissed the notion that his department was treating parents like ""domestic terrorists"" and using counterterrorism tactics to investigate them.

""I can't imagine any circumstance in which the PATRIOT Act would be used in the circumstances of parents complaining about their children, nor can I imagine a circumstance where they would be labeled as domestic terrorism,"" the attorney general said, in part.

In his Oct. 4 memo, Garland called on the FBI to help address an alleged ""disturbing spike"" of ""harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence"" against local education personnel. The email came just days after the National School Boards Association sent a letter to the White House comparing concerned parents to ""domestic terrorists.""

What else?

House Judiciary Republicans, led by ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), said Tuesday that the email ""calls into question the accuracy and completeness"" of Garland's testimony before Congress.

""At best if we assume that you were ignorant of the FBI's actions in response to your October 4 memorandum at the time of your testimony, this evidence suggests that your testimony to the committee was incomplete and requires additional explanation,"" Jordan wrote in the letter addressed to the attorney general.

In a separate statement, House GOP Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the email shows that ""Garland was either ignorant of the actions of the agency he leads, or was purposely misleading Congress during his answers.""

McCarthy further called the FBI's actions against concerned parents ""an egregious abuse of power"" and ""further proof that we have a President in the White House who is more interested in going after our own citizens, including concerned parents, than he is in going after actual threats.""

""Attorney General Garland must return to Congress to address, under oath, in detail, the discrepancies regarding the directives he issued involving investigating America's parents,"" he demanded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/whistleblower-email-fbi-tracking-investigating-parents,2021-11-17
Whistleblower: FBI agent who covered up Hunter Biden evidence also pressured subordinates to inflate domestic violent extremism data,"FBI officials in the Biden administration have allegedly pressured agents to inflate the number of reported ""domestic violent extremism"" cases, according to whistleblowers. One of the officials accused of pressuring his subordinates is the same FBI agent who allegedly worked to downplay or discredit negative information about President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden.

House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Wednesday sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting documents and information regarding the accusations.

""We have learned that FBI officials are pressuring agents to reclassify cases as 'domestic violent extremism' even if the cases do not meet the criteria for such a classification,"" Jordan wrote. ""Given the narrative pushed by the Biden Administration that domestic violent extremism is the 'greatest threat' facing our country, the revelation that the FBI may be artificially padding domestic terrorism data is scandalous.""

Biden administration officials have repeatedly asserted that domestic violent extremism is the greatest threat facing the country. FBI Director Wray has previously testified that the U.S. domestic terrorism caseload has ""exploded"" in size since spring 2020. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified this year that domestic violent extremism is ""the greatest terrorism related threat to our homeland.""

Responding to the determination of law enforcement officials, the White House National Security Council unveiled a national strategy for countering domestic terrorism last year. And in January this year, the Department of Justice opened a new unit to investigate acts of domestic terrorism.

Seizing on the government's narrative, Democrats have sought to tie political violence and domestic extremism to Republicans, often pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Mainstream news outlets like the New York Times have supported their narrative, reporting that most political violence in America ""comes from the political right.""

But Jordan's letter raised questions about the government's data, citing ""multiple FBI employees"" who came forward to accuse top bureau officials of encouraging their subordinates to pad the data.

""We have received accusations that FBI agents are bolstering the number of cases of [domestic violent extremism] to satisfy their superiors,"" Jordan wrote.

He gave as an example one whistleblower who alleged that agents are ""encouraged and incentivized to reclassify cases as DVE cases even though there is minimal, circumstantial evidence to support the reclassification.""

""These whistleblower allegations that the FBI is padding domestic violent extremist data cheapens actual examples of violent extremism,"" Jordan wrote. ""This information also reinforces our concerns — about which we have written to you several times — regarding the FBI's politicization under your leadership,"" he told Wray.



The letter also refers to an unidentified ""field office Counterterrorism Assistant Special Agent in Charge"" who allegedly ""pressured agents"" to reclassify cases as domestic violent extremism ""to hit self-created performance metrics.""

Jordan identified this person as Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault in an interview with Breitbart News.

Thibault was previously named by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in a separate letter to Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland disclosing that a ""highly credible"" whistleblower came forward in August 2020 and alleged that the FBI and Department of Justice had coordinated to falsely portray evidence gathered about Hunter Biden as ""disinformation.""

Grassley wrote that an FBI intelligence assessment was ""used by an FBI headquarters team to improperly discredit negative Hunter Biden information as disinformation.""

""Based on allegations, verified and verifiable derogatory information on Hunter Biden was falsely labeled as disinformation,"" Grassley said.

Noting that Thibault previously displayed ""a pattern of active public partisanship in his then public social media content,"" Grassley revealed that in October 2020, one month before the election, Thibault had ordered closed ""an avenue of additional derogatory Hunter Biden reporting.""

The senator went on to detail that Thibault and other agents ""subsequently attempted to improperly mark the matter in FBI systems so that it could not be opened in the future,"" according to whistleblowers.

The FBI told multiple news outlets it had received Grassley's letter but offered no additional comment.

"Whistleblowers claim FBI is trying to find 'white supremacy,' even when it's not there","Whistleblowers from within the Federal Bureau of Investigation have come forward and argued that the agency, under the direction of the Biden administration, has pressured agents to manufacture instances of so-called ""white supremacy,"" even out of behaviors that otherwise ought to be covered by the First Amendment.

According to a report from the Washington Times, current and former FBI agents have stated that the agency vastly misrepresents the actual threat that white supremacy poses to American security and democracy but that agents within the Bureau are feeling pressure to find it anyway.

""The demand for White supremacy ... vastly outstrips the supply of White supremacy,"" one agent said. ""We have more people assigned to investigate White supremacists than we can actually find.""

""We are sort of the lapdogs as the actual agents doing these sorts of investigations, trying to find a crime to fit otherwise First Amendment-protected activities,"" he continued. ""If they have a ['Dont tread on me'] flag and they own guns and they are mean at school board meetings, that’s probably a domestic terrorist.""

Congressional Republicans have made similar claims about the White House, claiming that President Biden and other Democrats have attempted to criminalize political differences and to portray those with different opinions as ""extremists"" and ""domestic terrorists."" Meanwhile, they say, these same Democrats have ignored the extremism and domestic terrorism perpetrated by Antifa, BLM, and other left-wing groups.

The speech Biden gave earlier this month, in which the president characterized ""MAGA"" and Trump supporters as anti-American ""semi-fascists"" who ""put their own pursuit of power above all else,"" only fueled those accusations.

""I think [that's] what’s ultimately driving his politics,” said Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). “If you own a gun, display the flag and voted for Trump, the president’s going to call you an extremist, and it appears the FBI is going to use the numbers to satisfy that narrative that the president laid out.""

The FBI has issued a statement, unequivocally denying that the agency is targeting Republicans or supporters of the former president.

""The FBI aggressively investigates threats posed by domestic violent extremists,” an FBI spokesperson said. “We do not investigate ideology, and we do not investigate particular cases based on the political views of the individuals involved. The FBI will continue to pursue threats or acts of violence, regardless of the underlying motivation or sociopolitical goal.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/whistleblowers-claim-fbi-is-trying-to-find-white-supremacy-even-when-it-s-not-there,2022-09-15
White House insists 'MAGA Republicans' — Americans who support Trump — are an 'extreme threat to our democracy',"The White House emphasized Wednesday that officials believe Americans who support former President Donald Trump are a clear and present threat to democracy.

At the White House briefing, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre previewed a prime-time speech that President Joe Biden will give on Thursday.

According to Jean-Pierre, Biden will address the growing ""extremist threat"" he believes is taking root in America. That threat? No, not homegrown terrorism, for example — but Trump supporters.

""When we talk about our democracy, when we talk about our freedoms, the way that he sees it is the MAGA Republicans are the most energized part of the Republican Party,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""This is an extreme threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.""

""They just don’t respect the rule of law. You’ve heard that from the president,"" she continued. ""You know, they are pursuing an agenda that takes away people’s rights, which is what the president said last week on Thursday. You all heard him. This is what the president said yesterday, and that’s what he’s going to continue to say.""

Biden will not ""shy away"" from exposing the alleged threat, Jean-Pierre went on to say, because what Biden believes ""is just facts.""

Later in the briefing, Jean-Pierre was confronted over Biden's contradictory position: He has repeatedly promised to unify the nation, yet he is now demonizing tens of million of Americans because they support Trump.

""Look, he has said this before — that it’s going to take some work. You have heard him say that. You’ve heard us say that,"" the press secretary responded. ""But what he’s not going to do is shy away, again, from calling out extremism that he is seeing — these MAGA Republicans. He is not going to shy away from that.""



Jean-Pierre even called out several Republicans by name — Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Reps. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.), and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) — who she claimed are carrying out an ""attack of our core values as a country.""

""[Biden is] not going to shy away. He believes ... as president he has the obligation to speak out against threats against our democracy, against violence,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters. ""He believes as president you have the strongest platform, the strongest voice, and that’s what he’s going to continue to do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-maga-republicans-extreme-threat,2022-09-01
"Whiteness is a 'parasitic-like condition' that needs treatment but has no cure, research published in peer-reviewed health care journal says","Whiteness is ""a malignant, parasitic-like condition"" that does not have a ""permanent cure,"" according to research recently published in a peer-reviewed health care journal.

Dr. Donald Moss, a New York City psychoanalyst, published an article titled ""On Having Whiteness"" last month in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association.

""Whiteness is a condition one first acquires and then one has — a malignant, parasitic-like condition to which 'white' people have a particular susceptibility,"" the paper claimed.



""Parasitic whiteness renders its hosts' appetites voracious, insatiable, and perverse,"" Moss wrote. ""These deformed appetites particularly target nonwhite peoples. Once established, these appetites are nearly impossible to eliminate.""

Fox News reported, ""Moss argues that white people possess an 'entitled dominion' that enables the 'host' to wield power 'without limit, force without restriction, violence without mercy,' and increases one's desire to 'terrorize.'""

The paper stated that ""any infant is vulnerable to the parasite of whiteness.""

""Effective treatment consists of a combination of psychic and social-historical interventions,"" the psychoanalyst, who is white, prescribed. ""Such interventions can reasonably aim only to reshape whiteness's infiltrated appetites — to reduce their intensity, redistribute their aims, and occasionally turn those aims toward the work of reparation.""

The doctor alleged that ""there is not yet a permanent cure"" for whiteness.

Moss also claimed that whiteness ""easily infiltrates even groups founded on the protection of individuals, on democratic principles.""

Newsweek reported, ""In 2019, he delivered his theory describing whiteness as a parasitic condition as a plenary address for the South African Psychoanalytical Association, and he also lectured on it at the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and at the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in New York.""



Moss presented his ""On Having Whiteness"" seminar at the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in 2020.

Moss teaches psychoanalysis at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis.



According to the American Psychoanalytic Association website, Moss says since the mid-1980s he has ""been working on clinical/theoretical/activisist perspectives that aim to understand and dismantle structured forms of hatred– 'hating in the first person plural'–racism, homophobia, misogyny and xenophobia.""

In 2017, Moss was the recipient of the Elizabeth Young Bruehl award for work against prejudice.

Moss is also a climate change activist and is a founding member of the ""Green Gang,"" a ""group of analysts and scientists focusing on climate change and its denial.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/whiteness-parasitic-condition-medical-journal,2021-06-10
"Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: 'If you're tired of lockdowns ... wearing masks, or you wish you were in church this morning,' then vote for Joe Biden","Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that if Americans are weary of coronavirus lockdowns and the fallout from socioeconomic restrictions related to the pandemic, they should vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Election Day instead of President Donald Trump.

""If you're tired of lockdowns, or you're tired of wearing masks, or you wish you were in church this morning or watching college football or your kids were in-person instruction, it is time for change in this country, and that's why we've got to elect Joe Biden,"" Whitmer told Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press"" Sunday.

What else did Whitmer say?

Whitmer blasted Trump during the interview, accusing the president of inciting violence and not doing his job.

""The Trump virus response is the worst in the globe — I mean, in the world it's the worst,"" she said. ""Eight million people have contracted COVID-19, 220,000 dead. We've got people in food pantry lines who never would have imagined that they'd be there. And no light on the horizon because our numbers keep going up. This is a gravely serious moment for all of us.""

What was the reaction?

Some Twitter users who commented on the ""Meet the Press"" clip said Whitmer's insistence on Americans voting for Biden if they want lockdowns to end and if they want to go back to church sounded like a thinly veiled ultimatum:

""Wait, so if we elect Biden, magically we'll be able to lift lock downs, stop wearing masks & go back to church? That's ALL we have to do, elect Biden?"" one commenter said. ""Something smells like a lie here.""

""So is she basically admitting that they are 'punishing us"" unless we vote for Biden? That's what it sounds like to me,"" another commenter said. ""I would rather be locked down for the next 4 years than put a criminal who sells out America with our tax dollars into office. No thanks.""

""So what's her point, she's holding people hostage until Trump [is] out?"" another user asked. ""Dictator much???""

Anything else?



In part of her interview not shown on the above video, Whitmer said Trump is inciting ""domestic terrorism"" due to ""lock her up"" chants at his Michigan rally Saturday night, the Associated Press said, and that his words are ""incredibly disturbing.""



""The president is at it again and inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism,"" Whitmer told ""Meet the Press,"" according to the AP. ""It is wrong. It's got to end. It is dangerous, not just for me and my family, but for public servants everywhere who are doing their jobs and trying to protect their fellow Americans. People of good will on both sides of the aisle need to step up and call this out and bring the heat down.""

"WHO director admits to prematurely dismissing lab leak theory, says China needs to be more transparent","After dismissing the lab leak theory and praising China for being so transparent, the director of the World Health Organization changed course on Thursday.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus admitted that China had been less than forthcoming about requests for information related to the source of the pandemic and called for their cooperation.

He told reporters that the WHO was ""asking actually China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for at the early days of the pandemic.""

Tedros went on to admit that experts had been too hasty in ruling out the possibility that the coronavirus had leaked from a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan.

""I was a lab technician myself, I'm an immunologist, and I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen,"" Tedros explained. ""It's common.""

The lab leak theory had been ridiculed by many experts and those in the media as a right-wing conspiracy theory animated by racial animus against Asians and political expediency.

Public opinion turned toward the possibility of the laboratory leak theory after a team of online amateur sleuths trudged through official documents online and undermined the official narrative from China and the Wuhan lab. Scientists and experts were forced to reluctantly admit that there was evidence enough to investigate the hypothesis.

In May, President Joe Biden ordered the U.S. intelligence community to reassess the lab leak theory.

Many accused the WHO and its director for not taking a strong enough stance against China. Some critics have claimed that China aided Tedros' campaign to become WHO's director in 2017 despite his problematic past.

In February, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. had stopped cooperating with the WHO because they believed it had become corrupted.

""It had been politicized. It was bending a knee to General Secretary Xi Jinping in China,"" said Pompeo. ""I continue to know that there was significant evidence that this may well have come from that laboratory.""

Although Tedros asked for greater transparency from China in the investigation for the source of the pandemic, he framed it as an opportunity to exonerate the communist government.

""We need information, direct information on what the situation of this lab was before and at the start of the pandemic,"" the director said.

""If we get full information, we can exclude (the lab connection),"" he added.

'Who was behind it?' Rubio calls on Republicans to use their oversight role to investigate 2020 BLM riots,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has called for congressional hearings into the BLM riots that beset 140 American cities in 2020, claiming the lives of dozens of people and injuring over 2,000 police officers.

With Republicans poised to win a majority in the House and potentially also the Senate, Rubio suggested that the GOP will soon be in a position to ""stop bad things from happening"" and to preclude ""crazy people from getting into positions of power.""

Rubio's call for accountability

On Monday night, Rubio appeared on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle,"" where he delineated actions that Republicans must take after the midterms.

Extra to addressing the leftist terror attacks committed this year against pro-lifers and pro-life pregnancy centers, in response to which no arrests have been made, Rubio suggested it was time to ""use our oversight role ... to have hearings on the riots of summer 2020.""

Suggesting that ""there has been no accountability about the summer of 2020,"" Rubio posed the questions: ""Who was behind it? How much did the political rhetoric lend itself to it?""



The senator also referenced efforts to bail out rioters and questioned whether that encouraged criminals to take to the streets to reoffend.

Rubio promises accountability if GOP takes back control youtu.be

Republican support

Rubio is not the first to call for such an investigation.

On Sept. 22, 2020, 24 members of Congress, including Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting that he ""use every tool available to the FBI to investigate local, state, and national organizations helping to fuel the criminally violent riots.""

The letter alleged that the actions taken by ""ANTIFA and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a variety of different political persuasions"" constituted ""domestic terrorism and federal charges must be brought against those who are aiding and abetting the criminal actions of these organizations.""

The Sun reported that former President Trump similarly demanded accountability, recommending that Republicans in the House and Senate should study the ""murders, riots, and fire bombings in Portland, Minneapolis, Seattle, Chicago, and New York.""

Voters also wanted answers concerning the violent events that occurred after the death of George Floyd. A survey conducted last year by Rasmussen Reports revealed that 66% of likely U.S. voters think Congress should investigate ""last year's violent protests.""

The BLM riots



Between May 25 and July 31, there were 8,700 BLM ""protests"" nationwide; 574 of those were declared riots. BLM terrorism continued unabated for months. For instance, on Aug. 23, 2020, BLM terrorists torched a police station in Portland, Oregon.

The Guardian reported that at least 25 people were killed in the BLM riots. The Major Cities Chiefs Association indicated that over 2,000 law enforcement officers were injured in the first weeks of the riots.



In September 2020, Axios reported that the ""mostly peaceful"" BLM riots ""will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims."" By way of comparison, the Washington Post reported that the Jan. 6 protests caused $1.5 million in damage to the Capitol.

While the looting, vandalism, and killings during the riots were horrific, the fallout of the BLM riots was also consequential. The Sun reported that cities targeted by BLM violence saw murder rates skyrocket, with between ""1,000 and 6,000 additional murders"" committed.

Violent rhetoric and Democrat support

Last year, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) criticized the Democrats for their hyperbolic characterization of the Jan. 6 protests, noting that while their rhetoric may not correspond to what happened in 2021, it certainly fits with the violence that took place the previous year. He said, ""Some [Democrats] have cited the metaphor that the president lit the flames. ... Well, they lit actual flames!""

Former Virginia Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam exacerbated racial tensions after Floyd's death, suggesting that the career criminal was one of those ""people being killed for the color of their skin.""

Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) told MSNBC in 2020, ""There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives.""

In a June 17, 2020, appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" then-candidate for vice president Kamala Harris said of the BLM riots: ""They're not going to stop, and everyone beware, because they're not going to stop. ... They're not going to let up, and they should not and we should not.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted, ""Congratulations to all who are out on the streets today. ... Together, we will defeat Trump.""

Democrats not only championed the BLM riots, but bailed out rioters, enabling them to hit the streets and reoffend.

Will Smith reveals that he thought about killing his father,"In his forthcoming book, actor Will Smith divulged that he thought about murdering his father.

""My father was violent, but he was also at every game, play, and recital. He was an alcoholic, but he was sober at every premiere of every one of my movies,"" Smith wrote, according to People. ""He listened to every record. He visited every studio. The same intense perfectionism that terrorized his family put food on the table every night of my life.""



The actor described the experience as a child of seeing his father strike his mother, who collapsed.

""When I was nine years old, I watched my father punch my mother in the side of the head so hard that she collapsed. I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other moment in my life, has defined who I am,"" Smith wrote, according to People.

""Within everything that I have done since then — the awards and accolades, the spotlights and attention, the characters and the laughs — there has been a subtle string of apologies to my mother for my inaction that day. For failing her in the moment. For failing to stand up to my father. For being a coward,"" Smith noted.



""What you have come to understand as 'Will Smith,' the alien-annihilating MC, the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction – a carefully crafted and honed character – designed to protect myself. To hide myself from the world. To hide the coward,"" the actor wrote.



Smith explained that when he was a kid he told himself that eventually he would avenge his mother and kill his father. He recounted a time as an adult when he thought about killing his father, who had cancer.

""One night, as I delicately wheeled him from his bedroom toward the bathroom, a darkness arose within me. The path between the two rooms goes past the top of the stairs. As a child I'd always told myself that I would one day avenge my mother. That when I was big enough, when I was strong enough, when I was no longer a coward, I would slay him,"" Smith wrote.

""I paused at the top of the stairs. I could shove him down, and easily get away with it. I'm Will Smith. No one would ever believe I killed my father on purpose. I'm one of the best actors in the world. My 911 call would be Academy Award level. As the decades of pain, anger, and resentment coursed then receded, I shook my head and proceeded to wheel Daddio to the bathroom,"" the actor wrote, according to ET Canada.

Smith's memoir titled ""Will"" is slated for release on Nov. 9, and was ""Written with the help of Mark Manson,"" according to a book description.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/will-smith-says-he-thought-about-killing-his-father,2021-11-05
"'I just shot him out of the house': Woman who never fired her gun before wounds burglar who's now behind bars — and she tells other women to get armed, too","A North Carolina woman who had never fired her gun before took aim and pulled the trigger Tuesday morning, wounding a burglar who busted into her home — and now the crook is behind bars.

What are the details?

Tarika McAllister, 29, woke up before 6 a.m. to her dog barking and a loud bang at the back of her home on Bear Lane in Dunn, WRAL-TV reported.



Then she saw a man taking some of her belongings and trying to steal her dog — and she was all by herself, the station said.

McAllister hollered at the man to get out, to no avail, WRAL said. So she opted to let her gun do the talking.

McAllister told WRAL she had never before used the gun she stores — but that was about to change.



“All I did was turn around and grab the gun,"" McAllister told the station. ""I was fumbling with it. It’s my first time using it.”

Despite the terror of it all, WRAL said McAllister had the presence of mind to turn off the safety and take control of the ordeal.

""I just lifted it up, and I started shooting at him, wherever he was moving to, I just shot him out of the house,” she told the station.



WRAL said Malihk Giles was found about 200 yards from the home with a gunshot wound to his right lower leg and a superficial gunshot wound to his right side.

Giles was taken into custody, the station said, and after his wounds were treated at a hospital, he was taken to Harnett County Detention Center under a $75,000 secured bond on charges of first-degree burglary and possession of stolen property. Giles, 20, was still in jail Friday morning.

McAllister and Giles do not know each other, WRAL said.

She says women should arm themselves for protection

McAllister added to the station that women should arm themselves for protection.

“I know a lot of women are scared of guns,"" she told WRAL. ""I feel those are the best protectors for us because we can’t fight a man. We can’t fight an intruder off.”



McAllister said three weeks ago a man tried to steal from her house, but she was able to scare him away, the station said.

Although she admitted that she's ""still shook up"" and it's difficult to be by herself right now, McAllister told WRAL she feels ""stronger"" now — and better prepared if another home invasion occurs.

""I took action, and I'm very proud of myself that I stood up for myself, as a woman,"" she told the station, adding that ""I did what I had to do, and I’m glad I did what I did.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-wounds-burglar-whos-now-behind-bars,2022-10-07
"'You don't think we don't know where your children go to school?': Activist lawyer appears to threaten cops, their families in tirade — and backlash is severe","A prominent activist attorney appeared to make threats against Kansas City police officers during a megaphone tirade outside police headquarters Friday — a portion of which was shared on social media.

What are the details?

""We are seeking to revoke the peace officers' licenses,"" Stacy Shaw hollered while standing with a crowd of supporters. ""We are going to start sharing things with your children's teachers.""

She added, ""You don't think we don't know where your children go to school? Who the f*** do you think we are?""

Shaw is leading a movement to get Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith fired, among other demands, KCTV-TV reported. In her rant, she accused police of ""terrorizing"" citizens.

""We are tired, and I don't make threats,"" she added in her megaphone rant. ""I don't make threats, but we're going to start sharing this information so your children can see it.""

In the end, she said officers ""will have no one, no one that loves you after we get done with this next campaign"" and that ""there will not be a place of peace, there will not be a place of respite, there will not be a place of respect left for anyone that wears this badge. Not one single place. We will make sure that even your children can't stand you.""

Here's the clip. (Content warning: Language):

Stacy Shaw Attorney Outside KCPD HQ October 2020 youtu.be

What was the reaction?



Brad Lemon, president of the city's Fraternal Order of Police, noted in a Facebook statement that the organization is ""aware of the video of Attorney Stacy Shaw threatening our members and their families. Our Lodge has begun work with city and state leadership.""

His statement also indicated that ""we urge our membership to remain calm and act as we have been trained to do. We should always be aware of our surroundings and potential threats. Yes, Shaw's threats serve to raise that threat level. We must remember that while a small number of people may be violent and threatening our families, the majority of this city supports you.""

Lemon concluded by saying, ""We do this job and have an understanding of the danger that accompanies our oath. Our families do not deserve what Shaw is threatening.""

Shaw later denied that she threatened police, telling KCTV that ""an information campaign is not a threat.""

But Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas — who is black — wasn't buying her explanation and took Shaw to task.

""That is one of the biggest bull crap statements I've ever heard in my entire life,"" Lucas said, according to the station. ""You do not say I'm going to threaten your spouse and your children simply because you want them to understand the nature of someone's job. That's ridiculous and preposterous. Her statements were uncalled for, and she knows better. She's a lawyer, a member of the bar. We are trained not to make statements like that.""

Lemon reacted similarly to Shaw's denial, KCTV said: ""That's bull crap. You watched the video, everybody else watched that video. We didn't edit the video. There were no cuts in that video. She said what she said, and she's trying to backtrack it now. The reality is she has threatened the families of police officers.""

The station said Shaw noted in a Monday press conference that she no longer will discourage violent protests: ""I will be praying for the safety of the officers families because as much as I've done for them, as much as I have influence the community to only protest non-violently, it is not my place to tell people how to protest.""

'Regrettable statements'

But by Tuesday evening, Shaw apologized.

On Friday, I made regrettable statements that I in no way intended as a threat. I sincerely apologize for the brief moment that I was not upholding the values of love and transformative justice I have consistently championed.



To be clear, I do not endorse nor will I ever tolerate harm to police families or children. We all deserve better. This video has become a distraction from the important work of organizers and activists that are on the brink of changing so much in this city and country.



I am taking time to focus on self-accountability and how I may be of further service in this historic movement.

Lemon, however, didn't seem very impressed by Shaw's mea culpa:

While we acknowledge Ms. Shaw's apology, which unfortunately is serval days too late, it does not in anyway mitigate the fact that our officers had to endure unwarranted threats from a member of the Missouri Bar.



The FOP will continue to evaluate whether to pursue criminal charges or file appropriate ethics complaints against her with the Missouri Disciplinary Administrator.

A 20-year-old Marine whose wife is expecting a baby was among the US troops killed in Kabul terror attack,"Details are emerging about U.S. service members who lost their lives during a heinous terror attack Thursday in Kabul, Afghanistan.

One of the victims was 20-year-old Marine Rylee McCollum whose wife is expecting to give birth in three weeks, his sister Cheyenne McCollum said, according to the Associated Press.

""He was so excited to be a dad, and he was going to be a great dad,"" McCollum said, according to the outlet. ""We want to make sure that people know that these are the kids that are sacrificing themselves, and he's got a family who loves him and a wife who loves him and a baby that he'll never get to meet,"" she said.



Another one of the American troops who died was 20-year-old Marine Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz.

""This was something he always wanted to do and I never seen a young man train as hard as he did to be the best soldier he could be,"" the man's father Mark Schmitz said, according to KMOX. ""His life meant so much more. I'm so incredibly devastated that I won't be able to see the man that he was very quickly growing into becoming.""

Rylee McCollum and Jared Schmitz were two of the 13 U.S. service members left dead in the wake of the attack, while 18 other American service members were wounded, according to the AP, which also noted that more than 160 Afghans also lost their lives.

Army Maj. Gen. William Taylor said during a press briefing on Friday that the attack in the vicinity of Hamid Karzai International Airport's Abbey Gate involved a suicide bombing followed by gunfire, but that it is not believed that there was a second explosion in the vicinity of the Baron Hotel as had been previously reported.

Even before the deadly attack the Biden administration had been heavily criticized by Republicans for bungling efforts to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan, where the Taliban has swiftly taken over, seizing the capital city of Kabul earlier this month. The U.S. has been scrambling to evacuate citizens and others.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/young-marine-whose-wife-was-expecting-a-baby-was-among-those-killed-in-thursday-terror-attack,2021-08-28
Zoom employee was Chinese spy who shut down anti-China video,"A former executive at Zoom, who shut down video conferences that were not flattering to China, was exposed as a spy for the Chinese Communist Party, according to the Department of Justice.

Xinjiang Jin, aka Julien Jin, was an employee of the American video conferencing company. The 39-year-old, who was based in China's Zhejiang Province, worked as a ""security technical leader"" for tech company headquartered in San Jose, California. Jin served as a liaison between Zoom and the Chinese government after Beijing blocked the company's service in China in September 2019.

Jin provided the Chinese Communist Party with information about users and meetings, even supplying the CCP with IP addresses from anyone who held anti-China sentiments, say federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York.

According to the complaint filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Jin reportedly participated in a plot to disrupt a series of meetings in May and June that commemorated the Tiananmen Square massacre, where at least 280 pro-democracy demonstrators were shot dead.

In the CCP's bidding, it is reported that at least four video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre were infiltrated and terminated. Jin and his co-conspirators reportedly contrived false accusations, including child porn and terrorism, against Zoom users in the United States.

Jin's co-conspirators created fake email accounts and Company-1 accounts in the names of others, including PRC political dissidents, to fabricate evidence that the hosts of and participants in the meetings to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre were supporting terrorist organizations, inciting violence or distributing child pornography. The fabricated evidence falsely asserted that the meetings included discussions of child abuse or exploitation, terrorism, racism or incitements to violence, and sometimes included screenshots of the purported participants' user profiles featuring, for example, a masked person holding a flag resembling that of the Islamic State terrorist group. Jin used the complaints as evidence to persuade Company-1 executives based in the United States to terminate meetings and suspend or terminate the user accounts of the meeting hosts.

In June, Zoom admitted that they suspended a U.S.-based user who had hosted an event commemorating the anniversary of 1989's Tiananmen Square Massacre. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, questioned the company's close ties with China.

""The allegations in the complaint lay bare the Faustian bargain that the PRC government demands of U.S. technology companies doing business within the PRC's borders, and the insider threat that those companies face from their own employees in the PRC,"" acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme said in a statement. ""As alleged, Jin worked closely with the PRC government and members of PRC intelligence services to help the PRC government silence the political and religious speech of users of the platform of a U.S. technology company. Jin willingly committed crimes, and sought to mislead others at the company, to help PRC authorities censor and punish U.S. users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression.""



Zoom is not directly identified in the DOJ document, but the teleconferencing company released a statement addressing the situation. Zoom said they were ""fully cooperating"" with the Department of Justice, terminated the ""China-based former employee charged in this matter,"" and ""placed other employees on administrative leave pending the completion of our investigation.""

Last week, there was a massive database leak of nearly 2 million registered Chinese Communist Party members. The breach provided an ""unprecedented view"" into how China could infiltrate western businesses and companies.

Afghan refugee convicted of sexually assaulting 3-year-old thought his behavior was acceptable,"Although America has its appalling share of child sex offenders, the law and culture still consider such behavior a heinous crime – at least until the Soros prosecutors take over the country. However, not all cultures are like that. What is the implication of bringing in carte blanche over 76,000 Afghans last year without any regard for cultural assimilation considerations? And by assimilation, I’m not referring to food and cloths, but core values.

Earlier this week, 24-year-old Mohammed Tariq, an Afghan refugee, was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old girl at Quantico Marine Corps Base where he was temporarily living along with many other refugees. According to the Justice Department, Tariq was arrested last September in Quantico after Marines observed him fondling a three-year-old girl. “United States Marines observed the defendant inappropriately touching the victim over her clothing, on her chest, genitals, and buttocks,” wrote the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Eastern District of Virginia in a press release following the jury conviction. “The victim and Tariq were unrelated, however, both Tariq and the victim and her family had recently been evacuated from Afghanistan and brought to the United States.”

AP reports that according to court documents, at the time of the incident “Tariq tried to explain through interpreters that his conduct was acceptable in his culture.” It turns out that Tariq was brought to America over the summer when the Taliban took over Kabul because he was a contractor for U.S. soldiers.

There’s a powerful lesson here about the counterproductive failures of our two-decade undefined mission in the hellhole called Afghanistan. Not only did we bring in thousands of people from remote parts of the country who had nothing to do with the U.S. military and we have no way of vetting them, but also the much-vaunted “contractors and interpreters” who “helped” our troops (help their own country) are unvetted as well. Sure, we might have successfully paid off some locals to help them with various tasks, but that does not make them fit for our culture and values. Now imagine the fact that we have brought in at least 76,000 Afghans last year on top of the over 76,000 we brought in since 2001. How many of them share the views of Tariq? Not all of them, but we have no way of knowing. “Invade the world, invite the world” is not exactly a strategy in the interests of the citizens of the United States.

Imagine the Americans Biden was willing to leave behind in Afghanistan in order to bring in backwards creeps like Tariq! The reality is that child sex is a known problem in the culture in parts of Afghanistan. I interviewed Jarrin Jackson, a retired Army captain who served two tours in Afghanistan and has run twice for Congress in Oklahoma, to get his reaction to this story. “In my two years of service in Afghanistan, I saw firsthand, the staples of Afghan culture,” said Jackson who commanded a platoon in the 101st Airborne.

“Most Afghans are decent, hard-working people; they just want to be left alone. However, the most disgusting and evil part of their culture, was a culture of tolerance for the sexually vicious. Young children were groomed and assaulted, and as they aged, would serve at the homosexual pleasure alongside warlords and wealthy Afghans. Every American soldier understood what a ‘cheska’ was and that it was impolite to draw attention to the sodomy and sexualization of young children.”

Jackson conducted operations in Khost Province, as well as Ghazni, Wardak, Helmand, and Khandahar. He feels guilty to this day that he didn’t slap around some of the perpetrators. “To my shame, I ignored multiple instances where I suspected rape and abuse of male prisoners by our Afghan partners, because I didn’t want the American mission to fail because it collided with the Afghan sexual ethic.”

The New York Times wrote an expose in 2015 about U.S. soldiers being told to remain silent in the face of witnessing these child molestations. In 2017, an aide to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) accused the Pentagon of blocking a report about rampant child molestation among the ranks of the Afghan soldiers and police, individuals who often worked closely with our military and would be candidates for special refugee status. Eventually, the report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) was released and chronicled how our military commanders gave the Afghan soldiers a free pass to molest children. There was a high-profile story with Green Beret Charles Martland who was initially punished for losing his cool and beating up an Afghan who had molested a boy and harmed the boy’s mother.

So, are we to believe that bringing in 76,000 afghans carte blanche has not led to the importation of some of this culture? The Quantico molestation case is not the first such incident. Two Afghan refugees were arrested at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin in September on rape charges, one of who is charged with child rape. A “vigorously vetted” Afghan was charged in October with rape in Missoula, Montana. At the time of the alleged rape in Montana, Rep. Matt Rosendale pointed out that during the initial court hearing, Mohmand’s attorney claimed that “cultural and language barriers” may have led to the rape. In another incident, A group of Afghan evacuees allegedly assaulted a female service member at Fort Bliss while they were staying on the base.

Well, not only does the Biden administration plan to move the existing ones out from the military bases into our communities by next month, but they are working on bringing in tens of thousands overseas through our military base in Qatar. Axios reports that DHS is planning “an expedited U.S. Refugee Admissions Program process in Qatar” that would “immediately put Afghans on a pathway to green cards.”

Red states can simply say no. They have a moral obligation to their citizens to block social transformation without representation. American citizens in some cities can’t go to the store without a Pfizer passport, yet people from the most dangerous, volatile, and culturally problematic parts of the world can be airdropped into our community with no way of vetting if they are fit for our society, much less engaged in terrorism. If we didn’t know any better, we might think our government is trying to replace We the People.

Best and greatest Christmas movies that aren't holiday movies,"Every year, you enjoy traditional Christmas classic movies, such as ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" ""A Christmas Story,"" ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" ""The Grinch,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""Elf,"" ""The Santa Clause,"" ""The Muppet Christmas Carol,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""National Lampoon Christmas Vacation.""

However, there are a handful of Christmas movies that aren't really Christmas movies that you should enjoy during the holiday season. We count down the movies that might not be Christmas movies per se, but have enough holiday jeer that you are compelled to watch them during Christmastime.

Here is the list of the eight best Christmas movies that aren't really Christmas movies.

8.) Lethal Weapon

This is definitely not your prototypical, run-of-the-mill Christmas movie. Los Angeles detective Roger Murtagh (Danny Glover), a devoted family man, is teamed up with a new partner – a suicidal loose cannon Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). The film kicks off with the Christmas classic ""Jingle Bell Rock."" Then there is a drug bust that goes down in the middle of a Christmas tree lot, plus a carton of eggnog – that gets shot. In the end, Murtagh and Riggs spend Christmas together. ''

7.) Meet Me in St. Louis

Set in 1904, ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" features Judy Garland singing the iconic Christmas anthem ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" Garland's character Esther Smith gets engaged to John Truitt (Tom Drake) at the Christmas Eve ball during the 1944 MGM musical, but her father announces they're moving after Christmas.

6.) You've Got Mail



This rom-com takes place from October to the spring, but the romance blossoms during the holiday season when Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) discovers that Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) will likely lose her store. There is plenty of Christmas tree-trimming and carol singing.

5.) Holiday Inn



This movie from 1942 features Bing Crosby, arguably the greatest Christmas crooner of all-time. As smooth as Tennessee whiskey, Crosby splendidly sings ""White Christmas,"" which is the best-selling single of all-time. The film, which also stars Fred Astaire, features a total of 12 songs written by celebrated composer Irving Berlin.

4.) Batman Returns



Sure this comic book movie has Danny DeVito as the Penguin villain, but it also has a visually-pleasing winter wonderland thanks to innovative director Tim Burton. Michael Keaton as Batman kisses Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, under the mistletoe and warns her that ""mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it."" A huge Christmas tree is the backdrop where Christopher Walken, who looks like a character straight from ""A Christmas Carol,"" throws out Christmas gifts to the crowd. Not before a ginormous red and green Christmas present rains terror on Gotham.

3.) Gremlins

If you're a struggling inventor and you're searching for that perfect Christmas gift for a loved one, try not to purchase an illegal wild animal from a shop in Chinatown that could cause widescale pandemonium. Instead, simply purchase a $50 gift certificate to Applebee's and call it a day.

Don't buy a Mogwai as a Christmas present; nothing good comes from doing so. But you don't have to take my word for it... you can ask Billy Peltzer, who made the mistake feeding Gizmo after midnight and allowing it to get wet. The Gremlins even love to go around the neighborhood to sing Christmas carols.

2.) Trading Places



A holiday tale about greedy people losing in the end that is set during the holiday season, which includes the second-worst Christmas bonus after the ""Jelly of the Month Club"" featured in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."" Dan Ackroyd attempts to undermine a hoity-toity corporate Christmas party where he smuggles smoked salmon into his stained Santa suit.

1.) Die Hard

Yes, ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie. Even John McTiernan, the director of the classic Christmas movie that isn't really a Christmas movie, admitted that ""Die Hard"" is indeed a Christmas movie. NYP and LAPD have acknowledged that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie.





""Die Hard"" takes place during the holiday season, specifically a company Christmas party. John McClaine's wife is coincidentally named ""Holly"" Gennaro McClane. One of the dead terorrists wears a Santa hat with a shirt reading: ""Now I Have a Machine Gun. Ho Ho Ho."" Feeling jolly yet?

Plus, what's more Christmas than saving your family by foiling a terrorist attack orchestrated by Hans Gruber on the Nakatomi Plaza? Instead of shimmying down a chimney like Santa Claus, St. McClane travels down an elevator shaft and air vents.

"Childhood, interrupted: Ruining young lives will not quell our existential fears","This piece was originally published on Medium.com, 25 July 2021. It was removed, along with my entire writer's account — all 83 essays including several commissioned and curated Medium features — ""Due to the elevated risk of potential harm to persons or public health.""

They think it's dangerous to talk about the depravity of what pandemic restrictions are doing to kids.

I think it's dangerous — and morally untenable — not to.

*********

In 2020, I watched — first with disbelief, then shock and horror — as schools around the world closed and children were masked and isolated. I could not understand what was happening or why. The data was clear: COVID-19 was not a significant threat to children — far less so than the risks we already tolerated every day from sports, car rides, swimming, or even from the freshly verboten flu.

Top 15 Causes of Death for 19y.o.-and-under in 2019 https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html

How were we not all on our knees with gratitude that this virus did not take children with a fraction of the frequency with which it took adults? Deaths of children with COVID, although undeniably tragic, are exceedingly rare.

In the time that it took to accrue roughly 400 C19 deaths in kids, more than 50,000 American children under 17 years died of all causes.

Deaths-by-age with COVID-19 since Jan 2020 (19mo.) https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3

I figured the panic would subside and the restrictions would be temporary. We couldn't justify continuing to take from our kids. After all, national school closures had never been instituted — or even considered — before and the Doomsday scenarios initially modeled became further divorced from reality by the day.

But even last fall — six months in — the facts had little bearing on public perception. For example, the actor Ryan Reynolds made a headline-grabbing statement just as school was set to resume in August that ""thousands"" of young people were dying from COVID-19 in Canada and insinuated that the public just didn't know. He raised the specter of some unseen entity secretly stealing our children.

And, instead of fact-checking his statement, the media amplified it.

Eleven months later, the cumulative total of deaths of Canadian young people is still off Ryan's terrorizing assertion by at least two orders of magnitude. And the article has never been corrected.

That was just one false media claim of too many to count, which all seemed to push panic as a public health strategy.

But regardless of the media's obvious incentive to sensationalize, their hyperbole and myopia didn't change the reality that children were spared.

And given that fact, I believed there was no way we could be shutting down children's lives for the sole purpose of shielding the elderly. The average age of a person who dies with COVID in most wealthy nations is higher than the average life expectancy (in the U.K., for example, it's 82). Someone surely would come to their senses. There is a natural order to life, and the pandemic response was in clear violation.

In the pre-2020 world, the welfare of children was a universally accepted (although not always perfectly practiced) priority. The importance of nurturing young people was not up for debate. Adults intuitively sacrificed to ensure that kids had what they needed to grow and thrive. Of course, some children had more resources than others, but the underlying value was the same. On the whole and up until that moment in history, kids came first.



And these weren't just feelings, they were facts. Tending to children ""followed the science.""

Then something in the ethos changed.

In this new world in which we now find ourselves living, that once-sacred order is inverted. Children must be restricted to protect the old. Their defining milestones and experiences are capriciously delayed and canceled by people who already experienced them. Kids' faces and airways are obscured to alleviate the anxiety of the unmasked adults around them.

Children's value — which was once predicated on their role as the literal future of humanity — has been perverted, now centering on their utility as shields for the elderly.

They're regarded as vectors of disease and shamed for putting adults in danger by daring to openly breathe or talk in public. The natural arc of life has been willfully set aside.

It's a world I no longer recognize — an aberration of values and theft from the young that I will never support.

It hits too close to home.

One of my babies lost her life before she even entered the world. And, at the time, I did not know how I would find the strength to carry on.

When she was born, she emerged impossibly tiny — no bigger than my palm — and completely still.

Remarkably different she was from my other three, who were born fierce and unrelenting in their demand for the delivery room's attention. Her facial expression was so peaceful — like a sleeping cherub on a faded cathedral ceiling with invisible wings. Her heart had stopped beating the day before, and she never drew a single breath.

My sweet Matilda — named after Roald Dahl's redoubtable young protagonist — died in my belly, and of all of my failures as a parent, this ranks among the most psychologically brutal.

As I held her in my hands, I grieved for her imagined future — for all the things she would never try or feel or do or see. I grieved that she was denied the triumph of her first steps and the pain of the bruises she would accumulate while practicing for them. I mourned the terror of walking into her first day of kindergarten and how her face would beam like the sun when I picked her up six hours later. I grieved that she would not get to grow up with three older sisters who would serve as both her bullies and her protectors, but — when it mattered most — her built-in support system to guide her through a beautiful life (hopefully) filled with more joy than pain. I grieved because, having lived a mere 29 years by that point, I was already well acquainted with how positively charmed — and utterly tragic — life could be.

But she'd never know. The whole of her impossibly brief existence occurred while sheltered inside my body. And I was so, so sad for her.

When my grandmother died the very next year, I grieved her, too. I had the distinction of being the only grandchild at her side when she passed. We knew, of course, that she was not immortal, but when she caught pneumonia, she deteriorated quickly and I was the only one of my generation living in close enough proximity to arrive in time. I was honored to be there holding her hand as she, too, went still: not so tiny, but no less perfect than her great-granddaughter, whom we had lost almost exactly 12 months before.

She died with 82 years of joy and pain etched into a face framed by strands of wiry grey and obstinate brunette.

Her body was peppered with scars from laying down the motorcycle that she rode well into her 60s, multiple cancer resections, and generally taking on all manner of risks that people told her she could not or should not attempt. She died having been joyfully married at 18, tragically widowed at 50, and having borne four daughters — just like I eventually would. She was the matriarch of a clan of 30 and counting, and she left behind the legacy of a life well lived.

When she was gone, I missed her so so much.

She had been a constant in my life, and her passing was a disquieting reminder of my mortality. My rank in the natural order shifted forward at that moment, and only one generation remained standing between me and my own final breaths.

The grief of my daughter's death was not the same as the grief of my grandmother's death. Gauging strictly by loss, my grandmother's death should have been more difficult. I had known my grandmother my entire life. She was as much a part of me as any limb or organ. She guided me and comforted me and impacted my trajectory in too many ways to count, and I missed her terribly — but there was comfort in knowing that it was simply her time to go. She had lived fully and had no regrets. Her arc was complete, and despite the loss, there was so much to remember and celebrate.

Despite never having met my daughter, her death was infinitely more challenging to process than my grandma's. It felt like a cruel injustice — because it was. There was no space for reflection or joy — only despair and regret. Canceled potential. Unnatural theft of kinetic energy.

And it's because the arc of her life never even began its rise.

*********

Some of the days to follow were more difficult than others. I can still conjure the feelings — now 12 years later — of pure heartbreak and hopelessness. What got me out of bed each day — what most helped the sadness slowly migrate from the front to the back of my mind — were the three little faces delicately constructed of my dad's steel-blue eyes and framed with my (now ex-) husband's dirty blonde ringlets that peeked around the corner of my bedroom door each morning. Those precious, perfect, and ever-changing faces did the impossible — they eased the sadness of my loss, dulled the pain in my chest, and dissolved the irrational anger I felt toward the sun for having the audacity to rise when I was so clearly suffering.

Tending to their needs fulfilled mine, and knowing how much they depended on me to deliver was the emotional fuel that kept me going. I would sit up, and they'd run in and jump on my bed and ask for eggs and bacon and chocolate milk. They'd inquire as to where we'd be going that day and what we might do. And I couldn't bring myself to deny them the care and experiences I'd committed to providing when I brought them into the world, just because things were difficult for me.

Watching them grow and thrive because of my efforts facilitated my healing more than anything else.

But — truth be told — the inherent injustice of my daughter's stolen life is still with me. And it has triggered some existential fears about my living children's survival, as well. Both are etched into my face, just like my grandma, and will pass on with me when I die, too.

The point is not to conflate the death of an infant with prolonged school closures. It's to describe the difference between my daughter's death and my grandmother's — to highlight why children are so valued and just how important it is to put their needs first.

We have an obligation to make them a priority and not to dismiss their losses with the wave of a hand. And to wit, the comparison stands: My grandma's death was sad, and yet, her life was fully lived. My daughter's death was tragic — because her opportunities were stolen.

And — like so many kids whose futures have been involuntarily put on pause since 2020 — she'll never get that time back.

*********

An iota of empathy was the sole requirement for acknowledging how educational disruption and social isolation (and eventually compulsory masking) could impact our youngest generation. Recognizing that impoverished and disabled children would bear the greatest brunt did not require an MPH or a Ph.D. in epidemiology. It was easy to see that, without the resources to purchase individually tailored, hand-delivered alternatives, non-wealthy children would simply have to do without the nutritional support, therapies, ESL classes, extracurricular activities, community resources, protective eyes and ears of mandatory reporters, and more generally, access to the single-greatest external factor influencing socioeconomic mobility: an education.

""But kids are resilient"" never sounded so sinister.

I believed there was no conceivable way we would let millions of children fall through the cracks of the very system designed to support them.

And yet …

Restrictions not only persisted; they intensified. When schools finally reopened — some more than a year later — they looked more like correctional facilities than communities of learning.

The message to the children came through loud and clear:

""Your role as a disease vector is central in this new schema — rising above all else — and your opportunities must be severely restricted to keep adults safe.""

Even now — 17 months from the first school closure — we know with unflinching certainty that COVID presents a negligible risk to kids. Not only that, but we have access to vaccinations that substantially reduce the likelihood of severe disease and death in at-risk and fearful adults. Yet, school districts around the country are already planning in-person restrictions for kids this coming fall. At that point, we will be waist-deep in Year Two of interrupting finite childhoods with indefinite restrictions.

And all of this leaves me no choice but to ask: ""What problem does this solve? Who is all of this meant to protect? And why can't we give those people the tools to protect themselves, while protecting the ones who cannot? Why have we become so obsessed with a single respiratory virus that literally nothing else — including the future of our children — matters any more?""

It doesn't make sense.

Those first budding friendships wherein we learn what it feels like and means to care about someone outside our immediate family — they matter. Learning to read people's expressions and developing empathy and communication skills — those lessons matter. As we get older, the final exams. The school trips. The dances. The graduations. First time living away from home. First relationship. First heartbreak. First job interview. Those things matter so much. They not only help kids learn and grow, but they give kids experiences to look forward to before their brains acquire the ability to conceptualize the future. They motivate and incentivize — two things every person needs for good mental health.

My grandmother got to experience all of those. Matilda didn't get any.

And it is a big deal to interrupt and delay them. It is such a big deal that we should only be considering doing so in the direst of circumstances. Childhood lasts a brief 18 years, and the window for maximum neuroplasticity is finite. We are taking opportunities away from them that they can — and will — never get back. And when the experiences and activities they value can be discarded with the pop of a single positive PCR test — what do children have to look forward to? What can they count on?

""Well, at least they're alive!"" does not hold up as a justification when they were never at risk of death in the first place.

""Well, at least I'm alive!"" is a more honest response.

Because none of this is for the benefit of the kids.

*********

It should not be a matter of debate that many children are suffering. And not simply the little ones who can't recognize their classmates' faces because of masks or those who were denied early intervention services meaning their developmental delays will persist longer than necessary.

Teen mental health — which was already teetering on crisis — has been decimated. Eating disorders in young people are on the rise. Overdoses are at record highs. And it is not hard to wrap one's brain around why. What is the point of protecting or nourishing a body that sees no path forward? Why not turn to alcohol or drugs when there are no life experiences available to get high on? That ""Why not?"" pulls a lot more weight with a person who has nothing to lose.

And how long do we expect children to endure the message that they are responsible if their elders die before they begin to internalize that guilt, shame, and self-loathing? Never before have we asked children to be the keepers of their parents' and grandparents' health. It is adults who are supposed to sacrifice for them — not the other way around.

And all of this should be moot because, no matter how many times we tell ourselves that the restrictions are justified to protect our children, the facts simply do not support it. And repeating ""Well, unless they stormed the beaches at Normandy, they have nothing to complain about"" is not only cruel and absurd, it won't erase the truth that this didn't have to happen.

Dismissing their suffering doesn't fix it — it only silences children's pain so that adults are spared the guilt of hearing it.

It's literally adding insult to horrifying injury.

*********

So how can we right this ship when it is so far gone?

Right now, children should be preparing for a normal return to school, especially given that kids are not responsible for COVID and schools are not significant transmission sites. They should be looking forward to seeing their old friends and making new ones, with their beautiful faces exposed, miraculous immune systems trusted, and airways unobstructed. They should be able to hug each other and hold hands and show physical affection and camaraderie. Six-foot spaced dots should be scraped off the floor, thrown in the trash, and all remnants of plastic barriers removed.

And when that first day of school finally arrives, they should be thanked for their sacrifices and allowed to express their anger and disappointment at what they lost.

They should be asked their opinion on how canceled events might be made up or recreated — and we need to action as many of those re-dos as possible because they will help suffering kids feel validated, proactive, and whole. Schools need to support the legions of children who suffered learning loss in catching up and be patient and understanding when they struggle. We need counselors specializing in social/emotional development available to help those who are now scared of others or afraid to take their masks off — kids who are suffering diagnosable mental health disorders as a direct response to the restrictions. And the prevailing message we send needs to be:

""You are valued, you are welcome, and you are safe. What happened isn't your fault, and we are going to try our best to fix it. And we will not do it again.""

But the most important thing we can do for our kids is get a grip on our own anxiety and stop projecting it onto children.

We are all going to die. Every single one of us. Seatbelts won't stop it. Socially isolating won't stop it. Locking ourselves in our homes won't stop it. Segregating unvaccinated people won't stop it. Restricting children's opportunities won't stop it. ZeroCovid policies won't stop it.

And — at this point — a reasonable person has to wonder: How much of this hysterical response is about our inability to confront our own mortality? How many people who say, ""If it saves one life …"" are really concerned about their own?

Have we become so insulated from and fearful of death that we are willing to sacrifice our children's childhoods to the false god of immortality?

Because if so, accommodating that fear will be a costly and tragic indulgence.

Like many parents, I would take a bullet for my children without a second thought. But that willingness or ability to sacrifice is not — and should not be — reciprocal. I would not expect or want my children to step in front of a bullet — metaphorical or otherwise — for me. Frankly, I would not allow it, even if it would ""only"" hurt or maim them.

I have been, thus far, blessed with 42 years on this earth. Not as many as I expect, but enough to have enjoyed my fair share of life. My oldest has had less than half of that. My youngest, a fourth. Their lives are worth more than mine, and they deserve a chance to live them. So even when life is challenging for me and their needs costs me something I want or need, I always put them first. They are entitled to a future, and they depend on me to provide it. Right now is their turn. I already had mine.

And that is the natural arc of life.

*********

The insistence that we must choose between the well-being of children and saving lives is false, and the idea that ""wanting children to have access to normal life means that you want to murder old people"" is a destructive projection of our own fears. The two are not mutually exclusive.

The world can keep turning while we work to preserve the remaining years of the older people we love, and we do not have to deny and restrict children to do it. We do not have to turn our backs on one to save the other.

But, for the sake of argument …

If we were forced into a Sophie's Choice between the futures of the old and the young, whose should we prioritize?

For me, the answer is obvious.

And you would not have to twist my arm to get me to step in front of that bullet.

*********

John F. Kennedy famously said, ""Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.""

Regardless of what this virus — or any other virus/crisis/tragedy — brings, if we do not course-correct and put our children first, the circle of life will be fractured.

And that may ultimately leave humanity not only morally bankrupt — but with no future to protect.

Deace: It is time to end 'Faucism' once and for all,"Over the past 14 months, all Americans have had their lives at least somewhat under the capricious control of the double-minded Anthony Fauci.

Same goes for every business and the decision of whether the business can be open and to what extent. Same goes for every school and every house of worship as well. Even whether we're permitted to breathe the free air outside once we're allowed to leave our homes.

And Fauci was granted that unprecedented authority without a single vote cast.

That level of power bestowed without direct consent of the governed would be dangerous enough to a free people even if it were given to someone with proven competence and reliable consistency. Absolute power corrupts absolutely even in the best of hands.

However, when that much power is given to someone with little regard for intellectual honesty and as schizophrenically wrong as Fauci has repeatedly proven to be, you end up with one of the darkest hours in our nation's history.

Such a long train of abuses requires a reckoning. While a 9/11 type of tribunal is what's required here, for now let us focus on these three headliners:

● Fauci has already admitted to lying to the American people regarding masks and the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19. These are two of the most contentious debates surrounding the pandemic, hence hardly insignificant points. Once someone has admitted to being a liar, how do you know they're not lying about everything else? How do you when to trust them and when not to?

● As we chronicle in our best-selling book ""Faucian Bargain: The Most Powerful and Dangerous Bureaucrat in American History,"" the Fauci flip-flops are legion. It would require a series of columns to itemize them all, and it took us an entire book to do it. Suffice to say, there isn't anything of substance pertaining to COVID-19 that Fauci has not flip-flopped on. One of our favorite examples actually occurred after our book was published. On April 18, Fauci said on ""Meet the Press"" the vaccinated still need to wear masks, as if they had not been vaccinated. But then later that same day on CBS, Fauci was incredulous that some Republicans (because don't all non-partisan bureaucrats single Americans out by political party?) wanted COVID restrictions lifted without getting vaccinated. Thus, on the same day Fauci said you couldn't go back to normal even if you're vaccinated, he said we needed to be vaccinated to go back to normal. Makes perfect sense, or not.

● The right to seek a second opinion is fundamental to our health care system. Yet through Fauci's refusal to consider any viewpoints that don't align with his particular narrative, the American people have been denied access to contrarian views from world-class experts from esteemed universities such as Oxford, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon — each of which are ranked among the most prestigious pillars of academia in this nation or on this planet. Yet they have been consistently ignored in exchange for whatever flat-earth voodoo Fauci is peddling at the moment.

We could continue with more, such as Fauci's refusal for whatever reason to ignore natural immunity in his herd immunity calculations. The emerging story about his bureaucracy's ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the controversial gain-of-function research conducted there. Or the fact that he is now admitting the entire premise of locking down the country and quarantining the healthy — Walking Dead-like fear of asymptomatic spread — isn't really a thing.

By now, though, you get the picture. Fauci is a bureaucratic tumor that has been allowed to metastasize. We now see even more public health officials following his nefarious lead. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky theatrically warned of ""impending doom"" in late March, before last week dramatically downgrading her agency's mask-wearing guidelines without citing any specific science whatsoever. Which at least suggests there never really was any specific science justifying what's now become an annoying mask cult.

Fellow Biden adviser Michael Osterholm warned ""the darkest days were yet to come"" over the next six to 14 weeks back in early February. Fourteen weeks later, cases are down 76% across the country, total hospitalizations are at their collective lowest in eight months, and U.S. excess mortality has fallen to pre-pandemic levels. As the great Bob Uecker once said, ""Just a bit outside.""

In his front cover endorsement of our book, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis specifically credited his state's success to his refusal to follow Faucism. While Fauci was ridiculously praising nursing home menace Andrew Cuomo, DeSantis was following actual science and data that our book proves has largely been known for a year. DeSantis followed it while others followed Fauci, and the results now speak for themselves.

We've heard enough of Fauci's forked tongue. The country has suffered enough under his reign of terror. End the failure theater once and for all.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-it-is-time-to-end-faucism-once-and-for-all,2021-05-19
Deace: True Americans make leftist tyrants extremely nervous,"The New York Times' Mara Gay has one thing right about the people she finds ""disturbing"" because that star-spangled banner yet waves somewhere nearby.

The United States is, in fact, their country. Far more than it is hers.

""It's a Republic, if you can keep it,"" said Benjamin Franklin upon the completion of the U.S. Constitution. More than two centuries later, the Steve Deace Show's paraphrase of that calling is our 2021 motto, ""The answer is us.""

Either way you frame it, this nation clearly belongs to those who not only honor the work of those done before them to liberate mankind from tyranny, but then also stand a post when their turn comes to make sure the lights don't get turned out on freedom during their watch.

With extreme prejudice, just like Captain America said, ""Whatever it takes.""

When that is the game, the pickup truck with the American flag defeats Maya Gay in a route as a de-facto citizenship test.

Just as it does the media that continually provides a platform for the likes of Gay in order to turn her emotionally and historically unstable rantings into run-of-the-mill propaganda. Take NBC and MSNBC, the news outlets that uncritically send out a woke SOS for seeing too much red, white and blue. Those networks also played host to contributor Frank Figliuzzi this week, a former assistant director of the FBI who said this about the kind of politician a flag-waving pickup truck driver might vote for:

""Arresting low-level operatives is merely a speed bump not a road block,"" Figliuzzi said. ""In order to really tackle terrorism ... you've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element … That may mean people sitting in Congress right now.""

All of this on the heels of several years of watching the same sort of people redefine gender, manipulate the existence of a virus for political gain and authoritative ends, shut down schools and mask children in defiance of all science, and promote mob violence in the streets and critical racist theory in the classroom to grow racial tension.

If standing up to that makes me a terrorist, sign me up and give me a cool ""command and control"" T-shirt to signal my virtue. Then come and get me. Please try, I dare you. I'm bored and have oodles of pent-up angst just looking for an outlet. Because there is absolutely no ambiguity now for those even remotely paying attention. Gay and Company hate us. And they mean to punish those who won't either endorse their revolution or at least passively accept it.

With every word and deed we are promised by such enemies that this isn't their country because they scream it with pornographic intent. They are ashamed of the formerly shining city on a hill and fundamentally loathe its founding principles.

Gay isn't really even posing as a victim in this case, although she wouldn't hesitate to do so if it helped her cause. What she is behaving like is a front-line general in a war of conquest. She is defining clear lines of battle.

Either we get that or America becomes a thing of the past. Guaranteed. How else do you think a nation ends up whose citizens are advertising in one state that adults will be able to claim a free marijuana joint when they receive a COVID-19 vaccine? Sheep say ""bah.""

True Americans, on the other hand, make tyrants like Gay nervous. They are unafraid to do what must be done. They will not relent. They are proud to be called to defend something greater than themselves. They will not be fooled again.

They are nothing like Gay. This is indeed their country far more than a usurper like her. And according to such terms, she is free to surrender any time now and we'll be happy to let her enjoy the true blessings of liberty – instead of conjuring forfeits that are born of hell itself.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-true-americans-make-leftist-tyrants-extremely-nervous,2021-06-11
Horowitz: America’s most violent year,"We have domestic terrorism in this country, all right. It's just that it emanates almost exclusively from the left and violent career criminals. When will our focus shift to those people? And if not, what's the purpose of having law enforcement other than to empower a tyrannical government?

Every last person involved in the Capitol riot will be brought to justice … and then some. But when will the people responsible for the most violent year be brought to justice?

It's not just the widespread arson, looting, vandalism, and blocking of roads we continue to see from Antifa and Black Lives Matter even now, into 2021. It's the widespread effects of the lawlessness and deterrent against policing (rather than against criminals) that has led to the sharpest one-year increase in crime in recent history.

Earlier this week, Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal revealing some startling crime statistics from 2020:

""Murder was up nearly 37% in a sample of 57 large and medium-size cities."" Some cities experienced sharper increases: 95% in Milwaukee, 78% in Louisville, Ky., 74% in Seattle, 72% in Minneapolis, 62% in New Orleans, and 58% in Atlanta, for example.

In total, at least 2,000 more Americans were killed in 2020 than in 2019.

This year, we witnessed brazen attacks on black children through gang warfare and drive-by shootings. ""Fifty-five children were killed in Chicago in 2020, 17 in St. Louis, and 11 in Philadelphia. In South Los Angeles alone, 40 children were shot, some non-lethally, through September.""

Mac Donald points out that most media figures and politicians blame the spike in violence on the stress of the pandemic. To the extent that this is not an indictment of their lockdown policies, Mac Donald observes the obvious fact that crime actually fell for the first few months of the pandemic and only rose at the end of May with the rise of BLM, the rioting, and the attacks on police.

It's not just the war on cops, but the war on incarceration. Virginia Democrats, for example, are debating SB 1370, a bill that will enable judges to retroactively shorten life sentences for some of the state's worst murderers. Many county jails have been emptied of their criminals thanks to endless rounds of de-incarceration ""reforms."" It's taking its toll on the streets.

The tragic irony is that as politicians abolish bail, shorten sentences, and drop prosecution of career violent criminals or rioters, the entire force of the federal law enforcement apparatus and some state law enforcements are being harnessed against conservative activists and Trump supporters, even those who did not engage in violence at the Capitol. Thus, we are now confronted with even more street violence as law enforcement stands down against the mayhem staring them in the face and leaves no stone unturned in persecuting Trump supporters.

In lower Manhattan this week, a flash mob ruthlessly beat a man on the street, leaving him bloodied and naked. Do you think for a minute those ""youths"" will be brought to justice? Do you think law enforcement will use technology to track down and prosecute even those who were in the vicinity of the attack, like they are doing with Capitol Hill?

The reality is that politicians only protect their own. You can beat civilians and destroy private property, because those are not sacred to our government. Then again, even public property, if demolished by the left, is not that sacred. The man who pleaded guilty to burning down the third precinct police station of the Minneapolis PD last May faces, at most, four years in prison before the early release programs likely trim the sentence down further. Hundreds of people were involved in the burning, but no more than four perpetrators will be charged at all. I'm sure the man caught moving Nancy Pelosi's lectern in the Capitol will serve more time in federal prison.



As the media and government obsessively focus on ""right-wing terrorism,"" it's not like the violence they are ignoring is ancient history. It's still happening. The violence in 2021 looks to be getting even worse. Shootings in south Los Angeles are up 742%. Eleven people have already been killed in Oakland, as compared to just one at the same date in 2020. Antifa continues to riot and block streets with impunity in places like Tacoma, Seattle, and Portland every single day. There is no safety net or backstop to the lawlessness as the entire law enforcement apparatus of the federal government trains its fire on Trump supporters.

Which raises the uncomfortable question: Should conservatives join with the left and support abolishing the police, at least the urban police departments (as opposed to rural sheriffs)? Throw in the FBI and the federal law enforcement agencies while we're are at it. If ordered liberty is no longer an option on the menu because the government refuses to do its core job and deter crime and violence, why should we have law enforcement around to be used as a blunt instrument against us and as an enforcement for tyranny? Why should we have law enforcement standing at the ready to arrest single moms like Larvita McFarquhar for opening her restaurant in Minnesota as violence pervades the streets of their cities uncontrollably?

What good is law enforcement if the only time they are effective is in enforcing COVID fascism, hampering us from defending ourselves against Antifa, clamping down on the First Amendment, and generally empowering despotic regimes to supplant our Constitution? I'd rather suffer from plain anarchy than a dystopian mix of anarchy for the fringe left and tyranny for the rest of us.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-americas-most-violent-year,2021-01-27
"Horowitz: While Andrew Cuomo uses law enforcement to target New York Jews, violent criminals terrorize subways","The Revolutionary War was fought, in the words of Sam Adams on Aug. 1, 1776, to determine whether ""there shall be left to mankind an asylum on earth for civil and religious liberty."" The purpose of just governance is laid out plainly in our Constitution — to ""secure the blessings of liberty,"" but at the same time to ""establish justice"" and ""ensure domestic tranquility."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo flipped this founding principle upside down by using government to harass New York's Jews and target their inalienable rights, while releasing criminals and blithely ignoring the violence on the streets. Indeed, revolutions have been fought over lesser abuses and usurpations.

After Cuomo singled out the Orthodox Jewish community by name for causing the increased spread in the virus (which is occurring in almost every part of the world), inspectors from many state enforcement agencies fanned out in their communities to issue citations. One local Jewish publication took a picture of a target list from inspectors, which revealed that every business or institution on the list was Jewish. In what makes the revolutionary-era British tax collectors and the Townshend Acts look like a liberty paradise, there are now city inspectors harassing Jewish business owners and falsely accusing them of not complying with recent coronavirus restrictions.

While Cuomo is very concerned about a temporary rise in cases because it interferes with the optics of his book release, he doesn't appear to be bothered by large gatherings that are not Jewish. Last week, a wedding planned for the granddaughter of a known Rabbi in the city was shut down by Cuomo. Yet just two days earlier, not a word was said by Cuomo or his officials about a large BLM rally for Breonna Taylor in Manhattan.



Cuomo has also targeted in-person classes of Jewish schools in certain zip codes, even though his own data from randomized testing shows no statistical spread of the virus by New York City schoolchildren.

Closing religious schools, houses of worship, and businesses … these are the things that were not tampered with even by King George. Revolutions were fought over less.

But it gets worse. You might think that Governor Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio have so many resources on hand to pursue a war against civil and religious liberty, particularly targeting Jews, because the city is safe from crime. Not a chance! New York City is experiencing its worst increase in crime since the early 1990s, and the subways are beginning to look like they did during the days of David Dinkins.

The family of Bi He, 73, and husband Ren Bao, 82, would sure have wanted Cuomo's laser-beam focus on obeying laws to have been present in the Brooklyn subway on Monday when they and their grandson were brutally attacked. Bi He had her foot twisted, was shoved onto the tracks, and would have been run over if not for the quick reaction by the train conductor of the oncoming subway car. Unfortunately for them and for the increasing number of subway attack victims, the attacker was likely not Jewish, so Cuomo won't flood the subways with inspectors and police

The previous evening, a man was randomly shot in the neck while waiting on a subway platform in Manhattan. Last Friday night, a 30-year-old woman was found dead, face-down in a Brooklyn subway. Every week, there are more brazen and heinous assaults committed on the subways, often targeting elderly people.



The lack of deterrent against subway violence stemming from the breakdown in law and order is emblematic of the broader problem on New York's streets this year. Overall, the number of shooting incidents in the city increased 127% in September over the same period last year. And while Cuomo and de Blasio criminalize basic life, liberty, and property under the puerile assumption that they can stop a virus, they are using the same virus as a pretext to keep thousands of criminals out of state and city jails. Meanwhile, the NYPD is catching these same people committing more crimes after they are released.

So, with all this crime and mayhem, where are the police? I guess Cuomo is too busy patrolling Jewish weddings. After all, he wants to keep everyone safe.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-andrew-cuomo-harasses-new-york-jews,2020-10-22
Horowitz: Are elites planning a COVID repeat ... with smallpox?,"Those who watched Glenn Beck's special presentation Wednesday night on the origins of SARS-CoV-2 now understand that people like Bill Gates spent over a decade both funding coronavirus gain-of-function research and, curiously, warning about the coming of a coronavirus pandemic. So with Bill Gates insinuating that there might be a smallpox pandemic — an idea we would have laughed off as the ultimate conspiracy theory a few years ago — we should pay close attention.

What is the likelihood that less than two weeks after the most notorious global financier of vaccine research warns about an outbreak of the long-extinct smallpox virus, questionable smallpox vials would show up in a Merck lab? Well, this is the world we now live in, or perhaps the world our globalist overlords have now created.

During a Policy Exchange think tank interview with the chair of the U.K. parliament's Health and Social Care Select Committee and former U.K. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Bill Gates randomly and shockingly warned of a smallpox bioterror attack. ""You say, OK, what if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports? You know, how would the world respond to that?"" asked Gates rhetorically in the creepy Nov. 4 interview with Hunt. ""There's naturally caused epidemics and bioterrorism-caused epidemics that could even be way worse than what we experienced today.""

There's no evidence of any terrorist organization even focusing on this issue, which was more of a concern among our counterterrorism community during the previous decade.

Fast-forward to Monday night outside Philadelphia, and Yahoo News reported that the CDC is quarantining and the FBI is investigating 15 ""questionable vials""that were found in a Merck lab freezer in North Wales, Pa., with 10 labeled as ""Vaccinia"" and the remaining five labeled as deadly ""Smallpox.""

As Yahoo reported: ""The frozen vials labeled 'Smallpox' were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker while cleaning out a freezer in a facility that conducts vaccine research in Pennsylvania,"" the CDC said in a statement to Yahoo News. ""CDC, its Administration partners, and law enforcement are investigating the matter and the vials' contents appear intact. The laboratory worker who discovered the vials was wearing gloves and a face mask. We will provide further details as they are available.""

""Vaccinia"" is related to the pathogen that causes smallpox and was used as the foundation to create the vaccine for smallpox. In fact, the etymology of the word vaccine dates back to the late 18th century when cowpox was used as a precursor to smallpox vaccines. ""Cow"" in Latin is ""vacca.""

It is well known that it's illegal for Merck to hold such a vial in a freezer. What is Merck's explanation for having this in its freezer in a random storage locker?

In normal times, we'd dismiss these concerns, but the discovery of a labeled pathogen and at least the symbolism of the antidote beside it – following a warning by the vaccine pope of the world – actually mimics the lead-up to COVID almost perfectly.

A brief history of how we got here: coronavirus and vaccines

For two decades, there was a seamless web of people like Fauci, Gates, Peter Daszak, and Ralph Baric working on coronavirus gain-of-function research, pursuing coronavirus vaccines, and warning about the imminence of an outbreak. So we should take these people seriously when they warn of other outbreaks, because evidently they are ""in the know.""

Here is just a small segment of the history behind the virus:

In January 2010, Bill Gates predicted we'd be ushering in the ""decade of vaccines.""

In 2012, the NIH partnered with Moderna, an obscure start-up company, to create mRNA vaccines. They are still fighting over the patent rights to this day.

On Sept. 9, 2013, Ralph Baric, the doctor behind the coronavirus gain-of-function research at UNC Chapel Hill in cooperation with the Wuhan lab, announced a $10 million grant from Fauci's NIAID ""to study the pathogenic activity of viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola, highly pathogenic influenza and herpesvirus HHV8,"" which will help ""identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention and improve strategies for vaccine design.""

In November 2015, Baric and company publish their discovery in Nature magazine on cracking the code of transferring coronavirus from bats into mice with human lung tissue that is now pathogenic and can create an epidemic. Last month, the NIH finally admitted in a letter to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that the agency indeed did fund EcoHealth's support of Baric, together with the Wuhan lab that succeeded in enhancing a bat coronavirus to become more infectious to humans. The NIH blamed EcoHealth and called the breakthrough research ""an unexpected result.""

Now consider the fact that on Jan. 10, 2017, Fauci delivered a speech at Georgetown University's conference on ""Pandemic Preparedness in the Next Administration"" and warned that there ""definitely"" would be another pandemic. He ended his speech (around the 38:25 minute mark) warning ""the administration that is going to come in in the next few days"" is going to have to deal with a pandemic. After listing some potential pandemics, he boldly predicted, ""What is for sure that no matter what, history has told us definitively that it will happen."" He added, ""The thing we are extraordinarily confident about is that we will see this in the next few years.""

It's one thing to say you always have to be ready for an unprecedented pandemic, but to predict definitively with extraordinary confidence that it will happen within a ""few years,"" most certainly falling within the term of the next president? That is downright creepy, given his funding of the very research that likely created the virus.

But perhaps his comments could be dismissed as doomsday prophecy from a man steeped in infectious diseases … if not for a germ war game the Obama administration played with the Trump transition team just three days later, accompanied by an ominous policy change Trump was certainly unaware of. Last March, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco revealed in ""Foreign Affairs"" that on Jan. 13, 2017, Obama national security officials held a pandemic war game exercise with transition team members from the incoming Trump administration. She described the scenario as follows: ""A new virus was spreading with alarming speed, causing global transportation stoppages, supply-chain disruptions, and plunging stock prices. With a vaccine many months away, U.S. health-care infrastructure was severely strained.""



However, what she does not reveal, but what Peter Breggin pointed out in his book, ""COVID-19 and the Global Predators,"" is that on that very same day in 2017, the FDA placed a new regulation in the Federal Register that ""enhances FDA's authority"" to shepherd through policies and products in the event of a ""pandemic influenza."" Specifically, the regulation ""Permit[s] FDA to waive otherwise applicable current good manufacturing practice requirements (e.g., storage or handling) to accommodate emergency response needs"" and allows CDC ""to create and issue ""emergency use instructions"" concerning the FDA-approved conditions of use for eligible products.""

The ""medical products"" affected by these changes, which are referred to as ""medical countermeasures"" (MCMs),"" include ""drugs (e.g., antivirals and antidotes), biological products (e.g., vaccines, blood products, and biological therapeutics), and devices (e.g., in vitro diagnostics and personal protective equipment).""

There are many more interconnected webs, but fast-forward to October 18, 2019, supposedly two months before the pandemic, and the Gates Foundation, in conjunction with Johns Hopkins University and the World Economic Forum – the three major players in this escapade – held ""Event 201,"" which simulated ""an outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic.""

What is the nature of the pathogen? ""The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.""

What was the purpose of the simulation? Among other things, ""Governments, international organizations, and businesses should plan now for how essential corporate capabilities will be utilized during a large-scale pandemic.""

And as they say, the rest is history.

Other important dates and documents in the timeline of the cover-up can be found here.

Deja vu with smallpox?

So when Bill Gates is warning about smallpox right before vials of smallpox are discovered, and in the same week a Maryland woman tests positive for monkeypox, we should pay attention.

But that is not even the punch line. Just like with coronavirus, they were already working on a ""cure."" On June 4, the CDC randomly approved a smallpox drug, Tembexa (brincidofovir), because ""there have been longstanding concerns that the virus that causes smallpox, the variola virus, could be used as a bioweapon.""

It is well known that no pharma company will spend hundreds of millions developing a drug for an eradicated disease, on which there is no way to earn billions in profit. Now, even if this drug was around before and they are repurposing it for smallpox, it still costs millions to go through the process. Why?

And speaking of this history of this drug, it sounds eerily similar to the drugs they have approved for COVID, including remdesivir. It turns out that like Gilead's remdesivir and Merck's molnupiravir, brincidofovir was a failed repurposed drug with safety concerns. Its maker, Chimerix, conducted three failed Phase 3 trials for the indication of adenovirus, and it flopped! It also comes with an FDA ""black box"" warning for use for smallpox, for increased mortality after taking more than just two doses, based on those same failed studies!

So just like remdesivir, the drug they plan to use is an expensive, on-patent drug, although repurposed. But unlike ivermectin, which was extraordinarily safe and effective for its original use – yet is vociferously opposed by the cabal – these drugs failed miserably in their original indications. Just like the other two failed COVID drugs approved by the FDA – baricitinib and tofacitinib – this smallpox drug comes with an FDA black box warning!

Shockingly, the FDA notes in its June 4 approval letter that it did not conduct any human trials for safety and relied on the ""Animal Rule,"" ""which allows findings from adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies to serve as the basis of an approval when it is not feasible or ethical to conduct efficacy trials in humans."" But that is only when it is proven from previous approved indications to be safe and effective so that it can be repurposed for a secondary indication in its same formulation based on animal studies … you know, like perhaps something like ivermectin being used for antiviral after approval for parasites because it was so safe and effective. But this drug was proven unsafe and ineffective to the point that it never got approval for its primary indication and is now being used for a secondary indication without a human study!

Typically, the cure is created after the illness, but in this case perhaps the illness is coming to ""cure"" what they perceive to be an ailment among we the people. And perhaps the proposed ""cures"" will look a lot like ailments, just as we have seen with the shots, remdesivir, baricitinib, and tofacitinib – and most likely will see with Merck and Pfizer's new COVID drugs.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-are-elites-planning-a-covid-repeat-with-smallpox,2021-11-18
Horowitz: Are pregnant women given enough informed consent in the risk-benefit analysis of the vaccine vs. the virus?,"Some ""medical experts"" seem to think men can give birth, but during this pandemic, we should be thankful that it's women who carry babies, because they appear to be at a much lower risk than men for severe disease from SARS-CoV-2. A new study comparing mortality rates among pregnant vs. non-pregnant COVID hospital patients demonstrates that the ubiquitous talking point about pregnant women being so much more at risk appears not to be grounded in reality.

A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine by researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Texas Health Science Center seemed to find that pregnant women hospitalized for a COVID diagnosis actually fared slightly better than non-pregnant women in the same age cohort (women under 45).

""In-hospital death occurred in 0.8% (n = 9) of pregnant patients and 3.5% (n = 340) of nonpregnant patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia,"" the authors found in this surprising result. ""Median time from admission to death was 18 days (interquartile range, 6 to 28 days) for pregnant patients and 12 days (interquartile range, 5 to 23 days) for nonpregnant patients.""

In a first-of-its-kind study, the analysts did a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Premier Healthcare Database, an all-payer data repository that captures 20% of U.S. hospitalizations. While the study does not give any indication of whether pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized in the first place, it does seem to show that there is certainly no greater risk of death among those who are pregnant once hospitalized.

To begin with, young women are the lowest-risk group for COVID, being much less at risk than even young men. However, pregnant women have been terrorized by the entire medical community into getting the experimental shots because they are being told ubiquitously that pregnancy is akin to a severe condition like old age, obesity, and diabetes. It's clear from this study of a large sample size that while we can't rule out pregnancy as more likely to lead to hospitalization (or not), if it truly were like a comorbidity, one would expect an unmistakably higher death rate among that cohort as compared to non-pregnant women of the same age.

In fact, among just 9 pregnant patients who died of COVID found in the Premier Healthcare Database through November 2020, not surprisingly, six were obese and seven had at least one comorbid condition. Also, eight of them were non-white, which follows the pattern of the general non-pregnant universe, which is that most of the deaths are among the obese and those with comorbities, with a somewhat higher risk among non-whites. If pregnancy is an elevated risk, it is certainly not detected in this study.

A similar cohort study by the University of Oxford that looked at all symptomatic hospitalized patients with COVID-19 ages 20 to 39 hospitalized throughout the United Kingdom reported mortality of 0.8% in pregnant and 3.1% in non-pregnant women.

Even in the CDC's survey, which shows the opposite, the numbers are unremarkable. Unlike the aforementioned two studies, the CDC covered overall mortality for both hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-infected women and found a mortality rate of 0.15% among pregnant and 0.12% among non-pregnant patients. However, as noted by authors of this new study, the CDC's survey was not a full study group but from a voluntary reporting registry set up by the CDC, where the pregnancy status was only available for 36% of the registrants.



The reason this finding is so important is that the ironclad premise that pregnant women are so much more at risk from the virus has led the medical community to shame nearly every pregnant woman into getting the experimental shots. The medical establishment has violated the long-standing principle of not giving pregnant women anything that has not undergone rigorous safety trials specifically designed for pregnant women, which is why there are few drugs of any sort on the market recommended for them.

In a line that should shock the conscience of every American, Pfizer scientists write in the six-month update on the safety and efficacy of their vaccine that safety trials for pregnant women are still ongoing. ""This report does not address VE and safety in pregnant women and in children younger than 12 years. Studies evaluating BNT162b2 in these populations are ongoing,"" write the authors in the pre-print posted on July 28.

Notice how they place pregnant women in the same category as kids under 12 for not having a complete safety profile. Well, when it comes to kids under 12, we all know that the shot is not even available for voluntary use, which makes sense. But for pregnant women, not only is it available and forced upon them by practically every OB/GYN, any of them living under a mandate from a public or private entity are forced to take the shot! How is this OK?

Likewise, it wasn't until July that Moderna even announced it was conducting a safety trial on pregnant women. At the time, my wife turned to me and said, ""When do we ever approve, much less de facto mandate (for some) a medical intervention on pregnant women before the safety studies are complete?""

As of Aug. 13, there were 1,175 reports of miscarriages reported to VAERS. However, we know that the reporting is only capturing a fraction of the likely adverse events, especially for something like a miscarriage, which is not nearly as clear-cut as an anaphylactic reaction or myocarditis. Given the cumbersome nature of filing a VAERS entry and the penalty for falsifying it, doctors are going to be very reluctant to lodge a miscarriage filing.

Shockingly, in its letter of approval to BioNTech on Monday (p.6), the FDA openly conceded that the VAERS surveillance is insufficient even for more definitive adverse events like myocarditis. ""We have determined that an analysis of spontaneous postmarketing adverse events reported under section 505(k)(1) of the FDCA will not be sufficient to assess known serious risks of myocarditis and pericarditis and identify an unexpected serious risk of subclinical myocarditis,"" writes the FDA in a shocking revelation that flies in the face of its approval. ""Furthermore, the pharmacovigilance system that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.""

Again, if that's the case for serious reactions like myocarditis, how much more is the surveillance system insufficient in capturing the more ambiguous fertility and pregnancy issues. Even the media has widely reported on the menstrual irregularities that many women throughout the world have been complaining about following the shots. The notion that women have enough data and information on this to make an informed decision at this point is simply unfounded.

Until now, those pushing government mandates even on pregnant women have hidden behind the ""fact"" that pregnant women will all die from the virus, so it gives the medical establishment and the government the right to break all norms and safety protocols by de facto mandating the vaccine. But does the data really bear that out, at least for young women without obesity or serious underlying conditions?



Moreover, as with other groups of people, there is a third choice between facing the virus with nothing and risking a high miscarriage rate with the shots. There is multi-drug early treatment for the virus that has proven effective. In the irony of all ironies, hydroxychloroquine, for example, is one of the few drugs on the market that actually has controlled trials vouching for its safety in pregnant women (primarily because of use for lupus and malaria), yet the medical establishment treats this drug, which has been prescribed more often than even morphine, as some experimental poison, while the shots still undergoing trials are a de facto mandate in some places!

The question of how at risk pregnant women are from the virus and from the shot are life-altering questions that are being answered conclusively without enough evidence to back up the claims. Once again, the same people who are lying about previously infected people being at risk are to be believed to place a spike protein in the body of every pregnant woman.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-are-pregnant-women-given-enough-informed-consent-in-the-risk-benefit-analysis-of-the-vaccine-vs-the-virus,2021-08-27
"Horowitz: As criminals take advantage of hands-off justice system, feds clamp down on political prisoners","For the past decade, I've been trying to raise awareness about the harms of the weak-on-crime policies being advocated by both parties. As crime continues to surge, even the most violent career criminals are released on little or no bail, a growing phenomenon that is responsible for most of the violent crimes committed in the country. The insipid mantra of the de-incarceration crowd is that we shouldn't lock people up for low-level offenses. I have long wondered what they consider to be high-level offenses. Now we have our answer. It is you and me.

We are now living in an America where accused murderers and rapists with long rap sheets are released without bail, while Trump supporters are being held without the opportunity to post even high bail for nebulous charges of trespassing on public property. All of us want violent criminals punished, but as Julie Kelly of American Greatness found after examining 200 indictments related to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, nearly all of them were charged with trespassing for simply taking selfies in the Capitol.

Take the case of Jessica Watkins. She is being charged with disorderly conduct, entering a restricted building, and obstruction of an official proceeding. She has no prior record, and these are the quintessential ""low-level"" crimes I've been hearing the left lament for years in the context of the discussion of over-incarceration. Yet the Feds are asking that she be held without bail because she has spoken to friends about the need for a revolution.

By that standard, tens of millions of Trump-haters could have been held without bail for the comments they regularly spewed about him for years, especially when they were involved in Black Lives Matter riots. The fact that people are being charged, much less held without bond, for taking selfies in the Capitol, with no evidence that they engaged in assault or theft, is further disturbing because by the government's own admission, some police officers let them in. Last week, the Capitol Hill police announced the suspension of six officers and an investigation into the actions of 29 others because they are suspected of letting in the crowd. Absent evidence of other criminal behavior, it is indefensible to charge civilians with trespassing before this investigation is complete.

It's also disturbing that they continue to lie about the death of Officer Brian Sicknick to use it as a pretext for labeling any and all opposition to the Left as insurrection and sedition and treating the entry into the Capitol differently from any other commensurate crime.



Let's be clear: The only political violence that has taken place since Jan. 6 fomented by a group that wants to overthrow the government is from Antifa. Antifa's adherents have committed clear-cut violent crimes, yet few of them are arrested and none of them are held without bail. Thus, when attorney general nominee Merrick Garland compares Trump supporters to Timothy McVeigh and vows to focus on ""domestic terrorism"" but refuses to mention Antifa, you know this is not about justice, but about a sadistic persecution. In fact, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Antifa's attacks are not terrorism because they occur at night. It's all about a two-tiered system. Which is why, when Garland promises to fight discrimination, he doesn't mean the systemic anti-white bias at every level of the corporate culture.

The two-tiered justice system is even more appalling when you examine the number of rapists and murderers who have been set free on low or no bail in recent years in all of America's major cities. While there is zero evidence of any of the Capitol Hill protesters committing crimes outside that day, most crime in this country is committed by repeat violent offenders released under ""criminal justice reform measures.""

Just to pick a recent example from Chicago, America's murder capital, Oscar Grissett was just bonded out of jail again by a liberal advocacy group despite a history of manslaughter, robbery, and committing crimes while on parole. Here is his timeline according to CWB Chicago:

In 1992, Grissett was paroled from a two-year sentence for aggravated battery causing great bodily harm.

Just four weeks later, he was charged with murder after driving a stolen car and killing a pedestrian with it while fleeing from police. He received a 25-year sentence, but despite 100 disciplinary actions while in prison, he still got out early, even though this was during the two decades of ""tough on crime"" sentencing.

In 2010, he was convicted of theft and robbery again and sentenced to two 15-year terms and a 9.5-year term, but of course wound up being paroled by 2018.

Shortly thereafter, he was convicted for another robbery of a store and sentenced to just four years, but was released after less than two years in March 2020.

While he was on parole, prosecutors charged him with two counts of felony possession of a stolen motor vehicle and felony burglary in September of last year. One would think that given his rap sheet and the fact that he was unrepentant from three decades of crime, he would be held without bail. But instead he was offered just $25,000 cash bail, which was paid for by ""the Bail Project,"" a left-wing group that is against pre-trial holding (but would never bail out Trump supporters for low-level charges of trespassing on public property).

So, what did Grissett do while out on bail again? Police arrested him on December 8 for stealing a car and then holding up a store clerk at a pet store and stealing money from the cash register.

Yet despite all this, last Friday, Judge Susana Ortiz set his bail at $100,000 for the pet store robbery and ordered Grissett to go onto electronic monitoring if he posts bond.

Rather than pushing reforms to stop this leaky justice system, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a bill nearly abolishing cash bail.

The case of Oscar Grissett is not an aberration. It represents the prototypical career criminal who is never properly deterred or stopped in our justice system. It's in this world that Trump supporters are now being held without possibility of even posting bail on charges of trespassing in a public building, even if they didn't engage in violence and did not have a prior record.

While the DOJ and the DHS focus on the nonexistent threat of ubiquitous violence from Trump supporters, nearly every major city is seeing a surge in crime thanks to the reduction in prison and jail incarcerations. Philadelphia is experiencing an even worse crime year than last year, which was the worst in a generation, when Philly had the second highest number of murders on record. Over the weekend, the violence spread to the suburb of Norristown, where one was killed and four were injured while children were enjoying a night of bowling with their families.



Perhaps it will take the violence spilling over into the suburbs, where some suburban voters have become woke, for them to realize that it is the career violent offenders who need to be locked up to ensure their family's safety, not Trump voters.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-as-criminals-take-advantage-of-hands-off-justice-system-feds-clamp-down-on-political-prisoners,2021-02-23
Horowitz: Attack on Colleyville synagogue: The next FBI memory-holed terrorist attack,"In the eyes of the FBI, the only potential terrorists in this country are those who disagree with the political views of the left – not actual terrorists with ties to foreign terror groups. Which is why any true terrorist attack immediately gets memory-holed by the FBI and the media. The Islamic attack on a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, is just the latest example.

On Saturday afternoon, 44-year-old British national Malik Faisal Akram allegedly barged into services at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville and took four people hostage for about 10 hours. Late Saturday night, the hostages were freed and the suspect was shot dead by the SWAT team, which stormed the building when some of the hostages ran out with the suspect in pursuit. The Associated Press reported that the suspect had demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist imprisoned on charges of trying to kill American service members in Afghanistan.

Following the resolution of the hostage crisis, the FBI agent in charge immediately stated that the suspect was “singularly focused on one issue” that was not “specifically related to the Jewish community.” Sure, it just happens to be that the man decides to pick the one Jewish synagogue in an area with few Jews. Remember, this is the same FBI that still has no motive for the Vegas shooting, the Nashville Christmas bombing, the April 2021 Capitol attack, and more recently a case of a black nationalist mowing down six people at a Waukesha parade two days after the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict.

Joe Biden chimed in with an awkward and bizarre statement too: ""I don't think there is sufficient information to know why he targeted that synagogue, why he insisted on the release of someone who's been in prison for over 10 years ... why he was using anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli comments,"" said the president on Sunday.

According to British authorities, the suspect was a national of the U.K. He hailed from Blackburn, a city which has radical mosques with ties to Islamists.

Akram apparently arrived in the U.S. just five weeks ago, which makes the concern of ties to international terror even more alarming, especially since police in Manchester, England, arrested two teenagers in connection with Akram.

After these details were disclosed and the British media began reporting on it, then the FBI had to concede the obvious:

Who is Aafia Siddiqui, the person allegedly at the center of the hostage-taker’s demands? An American-educated Pakistani neuroscientist, Siddiqui was captured in Afghanistan in 2008 and put on trial in 2010 for attacking soldiers. She was accused of grabbing a rifle and firing on soldiers during an interrogation, injuring an FBI agent and a U.S. Army officer. She was sentenced to 86 years in prison after the jury found that ""Siddiqui attempted to murder Americans serving in Afghanistan, as well as their Afghan colleagues."" She is residing in a Texas prison. Known as “Lady Al-Qaeda,” Siddiqui demanded during the trial that Jews be excluded from the jury, claiming the entire prosecution had been orchestrated by unnamed ""Jews.""

Just two months ago, the Council on American Islamic Relations, which is the American branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, demanded that she be released. So here we have a Texas synagogue attacked by a supporter of an international terrorist who has support from an organization that works together with the DHS and the subject of the matter was a known Jew-hater, yet the FBI can’t connect any dots?

In a Facebook post on November 15, CAIR of DFW wrote, “We’ll be meeting with Congressional offices to educate them about Dr Aafia and call for her release. Special thanks to CAIR for being a pillar and letting utilize the office, which is walking distance from Congress, as our primary staging and organizing area.” Will those congressmen be forced to denounce their supporters the same way allied congressmen of some of the Jan. 6 protesters are being subpoenaed by a special congressional committee? Prominent mosques in America have recently held rallies to free Lady Al-Qaeda. Do you think any of the resources of the DHS and FBI will be focused on those people?

Instead, the entire purview of the FBI is now focused on conservative political groups whom they refer to as white supremacists. Last week, an FBI official told the U.S. Senate that “anti-government extremists,” meaning detractors of the Biden regime, are the nation’s top security threat. In other words, the newly created anti-domestic terrorism unit within the FBI will not be focused on groups with ties to Siddiqui sympathizers, but political opponents of the regime. ""We have seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. You better believe he doesn’t mean Islamic terrorist sympathizers; he means grandmothers with MAGA hats.



The U.K. Daily Mail is reporting that Akram was given a rare Exclusion Order at Blackburn's magistrates' court in the U.K. for his rantings about 9/11. How was a man like this able to fly to the U.S.? Well, evidently our homeland security and counterterrorism agencies are more focused on fighting domestic political opponents than foreign terrorists.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-attack-on-colleyville-synagogue-the-next-fbi-memory-holed-terrorist-attack,2022-01-17
Horowitz: BLM activist who burned cop car gets lenient sentence to protect him from deportation,"Setting a police car on fire during a riot is a pretty serious crime, don’t you think? Some might even call it an insurrection. Yet, in the case of BLM arsonist Ayoub Tabri, he was sentenced to just one year in prison. How much do you think a January 6er would have served for such a crime?



Ayoub Tabri, 25, of Arlington, Virginia, was arrested in 2020 for tossing a lit road flare on a Pennsylvania state trooper’s car during a BLM riot in Philadelphia. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Joel M. Slomsky imposed a 364-day sentence on him rather than the 37 to 46-month sentence recommended by prosecutors. As for the reason, the Philadelphia Inquirer is rightfully confused about whether this is because BLM is a protected cause or because this man’s immigration status made him a protected class.

“But it remains to be seen whether his sentence was a sign of a softening stance toward those charged with similar offenses during the May 30, 2020, unrest or an outlier influenced by the unique immigration consequences that Tabri — a citizen of Morocco who has lived in the U.S. as a green card holder since he was 6 years old — faced because of his crimes.” Tabri was a beneficiary of the diversity visa lottery.

The judge noted in the sentence that because a sentence of 365 days or more would be defined as an “aggravated felony” for the purpose of deportation law, he purposely sentenced him to 364 days to avoid removal from the country. Given the time served in jail pre-trial, this means Tabri will be released immediately on three years’ probation.

In other words, a member of a protected class got protection for engaging in a crime on behalf of another protected class.

Across the board, we have witnessed leniencies for BLM rioters, including those who burned down police stations because judges sympathized with their cause. However, in this case, it is particularly egregious. We should embrace the opportunity to deport violent foreign nationals, not shun it. Typically, we are forced to constantly deal with the revolving door of American violent criminals who continuously get out of jail and reoffend. But why should we keep other countries' criminals? If indeed this man’s deportation would be difficult, that is a decision ICE should make, not a federal judge.









The Inquirer notes that although this case had an extra wrinkle because of the immigration status, the new Biden U.S. attorney allowed other BLM arsonists to plead down from a seven-year mandatory sentence. Despite videos of Tabri and his friends armed with flares and a hammer, skateboards, a bike lock, and a crowbar attacking other cars, “Assistant U.S. Attorney Vineet Gauri described the plea agreement and the government’s reconsideration of the arson charge as part of “the Justice Department’s holistic view of these cases around the country.”

“A holistic view?” In other words, even though these crimes could have and often did lead to death, serious bodily injury, and widespread destruction, because it was for the “right” sort of cause, they went lenient on the defendants. They took into account prior records and the fact that Tabri otherwise wasn’t in trouble with the law. Contrast that to J6 defenders who served honorably in the military, never had a criminal record, and weren’t nearly as violent, yet they were held without bail.

But the two-tiered justice system is exactly what America’s judicial system has devolved into. Earlier this week, federal prosecutors dropped charges against nine crew members of Stephen Colbert who were caught illegally in the Capitol filming skits. Yet, a 69-year-old cancer patient is serving two months in prison for simply being present in the Capitol after the cops had opened the doors for people to enter.

And no, it’s not because our government suddenly has a Singapore-like affinity for order. Less than 10% of those arrested during the endless riots in Portland wound up being prosecuted. The violence was unprecedented. Yet, at the same time, prosecutors are seeking a 15-year sentence for Guy Wesley Reffitt, who behaved badly on Jan. 6 but never entered the Capitol building and is being charged with the vaguely defined “obstruction of an official proceeding,” a statute that is being used as a de facto terrorism charge. At this rate, had Reffitt torched a cop car at Capitol Hill, they’d be seeking the death penalty. And no, one’s immigration status would never have gotten in the way of a tougher sentence for a J6er.

Horowitz: BLM's legacy a year later: Terror on America's streets,"This week, the Biden White House hosted the family of George Floyd to mark the one-year anniversary of his death in police custody. His brother, Philonise, expressed hope that things are ""slowly"" moving in the right direction and that they are ""making progress"" in their war on cops. However, what is not going in the right direction is justice for victims of crime thanks to the agenda spawned by their movement.



Thanks to the pandemic and less social mobility, crime has been decreasing in most countries. That is with the exception of the United States. In 2020, the U.S. was hit with another pandemic. BLM's assault on law-and-order, in conjunction with the assault on incarceration of criminals, has led to an explosion of violence. It's not just the 108% increase in homicides in Minneapolis, the original epicenter of the BLM rioting. It's in nearly every major city across the country.

Perhaps gunshots ringing out during an ABC report at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis best exemplifies the evil fruits of the labor of BLM. In all the cities with strict gun control laws, shootings have become so rampant, and they have taken the lives of more black people than any crime wave in a generation.

Here are some of the latest crime tidbits from New York City, once the face of the generation-long decline in crime in America, as reported by the New York Post.

Comparing the week ending May 23 to the same week in 2020 (right before the BLM/Floyd effect), gun arrests dropped 24%. Not surprisingly, shootings skyrocketed by 72%. The number of gunshot victims rose by 92.6%.

In terms of the major crime categories, robberies were up 44.4%, felony assaults rose 35.3%, murder was up 28.6% grand larcenies were up 41.8%, and the number of stolen vehicles skyrocketed 49%.

Nearly every day, we hear about heinous crimes committed on NYC's subways, with the number of crimes in the transit system up 162% relative to the final week before the BLM riots last year.

One NYPD officer, quoted anonymously by the Post, hit the nail on the head when he noted that ""They could hire 10,000 cops, but it won't matter unless the politicians change the laws and keep criminals in jail."" It's not just about hampering and even defunding the police. It's that violent criminals and repeat offenders are able to violate their parole with impunity. So few people get locked up anymore.

The hole in our incarceration is even more gaping than the hole in policing. This is why, despite the temporary addition of 250 police patrols to monitor the subway violence, crime continues to skyrocket. What good are the cops if the criminals just get let out of jail indefinitely for years pending a trial that rarely results in meaningful prison time, if any time at all?

The rise in violent and property crimes is harming all citizens, but ironically, the most violent crimes are all being incurred by black victims. In Atlanta, another city with skyrocketing crimes, so far this year, a staggering 291 of the 311 shootings victims were black, while just 7 were white. How come nobody ever discusses the ""equity"" issue when it comes to black homicide victims and the need to get tougher, not weaker, on crime in order to actually protect black lives?



The media can no longer deny the skyrocketing crime, so they seek to deflect blame onto the pandemic. But as Nicole Gelinas observes, the crime rates in most other countries actually dropped because of the pandemic, as one would expect. For example, the murder rate dropped 16% last year in London, 14% in Italy, and 2% in France – all hard hit by the virus and the ensuing lockdown policies. Japan saw its lowest murder rate since World War II and even in cartel-ridden Mexico, the homicide rate held steady.

So, what suddenly changed in the United States?

Plummeting incarceration rates, the war on the cops, mass rioting, and the loss of a criminal justice deterrent that took a generation to build. To the extent that COVID-19 had anything to do with the rise in crime, it is the result of the gratuitous prison releases that were done under the false pretense of stopping the spread of COVID-19 in jail.

Recently, Ja'Ron Smith, one of Jared Kushner's pro-criminal henchmen who convinced Trump to make a U-turn on crime policy, wrote an op-ed calling for those people to be given permanent clemency.

How about focusing on victims of crime for once? Most importantly, such a focus would result in protecting all innocent lives, but as the crime data show, it would help black victims of crime more than anyone else. If BLM set out to kill more black people from crime, I'm not sure they could have done a better job.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-blms-legacy-a-year-later-terror-on-americas-streets,2021-05-26
Horowitz: Chicago releases the most violent offenders to commit the exact same crimes,"What happens when you let career violent criminals out on little or no bail with no fear of punishment for violating their terms of release? In a dystopian hell like Chicago, that means an individual released after being charged with punching a woman in the face and kicking a cop in the groin will be rearrested for … punching a woman in the face and kicking a cop in the groin. Oh, and another sex offender released on charges of molesting multiple women will be rearrested for … molesting another woman!



At a time when the FBI and DHS are spying on political opponents with no criminal records as if they are violent criminals, known violent criminals are released to repeat the worst crimes again. Let’s meet James Killingsworth, a career criminal who was arrested right before Christmas 2020 for stealing a woman’s phone on a Chicago street and then kicking the arresting cop in the groin. The prosecution later linked him to a robbery a few days earlier in which he punched a woman in the face in broad daylight and stole her phone. One would think that aggravated battery of a peace officer, theft, attempted robbery, and aggravated battery in a public place would put him away for a while, but when he reported to prison on October 19, 2022, he was released on the same day because of good time credits and time served.

Fast-forward just six days later, and Killingsworth was arrested on October 25 for punching a woman at a transit station and then kicking the arresting officer in the groin, according to CWB Chicago. De ja vu! This case would be one for the books even if the system finally locked him up, but it gets worse. The Illinois Department of Corrections refused to charge him with a parole violation, and the judge released him on just $12,000 bail!

Contrast this with military veterans with no criminal records who are still serving two years pretrial without any chance for bail for charges that don’t even allege touching a police officer or punching someone in the face.

What about sexual assault? Surely the system would give those perps the “January 6 treatment,” right? Wrong! Meet David Buckner, the terror of Chicago transit, courtesy of CWB Chicago reporting:

In June, a prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office refused to file felony charges against Buckner after two women accused him of licking, kissing, squeezing, and groping them on the Magnificent Mile. With felony charges denied, Chicago police had to charge Buckner with misdemeanor battery. He was released from jail a few days later to await trial.



On October 9, while he was still on bail for the June allegations, two more women accused Buckner of touching them inappropriately at the Roosevelt CTA station. He walked out of the local Chicago police station a few hours later on his own recognizance, charged only with misdemeanor battery again. Records that would show if prosecutors rejected felony charges for the new allegations have not been posted in public records.



Then, just before 2 p.m. Wednesday, while still on bail for the June and October cases, he allegedly assaulted an 18-year-old woman on the Loyola campus, not far from the Red Line station.



He grabbed the woman’s body and her left butt cheek, prosecutor Jeff Allen said. Once again, Buckner is only charged with a misdemeanor.



Despite the multiple bail violations and arrests for serious crimes, Judge Kelly McCarthy ordered Buckner to pay just a $5,000 deposit toward bail in the Loyola case and $3,000 in the June case until Buckner sees the judge overseeing that matter on Monday. It turns out that in 2017, he was accused by a list of women for grotesque sexual offenses in the subways. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that prosecutors said Buckner admitted to “probably” molesting 75 women. Yet a week before Thanksgiving of last year, when he was charged for violating the terms of the sex offender registry, he was released on his own recognizance because of an insanity plea.

This is the two-tiered justice we have in America. This is why the streets are full of violent criminals who will commit endless violent crimes for years to come. Think about all the violent criminal who used to be locked up during the “tough on crime” era who are now out. Those people need to be behind bars.

This chart from the New York Times shows the dangers on the streets in one chart:

The Left is celebrating the fact that the black incarceration rate has been nearly cut in half over the past generation and are calling for even more prison releases. However, when you measure the body count of thousands of excess black homicide victims over the past few years, you realize that this is nothing to celebrate. The reality is that among the black population, unfortunately, are a disproportionate share of violent criminals, usually tied to gangs. They are not in prison at higher numbers because of low-level crimes or drug crimes, but for violent crimes. According to the FBI’s crime data explorer, roughly 60% of the homicide offenders in 2021 whose race was known were black.

Any effort to go soft on prison sentences of career criminals out of concern for black prison rates – a sentiment too many Republicans have bought into over the past decade – will necessarily result in harming black victims of crime more than anyone else. Almost 60% of the homicide victims in 2021 were also black.

It’s no longer enough for Republicans to run ads complaining about crime and promising to “fund the police.” They need to promise mandatory minimums for violent and repeat offenders, toughening penalties for bail, parole, and probation violations, targeting gangs, and a legitimate three-strikes-and-you’re-out law.



While one can debate the degree of punishment to mete out to lower-level criminals, the street crimes we are witnessing in America’s major cities are being committed by those whom both parties used to deem a threat and support taking off the streets. Yet now we live in a world where Democrat Governors like Kathy Hochul in New York don’t understand why it’s so important to lock these people up . Hopefully, Republicans have finally learned their lesson and will pursue criminal justice reform in the exact opposite way they did this past decade and save their desire for grace and leniency for those targeted for political crimes.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-chicago-releases-the-most-violent-offenders-to-commit-the-exact-same-crimes,2022-11-02
Horowitz: Conservatives must stop conserving a military that no longer exists,"Being pro-military was the hallmark of a Reagan conservative that informed the minds of the past two generations of conservative policy. However, conserving and even growing a military that is now irrevocably woke – a military in which you must carry a vaccine card and mask on base but can’t carry a weapon; a military where Christianity is scorned and transgenderism is embraced – is not conservative at all. Rather than Republicans throwing more money at a woke and broken Pentagon and military-industrial complex, the time has come to make systemic reforms to the purpose of the military. Then we can discuss the dollars and cents.

Our military today resembles nothing from its Gulf War-era culture. It is unhospitable to Christians and conservatives and imbued with racism, transgendersim, and coed social engineering, and nearly every official above the rank of lieutenant colonel is to the left of a Hollywood actress. Moreover, for an entire generation, the mission of our military has been muddled and primarily focused on social change, refereeing sectarian civil wars, and nation-building.

More recently, there are growing concerns that the NSA is spying on Americans, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is engaged in unbridled biomedical security experimentation and hyper-obsession with vaccines, and the medical-industrial complex is inextricably tied into the transhumanist endeavors promoted by Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum. We have all taken pride in our military for most of our lifetimes, but what happens when the most powerful and expensive apparatus of your government is captured by the left? Well, now, sadly, it has become the greatest menace to our liberties. Thus, absent systemic reforms, any desire to throw endless, unaccountable spending increases at the Pentagon brass will create a bigger threat to what the Biden administration calls “domestic terrorists,” aka we the people, than to our true foreign enemies like China.

Anyone who considers himself both a conservative and a defense hawk should not be offended by this grim assessment of the military. In fact, a true defense hawk who cares about the troops should be leading the charge with intrepid fortitude to reform our military rather than empowering a woke, broken, and dangerously ideological military brass.

Yet the defense “hawks” who are truly doves, led by incoming House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, believe that anyone who will stop the gravy train and ask questions about the military is somehow an enemy of the state. This is why he was angrier about the speaker coup than even the other moderate Republicans and appeared to lunge at Rep. Matt Gaetz on the House floor last Friday night. The establishment “hawks” are now concerned that a desire to focus on a balanced budget will spill over to their fiefdom.

Defense spending was already boosted by 10% last year, now topping $858 billion, again funding foreign escapades, biomedical tyranny, surveillance of Americans, and woke policies. The same way those who oppose a blank check without policy concessions are tagged as opposing the troops, I can suggest those who support the status quo hate the troops and hate Americans because they are empowering the current military brass, whom we should all agree are a threat to our liberties and certainly don’t scare our enemies.

What ultimately needs to happen is that before we debate spending levels in appropriations bills, we must finally have a real debate on the National Defense Authorization Act. The NDAA was designed to first lay out the priorities and vision of national defense, the role the military must play in that vision, and the scope of procurements we will need in the near term. Where do we need bases, and where are they outdated? Where do we need a military presence? Where do we need to fund allies, and are they indeed allies who serve our interests?



Then, based on those priorities, we would write an appropriations bill to fund the military. But in recent years, the NDAA has been primarily about spending levels without regard for formulating a strategic vision. This year, the NDAA must audit every theater in which our military is engaged and determine whether there is a vital national security interest there. In general, our entire defense deterrent needs to be reoriented away from the theaters we’ve been in over the past generation or two and focused like a laser beam on China.

So yes, we might need spending increases in some areas of the military hardware we all support, but there are undoubtedly foreign entanglement expenditures we can and must cut. We must also reassess the structure of the military as well. For example, as Rep. Jim Jordan recently observed, “Focus our military spending on the soldiers and not having so many generals — the ratio of general officers to enlisted individuals now is so out of whack.”

But most importantly, we must clean up the military culture itself. Here are some policies that the Armed Services Committee should focus on beginning this week rather than simply debating top-line spending levels:

Ban the Pentagon from ever instituting a mask mandate.

Force reinstatement and back pay for those terminated under the vaccine mandate.

Expand parameters of religious and medical exemptions for other vaccines and permanently ban mRNA shots in the military.

End the weaponization of the military medical system forcing behavioral evaluations on service members as forms of retaliation for whistleblowing, per the Seth Ritter story at Fort Benning. The entire Defense Health Agency needs to be overhauled to focus on military readiness rather than the biomedical Karen agenda.

Allow our own soldiers to carry weapons on U.S. bases.

End the Saudi training programs on U.S. military bases. After one such trainee killed three Americans in a terror attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019, the Trump administration failed to terminate the program.

Prohibit all transgender or critical race theory training and programs.

Cancel all green energy mandates on military hardware and vitiate any military mission “combatting” the climate. For example, the Biden administration is requiring that 60,000 vehicles be retrofitted with $50,000 battery packs (likely made in China).

Terminate all NSA programs spying on Americans.

A full audit of the mission and activities of DARPA and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, particularly as it relates to their work on gain-of-function pathogens and vaccines in biolabs across the world.

Terminate all social engineering programs lowering standards to place women in combat.

Craft a religious liberty bill of rights ensuring that no soldier is forced to violate his religious conscience through his tour of duty in the military.

Just how broken is our military? Despite Congress halting the COVID jab mandate on the military, the Pentagon is still enforcing it on the National Guard. It demonstrates a level of malfeasance and unaccountability that stems from the GOP’s categorical affinity for all things Department of Defense. We must not forget that it is perhaps the department whose left-wing takeover is probably more consequential to our life and liberty than any other department. Commensurate with how important we regard its role is how alarmed we should be by its subversion.

Why are the so-called defense hawks not concerned about the aforementioned issues within the military?

Is this really about being a hawk for our soldiers, our national security, and the values the military is there to defend — or about being a hawk for Lockheed Martin?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-conservatives-must-stop-conserving-a-military-that-no-longer-exists,2023-01-10
Horowitz: Why is Deborah Birx pushing lockdown on behalf of this administration?,"One thing is certain if Joe Biden wins the election: There will be intractable pressure put on states to impose lockdown policies on the citizenry. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris keep promising to pressure the states to maintain strict mask mandates indefinitely. But unfortunately, those policies are already being promoted under this administration by Dr. Deborah Birx. The vexing question of the day is how — and why — she continues to pressure governors to impose failed policies that the president himself has already rejected.

Every week, White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx picks a new state to terrorize with her panic pornography. While Dr. Fauci is the more notorious face of lockdown panic policies in the media, Birx is traveling the country demanding that states follow Joe Biden's policies.

On Saturday, Birx visited local health officials in Rochester, Minnesota, to warn them of rising cases. Minnesota has a liberal governor who has promoted restrictions and mask-wearing as strongly as anywhere in the country, yet the fact is lost on Birx that her own policies have failed to stop the spread. She claimed that the early cold weather drove people indoors and is causing the virus to spread in recent weeks. Well, given that Minnesota has a mask mandate, why should that matter? Ooops, I forgot, masks actually don't work.

""We can see the increase in cases coming and continuing unrelentingly unless together as a community of individuals we do things we know will stop the spread of this virus,"" said Birx.

So, what exactly are the things ""we know"" will stop the spread? What has ever worked anywhere in the world to stop the natural progression of a respiratory virus that has taken over the flu for this year?

In comes Birx with the maniacal idea of mass testing for asymptomatic individuals. ""What we're asking people is to empower their communities by coming forward even when you don't have symptoms to get tested,"" she said.

Earlier this month, she said in Rhode Island that ""asymptomatic, silent spread in the community"" is driving the pandemic (at the 4:30 mark).

First, this is not a new idea. We are testing around 1 million people a day, nearly as many as we test for the flu in an entire flu season. It's not stopping the spread. Isn't it time to take ownership for the results?

Moreover, the president just said that we need to stop using ""cases"" that are overwhelmingly mild (and frequently asymptomatic) as pretext to shut down our lives. Why is she opposing the president's position? There is no fourth branch of government headed by Birx.

Birx, just like Biden, is trying to avoid using the word lockdown, but the idea that we are going to test every person in this country and have super-sensitive tests — rather than symptoms and hospitalizations — driving our policies is a recipe for shutting down every aspect of life. When asymptomatic individuals are included, this virus will likely target a large share of the 330 million people in the country. Remember, there is a lot of academic literature suggesting that a large chunk of the country gets the flu asymptomatically every year, possibly accounting for as many as 50% of those infected. There is nothing new about this virus. Were we to randomly test everyone for the flu every day and propose lockdowns in response, we would never survive as a civilization.



The reality is that despite all the hype and fear surrounding asymptomatic spread, every study that has actually examined transmission has failed to discover widespread asymptomatic transmission that could account for a meaningful percentage of community spread. A contact tracing study of 3,410 close contacts of 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases in a Chinese province near Wuhan during the peak months of the virus found that transmissibility seems to increase commensurately with the severity of symptoms presented by the infected individual. Of the 127 secondary infections that were traced to the original 3,410 cases, just eight were from individuals confirmed as asymptomatic.

The World Health Organization said in May that asymptomatic spread was ""very rare."" Then, like any time a major scientific figure reveals the truth, the WHO suddenly recanted that position when the media raised a howl.

A U.S.-based study from the University of Florida, Gainesville, Department of Biostatistics, observed similar low rates of transmission among the asymptomatic. Researchers found symptomatic individuals transmitted the virus at rates 28 times higher than asymptomatic individuals. Another Chinese study from May found very weak transmission capability among asymptomatic infections.

Early on, when he was still motivated more by science than politics, Dr. Fauci said emphatically, ""Even if there is some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks. He added that ""the driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person.""

According to Birx, not only would combating coronavirus necessitate endless lockdowns, but we'd never be able to function even after COVID-19 is eradicated. Given that this virus, especially in recent months, has a fatality rate close to that of the flu, if this is the new threshold for civilization lockdown and government control, then we'd have to do the same for the flu. Taking her position to its logical conclusion, given the pervasiveness of asymptomatic flu, you could be killing elderly people every single year and not even realizing it. And unlike with COVID-19, kids are actually strong vectors for the spread of the flu. Schools would be closed all year and kids perpetually kept away from adults unless they test every day during flu season.

The perplexing question is why is Dr. Birx is still able to tour the country as a Trump administration official and propagate panic that directly conflicts with the espoused views of her boss.

The tragic reality is that focusing on universal lockdowns and testing of the healthy hasn't helped save a single life, even as it has destroyed millions of lives from collateral damage. Nobody contextualized this insanity better than the left-leaning Daily Beast. While noting Italy's strong second wave of cases, the outlet observed that ""the country has done everything experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have been advising."" These ideas include the following: ""Face masks in public places have been compulsory for months, social distancing is strongly enforced, nightclubs have never reopened, and sporting arenas are at less than a third of capacity. Children who are back at school are regularly tested and strictly social-distanced, and yet, the second wave seems completely unstoppable.""



In other words, after destroying a generation's mental and emotional health, they have nothing to show for it but a spreading virus. Yet shockingly, Dr. Birx said in August, ""I wish that when we went into lockdown, we looked like Italy."" She extolled Italy's totalitarian policies of ensuring that ""people weren't allowed out of their houses.""

Sadly, while our lockdown wasn't as bad as Italy's, it still needlessly prolonged the epidemic and killed a great many people.

Indeed, the results of Fauci in this country are terrible. It's enough that we have to endure his ego because of his past reputation, but do we really need to be ruled by this no-name attention seeker who sits on the board of Bill Gates' Global Fund?



The president has been moving in a better direction ever since he brought on Dr. Scott Atlas. But if he wins a second term, he must speak consistently with one voice. Unless there is a policy shake-up, Birx will continue to promote Biden's worldview even after he is defeated.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-deborah-birx-pushing-lockdown,2020-10-26
"Horowitz: DHS coming dangerously close to criminalizing First Amendment, political beliefs","The State Department, along with over a dozen other Western governments, posted a joint statement expressing concerns about freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Perhaps these governments, beginning with our own, need to look in the mirror and recognize that their assault on basic human rights, including free speech, free association, and political and religious beliefs, is now on par with the behavior of the Chinese communists.

“The undersigned members of the Media Freedom Coalition express their deep concern at the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese authorities’ attacks on freedom of the press and their suppression of independent local media in Hong Kong,” began the statement, which was signed by countries like Australia that are now engaging in human rights violations under the color of COVID.

This is quite a rich statement proclaimed in the same week that the White House called on Spotify to censor Joe Rogan for having long-form engaging discussions with brilliant scientists like Drs. Robert Malone and Peter McCullough. As early as July, the White House called on Facebook to censor any information on the vaccine that is not in line with the views of the regime. The top doctors and scientists treating COVID have essentially been removed from nearly every media platform. How exactly is this different from China?

Well, you might suggest that at least they won’t hunt you down and treat you like a criminal for holding these views, as they might do in a country like China. However, can you really count on that, given what our government is already saying?

On Monday, the DHS posted its latest National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin. The number one terrorism threat, in the eyes of our government, is ordinary people who hold different views on COVID policies and election security. Under “Key factors contributing to the current heightened threat environment,” the very first factor listed is “The proliferation of false or misleading narratives, which sow discord or undermine public trust in U.S. government institutions.”

You might think this is referring to those who verbally and sometimes physically assault people for not covering their faces in a store like women in Afghanistan. Or perhaps denying kidney transplants to people for not getting a Pfizer product. But no, they mean people like you and me. “For example, there is widespread online proliferation of false or misleading narratives regarding unsubstantiated widespread election fraud and COVID-19,” states the bulletin. “Grievances associated with these themes inspired violent extremist attacks during 2021.”

Can you list examples of violent extremist attacks from people who oppose COVID fascism?

This factor was listed ahead of the concern of foreign Islamic terrorism or any mention of the Colleyville synagogue hostage-taker. Our own government, for the first time in history, is seeking to criminalize political opposition and treat it on the same level as al Qaeda. Then again, the DHS bulletin made no mention of al Qaeda or the Chinese Communist Party.

The witch hunt against freedom of speech is so strong that even members of Congress are not immune to it. Earlier this week, the Federalist reported that the Capitol Hill Police inspector general is launching a probe into an allegation by one congressman that his office was illegally surveilled by police. According to Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), Capitol Hill police stopped by his office in November and took a photo of legislative plans detailed on his whiteboard. The officers came back a few days later in plain clothes and questioned a staffer about a whiteboard that contained “suspicious writings mentioning body armor.” Specifically, Nehls was planning to introduce legislation banning the sale of faulty Chinese body armor, which was obvious by the text of his writing. Again, is this another case of projection, where the true Chinese-style authoritarians are accusing their opponents of a lack of patriotism?

On Tuesday, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) accused the Justice Department of spying on members of Congress as well. In a statement posted on Twitter, Gohmert contends that constituent mail was opened and stamped with “DOJ mailroom” and labeled “X-rayed,” seemingly indicating that the Justice Department first looked through his mail. This would violate the principle of separation of powers.

All this news comes amid the backdrop of a draft recommendation published by the House of Representatives inspector general calling on the sergeant at arms’ office to engage in internal “behavioral monitoring” to detect internal security threats. ""The slim document suggested that the House Sergeant at Arms’ office — which leads security for the chamber — start a comprehensive insider threat program, which it currently lacks,"" reports Politico.

Taken together, it’s beginning to look a lot like a despotic third world country. They used COVID to criminalize our breathing and bodies; they used Jan. 6 to criminalize political beliefs. Now they are using any opposition to their policies as pretext to shred the First Amendment rights of citizens and separation of powers of political opponents.

Republican governors in red states would be wise to work with state and local law enforcement and establish a principle of interposition against the looming federal assault on political opponents. They must make their states sanctuaries for the First Amendment by promising to arrest any federal official who comes to the state seeking to harass, question, or apprehend an individual who has broken no law other than espousing views unpopular with the regime.



We have all witnessed the remarkable transformation of Western democracies that have reverted to pre-enlightenment governing values in a matter of a few years. The virus might have begun in China, but it has turned Western governments into China. If we don’t first focus on the authoritarianism in our own back yard, we won’t have a refuge from Chinese tyranny, for our own government is nothing but a client state of the Chinese Communist Party. And clearly, China have taught our government well.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-dhs-coming-dangerously-close-to-criminalizing-first-amendment-political-beliefs,2022-02-09
Horowitz: How is this DOJ witch hunt against congressional conservatives not unconstitutional?,"The seizure of Rep. Scott Perry’s personal cell phone by the FBI is likely unconstitutional. Now that I just gave a constitutional opinion contrary to the view of the government, does that make me a criminal, and will they come to arrest me? Welcome to the Fourth Reich.



On Tuesday, Rep. Perry announced that three FBI agents had seized his cell phone. While information concerning their warrant is unknown at this point, the media is speculating that it has to do with accusations of the January 6 Committee that Perry was involved in the so-called conspiracy to overturn the election results and advocate for an alternate slate of electors from Pennsylvania.

But where is the commission of a crime? The question of whether state legislators or governors are the final say in selecting state electors or whether the vice president is just a ceremonial proceeding officer over the congressional counting of those electors or whether he has the final say is a political/constitutional question. It’s not a criminal act to advocate on behalf of one side, even if another individual believes those are reprehensible views to hold.

The fact that violence resulted from a protest of one side of this debate doesn’t implicate the members of Congress who took the losing side of the argument. It’s like saying the Democrat members of Congress who not only advocated for de-incarceration and defunding of the police, but downright encouraged violent protests, can be criminally charged for the deaths, injuries, and billions in damage caused by BLM and Antifa. Can a Republican president have his DOJ seize the phones of the members who marched at BLM riots where real violent criminal acts were committed?

Now the opposition party in the executive branch has the cell phone of the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, who undoubtedly kept a lot of political strategy and communication on that phone. This is exactly what our Founders sought to protect in the Speech and Debate Clause of Art. I, § 6, which provides that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, they [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place.""

For the same reason, in that same section, the Constitution states, “No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States.” Just like the Founders didn’t want collaboration between the legislative and executive branches, they didn’t want the executive branch to be able to prosecute the legislators for speaking their minds. No collaboration with or conspiring against the separation of powers. Yes, that would necessarily foreclose prosecution of sleazy politics (not stand-alone criminal activity), but the definition of sleazy and even immoral politics is in the eye of the beholder, or shall we say the political opponent.

In 1964, Maryland Democrat Rep. Thomas Francis Johnson was convicted in federal court on seven counts of violating the federal conflict-of-interest statute (18 U.S.C. 281) and on one count of conspiring to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. 371). The main case against him brought by the Justice Department was an accusation that he took money from banking interests in exchange for delivering a favorable speech on the floor of the House. However, the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court categorically overturned those convictions based on a violation of the Speech and Debate Clause.

In U.S. v. Johnson (1966), the Supreme Court concluded, “However reprehensible such conduct may be, we believe the Speech or Debate Clause extends at least so far as to prevent it from being made the basis of a criminal charge against a member of Congress of conspiracy to defraud the United States by impeding the due discharge of government functions.” In other words, as much as we would like to root out political corruption through criminal charges against this practice, the Founders understood that the collateral damage of affording the executive branch powers to criminalize legislative activity, political opinions, and speeches would be too chilling for a free republic.



Which is why they noted that Johnson’s speech was “precisely what the Speech or Debate Clause generally forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry.” The court made clear that the Clause must be “read broadly to effectuate its purposes,” ultimately concluding that the Clause forecloses prosecution based on evidence relying upon “the legislative acts” of a legislator or “his motives for performing them.”

Keep in mind that Perry is the member of Congress who last year filed articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland, the ultimate boss of the FBI, who signed the warrant for the Trump raid. This is exactly the sort of conflict of interest in law enforcement that our Founders wanted to avoid. They particularly feared the collusion between the law enforcement officials of the executive branch and the magistrates, a fear that we are witnessing in real life with magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, a former Jeffrey Epstein lawyer who hated Trump and approved the warrant against Trump. The Supreme Court explains this exact problem in the 1966 Johnson case as follows:

It was not only fear of the executive that caused concern in Parliament, but of the judiciary as well, for the judges were often lackeys of the Stuart monarchs, levying punishment more ""to the wishes of the crown than to the gravity of the offence."" There is little doubt that the instigation of criminal charges against critical or disfavored legislators by the executive in a judicial forum was the chief fear prompting the long struggle for parliamentary privilege in England and, in the context of the American system of separation of powers, is the predominate thrust of the Speech or Debate Clause. In scrutinizing this criminal prosecution, then, we look particularly to the prophylactic purposes of the clause.

Obviously, if someone commits fraud or another criminal act as a member of Congress, he can be prosecuted. If a member of Congress acted violently on January 6, he can be prosecuted. But legislators can’t be prosecuted for offering legal, constitutional, and political opinions or advice for a president of their party to fire people who are fully within his right to fire.

Most people find politics reprehensible and even, in a colloquial way, downright criminal. But what’s worse is to allow one side of politics to criminalize the other side’s politics. Historically, it is the Left that has spawned exponentially more political violence, including in many state capitals, during debates over a political matters, and they didn’t need help from FBI agents provocateur to actually make the violence go kinetic. Are we now to say that any Democrat who took the political side of the protesters is completely subject to questioning, seizure, subpoena, and potential arrest based on the political statements they made in the lead-up to the vote or legislative proceedings?

This is all occurring in the shadow of two years of government officials treating political opponents and their political views as domestic terrorism on par with Islamic jihad. This didn’t begin with Trump. They have been doing this to ordinary Americans who can’t afford high-priced lawyers. Hopefully, the GOP politicians, now seeing they are not immune from the suspension of due process and legal norms, will finally do what it takes to neutralize the tyranny rather than fundraise off it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-doj-wtich-hunt-conservatives,2022-08-12
Horowitz: FBI comes dangerously close to criminalizing free speech by indicting man for tweeting election memes,"We have all shared this unsettling premonition that the attack on free speech is not just coming from Big Tech with the threat of censorship, but from the government backed by criminal prosecution. We are watching the government arrest hundreds of people not just for violence but for trespassing and negligible crimes at the Capitol when many of them were let into the building by the police. We are seeing the billboards and technology being used to hunt people down, as the most violent Antifa rioters are never arrested. No, this crackdown is not being driven by a concern for security and a sense of justice.

Well, now it's confirmed that the government itself is rapidly headed toward criminalizing the speech of Trump supporters. The government is treating Antifa's violence like speech and our speech like violence. What starts with bad behavior by Trump supporters (while ignoring what the other side does) will not end there.

Yesterday, a bizarre headline from the Justice Department's Office of Public affairs caught my attention and raised the ire of many conservatives. ""Social Media Influencer Charged with Election Interference Stemming from Voter Disinformation Campaign,"" read the headline of a press release from the DOJ's Eastern District of New York. That seemed odd to me because I've never seen such a vague and intangible charge after years of sifting through daily press releases from U.S. attorneys about espionage, trade theft, and gang activity. As I read further, my worst suspicions were confirmed.

""A Florida man was arrested this morning on charges of conspiring with others in advance of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election to use various social media platforms to disseminate misinformation designed to deprive individuals of their constitutional right to vote.""

Wow, that sounds interesting. So the DOJ is finally going after election fraud? Did this guy throw out ballots or engage in mail-in fraud like endless witnesses said in sworn affidavits and in testimony before legislatures? No, the DOJ is not interested in tangible fraud that involves an action; in fact, it is investigating any DOJ official who might have sought to investigate such fraud. It only prosecutes speech.

Douglass Mackey, aka Ricky Vaughn, 31, of West Palm Beach was taken into custody and charged with having ""exploited a social media platform to infringe one the of most basic and sacred rights guaranteed by the Constitution: the right to vote,"" according to Nicholas L. McQuaid, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.



Again, I was confused how someone can use their own speech to infringe upon the right of a voter and actually succeed in stealing a vote.

After several paragraphs of DOJ officials bloviating about constitutional rights to vote, they finally announced his crime.

As alleged in the complaint, between September 2016 and November 2016, in the lead up to the Nov. 8, 2016, U.S. Presidential Election, Mackey conspired with others to use social media platforms, including Twitter, to disseminate fraudulent messages designed to encourage supporters of one of the presidential candidates (the ""Candidate"") to ""vote"" via text message or social media, a legally invalid method of voting.

Boy, is that a mouthful! This standard would basically rope in half the country. The other half of the country always believes everything the other side is putting out is false information that is extremely dangerous. We'd all be in jail.

How exactly did the person engage in fraud?

For example, on Nov. 1, 2016, Mackey allegedly tweeted an image that featured an African American woman standing in front of an ""African Americans for [the Candidate]"" sign. The image included the following text: ""Avoid the Line. Vote from Home. Text '[Candidate's first name]' to 59925[.] Vote for [the Candidate] and be a part of history."" The fine print at the bottom of the image stated: ""Must be 18 or older to vote. One vote per person. Must be a legal citizen of the United States. Voting by text not available in Guam, Puerto Rico, Alaska or Hawaii. Paid for by [Candidate] for President 2016.""



The tweet included the typed hashtags ""#Go [Candidate]"" and another slogan frequently used by the Candidate. On or about and before Election Day 2016, at least 4,900 unique telephone numbers texted ""[Candidate's first name]"" or some derivative to the 59925 text number, which was used in multiple deceptive campaign images tweeted by the defendant and his co-conspirators.



Folks, this is very scary. No, not the alleged crime, but that the feds are going after such behavior while ignoring sworn allegations of mass fraud. While what is alleged appears to be mean and spiteful, at the end of the day, there is no way to actually steal a vote with this subterfuge. Not unless someone thought that, based on a random internet tweet, they could vote via text, and without verifying anything thereafter, would have sent their text and then stayed home. By this standard, every governor who violated election law and actually facilitated the casting of ballots not pursuant to law should be in jail.

There are some really distasteful ways people use their freedom of speech – sometimes in a serious way or sometimes in a joking way – but the First Amendment was not written to protect benign speech. To arrest only one side of the divide for social media memes at a time when officials are letting cities burn is very concerning. And it opens a very slippery slope for the government to prosecute people for saying anything that the government believes is harmful.

Is it that hard to envision an FBI agent knocking on your door and saying, ""You just wrote information telling people masks don't work and to stop wearing them. You are engaging in fraud and are an accessory to murder!""



If you don't believe me that this could happen, take a look at yesterday's ""National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin,"" published by the Department of Homeland Security. The bulletin warns about threats from ""Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs) targeted individuals with opposing views engaged in First Amendment-protected, non-violent protest activity,"" which include those ""motivated by a range of issues, including anger over COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results …""

Thus, they now consider opposing views and First Amendment-protected speech highlighting governmental actions taken against other rights under the guise of COVID as a national security threat on par with ISIS or Hezbollah.

""Threats of violence against critical infrastructure, including the electric, telecommunications and healthcare sectors, increased in 2020 with violent extremists citing misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 for their actions,"" warns the bulletin. ""DHS, as well as other Federal agencies and law enforcement partners will continue to take precautions to protect people and infrastructure across the United States.""

Mind you, as they treat our speech as terrorism, they fail to mention a word about Antifa seeking to overthrow the government and attacking government buildings, even Democrat Party offices.

Some might automatically object to this concern by saying that the individual in question used the speech to attempt to defraud people with a specific scheme. Thus, this would be speech that is buttressed by an action; namely, setting up a fraudulent voting number. Yes, tyranny will always begin with the veneer of justice and under the color of law. I am certainly not defending someone for doing this if he indeed is guilty of it. But what does it tell you that this is the one voter fraud indictment the DOJ will make while refusing to even look into any of the evidence of pro-Biden fraud presented in the state legislatures? What does it say that Antifa can destroy our streets every night and attack ICE buildings, yet the FBI is focused on Trump supporters?

In this case, the DOJ is not even charging the man with voter fraud, because indeed his alleged actions don't fit the definition of any of those statutes. Instead, they bizarrely chose to focus on the fact that he worked with other people and therefore might have violated the generic ""conspiracy against rights,"" under 18 U.S. Code § 241. That title makes it a federal crime for ""two or more persons"" to ""conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution …""



By that definition, every single governor and mayor should be arrested for conspiring to violate life, liberty, and property under lockdown policies. Voting is very important, but it is ultimately the result of law and can be taken away under some circumstances, unlike property rights and certainly freedom of speech.

The Department of Justice might have a legal case here from an extremely vague statute (to the extent it's constitutional), but the asymmetry in its prosecutorial discretion is bordering on a sadistic two-tiered justice system. If this were Singapore and the government evenly and scrupulously prosecuted every minor offense to the letter of the law, I'd be less concerned about this. It would be one thing if the FBI had evidence of a number of people who used this text hotline and declined to actually vote, believing they had already voted. But there was no evidence of such a thing in the indictment, which makes it peculiar that they are focusing on this, even if they can find a crime to charge him with. This indictment, mixed with the other martial-law-like actions and the indefinite deployment of troops, is not coming from a good place and is headed to a good destination.

A friend of mine from Michigan, Garrett Soldano, got a call from the FBI last week because someone told them he is ""an extremist."" If you are reading this and thinking you can still rigorously fight for conservative policies and not have to worry about the ""law"" coming after you as long as you act in accordance with the law, then you need to wake up before it's too late. And don't expect the ""paragons of free speech"" at the ACLU to be there for you in your time of need.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-fbi-comes-dangerously-close-to-criminalizing-free-speech-by-indicting-man-for-tweeting-election-memes,2021-01-28
Horowitz: Why aren’t there more federal agents like Brandon Garcia?,"Whether it’s the FBI, ATF, or IRS, do you believe an increase in budget and manpower will be used to go after truly violent and dangerous criminals or after political dissidents? Well, after reading the six-page resignation letter of Brandon M. Garcia, a career Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives special agent, there should be no doubt as to the motivation in hiring 87,000 new IRS agents and no doubt about what needs to be done to stop it. The bigger question is, if most of these agents are indeed patriots, as Garcia suggest, where the hell are they?

“I have just reached the point where I cannot, in good faith, support the direction this government is taking our country; specifically, the direction it is taking law enforcement,” began Garcia’s letter, which was provided to AmmoLand News. Garcia goes on to describe the phenomenon of anarcho-tyranny, in which law enforcement agencies are standing down in confronting the greatest threats to society while at the same time targeting political enemies of the Biden regime.



“We can probably agree that law abiding citizens do not commit gun crime. I think that we can probably also agree that the majority of gun owners tend to be more conservative than liberal. So essentially, gun control will only affect law abiding, conservative citizens. Therefore, the Government is only punishing the conservative population. Similarly, in the summer of 2020, rioters were allowed to burn cities, assault the police, and terrorize citizens with little to no consequence. However, the chaos associated with January 6 has resulted in hundreds and hundreds of prosecutions. The vast majority of the defendants have been convicted of simply being there. They didn’t even have pallets of bricks or frozen water bottles staged at the scene, let alone Molotov cocktails for them to throw at the police. Still, 18 months later, the left continues to be absolutely obsessed with it,” Garcia said.

Garcia notes that like other cops, ATF agents “never did this job because it was ‘fun.’” Their goal was to lock up violent criminals. “I have always said that I do this job for the mission, not the money. That mission used to be locking up violent criminals. I don’t know what the mission really is anymore, but I don’t like it.”

Specifically, he notes that the ATF has begun to focus on the gun and not the criminal. “Over the last couple of years, ATF has been spending a significant amount of time talking about and changing the course of this agency to focus on ‘the gun’. Frankly, I don’t really care about investigating the gun, I care about investigating the criminal, and then plucking that criminal out of society.”

Garcia also observes that 2021 was all about vaccination for his superiors at the ATF and that for the first time in his career, he was warned about facing criminal charges for lying about vaccination status.

Garcia also detects the hypocrisy between targeting political gun crimes and violent gun felons in blue cities, as I have chronicled often in this column:

This administration talks a lot about guns in the same sentence they talk about violent crime; however, they say nothing about holding people accountable for the crimes they commit (unless it supports their agenda). I agree that gun crime is out of control. But I also know there is a double standard that is being ignored. When horrible tragedies occur with firearms, the left seizes every opportunity to argue for gun control and the elimination of certain types of weapon systems. However, specifically in blue states, fewer and fewer defendants associated with gun crimes are actually sentenced to prison. Additionally, violent crimes committed with firearms are consistently pled down to non-violent crimes and the defendant again avoids prison. This is not unique to state prosecutors, the USAO does the same thing. If there is no consequence to committing a crime, then why would a criminal stop? If guns were banned, why would the criminals actually agree to abide by the law?

Which brings us back to the reconciliation bill, which funds the hiring of 87,000 IRS agents. Why are Republicans not even promising to hold up the budget bill to repeal the IRS provisions? Why aren’t Republican governors promising to shield their citizens from the coming onslaught?

Also, why aren’t there more federal law enforcement agents speaking out about the mission of law enforcement being transformed from targeting violent criminals to persecuting political dissidents? Moreover, Garcia’s letter reveals an incorrigible degree of rot within the federal government that will likely never be rectified with a GOP president. Washington is a lost cause. It’s time for states to begin interposing against federal tyranny.

This interposition is needed now more than ever. They are even turning Customs and Border Protection against the people. In a blood libel similar to the projection they engaged in after Jan. 6, DHS and DOJ are now warning against our side being angry about the FBI and how that can foster domestic terrorism.

""Last night, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice issued a Joint Intelligence Bulletin, accessible via the Homeland Security Information Network, providing information on the potential for domestic violent extremists to carry out attacks on federal, state, and local law enforcement and government personnel or facilities,"" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus wrote in a memo to 60,000 employees last week. Federal agents were called upon to monitor the social media of political opponents of this regime.



How is this OK? It’s true that Rep. Jim Jordan is asserting that 14 FBI officials have come to him as whistleblowers, but why don’t we see a rebellion en masse from all of these federal agents? This is what CBP is focusing on as the border crisis – the agency’s core job – is worse than ever before?

Brandon Garcia is a patriot, but where are the others like him?

Until we see a change in mentality from the federal agents, we should no longer reflexively “back the blue” if they don’t back the Constitution. Defund, dismantle, repeal, and rebuild must be the rallying cry for any federal candidate running for election. As for the state governments – resisting tyranny is the imperative of the day.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-federal-agents,2022-08-16
"Horowitz: Federal judge overseeing J6 cases announces retirement, no interest in presiding over 1,000 more cases","We all knew this was coming, but in our hearts we were praying the persecutions would finally end. Anyone who merely stepped foot into the Capitol (and a few who didn’t) was charged and treated 1,000 times worse than anyone else for commensurate crimes. Now, in a bombshell revelation, Judge Thomas Hogan, one of the main D.C. district judges overseeing the J6 cases, announced in a conference call with defense attorneys that he is suddenly retiring. He further said that there are 1,000 additional cases coming down the pipeline from the DOJ (thanks to McConnell giving the department more funding), and he has no interest in presiding over them for another four to five years.

This is quite the revelation for the two-year anniversary of the event that now appears to be more of an FBI provocation and Capitol police misfiring on crowd control than an insurrection, certainly not a planned one. Oh, and don’t count on one of those thousand being Ray Epps.

But what are we going to do about it? Well, ask yourself the question we should always ponder in these situations: What would the Democrats do were the shoe on the other foot? Imagine if the Trump administration rounded up every person who merely attended a BLM riot. Well, for starters, that would literally rope in several million people. Mind you, these events were often riots from the onset, not protests turned violent by some, and they occurred day after day after day. No conservative, on the other hand, dared follow up on January 6, even with a peaceful protest. But what would Democrats do?

On the federal level, they would have held up the budget bill for as long as it took for the DOJ to stop these political persecutions. Republicans, thanks to McCarthy’s refusal to fight McConnell until it was too late, kicked that leverage until the end of the year. Now Biden can trample civil liberties without any check. And no, weak hearings on the FBI won’t scare them, especially when GOP leaders refuse to even mention the persecution of January 6 protesters specifically.

But more importantly, there is no doubt that blue states would harbor all their defendants accused of a crime, especially if they were peacefully protesting. They would not allow the FBI to come into their states and grab people on nebulous crimes, and they would certainly offer legal defense help. At some point, red-state governors and legislatures will have to step up and say no, or at least assist the defendants and place roadblocks in front of federal agents engaging in Soviet-style persecutions.

Here’s why. While BLM rioters beat thousands of cops, trespassed and looted private property, and destroyed public property with impunity, even those Jan. 6 protesters who never even committed a minor offense are being indicted under 18 U.S.C. 231(a)(3). This is the statute that prescribes up to five years in prison for “Whoever commits or attempts to commit any act to obstruct, impede, or interfere with any fireman or law enforcement officer lawfully engaged in the lawful performance of his official duties incident to and during the commission of a civil disorder …”

Even before roping in the next group of protesters, this statute has already incriminated people for merely engaging in constitutionally protected assembly and speech. The dangerous phrase “incident to and during commission of a civil order” can be used to tag anyone who merely talked to a police officer during an event where other individuals in another part of the Capitol acted violently, thereby distracting them from their duty.

Thus, the plain meaning of this statute was always unconstitutional, and now that officials are applying it even against mere speech or assembly, it must be blocked with the same vigor with which the Sons of Liberty thwarted the Quartering Act.

It’s also a fundamental violation of equality under the law in relation to the right to protest. Think of all the times BLM protesters – even the ones who weren’t violent – taunted, cursed at, and filmed police officers. They could easily have been roped into this statute, because their behavior definitely impeded and interfered with their response to the civil disorder.

Consider how thousands of rioters were allowed to vandalize 1,500 buildings , destroy 700 buildings, and block streets and terrorize motorists with impunity, just in Minneapolis alone. Less than 10% of those arrested during the endless riots in Portland wound up being prosecuted. According to a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, more than 2,000 officers were injured in the 574 riots across the U.S. and Canada over the course of two months. Most of those who had a direct hand in those injuries were not punished, must less protesters who were incidental to it. We cannot allow these selective enforcements of an unconstitutional, vague statute that cuts to the heart of fundamental freedoms be used as a tool to round up political opponents.

To that end, state legislatures should direct attorney generals’ offices to inquire into the names of those within the state who are being investigated by the feds for January 6-related activities. Anyone being investigated, charged, or harassed by the feds under 231(a)(3) without any other evidence of having committed a meaningful crime should trigger a set of policies from the executive branch of that state to thwart the persecution at all costs. At a minimum, the states should create a legal defense fund to argue on behalf of those individuals who are clearly being targeted for their political beliefs, not for any violent actions.

Two years into the “Reichstag moment” of the Jan. 6 agent provocateur setup, Republican leaders like McCarthy still refuse to realign their position with the new facts on the ground. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who just called for more funding to rope in even more Jan. 6 defendants, is slated to be Rules Committee chair. This latest revelation from a straight-shooting judge should be a wake-up call that we need wholesale change among national Republicans.



Even those Republicans who bought into the regime narrative until now must concede that anyone who remotely acted violent has long since been punished and almost assuredly over-punished. Any further effort to seek indictments reeks of the worst power plays in tyrannical countries. We need an effort to call out the immoral and despotic treatment of political protesters and a call for actions that reflect the spirit of how our founders dealt with similar violations of due process, legal norms, and basic human rights. But their ineptitude shouldn’t stop red states from picking up the slack and declaring, “Not in our state.”

“January 6” as a slogan no longer symbolizes what the left thinks it does, and when the discovery process of the actual trials commencing this month reveals the truth of what really happened, the political cowards will be on the wrong side of history.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-federal-judge-overseeing-j6-cases-announces-retirement-no-interest-in-presiding-over-1000-more-cases,2023-01-06
Horowitz: Georgia’s once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally lock up violent criminals,"Atlanta is now one of the greatest hot spots in the country. No, not for coronavirus, but for the epidemic of violent crime that is threatening the suburbs as well as the urban areas. With the crime situation in Atlanta now worse than in some cities in blue states, Gov. Brian Kemp has announced support for anti-crime legislation during the upcoming special session of the legislature this fall. Other red states need to follow suit before more people are murdered and harmed.

With the greatest surge in crime in over a generation, the key is for conservatives to harness this opportunity to finally lock up the criminals rather than allowing the session to be hijacked by distractions, feel-good proposals, simply throwing money at a policy problem, and downright weak policies promoted by the criminal leniency-industrial complex.

Atlanta is the new Chicago. Murders are up nearly 30% this year after the city already experienced the highest number of homicides in 2020 in over two decades. There is even a crisis of rampant shootings on interstate highways in the broader metro area (with nearly no arrests), as well as carjackings, which often involve criminals bumping into cars from behind so the victims can be carjacked when they get out of their cars to check for damage. There are shootings on metro trains and even in Lenox Mall in Buckhead, which is a high-class mall.

It's imperative for conservatives to ensure that the legislative agenda is focused on removing all impediments to locking up violent criminals, not simply throwing more money at police or programs. The elephant in the room is that repeat violent offenders, particularly juveniles, are often barely punished for their crimes, resulting in more violent criminals on the streets than ever. Despite the record crime, Georgia's prison population plummeted 16% from February 2020 to July 2021, after steadily declining in the preceding few years. Shockingly, after plummeting during COVID, the county jail population is still below pre-COVID levels, which is astounding given the record increase in new crimes.

Despite the rampant violent crime among juveniles, there were just 29 juveniles in Georgia prison convicted as adults, compared to around 100 just a few years ago. Given the number of violent juvenile gang members and carjackings, this number is appalling. There are 40 criminals on death row, half the number from just five years ago, despite the increased homicides.



According to the Atlanta Repeat Offender Commission, in 2017 and 2018, just 23 percent of repeat offenders arrested by Atlanta police were sentenced to any degree of confinement by Fulton County Superior Court judges — a decrease of nearly 14 percent from those sentenced in 2016. The most common sentence issued by a Fulton judge was ""time served."" One can only imagine what those numbers look like now, with more ""criminal justice reform"" in place, not to mention the COVID jailbreak.

In other words, in order to restore the justice deterrent, Republicans will have to finally kick their fear of incarceration and push legislation that will lock up more criminals. Legislation they should pass during the session should include the following:

An even stronger anti-gang bill than the one they foolishly rejected in 2020, which would make it easier to prosecute gang members across state lines, incentivize prosecutors' offices to prioritize those cases, and slap on extra mandatory sentencing for crimes committed in furtherance of gang activity or as part of expectation of membership in the gang.

Toughen juvenile sentencing for violent and repeat offenders, particularly those affiliated with gangs.

Allow prosecutors, not judges, to decide whether to charge a juvenile defendant as an adult.

Toughen sentencing on carjackings.

Toughen sentences on those convicted of violent crimes who are then caught in felony possession of firearms, and certainly those who go on to commit crimes with firearms.

Mandate that any violation of parole result in automatically serving out the rest of the sentence.

Lower the threshold to hold people without bond or with higher bond for certain violent crimes, as well as repeat offenders.

Fund prosecutors' offices with special grant programs designed to enforce specific statutes against repeat offenders that will result in the longest prison times. After years of weak-on-crime policies, there is a massive backlog in cases of violent felons. There's an even greater need to fund prosecutors than to fund the police.

Build more prisons and courts. They should use some of the COVID funds to pay for this, because even Biden blessed the reprogramming to combat crime. Why not use it to lock up more criminals that he likes to coddle?

Limit the discretion of judges to allow repeat felons to serve their maximum sentence on probation. Under Georgia's recidivism statute, conviction of a second felony can result in automatically being sentenced to the maximum time. However, judges have wide latitude, as we're seeing in Fulton County, to suspend or switch to probation the maximum sentence.

Strengthen the ""three strikes"" law. Under current law, someone who is convicted of a fourth felony must not only serve the maximum term but is not eligible for parole. That needs to be tightened for certain crimes. If one of those convictions was for murder or rape, he should lose a chance for parole after the third conviction, and depending on the subsequent convictions, he should serve life.

The biggest fear of Republicans preventing them from getting tough on crime is the threat of being called racist. However, criminal justice deform and jailbreak are the ultimate racist policies. As of mid-May, 94% of all shooting victims in Atlanta this year were black. Nearly every homicide victim from last year was black. By not locking up the gangbangers, carjackers, and robbers, officials allow the most dangerous criminals to remain on the street. They terrorize all sorts of people, but black victims are the ones who pay the ultimate price for it.

Republicans will never have another opportunity like this when the stars align to do the right thing on public safety. Recently, Fulton County voted in a new DA, Fani Willis, who defeated the previous Soros prosecutor and is actually stronger on crime than many Republicans. Now is the time to do surgery on the criminal justice system, not just pay for some band-aids. It's time for criminal justice reform to mean what Reagan envisioned it to mean – reforming the system to work for victims of crime, not just criminals.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-georgias-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-to-finally-lock-up-violent-criminals,2021-07-21
Horowitz: If only Republicans loved America as much as they love Ukraine,"We’ve had a revolution in this country for the past two years, in which constitutional and even human rights were suspended. To this day, a clot shot is being imposed on our soldiers in the military. Yet senators like Ben Sasse were dead silent as if in quarantine for two years. I didn’t even know some of them were still in Washington. We also have cartels killing Americans by sending over unfathomable quantities of deadly poison and criminal aliens. Yet crickets. But the minute Ukraine comes into the news, there is no amount of money and arms that is too much to bestow upon the country. Their only criticism of Biden is that he’s not sending enough aid quickly enough.

Oh, and inflation is just a figment of your imagination. So not only do they love Ukrainians more than Americans, they are actually increasing inflation with more printed money, plus prolonging a stalemate war that will result in more supply chain shortages and dead civilians.

After giving $13.6 billion to Ukraine, Congress nearly unanimously passed a lend-lease program to essentially lend any weapon aside from nuclear weapons to the dubious Ukrainian military, which is mixed with prominent neo-Nazi forces. But that wasn’t enough. Biden submitted a $33 billion weapons and aid bill to Ukraine, and congressional Democrats upped the price tag to $40 billion. Together with the first $13 billion, that is more than double the sum we spend on interest on the national debt.

So what is the GOP response? Yes, let’s get this done even faster, but our only objection is that it not be tethered to the $10 billion COVID bill. But that bill – which is a handout to Pfizer and Moderna, because, you know, they are quite poor – only bothers them because they want to use it as leverage to require Biden to keep Title 42 turnbacks at the border. They actually don’t oppose his COVID policy bills at all, just as they don’t oppose his Ukraine bill. And even with regard to the the border, Title 42 is kind of a tangential issue to the fact that our government is working with the cartels and that Republicans should demand that the $40 billion spent on Ukraine’s border be spent arming the Texas and Arizona National Guards against the cartels.

You see, Republicans, with all their feigned political combat against Democrats, will never fight the issue that matters, in the way it matters, and at the time it matters. In fact, when it actually matters, they are on the other side – not the side of America.

According to Roll Call, Sen. Lindsey Graham praised Biden for agreeing to split the COVID and Ukraine bills. “I don’t care, as long as the money is going to help the war cause,” he said. “It’s in our interest, defeating Putin is priceless.”

Yup, all the money, arms, and effort he would never put into defending Americans’ liberty from COVID fascism or our border from the cartels, he will use for Ukraine. The sky is the limit. He also called upon Russia to be designated as a state sponsor of terror, but of course no such call for designating the Mexican cartels that actually affect our security more than anything in the world.

Sen. Ben Sasse had no concerns about where this money is going and whether it is going to Hunter Biden’s extracurricular activities, such as the bioweapons facilities. No, everything in Ukraine is pristine and we “shouldn’t get bogged down in partisan politics.”

“This is really simple: If we want Ukraine to win, we need to continue to arm them to the teeth,"" he said. ""A clean Ukraine bill will have the votes. Let’s get this done.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear that “we need to do it quickly.""

“We all agree the most important thing going on in the world now is the war in Ukraine,” McConnell said at a press conference on Tuesday, announcing the bipartisan agreement with the president.

How is that for a bold contrast between the parties! Nothing here at home to worry about. But it’s worse than that. Their strategy for Ukraine is actually harming domestic policy.

Just hours after the text of the bill dropped on Tuesday, nearly three-quarters of the House Republicans joined every Democrat in approving the funding. Only 57 Republicans voted no.

As the central theme of their midterm election campaign, Republican leaders are decrying Bidenflation. However, they have supported nearly every major spending bill that has led to this inflation and have shown no sign of graduating to the next level of economic literacy. At a time of supply shortages, including in weaponry, they are sending stockpiles abroad to fuel a war in eastern Ukraine.

Moreover, so long as they fuel the war rather than bring about a solution that ends the fighting through Ukraine renouncing any future NATO membership and ceding the ethnic Russian areas, it will continue to exacerbate the pain of supply shortages across the globe. Imagine how many factories we could build for things like baby formula or fertilizer.



Instead, our funding is going to neo-Nazi nationalist groups that ran a “No to Capitulation” campaign against Zelenskyy’s own peace accord in 2019. Ironically, if not for the Azov Brigade we are now funding, there likely would have been no war.

Perhaps we can all self-identify as Ukrainians, and our Republican politicians will pay attention to those who’ve had their lives destroyed by Pfizer’s experimental gene therapy.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-if-only-republicans-loved-america-as-much-as-they-love-ukraine,2022-05-11
Horowitz: Is it time for a two-state solution?,"For years, everyone was sure that the solution to the endless terror attacks against Israelis was to create a two-state solution for the Jews and the Arabs living in the region. Donald Trump proved this 30-year obsession to be a false god by bringing peace between Israel and its neighbors without forcing Israel to cede more land. Perhaps what we have all missed all along is that the real two-state solution is needed right here at home in the once united states.

During the time of the Revolutionary War, the Patriots and Tories really only disagreed on one fundamental question: whether the existing power grabs by King George were worth further agitating the British and risking their lives against a military much stronger than the American colonies'. They all, however, understood fundamental rights. The question forced some of the colonists to self-separate before and during the war.

During the lead-up to the Civil War, the two sides disagreed on one vital question of fundamental rights of black people living in America. It led to a bloody war.

Today, the two sides disagree over every facet of life: the economy, theology, natural law, constitutional rights, and the purpose of America. Perhaps we need to self-separate before the Marxist political dominance and street violence become reciprocal.

How can we bridge the divide with a group of people who believe that men can be women?

How can we bridge the divide with those who believe government can shut down the First Amendment rights of Americans to work and pray, but it can't stop illegal aliens from coming here and securing welfare?

How can we bridge the divide with those who believe it's cruel and unusual punishment not to offer sex-change operations to criminals in prison but that it's not cruel to vacuum the brains out of unborn babies?

How can we bridge the divide with those who criminalize children who don't place masks on their mouths, but advocate for release of those who rob and maim with masks?

How can we bridge the divide with those who believe certain people and causes have a right to riot, loot, maim, and trap and attack random motorists with impunity, but those who defend themselves against it have no right to live?

Most importantly, how can we bridge the divide when the other side seeks to dominate us at all costs, while we merely seek to abide by the Constitution and don't impose our will on them?

When we win a national election, they can always retreat to their states and pretty much do whatever they want. Life in California and New York didn't change one iota during the Trump presidency. In fact, those states have gotten even more loony. Whereas when they win, we have nowhere to go to practice our faith and earn a living without being molested with coronavirus fascism, life-destroying regulations and taxes, and risks to our safety and security.

Is it perhaps time to divide permanently so that we can actually live in peace?

If they want to abolish the Border Patrol, the military, and the police, let them live in the part of the country without those institutions and most certainly without the nukes. We will have them.

If they want to give illegal aliens more rights than Americans, take away guns from law-abiding citizens, and refuse to lock up violent criminals, including gun felons, let them live with the consequences, while we use our governments for the few core functions it is supposed to serve.



If they want to crush small businesses with illogical regulations, let them try to start business and attract commerce in their states with those onerous rules but leave us free to govern ourselves elsewhere.

If they believe there is a fundamental right to camp out on public streets, let them live on those streets, but don't come to our states when the going gets rough to transform our paradise into your existing hell.

If they feel they could live without fossil fuels, let them take all the windmills, and we will take the oil and gas.

In many ways, this would be the easiest custody battle of any divorce. We are not fighting over the same money, materials, and children. We want the unborn children, while they want MS-13 and the Muslim Brotherhood. We want the energy sources that work, while they want those that are impotent. We want the jails filled with dangerous people, while they want them filled with those who dare to deviate from the COVID religion. We want the police and they want the social workers.

President Lincoln presciently warned in 1858 that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand"" without reaching a crisis point. ""I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free,"" he famously told Republican delegates at their first convention in Springfield, Illinois. Given that today we are divided over infinitely more issues, how can we stand together in the same house without reaching that crisis point?

Perhaps we need two separate houses. After all, unlike in past conflicts, we are unlikely to brawl over the same furniture.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-is-it-time-for-a-two-state-solution,2020-11-05
Horowitz: Judge applies critical race theory to release career gang member from gun felony charges,"A leftist federal judge in Manhattan evidently thinks there aren't enough ways to turn gun felons loose onto the streets. She has now applied critical race theory to add another way to release alleged gun felons; namely, by disqualifying grand jury indictments because not enough jury members were black, therefore rendering the jury pool inherently racist toward black suspects.

Abolishing the police is only a minor part of the public safety problem responsible for reversing two decades of miraculously low crime in New York City. Left-wing judges are abolishing all criminal justice deterrent. On Monday, District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York dismissed a gun felony indictment of William Scott on the grounds that he was tried in a part of the district that did not have enough non-whites on the grand jury, according to the New York Post.

""Defendant has produced clear statistical evidence of underrepresentation of Black and Latinx individuals in the pool from which his grand jury was drawn, and a jury selection process that was susceptible to abuse,"" Torres wrote. She was extremely meticulous, using census data and the latest nomenclature to describe Latinos, but provided zero facts to support the conclusion that the indictment from last June was tainted in any way. She ruled that this particular grand jury scheme did not use ""inactive voters,"" which she found ""decreased the percentage of Black individuals on the Master Wheel by 0.34 percentage points, and the percentage of Latinx individuals by 0.43 percentage points.""

In reality, so long as there is not a shred of bias on this particular case, there is no constitutional right to a computer-generated census that perfectly reflects every demographic permutation in the broader population. As the Supreme Court said in Holland v. Illinois, (1990), ""Defendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition"" and there is ""no requirement that petit juries actually chosen must mirror the community and reflect the various distinctive groups in the population."" If that's true for a trial jury, it most certainly is true for a grand jury. While this is a federal case, many states don't even require grand juries to bring indictments for state felonies; the prosecutor presents them alone. Are we going to say that only a black prosecutor can indict a black suspect?

Judges like Torres like to have it both ways — demand special rules for COVID but then violate those rules. In this case, Scott was charged in White Plains on felony possession of ammunition instead of in Manhattan because of the COVID restrictions. The entire judicial system has been upended because of COVID restrictions, much like individual rights of innocent citizens, which resulted in the release of so many violent criminals. Yet when it comes to convening a grand jury on this case in a different part of the same judicial district, suddenly Torres believes the defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.



It's funny how nobody seemed concerned about 50% of the jurors in the Chauvin trial being non-white, even though the makeup of Hennepin County is 74% white, or about the blatant examples of bias from the jurors. One of the jurors even attended a Black Lives Matter event. Also, in the White Plains case, this was merely a grand jury for the indictment, not the trial. Prosecutors believed that a delay in the case would endanger public safety, but this phantom right to a racially diverse grand jury was able to trump COVID logistics while unambiguous civil rights of peaceful citizens were swatted down in nearly every court case on the altar of public health safety.

Scott, 43, is a reputed member of the Bloods gang, and this federal gun charge stems from a shooting he is alleged to have been involved in last June. Scott was caught illegally possessing ammunition near the scene where the victim was shot in the leg twice. Court records show Scott had at least 25 prior arrests dating back to the 1990s, including busts for attempted murder on a failed shooting, assault, theft, weapons possession, and drug charges. This is the profile of the sort of individuals terrorizing the streets.

Here is a list of the charges I've been able to find from Scott's criminal record.

If you want to know why there is so much gun violence on the streets, it's because gun criminals are being released by leftist judges like Torres. In many ways, these judges are more culpable than even the street rioters deterring police from doing their jobs. Judges like Torres have taken critical race theory and enshrined it into law itself.



Incidentally, Torres is the same judge who ruled that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy is unconstitutional. This is the policy that is widely credited with turning around the city. Studies have shown that the termination of stop-and-frisk led to the catastrophic rise in shootings in Chicago since 2016. Undoubtedly, New York has followed a similar trajectory.

Before crime spirals to a breaking point, there is a need to create a private cause of action for victims of crime to sue judges who release criminals who have a clear proclivity to reoffend. Perhaps that will help remove critical race theory from the courtroom, an exponentially greater threat than even in the classroom.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-judge-applies-critical-race-theory-to-release-gun-felon,2021-06-30
Horowitz: Martha’s Vineyard affair shows how easily states could fight the border invasion,"We’ve been told for decades that America is different from every other country in human history in that it has no right to jurisdictional sovereignty. Anyone can trespass the country, unilaterally assert domicile in a given locality against the will of the people and its governing authority, and force the people to pay for their medical bills, K-12 education (Plyler v. Doe), make their children citizens, and be counted in the census – and there’s not a darn thing you can do about it. That was until Martha’s Vineyard.



Conservatives often observe the appalling hypocrisy of the left-wing virtue-signalers who publicly advocate for illegal immigration but then refuse to live with the consequences. But rather than just scoring a political talking point, conservatives would be wise to secure political outcomes based on the Martha’s Vineyard affair. If the residents of the opulent island were able to marshal the National Guard to remove 50 illegal aliens within a day, why shouldn’t the red states follow suit immediately?

What we’ve learned from the virtue-signaling at Martha’s Vineyard is that indeed, illegal aliens simply landing on their island doesn’t make them entitled to endless use of the community’s services. Residents, while claiming to have compassion and posting photo ops offering them food and shelter, made it clear that they lack the resources to house them — and therefore it is the compassionate thing, from anyone’s vantage point, to move them somewhere else. Why then should other poorer parts of the country be saddled with a burden on their schools and hospitals that is incalculable?

Consider the plight of Arizona, for a moment. As many as 11% of all school children have at least one parent who is in the country illegally. According to a 2012 study by the Federation for Immigration Reform, “The total education, medical, and incarceration costs in Arizona due to illegal immigration are $2.6 billion a year.” And that is for an entire state. You can imagine that the costs are even more acute in some local cities and towns, many of which are quite poor, such as Yuma. Some estimate that the lifetime cost of just the illegal aliens who have come under Biden so far is upwards of $100 billion. And those numbers are growing every day.

Martha’s Vineyard currently has 165 children in the local public school. Applying the same ratio as Arizona, they could easily afford these families because they likely don’t yet have 18 children among the group of 50 (11% of their native enrollment). If even that is too absurd for them, why should Texas, Arizona, and every other state cater to the invasion instead?

Thus, rather than merely observing the double standard of the left, isn’t it time for red states to begin promoting their own self-survival? Federal courts have forced these states to educate the world’s children, but Martha’s Vineyard wouldn’t be caught dead enrolling them in their schools. And they most certainly wouldn’t put up with the crime.

In 2018, John Lott conducted an analysis of Arizona’s incarcerated population and found that illegal immigrants in Arizona are at least 142% more likely to be convicted of crime than other Arizonans. He also found that they are 45.4% more likely to have been gang members, and “they are 133% more likely to receive sentencing enhancements for being classified as dangerous, and they tend to be released from prison at a younger age despite more serious crimes because they initially go to jail at a younger age.”

The point being that if Martha’s Vineyard could request removal of illegal aliens with no record of their island being overrun with gangs, drugs, and the rampant fiscal cost, then most certainly, those areas suffering its effects for two generations should have the right to use their respective national guards to remove illegal aliens. Ironically, Martha’s Vineyard residents were acting upon their own heritage. In 1700, Massachusetts passed a law denying admission to those deemed a public charge or who forced shipmasters to guarantee their economic security. They forced the ships to transport the inadmissible aliens at their own cost.









Red states have the ability to end this charade tomorrow. They can declare an invasion and invoke Art. I Sec. 10 to repel the invasion by coordinating their respective national guards to remove all large groups of illegal aliens the feds send into their states and return them to Mexico. If Martha’s Vineyard can’t afford them, most others can’t either. The federal government has violated its commitment to the states and the states have the right to step in and end this invasion. The amount of illegal immigration, pursuant to law, that states should tolerate is zero. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires the DHS to achieve full operational control over the border, defined as “the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.”

So why haven’t the states stepped up to the plate? Sadly, most Republicans still support the cheap labor-driven open borders agenda. Sure, now, more than ever, they will use the chaos at the border as a cudgel against Biden headed into an election, but do they really want to shut off the flow of illegal aliens? Idaho Republicans Mike Crapo and Mike Simpson are strongly pushing legislation to grant amnesty and a path to citizenship for illegal aliens working in agriculture so they can further drive down wages and bring some of the problems associated with big cities to America’s rural areas.

HR 1603 has 13 Republican House co-sponsors. The bill grants amnesty to every illegal alien in this country who claims to have worked at least part-time for agriculture and creates an unlimited agriculture guest worker program for the future to bring in millions of low-skilled workers. The cultural and fiscal costs are never factored in. It permanently tethers green cards for people coming in on these H-2 visas to the condition of working in agriculture for 10 years, creating an indentured servant model that will prevent farms from ever modernizing and mechanizing their processes because of the boundless flow of cheap labor.

“This is not amnesty,” said Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, using the age-old trick to redefine amnesty. “This is earned citizenship, earned legality in the country, to be able to provide the jobs and do the jobs that are necessary.” The comments were made at the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives in Washington where the American Business Immigration Coalition promised to spend $8 million promoting the amnesty bill.

This, despite the flood of illegals at an unimaginable level.

Just know it doesn’t have to be this way. States can take charge of their own destinies. The problem is that Ron DeSantis is the only GOP governor espousing the view that immigration should be driven by a cost-benefit analysis to the whole of the people, not just to special interests. Most Republicans, as much as they don’t like the chaos at the border, continue to espouse a belief in the corporate cartel’s monopoly on our country in their desire to bring in boundless cheap labor.

“But corporatism is not the same as free enterprise. Too many Republicans have viewed limited government to basically mean whatever is best for corporate America is how we want to do the economy. And my view is, obviously free enterprise is the best economic system,” said DeSantis at a recent National Conservatism Conference.

Focusing on policy both for illegal and legal immigration, DeSantis framed his thought process as follows: “So the issue is, how does immigration serve the people of the United States and the national interest?” he said, adding, “We’re not globalists who believe that foreigners have a right to come into our country whenever they want to.”

At least as it relates to limousine liberals, when they are mugged by reality they will come to their senses. Not so for the globalist “business community” which Republicans slavishly serve. No amount of border chaos will ever move them from their dogmatic support for endless cheap labor.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-marthas-vineyard-affair-shows-how-easy-states-could-fight-the-border-invasion,2022-09-20
Horowitz: Minneapolis City Council votes to pay BLM rioters who almost lynched a motorist for ‘excessive’ police force,"The Black Lives Matter riots were spawned by the excessive use of force on George Floyd by one Minneapolis cop. But nobody in their right mind would suggest police used excessive force in the aftermath of the incident. As a peace offering to BLM, the Minneapolis police sacrificed the entire city for weeks on end, including allowing rioters to vandalize 1,500 buildings, destroy 700 buildings, block streets and terrorize motorists with impunity, and even burn the third precinct police station to the ground with no resistance.



In fact, they barely defended their own lives, as many of them were injured. One was knocked out with a metal trash can lid, and the perpetrator, Brayshaun Gibson, didn’t serve a day in prison. The plea deal, which resulted in just one year of home detention, also dismissed charges that Gibson allegedly threw large rocks at a police car and for a separate crime in which he was accused of stealing from Home Depot at least 10 times and up to 194 times.

Contrast that to Matthew Bledsoe, who had no other criminal arrests but was sentenced to four years in prison after spending 22 minutes in a public building committing no act of violence on January 6 after the cops let him and others in the doors. Anyone who was accused of even minor physical contact against a cop on January 6 was held pretrial indefinitely. Cops in Minneapolis, on the other hand, were fair game.

Nonetheless, the Minneapolis City Council just voted unanimously to pay 12 rioters $700,000 for being sprayed with pepper spray. These individuals were part of a massive mob that illegally shut down I-35 on a west-side bridge on May 31, 2020, and then surrounded a trucker and almost lynched him. Police were saving the life of the trucker and obviously used riot control techniques to disperse the crowd. But in the world of Sodom and Gomorrah, otherwise known as “Minnesota nice,” these rioters and lynchers are victims.

What has essentially been codified into criminal law in this country is that acts of violence in pursuit of the woke agenda are protected speech, while speech and advocacy or nonviolent acts of conservative activism are deemed violent felonies. It was striking watching Whoopi Goldberg during her debate with Senator Ted Cruz when he brought up the violence of Antifa after she asserted that the left doesn’t “storm” or commit violence. She looked at him like he was from Mars and said flatly, “I don’t know what an Antifa riot is.”

Ted Cruz CALLS OUT Whoopi Goldberg On The View www.youtube.com

While most people probably thought she was bluffing, I genuinely think she was serious. In her mind, nothing the leftist rioters did is tantamount to violence because it was all done for the right purpose. In fact, we should be lucky all white people weren’t locked up and beaten out of their cars in pursuit of “justice for Floyd.” It would be one thing if this demonic worldview were limited to hack has-been TV personalities past their prime, but this is the sentiment of elected officials and judges.

Remember when a Minnesota federal judge, Patrick Schiltz, described Michael Bryce Williams, the leader of the attack on the police station, as a ""good person who made a terrible mistake""? Noting that it’s ""easy to understand"" why the killing of George Floyd had affected Williams, Judge Schiltz sentenced Williams to just 27 months in prison.

Contrast this to Matthew Bledsoe, who was just sentenced to four full years for scaling the wall of the Capitol, entering the building for 22 minutes, and shouting, ""This is our house. We pay for this s***. Where’s those pieces of s*** at?"" He didn’t burn, break, or steal anything. The judge didn’t sympathize with his grievance and note that he never had a criminal record and just made a mistake that day. ""I do view this as a very serious case, and you are facing serious prison time,"" said Judge Beryl Howell in rebuffing Bledsoe’s apology on sentencing day.

And speaking about a fundamentally good person who made a mistake – what about the case of Ryan Nichols? He is charged with assaulting a police officer for having a crowbar and discharging a pepper spray can in defense of innocent people being pepper-sprayed, but there is no evidence he did anything with it. The charging documents make it clear that he wasn’t even apprehended on the spot and was only caught through Facebook snitches placing him in the Capitol. He didn’t break anything or harm anyone, yet the entire arrest was built upon his political views and things he said.

Remember the suspect who got home detention for knocking out the Minneapolis officer? Nichols has been in jail for almost two years pretrial and is facing potentially more than a decade in prison. Nichols is a veteran of the Marine Corps who spent his time rescuing people and dogs from hurricanes. He is a search and rescue specialist helping people before first responders can come to the scene of a natural disaster. He appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’ show, and she was so moved by his work that she offered to pay for his honeymoon with his new wife. Instead, Ryan and his wife decided to use the money to buy a rescue boat.



He certainly made a mistake, but how do you square his treatment with that of Michael Bryce Williams or Brayshaun Gibson, neither of whom lived as honorable a life, for knocking out an officer or burning down a police station?

Remember Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his feet on a desk in Nancy Pelosi’s office? Nobody will suggest he didn’t do anything wrong, but contrast that to the overtly violent and destructive acts of so many throughout the BLM/Antifa riots who never faced any punishment. This man was held pretrial without bail for four months!

Then there were the peaceful protesters at the Capitol who were merely singing “God Bless America” and had no clue what was about to unfold. They were legitimately beaten and pepper-sprayed by the police for no reason.

Can you imagine the federal government or D.C. government settling with them to pay for injury? And unlike the people blocking an interstate highway, they had the right to protest there.

There’s a legal maxim, “Summum jus summa injuria,” which means extreme justice is extreme injustice. It’s all the more appalling when parallel federal courts in this country mete out zero justice to truly violent and unrepentant criminals who happen to align with their political beliefs.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-minneapolis-city-council-votes-to-pay-blm-rioters-who-almost-lynched-a-motorist-for-excessive-police-force,2022-10-27
Horowitz: MN gov paroles child-killer while threatening single mom with prison for opening restaurant,"King George has nothing on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Had Walz been around in the early 1760s, it wouldn't have taken the colonists 13 years to declare independence.

There is no subtlety to Walz's tyranny, and his evils are clearly no longer sufferable. His regime is now threatening to imprison business owners who have no options to feed their families other than keeping their businesses open. At the same time, he is releasing violent criminals, including child murderers, as violent crime consumes the Twin Cities region.

Larvita McFarquhar is America embodied. An African-American single mom with four children to support, Larvita never asked for handouts. She opened Haven's Garden, in Lynd, Minnesota, a family-oriented restaurant with an attached gymnasium for kids to have a good time. She is the ultimate entrepreneur and family woman, but in Walz's Sodom and Gomorrah, she is now a criminal. She had the audacity to pursue the rights spelled out in the Declaration of Independence and kept her business open at great expense with full compliance with all the unscientific distancing restrictions.

The twisted irony is that Walz is all in on the de-incarceration agenda. Just last month, he stated that ""incarceration is a failure of the system."" But what he really meant was only incarceration for dangerous criminals should be shunned. On Wednesday afternoon, Nathan Hansen, Larvita's attorney, posted on Twitter that ""Assistant Minnesota Attorney General Kaitrin C. Vohs filed court documents to have Ms. McFarquhar potentially imprisoned to force her compliance with Governor Tim Walz's executive order.""

With so many criminals being released for violating real laws, you know, like not to steal, carjack, or murder, wouldn't ""Mr. Anti-incarceration"" himself not want lovely people like Ms. McFarquhar to be imprisoned for living a free life? Don't count on it.

What I find interesting is that people are now being criminalized for supporting their families with their own God-given, constitutionally protected property rights. Larvita has no other way to support her family. Despite our government spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, Larvita told me in an interview on my podcast that she has not received a penny of federal help, a complaint I've heard from nearly all small business owners. What choice does she have?

I can't tell you how many times I've heard virtue-signaling from political elites in recent years that drug traffickers aren't so bad because they have no other way to support themselves. In fact, last year, the Ninth Circuit ruled that cities cannot clean out homeless encampments even when they are blocking public walkways because it violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The Ninth Circuit essentially ruled that you can't criminalize something that, in their estimation, is unavoidable in order to live.

As a result, just as the state may not criminalize the state of being ""homeless in public places,"" the state may not ""criminalize conduct that is an unavoidable consequence of being homeless — namely sitting, lying, or sleeping on the streets,"" concluded the court in Martin v. City of Boise. The Supreme Court refused to overturn this extremely novel opinion.

So you mean to tell me there is now an inalienable right to camp out on public streets because it's supposedly unavoidable, but there is no right to earn a living with one's legitimately owned business, even though it is conduct that is an unavoidable necessity of feeding one's family? Courts are now ruling there is a right to homeless encampment and a right to Medicaid, but no right to property, as mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.

Now hold this thought as we move to another Tim Walz news story of the week.

On Tuesday, Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison, as part of the state's Board of Pardons, voted to immediately commute the life sentence of Myon Burrell after he served 18 years for the murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards in 2002. He intended to kill someone else in a gang fight that day, but a stray bullet hit Edwards in the heart while she was in her home doing schoolwork. Burrell's cousin and jailmate testified in 2002 that he confessed to the killing, and Timothy Oliver, the intended victim of the shooting, testified that Burrell pulled the trigger. But, of course, Burrell and his lawyer maintain that he is an innocent man.

Why did Walz release him? The ""science"" of teenage killers!

""We cannot turn a blind eye to the developments in science and law as we look at this case,"" said Walz. ""We can't shackle our children in 2020,"" added Walz. ""We need to grow as our science grows.""

You see, it's all in the science. The science says we can't incarcerate teenage killers. The science says we must declare war on cops and incarceration, which leads to utter terror, fear, and carjackings in Minneapolis. The science says that same-sex couples can biologically impregnate each other. The science says that diners have to dine outside in the zero-degree weather in Minnesota, but outdoor hockey designed to be played in the cold must be canceled. And the science says that business owners are a threat to the public.

Are you starting to see a pattern here?

There is so much crime in Ramsey and Hennepin Counties that they are forced to call in police from surrounding areas. Carjackings in Minneapolis were up 537% this November over last year. According to Neighborhood Scout, ""With a crime rate of 42 per one thousand residents, St. Paul has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 24.""



What's their response? Ramsey County's prison population shrank by 43% from 2010 to 2019, and that was before the coronavirus jailbreak. Hennepin County has lifted bail requirements for 20 felony-level crimes. Attorney General Keith Ellison, who wants to lock up business owners, joined Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman in that announcement just two weeks ago in which Freeman bragged about the Hennepin County jail population being reduced by over 40% just in the past few months. He said that ""we don't want to clog up our jails with persons who are not a threat, so that we have the space and the money to hold violent offenders.""

Former Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner told KSTP a few months ago it is not ""all that unusual"" to have someone with multiple felony convictions who has barely served time behind bars. ""We have, in Minnesota, one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country,"" said Gaertner in response to a story of a seven-time violent convict not serving time. ""Right now, we are fourth from the bottom and we put very few Minnesota citizens in prisons compared to the rest of the country.""

Yet Ellison's office is now dragging Larvita into Ramsey County court from halfway across the state because she, not the carjackers and the gangs in the Twin Cities, is the problem. She is the one who needs to be in jail because of the same virus that is used an excuse to release carjackers and drug traffickers.

This country is simply not big enough for people like us and people with the worldview of Walz and Ellison.

The preamble of the Minnesota constitution states that the document was established by the people ""grateful to God for our civil and religious liberty, and desiring to perpetuate its blessings and secure the same to ourselves and our posterity."" At its core, that means using the power to lock up violent criminals while getting out of the way of individual liberty. The opening line of the state constitution states, ""Government is instituted for the security, benefit and protection of the people, in whom all political power is inherent, together with the right to alter, modify or reform government whenever required by the public good.""

If the governor doesn't submit to the right to liberty, security, and protection, then he must remember the ""right to alter, modify, and reform,"" held by the same sovereign citizens.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mn-gov-paroles-child-killer-while-threatening-single-mom-with-prison-for-opening-restaurant,2020-12-17
Horowitz: NM sheriff issues cease-and-desist order to governor who is trying to close businesses,"Every one of the more than 3,000 sheriffs in this country swears an oath to the federal Constitution in addition to the state constitution. One sheriff, Michael Wood of Lincoln County, New Mexico, appears to take that oath very seriously and is therefore willing to directly challenge the governor's unconstitutional COVID orders. In doing so, he has provided a blueprint for the constitutional sanctuary movement across the country.

American business owners have been receiving cease-and-desist orders across the country. Their crime? Trying to earn a living. Throughout the past nine months, Americans have been made out to be criminals by lawless tyrants in executive offices across cities and states. Some have even gone to jail. Now, Sheriff Michael Wood is turning the tables and putting the governor on notice for the criminal act of violating the most sacred provisions of the supreme law of the land.

Last Wednesday, Sheriff Wood posted a letter on the department's Facebook page ordering New Mexico Gov. Michele Lujan-Grisham to cease and desist from harassing businesses in Lincoln County. It's truly shocking how county governments that are in deep red territory have tolerated this fascism for months on end. Well, at just 13 days in office, Wood sent out a letter inquiring about the governor's orders.

""It has been brought to my attention that under your authority, government officials have been acting under color of law within the confines of Lincoln County, N.M., pursuant to a public health order,"" wrote the sheriff. ""It has been reported to me that local businesses have been interrupted and business owners have been threatened with unreasonable fines and threats of imprisonment, without having committed any criminal offense.""

He then ordered her to stop these activities until he is consulted and then requested a meeting with her.

Plain and simple. He didn't get into the specifics, the math, the science. Governors have no power to suspend democracy and shred the Bill of Rights. This should be the message of every sheriff, prosecutor, and county commissioner in the 83% of counties Trump carried and really in all the Republican state legislatures.

It's time to stop groveling, begging, complaining, or debating. The plain meaning of the Bill of Rights is not up for discussion. Half the states and the overwhelming majority of counties in this country, just based on the voting patterns, should easily serve as sanctuaries for business owners, schoolchildren, and for First Amendment rights now under assault by the federal government and certain governors.

Trump carried Lincoln County by a 36-point margin in November. There are hundreds of counties that are this red or redder, and sheriffs like Wood can serve as beacons of constitutional freedom during this dark time. James Madison, when explaining his theory on a large multi-layered republic in Federalist #10, predicted that having multiple layers of government would ensure that no single faction could spread tyranny everywhere and that inevitably some officials would push back and represent the persecuted minority.



""To refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations,"" wrote Madison of the divided power structure in a large country.

Madison continued:

The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary.

This literally speaks to the time we live in. As the left wants to use COVID and the claim of right-wing terrorism to suspend the entire Bill of Rights, all is not lost just because the left controls the federal government. If conservatives actually pressured and reformed the GOP or created an alternative, they should be able to thwart this tyranny through state legislatures, governors, county executives, sheriffs, local prosecutors, and school boards across a large swath of the land. If tyranny is able to take root in red counties and red states, we have nobody to blame but ourselves.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-nm-sheriff-issues-cease-and-desist-order-to-governor-who-is-trying-to-close-businesses,2021-01-20
Horowitz: There is no good federal response to school shootings,"They are not coming for your guns; they are coming for your bodies.

Unlike most other policy issues, Republicans tend to be united about guns and rarely submit to pressure – even when induced by a tragedy like Uvalde – to promote broad gun control measures. However, there is a greater political threat to which they might succumb, one that not only criminalizes guns but criminalizes our existence. Beware of the clamor to “do something” on mental illness tied to red-flag laws, for nothing good will come of it.

On the surface, focusing on mental illness and flagging those who seem to fit the profile of the Parkland or Uvalde shooters seems to be an attractive alternative to gun control. Which is why Republican senators are flocking to it in droves. After all, we are all frustrated about the fact that nearly every one of these shooters was known to members of the community (and even law enforcement) as a potential threat, and nothing was done to intervene. However, any effort to give more authority to the legal system, particularly the federal government, will not result in stopping a single one of these shooters and will instead be used against people like us.

Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) are all joining with Democrats to work out a federal response to mental health and red-flag laws. From the get-go, conservatives should draw the line at federal legislation. This is the sort of issue that needs to be dealt with at the county and school district levels and must be focused on fostering concealed carry and better security at the schools. Any federal intervention will lead to tyranny with numerous strings attached to funding programs they funnel through the states. In fact, the only federal legislation that is appropriate is the repeal of the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990.

Let’s not forget that in the country we live in today, our government considers conservatives to be the biggest red-flag threats to society. In February, the DHS posted a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin identifying ordinary people who hold different views from the elites on COVID policies and election security as the number-one terrorism threat. Under “Key factors contributing to the current heightened threat environment,” the very first factor listed is “The proliferation of false or misleading narratives, which sow discord or undermine public trust in U.S. government institutions.”

Then there is the Garland memo on school boards. Last year, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that he is directing the FBI and federal prosecutors to meet with state and local law enforcement on how to combat what he referred to as ""threats of violence"" against school board officials by protesters of critical race theory.

""The Justice Department will also create specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators,"" said Garland in a DOJ press release. ""This training will help school board members and other potential victims understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.""

Does anyone think that a federal program to “deal with” mental illness and red flags would not be turned against us? Consider the number of conservative veterans they can easily suggest suffer from PTSD and use these new programs and policies to flag their public statements as looming threats. They can use their political statements as pretext to not only confiscate their guns but even to commit them to mental institutions.

Remember, we already have laws on the books in the states to commit people to mental institutions by force. In fact, it’s the left that has long opposed, and successfully stopped, the states from locking up the criminally insane, especially among the violent homeless criminals we see in cities like New York. So why would they be so eager to pass new red-flag laws rather than using the ones on the books? It’s all about due process or the lack thereof.

As Rep. Thomas Massie, chair of the Second Amendment Caucus, warned last week, unlike existing laws, which require a formal hearing and counsel for the accused, red-flag laws being proposed could strip people of their rights based on a written complaint from a neighbor alone. We have already witnessed so many doctors who prescribed ivermectin who had their licenses threatened based on complaints – not from patients, but from political enemies. We live in such a terribly divided country that leftists will use these laws against conservatives who absolutely don’t fit the profile of the Uvalde shooter.

Sensing conservative opposition to red-flag laws, Sen. Lindsey Graham claims that he opposes a federal law, but at the same time he is now pushing for a federal grant program to help fund state red-flag laws. But we all know how that ends. Just like with the endless COVID funding, where states were beholden to the CDC’s policies, so to the states will follow the feds’ lead on who is and isn’t a mental health threat and the process through which to determine it.

Now consider which agency would likely be involved in spearheading such a program. Well, none other than the FBI, of course. This same Lindsey Graham recently suggested he agrees to FBI Director Christopher Wray’s request for record funding for the organization. As Julie Kelly warns, “If he gets his way, Wray will control a $10.7 billion budget next year—a $1.4 billion increase over 2020—and nearly 37,000 employees.” She reminds us that “for nearly a year and a half, armed FBI agents across the country have raided, interrogated, and arrested more than 800 Americans on mostly nonviolent offenses related to January 6, 2021, a four-hour protest that Wray considers an ‘act of domestic terror.’”

If you think that pumping more money into an FBI red-flag program will be used to thwart the next shooter rather than being used against us, you must be on a ventilator.



The real answer is to terminate gun-free zones. That is the real political battle that will have an immediate impact on saving lives. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who led the investigation into the 2018 Parkland shooting, actually changed his position in favor of arming school officials and teachers. “People need to keep an open mind to it, as the reality is that if someone else in that school had a gun, it could have saved kids’ lives.”

We need to neutralize threats, not allow a very flawed and capricious government to arbitrarily determine who is a threat based on proceedings outside due process. If COVID didn’t teach us that allowing government to determine who is a threat to others is extremely dangerous, then we deserve the trap in which we they will ensnare us.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-no-good-federal-response,2022-06-01
Horowitz: One of the most powerful Republicans supports expanding funding for FBI J6 witch hunt,"Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) is a top appropriator and is likely going to be the Rules Committee chairman of the next Congress. In other words, he will control the flow to the floor for every bill and has a big say in in the entire budget process. He is also a man who believes we are not spending enough money on Fourth Reich agenda items, including the persecution of Trump supporters on January 6 – and beyond.

No Republican can feign ignorance about the truth of January 6 nearly two years later. It’s not that not a single authentic Trump supporter did anything wrong on that day. But it is abundantly clear that elements of the government had forewarning, there was robust FBI involvement in provoking it, people are being persecuted for peacefully protesting or merely being in the Capitol peacefully, and even the few who engaged in some degree of crime are being punished so disproportionately that if the standard were applied to BLM, there would be 1 million people in jail pretrial indefinitely.

As such, this inquisition needs to be shut down, especially now that we know from whistleblowers that investigators are planning to expand the investigation to anyone supporting the protest who wasn’t even at the Capitol.

Yet the DOJ is now asking Congress for even more funding in the upcoming fiscal year, according to NBC.

The Justice Department has called Jan. 6 “the most wide-ranging investigation” in its history, with more than 870 arrests so far. For 21 months, the investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, has largely been propped up with help from 93 federal prosecutors' offices from across the country who are volunteering personnel.

Even if you don’t believe the FBI and informants like Ray Epps created a setup and you do believe that somehow this was a legitimate attack, how in the world are there more than 870 people to rope in when most of those 870, at worst, simply walked into a public building or committed a misdemeanor? Yet shockingly, one of the most powerful Republicans is open to giving the bureau more money to investigate people who clearly did nothing wrong or might not even have been in the Capitol.

Some Republicans are open to it. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior GOP appropriator who objected to certifying the election results after the Jan. 6 attack, said he’s open to authorizing more money for the investigation.



“Those people ought to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I don’t have any problem giving the Justice Department the resources it needs to do that,” he said. “I don’t have any problem spending extra money to make sure that anybody that broke into this building is brought to justice.”



More money has already been spent on prosecution than on the damage to the bricks of the building by an exponential factor! Where is the call from Tom Cole to spend money investigating BLM rioters, including thousands upon thousands of people who committed violent crimes, often for weeks on end, including setting up autonomous zones in middle of cities? There was an estimated $2 billion in insurance claims from those riots. What about the hundreds of private businesses that were burned to the ground? Don’t they deserve justice? Then again, even those who attacked police officers were not punished with jail time, while people who put their feet on Pelosi’s desk sit in the gulag pretrial for two years. Meanwhile, judges are now preventing law-and-order prosecutors from pursuing cases against the most violent BLM thugs who surrounded motorists and smashed car windows on highways.

So what exactly would be funded by people like Tom Cole with an expanded investigation? Thanks to FBI Special Agent Steve Friend coming to Senator Grassley as a whistleblower, we know it won’t even be used for January 6. “ FBI domestic terrorism cases are being opened on innocent American citizens who were nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, based on anonymous tips to an FBI hotline or from Facebook spying on their messages,” reports the New York Post, based on Friend’s complaint. “These tips are turned into investigative tools called ‘guardians,’ after the FBI software that collates them.”



Thus, Cole and the other RINOs literally want to fund the dissolution of the foundation of democracy. And he will essentially be the next chairman of all the chairmen in the upcoming Congress.

Tom Cole exemplifies the GOP old bull leaders who will largely run the GOP-controlled House … into the ground. They accept all the premises of the Left on the major issues of our time – be it political persecution, COVID, or Ukraine. This is why they are in a rush to give Democrats everything they want in the omnibus bill before January rather than extending the stopgap bill into next year so that their own leaders will be able to write the budget and defund tyranny.

But then he turns around and uses broad bromides that the base wants to hear to project the image of a conservative.

However, how does Cole plan to fulfill his promise of fighting on the border or inflation (caused by Cole’s years of big government spending) if he refuses to deny funding to Democrat policies in the budget? Cole has made it clear that without control of 60 seats in the Senate and the presidency, Republicans can’t do anything. In response to calls from Rep. Chip Roy to use the budget bills and debt ceiling to fight for lower spending to reduce inflation, Cole recently told Politico that it’s dead on arrival.

But Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a veteran appropriator, offered conservatives a reality check in advance.



Even with a House majority, “the president is still the president,” Cole said, and “the filibuster is still there” in the Senate.



Cole added that his fiscal-hawk colleagues “don’t vote for the bills anyway, so they’ve sort of dealt themselves out of the game. ... They ask for things that are impossible to achieve in a process that has to be bipartisan.”



However, this is only true for legislation where you need three bodies of government to change a law. But to pass a budget with liberal priorities, the Democrats need all three branches to agree. With GOP control of the House and likely narrow control of the Senate, why should the Republicans be the first to blink on a budget showdown? If you take Cole’s assertion to its logical conclusion, it would mean that even with control of all three branches but one seat shy of a supermajority in the Senate, the GOP could not fight on budget bills. Indeed, this is what happened in 2017-2019, when Republicans controlled all three branches and old bulls like Cole sold us out on every budget bill.

If at this time next year you are just as disgusted with the GOP-controlled Congress as with Pelosi, just know it will be due to the handiwork of Tom Cole and his ilk who lend bipartisan support to every illegal, immoral, and tyrannical policy pursued by this administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-one-of-the-most-powerful-republicans-supports-expanding-funding-for-fbi-j6-witch-hunt,2022-10-25
Horowitz: Our border crisis leaves states with only one choice,"At what point does our federal government lose all legitimacy by inducing an invasion against the state? At its core, the social contract established in our Constitution created a federal government to, among other things, protect us from external threats that states were incapable of contending with. Yet with over 1 million illegal aliens streaming across our border just in the past six months, along with a shocking number of criminals and horrifying amount of drugs, our federal government has forfeited all legitimate rights to govern.

When we thought the border couldn’t get any worse, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced that it apprehended an unfathomable 221,303 illegal aliens in March, the most in modern times. This was the 14th consecutive month with more than 100,000 apprehensions, a never-ending invasion we’ve never experienced before. Just in the first half of fiscal year 2022, there have been over 1 million apprehensions (excluding several hundred thousand gotaways), and over 2.7 million since Biden took office. That is the size of the city of Philadelphia.

The overwhelming majority of those caught are single adults, roughly half of them from Mexico. However, whereas in previous years the northern triangle countries in Central America composed the remainder of the flow, there are now record numbers of people from Cuba, Colombia, and Nicaragua, as well as from majority Muslim countries. This means that even after we empty out the traditional illegal alien-sending countries of those who desire to cross, we will continue to open up new fronts. There is no limit to how many people would come if we allow them, and the Biden administration is hell-bent on testing that limit.

Although some of the trespassers are still being turned back under Title 42 for the time being, ICE is preparing to release 600,000 by September. Deane Dougherty, ICE’s juvenile coordinator, wrote in a court filing that he expects a “historic border surge, with projections forecasted to triple current arrivals” and expects to release 3,000 a day into our communities “for a population of up to 600,000 by the end of the fiscal year.” According to the Washington Times, the document revealed that about half of those caught in March were expelled under Title 42, but CBP released more than 65,000 people on its own just last month. The agency is planning to up that number to 100,000 per month.

It is unfathomable how many criminals, public charges, and gang members are being brought in every day, not to mention the drugs. ICE already had 3.6 million people on its non-detained docket as of last September, including more than 400,000 convicted criminals and at least 600,000 fugitives who are defying deportation orders. Again, those are just the known criminals and those with outstanding deportation orders. Since then, we’ve imported hundreds of thousands more who were caught and released or were surreptitiously smuggled into the country as a result of the agents being tied up with processing.

In other words, our government has become the first in history to telegraph to the world that it will enable anyone from anywhere to come and invade and it will help resettle them into our communities. This is no longer just about the issue of illegal immigration, but a full-scale invasion that assaults our culture, economy, jobs, communities, security, and safety.

Can you imagine the amount of drugs that are pouring over the border?

According to the CDC, there were 107,000 drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending November 2021, and the numbers are growing every month. Not only do these illegal aliens bring over drugs, but they empower the cartels by delivering them billions in revenue from human smuggling fees. Also, they often serve as drug smugglers and distributers on the interior of the country in order to pay off their debt to the cartel.

According to the DEA, the distributors for the cartels in our major cities are either cartel associates themselves or Mexican transnational gangs such as MS-13, Nine Trey Gangsters, Mexican Mafia, Norteños, Sureños, and Latin Kings, or, in the Northeast, the Dominican gangs. These networks, according to the DEA, are “overseen by Mexican nationals or U.S. citizens of Mexican origin.” They “enter the United States legally and illegally and often seek to conceal themselves within densely populated Mexican-American communities.”

It’s true that at lower levels, Americans also work for the cartels, but most of the primary trafficking is done by criminal alien networks, which could be disrupted if we enforced our immigration laws. In 2019, the Louisville Courier-Journal published a long piece on how the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación has created a network of illegal alien farm workers to penetrate America’s rural and small towns with drugs. “In cases in which immigrants resist the cartel's offer, CJNG members often threatened violence — to them or their loved ones back in Mexico, according to court cases and law enforcement officials,” wrote Beth Warren in the well-researched expose.

A classic example of this dynamic was reported last week in Sterling Heights, Michigan, when two illegal aliens were pulled over in a traffic stop and police discovered they were peddling 20,000 fentanyl pills and 500 grams of powered fentanyl on behalf of a Mexican cartel. That is enough fentanyl to kill tens of thousands of people. And what is particularly scary is that these are counterfeit oxycontin pills, so people who purchase them believe they are getting a prescription opioid, not a bioweapon.

We locked down Americans because of the prospect of a pandemic from a virus, yet our government invites record numbers of drug traffickers at a time when we are losing millions of life-years from teenagers and young adults due to drug poisoning.

Then there are terrorism concerns. In response to an inquiry from Rep. Chip Roy, CBP released information on 42 individuals on the terror watch list who have been caught at the border since Jan. 2021. Given how much money they pay the cartels to cross over undetected, you have to believe that the number of suspected terrorists we don’t apprehend is exponentially higher.

Thankfully, the 26 GOP governors finally got together to form a “Border Strike Force” to collaborate efforts and share information and intelligence on border and cartel related issues. In a memorandum released this week, the objectives announced were as follows:



Target cartel finances that fund criminal activity in the border regions to seize the tools used to assist the cartels.

Monitor cybersecurity issues that may increase vulnerability along the Southern Border, such as criminal networks that operate on social media to recruit traffickers.

Review state criminal statutes regarding human trafficking, drug trafficking, and transnational criminal organizations to ensure the laws deter, disrupt, and dismantle criminal activity.

Review state criminal justice statistics and information to determine crimes that can be traced to the Southern Border.

Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps or identified inconsistencies in existing plans to address border crime.

This is a good first step and would have been a terrific idea several years ago, but ultimately this has gotten so bad that nothing short of state deportation agreements will stem the tide of this invasion.

For over a generation, Republicans have badly misgauged the public mood on this issue. For years, we were told Hispanic voters want open borders and that Republicans would have to adopt a pro-amnesty message to attract those voters. Well, Biden is the most rabidly pro-open-borders president in history, yet he has approval of just 26% of Hispanic voters, while a staggering 41% “strongly disapprove” of him, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll.

Horowitz: Red-state jailbreak: Utah faces fugitive parole crisis with violent criminals released early,"The one-sided leniencies for criminals and disregard for victims of crime are often associated with the politics of California and New York. Unfortunately, many red states have adopted this twisted version of criminal justice ""reform,"" originally catalyzed by Utah. Now a new murder arrest of a violent career criminal out on parole, in conjunction with a new report about the broken parole system, sheds new light on Utah's much-vaunted effort to keep criminals out of jail and on the streets, an agenda that has been pushed nationally by Utah Sen. Mike Lee.

On Saturday, 31-year-old Terence Trent Vos is accused of crashing his car on I-80 and fleeing the scene. The dead body of his girlfriend was found by police in his car, and they believe he murdered her. As always, the first thought that comes to mind is: Could this murder have been avoided? Was this a first-time offender? As KUTV-TV reports, Trent Vos is a Bloods gang member with numerous arrests including for a drive-by shooting, prohibited possession of a firearm, drugs, obstruction of justice, and aggravated assault. As early as 2006, he was accused of firing his gun on a highway.

Not surprisingly, violent gang members don't tend to reform their behavior. Despite all these arrests, Vos doesn't appear to have served much time and was recently out on parole. Despite being wanted in 2015 for several drive-by shootings, he has cycled in and out of the system and remained free on parole. After being convicted of unlawful possession of a weapon in 2019, he was paroled in 2020. A warrant was issued for his arrest this February, but like most violent felons on parole, he became a fugitive, and the parole board appears to have lost track of him until the murder.

The case of Vos is not an aberration. Ever since Utah championed jailbreak legislation to place more people on parole, violent criminals have been getting away with more violent crimes and are not re-incarcerated for violating parole. Moreover, a new masterful investigative report by KUTV reveals a troubling pattern of the parole board losing track of violent felons and trying to cover it up.

Reporter Wendy Halloran found that Utah Adult Probation and Parole has lost track of and could not account for 328 parolees statewide each month. Thus ""killers, sex offenders, violent gang members from every street gang, and some of the worst of the worst remain unknown."" There has been a 72% increase in parole absconders since 2015, which is not surprising, because in 2015, Utah passed a law downgrading a bunch of crimes and shortening sentences. This placed more people on parole rather than in prison.

The public was of course promised that the leniencies were only targeting first-time, nonviolent offenders, but in reality, as I noted at the time, the prison population is not driven by low-level offenders. Thus, as has been proven in every state, these jailbreak initiatives let out violent criminals who are often caught after their release for drug or weapons charges or parole violations, which are now viewed as low-level, without factoring in the criminal's past history.



KUTV reports that whistleblowers within the department reached out to KUTV, but officials from the department canceled interviews on three separate occasions. KUTV reports that there seems to be a systemic problem within the parole board leading the board to always favor keeping criminals out of prison:

Frustrated parole agents have risked their jobs to tell 2News what's really going on inside AP&P. Former agents claim they lost their police powers and were turned into social workers by supervisors who, more often than not, required them to give the parolee another chance instead of writing a warrant and sending it to the Board of Pardons and Parole in an effort to send them back to prison.

A video presentation used to train AP&P agents corroborates what the whistleblowers say. During a 2019 training seminar, presenter Dennis Franklin seems to imply exactly what the agents we spoke to complained about — AP&P wants agents to be more like social workers, as opposed to law enforcement.

I have been a lonely voice warning against the bipartisan jailbreak cartel. This was never about finding the few instances where the justice system is too strict and reforming them amid the exponentially greater numbers of cases where criminals were already given too much leeway. This was about cutting the prison population at all costs. Given that you can't cut the prison population with only low-level criminals, they had to let out high-level criminals. Given that most of them violate second and third chances, this was never about offering criminals second chances. It's about ensuring that violent parole violators remain out of jail.

Both violent crime and property crime have been surging in Salt Lake City. Last year, a career criminal was released from a halfway house under a new ""low-level"" leniency program and threatened a woman at knifepoint in her own bed just days later. In 2016, one year after passage of the much-vaunted Justice Reinvestment Act, a career criminal who was eligible for early parole under this program murdered a Salt Lake City cop. He had accrued a decade-long rap sheet of charges for drugs, firearms violations, and theft — the paradigm of a career criminal eligible for early release under the proposed federal legislation.

Now, just consider the fact that police have lost control of hundreds of criminals with similar profiles who used to be behind bars. Yet Utah RINOs have not learned their lesson. They continue to push for more jailbreak bills and even passed a New York-style bill in 2020 abolishing bail for many criminals, which turned out to be such a disaster that it had to be repealed this year.

The criminals have gotten a decade of their ""reforms."" Now it's time for victims of crime to get their decade of reforms so that Salt Lake City doesn't become like Portland.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-red-state-jailbreak-utah-faces-fugitive-parole-crisis-with-violent-criminals-released-early,2021-05-07
Horowitz: Republicans embracing refugee resettlement completely misunderstand 9/11 and Afghanistan,"Invade the world, invite the world.

As I've been reflecting on our odious response to COVID-19, it's hard to ignore the parallels with our counterproductive response to 9/11. The core solution to the virus was always to pursue early and even pre-emptive treatment of the actual virus. Instead, we destroyed ourselves with endless voodoo control measures that flattened our society and economy, not the curve of the virus. Pondering our Afghanistan policy, it appears that our policy from day one was essentially doing everything to make the Islamic threat worse while wasting time overseas on endeavors that not only failed to stop the threat but actually brought it closer to home.

At present, by my count, GOP governors from states including Iowa, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Georgia, South Carolina, Maryland, Utah, and Massachusetts are requesting the resettlement of thousands of unvetted Afghans in their states. Many of these same GOP politicians are hand-wringing about leaving Afghanistan and feigning concern over terrorism — all while missing the simple point that Afghans can only hurt us here if we bring them here!

Afghanistan never did and never will have an army or air force that is capable of attacking our homeland. To concern ourselves with Afghanistan in light of the threat from China is ludicrous. 9/11 was not about a military threat that required a military invasion. It was all rooted in the problems with our immigration and visa system. Rather than locking that bad system down, our government went overseas to referee a 1,000-year civil war, then proceeded to admit thousands of people from both sides of the civil war — coming full-circle on the impetus for the 9/11 attacks.

On Sept. 11, 2001, a ragtag terrorist organization attacked us through our immigration system, killing nearly 3,000 Americans. We simply let in people we should not have admitted and allowed them to work with networks in this country of other people who should not have been let in. We responded by making the problem worse and increasing migration from those countries without any system to vet incoming immigrants.

We have clearly not learned our lesson, or we are just willing to allow the false gods of mass migration to overshadow safety concerns. We have issued roughly 2.2 million green cards to nationals of predominantly Muslim countries from 2001 through the first quarter of 2018, a level we've never seen in our nation's history. We've brought in more just in a five-year period than the entire Muslim population of Belgium, which has become saturated with radical Islamic elements.

Consider the immigration policies of the past 20 years in light of what the 9/11 Commission staff report on terrorist travel wrote in 2004:

It is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country. Yet prior to September 11, while there were efforts to enhance border security, no agency of the U.S. government thought of border security as a tool in the counterterrorism arsenal. Indeed, even after 19 hijackers demonstrated the relative ease of obtaining a U.S. visa and gaining admission into the United States, border security still is not considered a cornerstone of national security policy.

Here is a list of people we've brought in just on immigrant visas from predominantly Islamic countries. Notice nearly 100,000 Afghans were brought in since 2001:

Not only did we send our best warriors into a meat grinder with no defined mission or logical outcome, we had them fight for a compromised force, making them subject to endless ""green on blue"" attacks. In the ultimate paradox, we invested so much in building up the Afghan military that we brought thousands of unvetted Afghans to our shores every year under the guise of helping a war effort that in itself placed our troops in danger from unvetted coalition ""partners.""



Several hundred Afghan military trainees have gone AWOL in our country over the years. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) observed that the ""limited vetting of Afghan trainees, and the restrictions of the investigatory and asylum processes, may pose a security risk to the United States when trainees go AWOL."" We've spent about $81 billion on the Afghan security forces, as part of a nearly $1 trillion price tag for the two-decade war.

Yes, you can always count on the Democrats to wait 20 years and then pull out in the worst way imaginable, not even bothering to plan an orderly pullback and ensure that weapons are removed or destroyed before the retreat. But this should not be used as an excuse to rectify the situation with mass migration.

Some are suggesting that we owe it to these people to resettle them in the United States. This is the most absurd line of argument imaginable. It's only because of the war that we are bringing foreign nationals to our shores in record numbers. The same unvetted Afghans who were leading our soldiers into ambushes for years are being brought here in the thousands every year. The number of special immigration visas from Afghanistan has increased over time, and they are not subject to the refugee cap. We've brought ""here"" roughly 65,000 individuals who helped us fight ""there.""

Those Republicans joining Democrats in demanding that we bring in tens of thousands of unvetted Afghans, as if the American people owe them more blood, treasure, and sacrifice, are violating the social compact of governance. These swamp congressmen and governors must understand the admonition of the 9/11 Commission staff report: that 9/11 was all about visas and immigration because ""terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country."" Now, in addition to nearly 2,500 dead and tens of thousands of wounded soldiers fighting ""over there,"" we have nothing to show for the war other than 100,000 largely unvetted new Afghan migrants.

Have we learned nothing from Europe? In 2014-2015, Europe suffered a massive migration crisis from places like Afghanistan and north Africa with the rise of the Islamic State. It set off a torrent of Islamic terror attacks on the continent, and the problem has still not abated. Europol's latest European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2021 (TESAT) documents that perpetrators of five completed terrorist mainland attacks during 2020 had ""entered the EU as asylum seekers or irregular migrants.""

To this day, we have not even ended the foreign military training programs on our U.S. military bases, even for those from countries with a strong jihadist presence. Even after Saudi Royal Air Force pilot Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, one of an estimated 850 Saudi military personnel training on our bases, shot dead three Americans at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019, we continued the program. If we couldn't even vet official military trainees from the Middle East, are we really supposed to trust every Tom, Dick, and Harry Afghan who claims to have ""helped"" our military help his own country?

One would think Republicans would universally reject the proposition of following in Europe's footsteps. Then again, these are some of the same Republicans who have refused to reject COVID fascism and have instead rejected the one way to treat this virus while opting for painful and counterproductive measures – just like our response to 9/11.



It's time for red-state legislatures to convene and bar all refugee resettlement in the United States. We have already accepted hundreds of thousands of people from our own hemisphere thanks to the Biden administration's invitation at the southern border. As for the Middle East, our own taxpayers have already paid enough for what goes on there with our blood and treasure. We need not come full-circle again and pay for it on our own shores with the one policy that will ensure that what inevitably will happen in Afghanistan will indeed migrate to our shores.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-republicans-embracing-refugee-resettlement-completely-misunderstand-9-11-and-afghanistan,2021-08-20
Horowitz: Texas school district warns of danger from illegal alien car chases over the border,"Rural America is generally safer from crime, but not if you are unfortunate enough to live in a rural county near the Mexican border. As the politicians and the media focus the attention of the border crisis on the needs of the illegal aliens held in detention, they never focus on the terrible effects mass illegal immigration foists upon Americans living near the border.

Cotulla is a small town about 60 miles north of the international border at Laredo, Texas. Yet it is so affected by the invasion over our border that the school district sent out a letter to parents and administrators warning them to protect the children from the endless car chases and bailouts of criminal aliens in the region.

""Please be watchful of your children as they are playing outside, walking home from school, or generally out of the house,"" warns Cotulla Independent School District Superintendent Jack Seals and La Salle Sheriff Anthony Zertuche in a joint notice to the community. ""Both our communities and the rural areas of the county have experienced a great increase in law enforcement chases and 'bailouts.'""

The sheriff goes on to warn the citizens about 8-10 car chases and bailouts a day and encourages the locals to lock their cars and not keep valuables outside.

This cuts to the core dereliction of the federal government, which in many ways undermines its entire legitimacy. The purpose of the federal government is to keep us safe from foreign threats. These communities, which would otherwise have minimal internal crime, are now faced with high-speed car chases, rampant theft, and menacing criminal aliens and drug carriers attacking their ranches.

It was recently announced that the border numbers for March were higher than any level in 15 years, with over 170,000 apprehensions. Many of those people are ultimately released and sent out on buses, but tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of others have never been apprehended, but are able to get into the country while Border Patrol is busy caring for illegal aliens rather than protecting the ranchers and border citizens from them. Those are the people we should really be concerned about.

Border Patrol has already apprehended three times the typical number of sex offenders, and given the amount of money they pay the cartels to cross clandestinely, it's likely that many more successfully evade capture. In other words, the world's criminal enterprises are all converging on our border and trespassing on the private property of our fellow Americans.



One rancher, Cyndie, who owns a lot of property south of La Pryor in Maverick County, Texas, posted on a private Facebook page that her husband was assaulted by a group of illegal aliens when he found them hiding out in their lodge. When they called Border Patrol, they were told they didn't have the resources to come out, a complaint I've heard from many ranchers. Eventually, the sheriff's deputies caught them, but were forced to release them immediately.

Cyndie told me yesterday that when she got home from work, she found sheriff's SUVs parked across from her mailbox and two Border Patrol vehicles in the ditch on the ranch. When she went to check it out, she heard a helicopter hovering. ""Then he [the helicopter pilot] ducked down and went towards the bush, and he's trying to flush out a big group that was on the property, so I ran to the house for safety and my husband joined their search,"" she told me. ""It's so sad that we have to live this way.""



On Monday, Deputy Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz stated that ""way over 100,000 people"" have gotten away from Border Patrol this week. Who do you think those people are? Girl Scouts? Our ranchers are the first victims of their invasion, but they don't necessarily stay at the border. They come to all 50 states, and we have no idea who they are. Earlier this week, CBP announced the capture of two Yemeni nationals on the FBI's terror watch list at the California border earlier this year.

Again, how many terrorists, sex offenders, and previously deported criminals have not been caught? With Border Patrol now expecting 184,000 unaccompanied minors this year, how many hundreds of thousands of criminals will they enable to cross our border while tying down our agents with ""humanitarian"" missions? How much money will pile up in the coffers of the cartels to further facilitate their human smuggling and drug operations? And how will such a mass flow of criminal activity affect the border counties?

As one rancher, Jessica, wrote on a private Facebook page of border citizens about current life as far as 100 miles from the border:

Friends who do not live near our Southern border, I invite you to read this then close your eyes imagine this is your life.



It's 7:30pm on a Monday, your husband is outside working, your oldest is outside playing with baby kittens, your middle baby is in the shower and your littlest baby is outside enjoying playing in the dirt (supervised) while you wash dishes. You get a call from a concerned friend there has been another bail out, only this time, a 1/2 mile from your house and less than a 1/4 from your parents. You normally receive an emergency alert from the local sheriff's department but not this time. You aren't given much information. Number of criminals - unknown. All you know is there is an unidentified number of illegals running from local law enforcement somewhere in your area. For a moment you think F this. We aren't stopping what we are doing. We have protection and this is starting to interfere with our daily lives. Then you remember, our border patrol agents are being shot, children are being left to die, vehicles are being stolen and left with only the kind of evidence you see on CSI and for most there is no punishment. You find a gun, grab your spouse, bring everyone inside and lock the doors. You watch and listen carefully. You can't help but look at your children and wonder why United States of America has a President that couldn't care less about its citizens.



This THIS is what it is like living 107 miles from the Mexican border. This is not a story fabricated by President Trump or Republicans. This crisis doesn't care about your skin color or who you voted for, only your location. How fortunate some of you are to look at this situation and pretend it's make believe.

Should the protection of American ranchers against these people take priority over the care of the hundreds of thousands trying to surrender to agents to freeload in our system? Where is their vaccine passport to cross the border as Americans are now facing the prospect of needing one to function within their own cities?

The bottom line is that our government and its law enforcement resources were created for the benefit of our people. It's time to use them for that cause.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-texas-school-district-warns-of-danger-from-illegal-alien-car-chases-over-the-border,2021-04-08
Horowitz: Texas should secure its own border. Here’s how.,"""Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive's refusal to enforce the Nation's immigration laws?""

That was the question Justice Antonin Scalia posed in his partial concurrence in Arizona v. U.S. in 2012, when there were 357,000 apprehensions at our southern border. With four months left in this fiscal year, there have already been 900,000 apprehensions, with the numbers from the past three months nearly tying the all-time record.

But the situation at the border is even worse than those numbers suggest. The number of gotaways, which are usually the worst criminals, is higher than ever. Also, this comes at a time when Border Patrol and border infrastructure are much larger and more robust than they were during the greatest previous waves of illegal immigration 20 years ago, which makes the lack of deterrent behind those numbers all the more remarkable.

The reason why things are worse than ever despite more agents on the ground is because our Border Patrol is now being used to actively work with the cartel smugglers. Todd Bensman of the Center for Immigration Studies reports that CBP has prohibited agents from catching the smuggler who steers the rafts across the Rio Grande River.

""So established is this non-belligerence arrangement that cops and smugglers often banter with one another across the water or at the Texas shore about the weather, or how long the boats might be running tonight,"" reports Bensman. ""Scenes play out where Border Patrol agents simply watch from five or six feet away as smugglers stand on the Texas riverbank or in shallow Rio Grande waters helping their illegal-alien customers out of boats.""

From his conversations with high-ranking officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), Bensman, who worked at the Texas DPS for 10 years, reports that CBP is warning Texas officials that they should also refrain from nabbing the smugglers as well.

Taken together, this strategy ensures that all the assets of Border Patrol are actually being harnessed to facilitate a more efficient invasion, which is why the numbers are sky high.



Which brings us back to the original question posed by Scalia in 2012: Are states really at the mercy of DHS' criminal behavior in not only leaving the border wide open but downright facilitating human smuggling into the states?

In 2006, then-Sen. Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for the Secure Fence Act. It required the secretary of homeland security to ""take all actions"" necessary within 18 months of passage to ""achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States"" (emphasis added). Section 2(b) of the bill defined ""operational control"" as ""the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""

What has ever come of this requirement? Why should a state be constrained by ""federal powers,"" if they are suffering from the results of the feds violating those very federal powers?

Article I, § 10, cl. 3 (the Compact Clause) states:

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.

The Constitution is clear that, all things equal, states shouldn't engage in warfare with other countries. But all things are not equal in this case, and the Constitution made an exception for those times when states are invaded and in imminent danger.

John Marshall, during the Virginia Ratifying Convention, made it clear that this section affirms that the power given to the states by the people to repel an invasion ""is not taken away"" by the federal war powers. ""When invaded, they [can] engage in war, as also when in imminent danger,"" asserted the future chief justice during the debate over the Compact Clause on Monday, June 16, 1788. ""This clearly proves that the states can use the militia when they find it necessary.""

Joseph Story in his commentary on the Compact Clause writes that while the prohibition on states making war is obviously necessary, it was ""wisely guarded by exceptions sufficient for the safety of the states, and not justly open to the objection of being dangerous to the Union.""

Still, a state may be so situated, that it may become indispensable to possess military forces, to resist an expected invasion, or insurrection. The danger may be too imminent for delay; and under such circumstances, a state will have a right to raise troops for its own safety, even without the consent of Congress.

Haven't the border states (the ones that still care) waited long enough, with too much delay, to act unilaterally?

Some might suggest that caravans and groups of illegal aliens coming north are obviously not part of a declared war. But if you look at the original language of Article IV's guarantee clause protecting states from invasion, Madison originally drafted its language to be read as protecting against ""foreign violence."" It's clear that this was not necessarily referring to formal warfare with a nation-state, but repelling violent incursions from Indian tribes. If a state can't protect against foreign violence, then what can a state do?

Remember, in addition to telling CBP to stand down at the border, the Biden administration is handcuffing ICE from removing even the most violent foreign criminals. Does that mean a state is forced to allow illegal alien rapists to remain within its borders with no recourse? There has been a 900% increase in apprehension of criminal aliens just in the Laredo Sector alone. Is Texas without any right to stop the untold numbers who are likely getting away and cutting through the ranches of its citizens?

As always, the Lone Star State needs to go it alone and lead the way. Governor Greg Abbott should call a special session to bolster the resources and legal authority of state and local law enforcement to deter and punish illegal aliens. The following issues should be addressed:

A surge in funding for an entire division of the Texas DPS to focus solely on deterring illegal immigration.

A surge in resources to build or repurpose jail space to hold illegal aliens who are charged on state crimes.

Severe mandatory minimum sentences for human smuggling, criminal trespassing, child endangerment, and other existing state crimes that can be used to hit those coming over the border. Also, make them ineligible for bail because they are, by definition, the ultimate flight risk.

Pass Rep. Bryan Slaton's bill to have Texas build the border wall. This can be done with a public crowdsourcing campaign as well.

In addition, it's time to make illegal immigration a state crime. Many federal crimes are doubled up as state crimes, and there's no reason why illegal immigration should be any different. With a new Supreme Court, it's time to challenge some of the premises behind the erroneous legal theory of the 2012 Arizona v. U.S. decision.

Throughout the Trump tenure, blue states successfully thwarted the enforcement of immigration law with sanctuary policies. Why then shouldn't red states be able to enforce the laws the feds refuse to abide by? The Constitution was designed for the federal government to protect the states from invasion. At some point, that principle can no longer be contorted to such an extent that it becomes a suicide pact,s whereby states are bound by the federal government's own malfeasance.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-texas-should-secure-its-own-border-heres-how,2021-06-10
Horowitz: The Brooklyn shooting and the rise of black nationalism,"You can’t blame the FBI for seemingly missing every mass shooter or domestic terrorist. After all, the bureau is stretched thin hatching kidnapping plots in Michigan, investigating garage door ropes, and finding anyone who was within a half a mile of the Capitol on January 6. But what about those who are obsessed with white supremacism? Aren’t they the least bit concerned that most of the recent mass casualty shootings and domestic terror attacks appear to be committed by black nationalists?

I couldn’t understand why the Tuesday morning shooting that left 29 shot or otherwise injured in a Brooklyn subway car was not a bigger news story. After all, millions take the NYC subways, and if there is a mass shooting with smoke bombs released, that is a pretty scary event. But by the end of the day, the memory hole became obvious, as has been the case with nearly every dramatic domestic terror attack in recent memory. The suspect in this case was an avowed black nationalist who preached violent hate toward whites. In other words, 99.5% of Americans will never know his name.

Yesterday, police arrested 62-year-old Frank James in connection with the April 12 attack that thankfully led to no fatalities because of a jam in one of his pistol magazines. So, who is Frank James? Andy Ngo, editor of the Post Millennial, found numerous posts from what appears to be his Facebook page promoting BLM, the Black Liberation Army, Nation of Islam, and individuals who attacked whites. He posted a photo of a man who killed five Dallas police officers in 2016 and called on people to kill whites. Just before the April 12 shooting, he posted a video of himself shouting racist statements on a New York street.

James also recently posted a video on YouTube criticizing Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for marrying a white person.





Social media is full of these postings from countless individuals, yet they are never censored the way posts on vaccines are. The left claims without any proof that simple conservative speech is proof of white supremacism and leads to violence, yet when we have numerous attacks from black supremacists who are promoting their hate online, that never raises red flags.

In other words, if James turns out to be the shooter, the Brooklyn shooting will go the way of the Waukesha massacre and the attempted assassination of a Louisville mayoral candidate, where all the suspects had a long history of promoting black supremacism. Which is why it’s important to rehash some stories you may never have heard in recent years:

In what can only be described as a biblical-level tragedy, six Americans were killed and dozens others were injured when Darrell Edwards Brooks allegedly plowed through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, just two days after the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse in neighboring Kenosha. Brooks has a paper trail of similar grievances as Frank James. Yet few Americans even know this attack occurred, much less understand the motivation behind it.

In February, BLM activist Quintez Brown was charged with attempted murder for stepping into the campaign headquarters of Louisville mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg and opening fire. Luckily, the bullets only grazed the candidate’s clothing and the shooter was stopped and apprehended. He came with extended magazines and clearly was coming as an assassin, but a judge let him out on $100,000 bail, which was posted by national BLM umbrella groups. Brown’s Twitter bio reads, “We have one scientific and correct solution, Pan-Africanism: the total liberation and unification of Africa under scientific socialism."" And the fact that he attempted to murder a Jewish mayoral candidate should raise some eyebrows, but that is not news.

Then there is the Capitol Hill attacker. Yes, the only attack on the Capitol that actually directly killed a Capitol police officer, you know, the one you never heard of. On April 2, 2021, Noah Green, a self-declared follower of Louis Farrakhan, rammed two police cars, resulting in the death of Officer William Evans and the maiming of another officer, before he was shot by police when he exited the car with a knife. I don’t know of any memorials for Officer Evans being used to inveigh against black supremacism or law enforcement programs dedicated to monitoring future Noah Greens.

In 2020, David Anderson and Francine Graham, two members of the black nationalist Black Hebrew Israelite church, killed a police officer in Jersey City after holding hostages at a kosher grocery store and concocted an initial plot to bomb a Jewish community center with enough explosive material to kill people five football fields away.

A few months earlier, Grafton Thomas was charged with murder close by in Monsey, New York, when he allegedly charged into a Hanukah party with a machete, killing one and injuring several others. Police later charged him with additional hate crimes after discovering Black Hebrew Israelite writing with swastikas in his possession. In general, Jews are the victims of 58% of the religiously targeted hate crimes. But few focus on who the perpetrators are. These attacks on Jews in the NY/NJ region are continuing. Last week, Dion Marsh, 27, allegedly told his family Jews are “the real devil” and warned of a “blood bath” before running down two people and then stabbing a Jewish man in the chest in Ocean County, NJ.

Then there is the rise of black militias, which lends credence to the concern that the supremacist mindset has already gone kinetic. Last June, 29-year-old Othal Wallace was arrested for the execution-style murder of Daytona Beach Officer Jason Rayner. Police believe he was associated with the NFAC Black Militia, the New Black Panther Party, and the Huey P. Newton Gun Club Alabama Chapter. He was apprehended in DeKalb County, Georgia, and found heavily armed in a treehouse at a property allegedly associated with the ""Not F***ing Around Coalition"" (NFAC). In an interview with NFAC's leader, John Fitzgerald Johnson, also known as Grandmaster Jay, who is currently in jail after being charged with pointing a rifle at Secret Service and Louisville metro police, the Atlantic described many of NFAC's adherents as follows: ""They joined a group that promised to take a bite out of the Earth and reserve it for Black people. They expected to be led by a commander who preaches radical separatism, and who will swagger with an AR-15 in public and boast that his snipers can bisect a white militiaman's head from 1,000 yards away. Jay told me that he already had to vet his recruits carefully.""

All of these stories jolt your gut with the instinctive thought, “Imagine if a white person, much less a bona fide white supremacist, had done these things.” We would have had civilization, policy, and legal changes to our entire country based on those events.

Unlike the other side, we have no desire to accentuate the race of various perpetrators. If we actually deterred and locked up career violent criminals of all persuasions and had the FBI focused on known threats that aren’t political persecutions, we’d stop most of these attacks. Indeed, Frank James had nine prior arrests and was on the FBI’s radar, but the bureau failed to act. But there is something disquieting about years’ worth of incessant blood libels lodged against white people, in which every cultural and governmental institution inundates people with the idea that black people are oppressed. If we are to believe that merely being white is a threat to black people, then perhaps that is fueling the rise of black nationalism … and with deadly consequences.



It’s never a good idea to begin criminalizing speech, even hateful speech. But we typically count on culture to broadly shun those who engage in that behavior. As it relates to white supremacy, we all know that any individual caught espousing those views will have the weight of the universe marshaled against him. No such deterrent, however, exists against black supremacism, and in fact, it is clearly encouraged by government and culture, which allows not just the vague supremacist sentiments, but even the overt calls for targeted violence against white people to exist unrestricted in the public square, which often can cross the legal boundary into criminal behavior.

Indeed, critical race theory is not just a theory. It has real human consequences.

Horowitz: The disturbing questions following attack on Boston rabbi allegedly by Muslim illegal alien,"Are we needlessly importing anti-Semitism in large amounts to our shores?

Last week, there was a stabbing attack on a Boston rabbi allegedly committed by an illegal alien Muslim from Egypt who was a known anti-Semite. This stabbing incident, which the victim thankfully survived, raises numerous policy questions. However, none of them will ever be asked, because since the suspect is both Muslim and an illegal alien, most people will never know it occurred.

Rabbi Shlomo Noginski was stabbed eight times in front of a Boston Jewish day school last Thursday in what could easily be chalked up to rising crime, but there is so much more to the story. Fox News reports that the suspect, Khaled Awad, is an Egyptian national who entered the country two years ago on a student visa but lost his legal status last month after failing to attend college. ICE currently has a detainer on Awad, but the question is why he wasn't apprehended last month. Moreover, has anyone thought of the hundreds of thousands of foreign students we bring in from the Middle East and how we can vet them for anti-American and anti-Semitic proclivities?

Noginski, who is recovering from stab wounds in the arm and stomach, believes that this was not a robbery gone wrong. ""Unequivocally, it was an anti-Semitic incident,"" Noginski told an Israeli media outlet on Friday. ""This is how I feel, I felt in that moment that he was trying to kill me, not [trying] to steal my car. He wanted to capture me and kill me."" He explained how he offered the attacker the keys to his car, but he wasn't looking for his keys or wallet. ""He didn't want anything. He really tried to aim for my heart, my body, which is significant.""

But Awad wasn't a random street thug. He came to this country on a student visa from a very volatile country steeped in anti-Semitism. CBS Boston reports that Awad's college roommates, one of whom was Jewish, said in an interview that the suspect is ""violent"" and ""very much anti-Semitic."" The Jewish roommate had to move out and secure a protective order against Awad after he allegedly attacked him one day in the kitchen. ""He was very much anti-Semitic. He would say like all types of Jewish jokes. I thought he was joking at first and then I started to see seriousness in his comments,"" another former roommate told WBZ.

We all know that colleges are becoming increasingly anti-Semitic, but one of the forgotten reasons is the plethora of Middle Eastern foreign students who are brought in every year. Instead of making visa applications from terror-prone countries a red flag, we now admit more than 155,000 foreign students from the Middle East.

According to the Institute of International Education, during the 2019/2020 academic year, there were more than 3,800 Egyptians issued student visas. In 2018, by my best estimate , we handed out more than 150,000 green cards to nationals of predominantly Muslim countries, not including more than 100,000 foreign student visas and other visa categories. How in the world can we vet all these people?

A Pew poll from last decade, which surveyed sentiments towards Jews among those living in Middle Eastern countries, revealed that 95% of Egyptians have an unfavorable view of Jews. Seldom do these views coincide with patriotic pro-American sentiments once they come here on student visas. This mass importation of the Middle East is turning our college campuses into islands of hate for Jews.

In this case, in particular, how can a foreign student of any nationality with a protective order against him be allowed to remain in the country? Don't we only take in the brightest of the brightest?

What is truly unsettling about the hundreds of thousands of unvetted foreign students is that our government failed to properly vet foreign military trainees from Saudi Arabia studying on our naval bases. In December 2019, Saudi Royal Air Force pilot Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, one of an estimated 850 Saudi military personnel training on our bases, shot dead three Americans at Naval Air Station Pensacola. Rather than terminating this program, then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper promised to expand it.

Alshamrani had a history of openly jihadist social media postings, yet he was allowed to attend a military training program. Can you imagine how little vetting is applied to civilian students coming from the Middle East, China, and other areas of concern?

What's worse than the lack of vetting on the front end is the lack of focus, technology, and resources — or even will — to deal with concerning foreign students even once they lose their visas, as in Awad's case. Why are so many people able to remain in our country completely unvetted after they overstay their visas? Congress passed a law in 1996 mandating the creation of a visa tracking system to monitor and apprehend those caught overstaying their visas, and its implementation was urged by the 9/11 Commission.

Just in fiscal year 2019 alone, almost 700,000 individuals overstayed their visas, and 85% of them still remain in the country. One of the 9/11 hijackers who piloted the plane that flew into the Pentagon, Hani Hanjour, came here on a student visa from Saudi Arabia. We have responded to the threat by increasing the number of foreign students from Saudi Arabia from a few thousand a year to more than 70,000. In 2014, ABC news discovered that 58,000 foreign nationals had overstayed their student visas in particular, of which 6,000 represented a ""heightened concern.""

Between all those who overstay their visas and the 1 million illegal aliens who remain here after final deportation orders (plus another 1.5 million who have ""pending final deportation orders""), ICE obviously has its hands full. But under this administration, it has its hand tied.

Isn't it interesting how our government can contact-trace American citizens and monitor everyone for quarantine, yet it can't monitor security threats among visa recipients?

The distinguishing characteristic of a strong sovereign nation compared to an undeveloped country is the ability to monitor and control an external movement into the territory and the ability to apprehend and remove those who trespass on the national private property rights of the people. Yet in every measure, we seem to fail not just in our ability to prevent people from infiltrating our territory, but in monitoring and apprehending those who successfully remain in our country illegally. We the people are regulated or monitored in every aspect of our lives, but somehow illegal infiltrators seem to evade the juggernaut of Big Brother. At a time when the president is promising to go house to house pressuring those who declined to vaccinate, the question is: Are our leaders are incapable of monitoring foreign national threats, or are they downright unwilling?

Horowitz: Top 6 demands to put Americans first in omnibus bill,"Our nation is at an inflection point like never before. Despite clear science and data indicating that our government is now responsible for countless deaths and injuries from vaccine mandates and the blocking of treatment, nothing has been done to rectify this for the future. We have a border that is wide open to millions of illegal aliens and cartel criminals. We have a government getting us into war with Russia over a corrupt Ukrainian regime, crushing consumers with inflation without any effort to boost American food and fuel production. And we have a budget bill that will not only ratify these policies, but spend even more money enforcing them and exacerbating the demise of the U.S. dollar.

In other words, it all comes down to the 2,741-page omnibus bill released late Tuesday night, which the House will vote on hours after it was posted online. It’s time to fix our government through the budget or shut down this ruinous government from destroying our lives. Let’s not forget that the inflation and supply chain crises were not originally caused by the Russian war; they were caused by COVID fascism and biblical levels of spending that devalued the dollar. Currently, both parties plan to solve the problem … by spending even more on COVID funding, spending $12 billion on Ukraine, and engaging in a proxy war with Russia and its oil exports without ramping up domestic production.

Republicans have the votes to block the omnibus bill in the Senate. Technically, they even have a majority, because Democrat Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.) is on medical leave. Here are the six demands they should make before passing a budget bill.

1) End of all COVID mandates: Workers, soldiers, health care professionals, and patients are still being forced to get the shots, despite everything that has been revealed about the safety and efficacy. All the vaccine and mask mandates still in place must be terminated. Yet not only does the omnibus bill fund every corrupt agency that is still promulgating these immoral and illogical policies, it gives another $15 billion to HHS to promote Pfizer, mass testing, and health surveillance. In total, the monsters at the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for the COVID disaster got a 12 percent funding boost, which will total $108.3 billion.

2) End emergency declaration: Ideally, the existing emergency statute should be repealed and replaced, but at a minimum the current emergency declaration and the invocation of the PREP Act that has induced all of this mischief and has handed our society over to Big Pharma must end.

3) Drill, baby, drill: Both parties seem to agree that we must dump $14 billion into Ukraine while cutting off Russian oil. Putting the prudence of these policies aside, it is indefensible to harm American consumers without first ramping up American production. This includes:

Approval of the Keystone pipeline;

Expansion of drilling in Alaska and federal lands and termination of moratorium on permits;

Removal of Biden’s recent global warming regulations on energy production;

Elimination of the ethanol mandate, which increases the price of fuel and food and harms independent oil refiners;

Ending the ban on financing of coal-fired power plants;

Ending all the existing barriers to fracking;

Ending restrictions on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission limiting its ability to approve natural gas pipelines;

Pulling out of the Paris climate accord;

Suspending the EPA seasonal fuel blend regulations, which would decrease refining and transportation costs.

4) Ban oil and gas from Venezuela and Iran: If we are going to ask the American people to sacrifice Russian oil and gas on behalf of the Zelenskyy regime, then shouldn’t that same sense of morality trump supply concerns when it comes to Iran and Venezuela? Yet the Biden administration plans on using them as alternative exporters of energy.

5) Defund spying on political opposition: The DHS has announced it is treating opponents of election fraud and COVID fascism as the highest terrorism concern. The DOJ is promising to work with local law enforcement to combat concerned parents standing up to licentious school board officials. How can we combat authoritarians overseas when our own government is engaging in tyrannical behavior?

6) Defund border invasion: Thousands of illegal aliens are being flown from the border to our communities rather than being removed. Over 62,000 were released in January alone. Any program designed to complete the criminal smuggling conspiracy of the cartels must be defunded, and Title 42 removals must be applied to all who come to our border.

The bottom line is that a vote for the current omnibus is a vote for more inflation, more medical experimentation, more mandates, an open-ended war with Russia from a position of weakness, and every other immoral activity funded by our government. Yet rather than secure these demands, what was the hill to die on for GOP leader Mitch McConnell? He bragged about raising Biden’s $10 billion Ukraine aid package to $14 billion. In other words, he doesn’t give a hoot about Americans and American issues. The only thing that elevates his testosterone levels is foreign interests.



Does anyone believe this will change when Republicans have the majority and the same GOP leaders control the floor process with the same decrepit values they harbor today? If anything, there is no time like the present. With a 27% approval rating, Republicans could fight on every one of these issues and have the public on their side. Except all of the bad guys are actually on the same side – Republicans and Democrats. Which leaves we the people without any avenue to redress our grievances.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-top-6-demands-to-put-americans-first-in-omnibus-bill,2022-03-09
Horowitz: What ever happened to the right to breathe freely?,"""No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law."" ~Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford (1891)

For how long can American governments continue denying the basic human right to breathe freely without showing a modicum of evidence that masking is effective, necessary in all circumstances, and outweighs the cost to liberty and human health?

Some rights are so natural that they need not be enumerated in the Constitution

We know there is a right to freely exercise religion or bear arms, but how do we know there is a right to breathe without the cruel and draconian covering of our mouths? Sadly, our court system seems to believe that no such right exists, even as judges concoct novel rights to numerous privileges and enshrine them in the Constitution nearly every day through ordinary litigation. However, some rights are so natural and inalienable that they need not be written. Breathing without a dangerous bacteria and carbon dioxide trap over our mouths is a pretty obvious one.

In fact, in many ways, this is why Madison initially opposed the concept of a written Bill of Rights – because it would imply that only those rights listed are inalienable and that rights only come from government and are not indeed self-evident truths of nature. Even as he was pragmatically introducing the Bill of Rights on the House floor on June 8, 1789, Madison noted that some objected to it on the grounds that ""by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration, and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the general government, and were consequently insecure.""

While introducing his first draft, Madison even conceded that he found this argument to be ""one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard urged against the admission of a bill of rights into this system."" The only reason he felt he ""guarded against"" this concern was because of the language he originally proposed in ""the last clause of the 4th resolution."" That original draft language was very strong and categorical:

""The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people; or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.""

Although part of the spirit of this clause remained in the final versions of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, the language is not as strong as Madison's original draft. Perhaps the fact that we think government can indefinitely regulate human breath is a fulfillment of Madison's original concern.

On Friday, the Supreme Court, yet again, slapped down a California executive branch edict using COVID to interfere with freedom of religious worship. In a 5-4 decision, the court issued an injunction on the California health department's rule banning home-based group worship or Bible study during the reign of COVID terror. ""The government has the burden to establish that the challenged law satisfies strict scrutiny,"" wrote the unsigned order. ""To do so in this context, it must do more than assert that certain risk factors 'are always present in worship, or always absent from the other secular activities' the government may allow.""

I found myself shouting ""Amen!"" while reading this, but at the same time wondering why the courts only seem to apply strict scrutiny to COVID rules affecting a selection of very specific liberties, such as religious practice or gun rights, but not the more fundamental natural right to move freely and unrestricted, without one's nose and mouth being restrained, or shutdown orders in general. Somehow it seems like our court system only recognizes unenumerated rights when they are fabricated and not rooted in natural law.

Even without questions of cruel and unusual punishment or a violation of the Fourth Amendment's dictate against illegal search and seizure, it's obvious that making someone cover his or her nose and mouth – to the draconian extent the government has applied it – violates the most basic definition of individual liberty itself. As defined by Blackstone, individual liberty is ""the power of loco-motion, of changing situation, or removing one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct; without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law."" William Blackstone wrote that the right to ""personal security"" includes ""a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, [and] his health,"" as well as ""the preservation of a man's health from such practices as may prejudice or annoy it."" [1 Commentaries *125, *130.]

It's one thing to mandate masks for a limited time on certain people in certain places – for example, for people with clear symptoms, in health care settings, or on mass transit. But to mandate them indefinitely in order to move freely, obtain vital goods and services, and basically live life in any way clearly violates the most basic individual liberties that never needed to be enumerated in the Constitution. And to do so without showing evidence that someone is a threat or aren't already immune, or that the masks even work, violates the Fifth and 14th Amendments' due process clause.

Ex post facto criminalizing human breath

The Supreme Court stated in the landmark Calder v. Bull (1798) case that a legislature cannot go so far as to violate natural law even if the ""authority should not be expressly restrained by the constitution or fundamental law of the state.""

Chief Justice Samuel Chase stated: ""An act of the legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great first principles of the social compact cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative authority."" Chase was referring to the idea of a state criminalizing behavior ex post facto. His point was that even if Art. I Sec. 10 of the Constitution didn't explicitly bar legislatures from passing ex post facto laws, ""To maintain that our federal or state legislature possesses such powers if it had not been expressly restrained would, in my opinion, be a political heresy altogether inadmissible in our free republican governments.""

In many ways, the mask mandates going on indefinitely forever for children to obtain an education or for humans to live a free life is the ultimate form of ex post facto ""law,"" which was defined in Calder v. Bull as making ""an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal."" We were all born as humans and are forced to live and obtain certain services. It's one thing to force someone to wear a mask for a limited time, place, or scope. But to do so essentially all his life or for a child in school when healthy is retroactively criminalizing human existence predating COVID.

Mind you, Chase was speaking of a law duly passed by both branches of government, not the government edicts we have today. The notion that the CDC can simply mandate masks on two- and three-year olds, which fundamentally violates their bodily integrity and their cognitive abilities in the most basic function of their individual liberty, shocks the conscience. It's mind-numbing how there hasn't been a major lawsuit on this issue. This is especially jarring given the lack of evidence that children pose a risk of spreading the virus or that masks are even effective.

It's impossible to harmonize COVID fascism with decades of case law on right to privacy

It's not like we haven't lived through decades of the courts inventing novel rights that aren't written in the Constitution and most certainly aren't natural. For example, in 2017, the Supreme Court, in Packingham v. North Carolina, ruled that the state's law restricting child sex offenders from accessing social media was not enough of a ""compelling interest"" to outweigh what the court believed to be an important right, even though the state clearly had a much more compelling case for blocking pedophiles from social media than masking children for COVID.

The court in Packingham designated social media a place ""to engage in a wide array of protected First Amendment activity"" like streets and parks and noted, ""By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.""

Think about that: One has a right to access social media even as a convicted child sex offender because one basically can't live life properly without it, according to the court. Yet, at the same time, government can restrict human breathing in nearly every setting without having to provide any evidence one is a threat or that the experimental medical device of masks – authorized only under an emergency use authorization – even works. They can place people at risk for shortness of breath, headaches, lack of cognitive function, bacterial infections and rashes, and self-contamination, all without showing that they work.

Justice William Douglas was able to suggest in the famous Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) case, ""The First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governmental intrusion,"" even though there is no right to privacy in the Constitution. Justice Arthur Goldberg stated in his concurrence that birth control is covered by the unenumerated rights of the Ninth Amendment. ""The concept of liberty ... embraces the right of marital privacy"" and ""The right of privacy is a fundamental personal right.""

Well, if birth control is a concept of liberty and privacy so fundamental as to serve as the backbone for Roe v. Wade to kill babies, then what about the privacy and liberty of breathing? If anything, in this case it's worse because you are not asking to take an action (consume birth control), but to refrain from an inaction and not have government force you to wear an experimental medical device that has not been approved for respiratory viruses.

As Clarence Thomas stated in his famous dissent in Obergefell:

""In the American legal tradition, liberty has long been understood as individual freedom from governmental action, not as a right to a particular governmental entitlement.""

The court punctuated this right to privacy under the 14th Amendment by stating in the Lawrence v. Texas (2003) sodomy case, ""The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.""

Think of how they are demeaning the existence of people who are in pain and have trouble breathing under a mask and are controlling the destiny of the most sensitive parts of our body with these Chinese face burka edicts. Mandatory mask-wearing for long periods of time to obtain vital services (especially outdoors) clearly violates the liberty of ""bodily integrity"" enumerated in the landmark Glucksberg (1997) case among those liberty interest secured under the 14th Amendment.

Moreover, a person certainly has a greater right and compelling human need to breathe without oxygen reduction and rebreathing their own toxins left on a mask than to engage in sodomy. This is especially true for children being forced to exercise and play sports for a protracted period of time with a face covering that undoubtedly compromises their intake of oxygen and exfiltration of CO2 while laboring with rigorous physical activity.

In Roe v. Wade, the court said, ""The abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision."" The court applied that even to when that decision is 100% directly killing a particular baby. It's extremely hard to see how that doesn't apply to human breathing, especially when there is no evidence that an individual is carrying the virus, has the ability to spread it, is a danger to a particular individual, or that said governmental regulation even helps.



When the court established the right to bodily integrity in the aforementioned Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford case, Justice Gray noted, ""The right to one's person may be said to be a right of complete immunity; to be let alone."" That would imply that perhaps the forcing of a human to place something over his nose and mouth might not even be subject to any government interest balancing test. But even if we are to believe that the pandemic would align bodily integrity more in line with a typical right, like any fundamental right, it can indeed be regulated to some extent, but the burden of proof must be on the government to demonstrate it is necessary and efficacious in that particular circumstance, not the other way around.

Indeed, 80 years into the Supreme Court's crusade to invent new rights not mentioned in the Constitution, the only rights the justices won't recognize are those that didn't even need to be stated in that document, such as the right to breathe.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-ever-happened-to-the-right-to-breathe-freely,2021-04-12
Horowitz: Why are federal authorities ignoring the black militia threat?,"We have all heard of QAnon and the Proud Boys. No, not because we know people in those groups, but because the media won't stop talking about them, and the federal government is treating them as a greater threat than Hezbollah and al Qaeda. Except, as a ""right winger,"" I never even heard of QAnon until the media promoted it and still don't know how to join it online. As for the Proud Boys, it's hard to find anyone who is not a federal agent associated with it.

However, while we are distracted with phantom threats (such as unarmed grandmothers entering the Capitol building while a police officer held the door open), black nationalist militias are able to promote their violence online with impunity, and it appears that a policeman in Daytona Beach, Florida, has become the most recent victim of their violence.

On Saturday, 29-year-old Othal Wallace, the black nationalist wanted in the shooting of Daytona police officer Jason Raynor last week, was arrested by Georgia state troopers in DeKalb County, Georgia. According to Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young, Wallace was found heavily armed (with illegal flash-bang grenades) in a treehouse at a property allegedly associated with the ""Not F***ing Around Coalition"" (NFAC). ""You guys know who I am? You know what I'm capable of? It could have been a lot worse,"" Wallace said as he was arrested, according to Young.

While Wallace has a criminal record, he appears to represent a broader risk than just your typical career violent criminal. According to Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood, Wallace was planning to attack any cop who had stopped him that day. Officer Raynor was allegedly shot in the head by Wallace on Wednesday as the officer was approaching the suspect's car. While initially reported as being in critical condition, Raynor shows signs of recovering. However, the question is, with all this anti-police rhetoric coming from the media and the government itself, how many other threats like Wallace are there out on the streets?

At a press conference Thursday night, Daytona Beach Police Chief Jakari Young said his team was monitoring what appeared to be Wallace's Facebook page, posting as ""O-Zone Wallace,"" which indicates ties with black nationalist groups including the NFAC Black Militia, the New Black Panther Party, and the Huey P. Newton Gun Club Alabama Chapter.

According to a local Fox station, the NFAC is a group of black nationalist gun owners founded in 2017 supposedly to protect black people from violence and oppression. By that, they certainly don't mean the over 90% of black homicide victims killed by black criminals. This group held a protest at Stone Mountain, Georgia, last year and shut down the site for a full day.



Don't expect any American to ever hear about this organization despite its quite catchy name. One can only imagine if a white militia of gun owners had a member pose with prominent white nationalists what would happen culturally and politically in this country. Yet today we will hear crickets.

In fact, this is nothing new. Everyone forgot about the Capitol Hill officer killed in an attack by a nationalist. No, I don't mean Officer Brian Sicknick, for whom there is no evidence that he or anyone else died at the hands of Trump supporters, let alone white nationalists. I mean Officer William Evans, an 18-year Capitol Hill police veteran who was mowed down by Noah Green, a follower of Nation of Islam, on April 2. Green is accused of ramming two police cars, resulting in the death of Officer Evans and the maiming of another officer, before he was shot by police when he exited the car with a knife. At the time, Nation of Islam Founder Louis Farrakhan put out a statement mourning the loss of a ""brother"" who could have been a future ""star"" in his movement.

How many Americans do you think ever heard of Officer Evans and the attack itself, much less the identity of the suspect? How many federal agents do you think are dedicated to the much more ubiquitous threat of black nationalist violence tied to the BLM movement, as compared to white nationalists? Where are the corporations placing Blue Lives Matter paraphernalia and dogma in every facet of their business? Where are the cultural and educational memes warning about black supremacism? Why is everything so one-sided?

The Daytona News Journal, to its credit, has done a deep dive into groups like NFAC. The local paper of record reports on some of its tactics to defeat policing, including stealing body cameras from police officers to get rid of evidence. Sheriff Chitwood believes that Wallace partially followed this tactic against officer Raynor. ""It [body camera footage] doesn't end because we cut it,"" Chitwood said. ""It ends because the power cord is taken from the camera so therefore the camera couldn't record anymore. He methodically in my opinion dismantled the camera before he shot Jason.""

NFAC's leader, John Fitzgerald Johnson, also known as Grandmaster Jay, is currently in jail after being charged with pointing a rifle at Secret Service and Louisville metro police at a protest in Kentucky last September. Johnson, like several other prominent black nationalists who've recently turned violent, was a veteran of the Army. Don't expect there to be a witch hunt in the military among black soldiers to weed out those serving in the military to obtain training that could be used on the streets, like they do with white soldiers. Don't expect a new update to their critical race theory curricula being shoved down the throats of the soldiers, either.

This is not the first time a Florida cop was killed by a black nationalist. In 2017, two Kissimmee, Florida, police officers were killed by a member of a black militia who had served in the military. Again, where is the concern about black nationalists recruiting the large pool of hardened criminals in inner cities as well as military veterans who posses training in weapons – just like we hear about white right-wingers who retired from Desert Storm all the time?

Just two weeks ago, Briana Sykes, a BLM activist who spent a year promoting hate against cops on social media, allegedly drove up to a white cop at a ""Juneteenth"" parade in Flint, Michigan, and opened fire. Luckily, she had bad aim and the cop was not hit, but the officer was seen begging her to surrender so that he wouldn't have to shoot her. According to an eyewitness, he ""fell to the ground crying because … he didn't want to do whatever he had to do."" How many more of these ticking time bombs like Briana Sykes and Othal Wallace are on the streets?

The Atlantic described many of NFAC's adherents as follows: ""They joined a group that promised to take a bite out of the Earth and reserve it for Black people. They expected to be led by a commander who preaches radical separatism, and who will swagger with an AR-15 in public and boast that his snipers can bisect a white militiaman's head from 1,000 yards away. Jay told me that he already had to vet his recruits carefully.""



What we are seeing here is not only the fact that the entire threat of right-wing terrorism and ubiquitous white supremacism was fabricated. But like any blood libel, the BLM-driven projection of violence on white people and conservatives stirs up the dangerous people on their side to truly act out in all the ways they accuse Trump supporters of acting. So as the feds hunt down every grandma who peaceably entered the already-open public building on January 6, you can bet most of the BLM and NFAC rioters will never be hunted down using surveillance. In fact, they might be allowed to go through with their tactic of sabotaging police surveillance.

Fortunately for members of these militias, one thing they most certainly don't have to fear is infiltration by the FBI. After all, when CDC Director Rochelle Walensky states that racism is ""a serious public health threat,"" she doesn't mean that type of racism.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-are-federal-authorities-ignoring-the-black-militia-threat,2021-06-30
Horowitz: Why Daunte Wright’s aggravated robbery charge matters so much,"Here we have yet another example of a saintly youth needlessly shot dead by police simply because he was black.

That is the narrative the media wants you to believe about the Daunte Wright shooting, but the reality is that while the shooting was obviously a clear mistake, his criminal record and the fact that he was not behind bars are precisely why the police are now confronted by violent fugitives who either run or fight with them.

No, Daunte Wright was not just a young man living an upstanding life who wound up dead because the police pulled him over for an expired car registration or for an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror. According to documents obtained by the U.K. Daily Mail, the outstanding warrant police were attending to after they pulled Wright over was for aggravated robbery at gunpoint.

According to charging documents, Wright was sleeping over at the house of a young woman after a party on Dec. 1, 2019, when he suddenly pulled a gun on her and demanded she hand over money she had obtained from an ATM. He proceeded to choke her and threaten to shoot her while she kneeled.

After he was arrested, Wright was released from jail after a bondsman posted $40,000 bond, but in July 2020, his bail was revoked by a judge when he was caught with a firearm, a violation of his bail, and failed to check in with his probation officer.

Wright is one of thousands of young males in every major city of this country who have become increasingly violent, successfully thwart the law, suffer few consequences, and thus feel invincible against law enforcement.

We often hear protests and hand-wringing over the fact that young men, black or otherwise, wind up dead because of ""stupid crimes"" or a traffic stop. But in almost every case, there is a reason for it. In a previous era, these people would have been behind bars, but recently our justice system keeps them on the streets. When police confront them, either to serve a warrant or often because of lower-level traffic stops, the criminals – either because of their violent nature or because they know they have reason to fear the law – explode. They fight because they are criminals and they know that police are now watched closely and treated as if they are the ones on probation.

Many violent career criminals are often caught committing low-level crimes. Cops approach them as if they are innocuous, just as in this case, where clearly the cops treated him just as anyone else pulled over during a traffic stop. But there's something interesting about violent criminals who barely serve time for past offenses: They are not deterred from acting violent again. Cops never know when someone is going to turn violent on them.

Obviously, this particular case is anomalous, because the cop meant to fire the Taser after Wright resisted, but tragically picked up the gun, a reality borne out clearly by the bodycam video. But police are confronted with these situations more and more, which will trigger stress-related responses — appropriately or inappropriately — that get themselves or others killed.

So what is the answer?

Do we terrorize the police into being even more passive? Well, we need not speculate about the consequences of such a strategy. The past 11 months or so show that the body count in our major cities is set to skyrocket to levels we've never seen before. Those who fight with the police are not the sort of people who will live very long within the civil population without exhibiting violence. If the police ratchet down their encounters by laying off warrants and terminating traffic stops, law-abiding citizens will be the new line of defense … and body count. That is already happening.

With woke judges refusing to hold almost any repeat violent offender and with few of them ever getting convicted and serving meaningful time, we will have more people like Raquan Wilson out on the streets. This is just one of endless examples, but a Brooklyn, New York, judge recently released Wilson on charges of illegal weapons possession, even though he had four open cases for packing loaded pistols and for armed robbery.



Just like Wright, Wilson, 19, had been charged with pointing a gun at someone's head. At just 15, he was also arrested for attempted murder and then a slew of other crimes over the past two years, including one incident in which he allegedly pistol-whipped his victim in an armed robbery. All through the process, he was bailed out on extremely low bail and appears never to have served time in prison, despite breaking the condition of his bail in the most dramatic way imaginable.

Wilson was arrested a few weeks ago during a traffic stop and was caught in possession of a gun. Luckily for the cops, Wilson did not resist arrest, but his criminal record was never even brought up during his bond hearing by the woke judge or Soros prosecutor, and he is out again. Multiply this story times 1,000, and you have endless scenarios where cops are pulling over people and discovering their violent records, often with outstanding warrants or bail/parole violations, and it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to realize why police will likely face more violence than ever before.

This is exactly what the ""criminal justice reform"" crowd wanted — more people out on the streets rather than behind bars. What that means is that cops will be dealing with prison-like situations in the volatile environment of the open streets. Many criminals are on drugs more than ever and are emboldened to fight with the police more than ever. Most of the time, the cops will react appropriately, and often, even with underwhelming force (although you never hear about those cases). But once in a while, mistakes will occur.

To continue promoting the de-incarceration agenda and the war on cops as the solution will only lead to even more record crime and thousands more homicide victims every year. The real story is that repeat violent gang members with a history of armed robbery and gun charges are given endless chances, not just ""second chances,"" as called for by the liberal governors in both parties with their mindless tropes and slogans.

So no, this is not just a case of ""driving while black"" or getting pulled over for hanging an air freshener from a mirror. It's that the same liberals who cry over gun control suddenly don't find gun violence to be a problem when it's perpetrated by career criminals. In this case, they think Wright was a saint and had no problem with him remaining on the streets, despite his violation of the conditions of his bail for a violent gun crime.

At its core, ""criminal justice reform"" is the agenda to keep repeat violent gang members out of jail whenever they are caught with more gun and drug charges and probation violations. But those are the people who go on to commit murder and mayhem, which is why the crime bubble is exploding. Yet rather than speaking with one voice against the cause of this entire cycle of violence and volatile police interactions, Republicans like Tennessee Governor Bill Lee suggest that this agenda ""is a natural fit for conservatives"" and will ""make Tennessee communities safer."" Yes, sort of the same way Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson believes chemical castration is a natural fit for conservatives and would have been embraced by Ronald Reagan and Bill Buckley.

Because a generation of Republicans forgot what it meant to be conservative on crime, the Left has been free to pursue a radical de-incarceration agenda with impunity. They use examples of the symptoms of this problem to aggravate rather than cure the underlying ailment of undeterred violent crime.

Horowitz: Why I’m now in favor of abolishing the police,"The KKK would be proud. Their version of street justice and terrorizing jurors with threats worked splendidly in the Chauvin trial. Now that we only have mob rule, why even have police, who can only be used against We the People but not to defend us?

The standard of evidence in our post-constitutional mob rule is not ""guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,"" but ensuring that Black Lives Matter doesn't come to the juror's house and lynch his family. That is essentially the message to America. If the political system, the media, and the street mobs want a conviction, they will get a conviction regardless of the evidence. However, this will reverberate far beyond the defendant himself.

Famed Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz is correct in asserting that what was done during this trial is akin to what the KKK did during the Jim Crow era. ""It's borrowed precisely from the Ku Klux Klan of the 1930s and 1920s when the Klan would march outside of courthouses and threatened all kinds of reprisals if the jury ever dared convict a white person or acquit a black person,"" Dershowitz said in an interview with Newsmax.

However, where Dershowitz is wrong is that he thinks this conviction will be overturned on appeal. Show me the judge who will be willing to have his life destroyed by the new KKK mob justice. This will now happen with any white defendant — a cop or civilian — who has an altercation with someone who is black. Like the black defendants in the Jim Crow South, white defendants can no longer get a fair trial in America's major cities when the media and the elites turn it into a proxy for a race war.

We no longer have individual justice in America. We have mob rule incited by ""the system"" in pursuit of a transformational political agenda. The defendant in any case that is considered transformational — whether it's the case of George Floyd or of the Jan. 6 Capitol protesters — will be a human sacrifice for the greater cause. When the system makes a call for what it wants, that outcome will never be in doubt. The system gets what the system demands.

No serious person can believe that any sane juror would have placed principle over his own life and judged the evidence in this case properly. With the media, the president, and every state official gunning for a guilty verdict under the threat of doxing individual jurors, the outcome here was never in doubt. That should disturb us all, because this is not just about cops. It's about being on the wrong side of our two-tiered mob justice system.

It's the same reason why violent criminals are released without bail, while Jan. 6 protesters who didn't even commit a violent felony are held without bail. It's the same reason why every cop who shoots a citizen has his name released immediately except for the cop who shot Ashli Babbitt. It's the same reason why BLM is able to shut down streets with impunity and never get prosecuted, as it did yesterday, surrounding a truck:

In fact, the mob lynching of motorists at the hands of BLM is emblematic of why this is about so much more than the cops. Henceforth, the cops will sit back passively and not respond to volatile situations. That will precipitate a cascading cause and effect of violent criminals remaining on the streets even longer and becoming more emboldened to commit violence. Now, rather than the police being the first ones to interact with those criminals, guess who will do the heavy lifting? The civilians.



Now guess what happens when a white civilian is confronted by a black criminal and is forced to shoot him? You got it. Mob justice.

Which is why I have a novel idea going forward: Let's indeed abolish the police.

Believe me, I have no interest in anarchy. I want ordered liberty. But if the only option on the menu is anarchy for one side of the justice system, then by all means let's have complete anarchy for everyone, not anarcho-tyranny. Once the cops and the justice system will no longer punish and deter violent criminals and accept BLM as the rulers of our streets, then the only remaining function the police will serve is to arrest us when we are forced into a self-defense situation against BLM.

If we are going to be alone on the streets without proper police deterrent — which is essentially the current reality anyway — then yes, leave us alone. If the only purpose of the police is now to enforce COVID fascism or arrest someone who defends himself or does something the system views as criminal, then why have police? Remember, these two-bit dictator governors and mayors rely on the police to enforce their illegal and immoral edicts. Without a police force, they are nothing but a bunch of raving lunatics.

The reality is that they don't want the police abolished; they want police repurposed to enforce their own tyranny. Let's call their bluff and abolish them completely so that they can't be used against us, especially the big city police departments.



Moreover, we need to focus our attention away from defending the police to fortifying our own self-defense. State legislatures in red states need to tighten up self-defense laws so that mob justice can't do to civilians what it has already done to the police.

Let's completely abolish the city police departments and leave only the sheriff's departments in outlying areas. What you will see in America is that police have nothing to do with what ails our cities. It will bring the fight directly to the people without the police as the punching bags. Perhaps that is the only way to awaken the people from their slumber and force them to confront this corrupt system.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-im-now-in-favor-of-abolishing-the-police,2021-04-21
Just say no to central bank digital currencies,"You awake to find that today is special: It’s Stimmie Day! When you roll over and check your phone, you see a notification from your FedWallet app letting you know that another $2,000 in FedCoins has just been added directly to your account by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

To be honest, part of you would love to save that money for the long term, given that things have been getting rather uncertain and actually kind of crazy lately, what with the war and the economy and all ... but you can’t, since these FedCoins are coded as usable for consumer purchases only and will expire and vanish in seven days. So you’d better spend em while you’ve got em!

The latest PlayBox it is then. Everyone says Elden Ring 3 is the hottest VR game on the Metaverse right now, and you’ve really wanted to join in. Since you’re stubbornly old-fashioned, you decide to check it out at BezosMart on the way home from work today before you get it delivered by drone to your tiny apartment.

But first you begin your day as you always do, with a quick stop at the local Starbrats’ automated, no-contact drive-through latte dispensary. Opening your FedWallet app and vaguely waving your smartphone at the machine is enough to complete the transaction. $14 in FedCoins are instantly deleted from your digital account at the Fed and recreated in Starbrats’ corporate account, well before the sweet, coffee-flavored milk beverage is deposited into your eager, grasping hands.

Your morning starts to go downhill quickly, however, when you realize that your SUV is almost out of gas. You pull the old clunker, with its antiquated combustion engine, into the nearest open station you can find — it looks pretty run-down — and roll up to the pump. A dull-eyed teenager in a face mask inserts a nozzle into your vehicle and waits for you to pre-pay. You wave your phone at the pump. Nothing happens. You try again. Your phone buzzes, and you look at it. There’s a message from the Fed: “You have already spent more than the $400 maximum weekly limit on fossil fuels specified in the FedWallet User Agreement. Your remaining account balance cannot be used to purchase non-renewable energy resources. Please make an alternative purchase. Have you considered a clean, affordable New Energy Vehicle? Thank you for doing your part to build a more just and sustainable world!”

You have in fact considered purchasing a clean, affordable New Energy Vehicle. But they still aren’t very affordable for you, what with the supply chain shortages. Despite the instant credit the Fed would add to your balance when buying an electric car — plus the permanent 10% general subsidy you automatically receive on every purchase as a BIPOC individual thanks to the Fed’s Reparations Alternatives for Comprehensive Equity (RACE) program — the down payment on a new car would still be more than you can afford, even with your new stimmie coins.

Well, you’re not going to be able to make it to work at the warehouse on what you have in the tank. How could you be so foolish? You’re going to have no choice but to park here and blow a bunch of money on hailing one of those sleek, incredibly expensive self-driving electric cabs to take you there instead. But as you’re about to tap the screen to do so, you notice there’s a classic fast-food joint next door. Might as well head there first to unload a little stimmie money. Nothing makes you feel better like a greasy breakfast sandwich.

Entering the establishment and sidling up to the old touchscreen kiosk, you order a McKraken with extra bacon. But when you wave your phone to pay, an error message pops up again. “You have exceeded your weekly purchase limit for complex animal protein, as stipulated in the FedWallet User Agreement. Have you considered purchasing a delicious vegan or mealworm alternative? Thank you for doing your part to build a more just and sustainable world!”

This is a sandwich too far for you during an especially hard week. “Ugh FedWallet is so f***ing lame!” you post on Twatter as you idle hungrily in front of the kiosk.

“Your message has been flagged for review,” says an immediate notification. “As a reminder, using ableist hate speech may impact your ESG score and future financing opportunities. Thank you for doing your part to build a more just and inclusive world!”

“Omg this is absurd, life was so much better before FedCoin, when we still had cash!” you post again to Twatter, unable to control yourself.

“Your account has been locked pending national security review,” says a notification from FedWallet. “As a reminder, the proliferation of false or misleading narratives which sow discord or undermine public trust in government institutions is classified as a potential domestic terrorism offence by the Department of Homeland Security. We value your feedback.”

You jerk awake, fumbling at your phone with trembling, sweaty fingers. Oh thank God, it was all just a terrible dream! You just dozed off while reading Rod Dreher’s blog. You can still eat all the steak and bacon you want. There’s nothing to worry about ...

But no, you’re actually reading Politico and see with horror that President Biden has just released a “sweeping” executive order directing the government to immediately begin moving to comprehensively regulate cryptocurrencies while developing a digital dollar issued by the Federal Reserve. “My Administration places the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC,” he declares, in a line probably narrated in a creepy whisper.

You are wracked by foreboding amid the sudden cawing of ravens.

At least you should be, because everything about central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the stuff of totalitarian nightmares.

But let’s start with the basics: What is a CBDC?

Well, as the term implies, it’s digital money issued directly by a central bank. You might assume that you are already using “digital currency” right now, since you rarely use physical cash any more, instead buying everything with a credit card or a digital payment app; you impulse-buy something on Amazon and these do their thing — with the 1s and the 0s and whatnot — over the internet, and boom, numbers are moved between accounts.

But in truth the process of moving money from A to B is vastly more complicated than that. It involves a tangle of payment processors, banks holding federal debt, financial clearing houses, and, if your money is crossing borders, international communication and exchange systems like the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Since generally the actual money itself doesn’t move, each institution must take on risks to fulfill your transaction by accepting promises, sending transfers, and verifying receipt of funds, etc. So naturally many fees are collected along the way for such services.

A CBDC system would be radically simplified. A customer opens an account directly with a country’s “independent” central bank (let’s say the Federal Reserve), and the central bank issues (creates) digital money (whether denominated as dollars, or FedCoins, or whatever) in that account. This makes the money a direct liability of the Fed, rather than of a private bank. Using digital tools (like say a “FedWallet” app) the customer can initiate direct transactions between Fed accounts. The digital money is deleted in one account and recreated in another essentially instantaneously. No promises or trust necessary; every transaction is permanently recorded on a digital cryptographic ledger in real time. Kind of like Bitcoin, but exquisitely centrally managed. The Fed retains complete oversight and control over the creation, destruction, and “movement” of money, no matter who “has” it, or where it “is.”

Or as Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), helpfully put it at a 2020 summit of the International Monetary Fund:

We don’t know who’s using a $100 bill today and we don’t know who’s using a 1,000 peso bill today. The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that … and that makes a huge difference.

Moreover, in such a centralized system there is no longer any need for middlemen like banks or credit card companies. The Fed and its magic coins handle everything. Some planning documents for CBDCs discuss still including private banks in a “public-private partnership” system. But that’s only because customers love banks so much and because banks would love to keep charging fees for handling your money as long as they can, even if in reality they are reduced to being totally redundant husks for central bank software.

Among their many conveniences, CBDCs could also greatly simplify moving money across borders. Something as complex as SWIFT would no longer be needed. If you are moving digital dollars into your investment account from your office in Dubai, that would be as simple as receiving the Fed’s digital blessing. Meanwhile converting dollars into Euros, for example, would be slightly more complex, but would just require a pre-existing agreement between the Fed and the European Central Bank to allow this. Of course, if either party did not want you to be able to exchange your money, you’d be out of luck.

Finally, because these digital coins are minted out of code, they are easily “programmable” to function, or not function, however or whenever the central bank wants them to — a small detail that we’ll get into later.

But first, how did we get here, anyway? Cash has been working at least fairly well for a few thousand years. Why is it suddenly now a matter of “the highest urgency” for the United States to push for a technological revolution in money?

In truth, momentum toward the development of CBDCs has been building for years, ever since Bitcoin appeared and demonstrated that digital currencies were a thing now. Once they caught on, central bankers started doing their own research into how they could best jump on the crypto bandwagon too.

Over the last several years, one central bank after another has released reports on what that might look like. As a summary report by the BIS recently put it, “Central banks' interest in CBDC has increased as a potential means of delivering their public policy objectives” while allowing them “to evolve in step with the wider digitalisation of people’s day-to-day lives.” Plus, “Profound, ongoing changes across finance, technology and society, as well as the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, provide additional impetus” for doing so now while there seems to be the opportunity for some kind of reset, or something.

And so eight of the largest central banks (including the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada, among others) have decided to form a tentative consortium, with guidance from the BIS, in order to “enable interoperability and cross-border transactions between [their] domestic CBDCs” as they move forward with development.

In their public reports, these central banks all tend to cite the same reasons for why implementing a CBDC would be beneficial.

A Fed report from January, for instance, portrays a CBDC as a way to “support faster and cheaper payments,” and “offer the general public broad access to digital money that is free from credit risk.” In particular, it argues that, “Promoting financial inclusion — particularly for economically vulnerable households and communities — is a high priority for the Federal Reserve.”

Biden’s executive order also calls for the need to “Promote Equitable Access to Safe and Affordable Financial Services by affirming the critical need for safe, affordable, and accessible financial services as a U.S. national interest that must inform our approach to digital asset innovation, including disparate impact risk.”

And the ECB figures a digital Euro could not only “increase choice, competition and accessibility with regard to digital payments, supporting financial inclusion,” but also “represent an option for reducing the overall costs and ecological footprint of the monetary and payment systems.”

The Bank of Canada assesses that a “CBDC could be necessary in the future to ensure a competitive digital economy” and also “solve market failures” on social and economic issues.

“So, under what conditions would a central bank find it necessary to issue a digital currency?” the Bank asks rhetorically. Well, “the answer to the previous question is somewhat trivial: if a CBDC is expected to increase welfare, then a central bank should issue one.” Ah, so simple!

Wait, what was that part about discontinuing banknotes?

That stuff sounds nice and all, but still: Why the new level of urgency? After all, it wasn’t too long ago that Fed Chair Jerome Powell was going around saying that when it came to CBDCs, it was “more important to get it right than to be first,” given the “potential risks” and “important trade-offs that have to be thought through carefully.”

Well, fortunately you can always count on the Americans to say the quiet part out loud.

“The United States derives significant economic and national security benefits from the central role that the United States dollar and United States financial institutions and markets play in the global financial system,” Biden’s new executive order states. Therefore, “The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system.”

Or as BlackRock’s former global head of sustainable investing, and now director of the U.S. National Economic Council, Brian Deese, put it even more directly: “The approach outlined in the E.O. will reinforce U.S. leadership in the global financial system and safeguard the long-term efficacy of critical national security tools like sanctions and anti-money laundering frameworks.”

Oh, right. You see, it turns out that it’s the Chinese who have pioneered the development of a CBDC (the digital yuan) and even begun putting it into limited circulation and testing its cross-border functionality.

Right now the dollar’s overwhelming use by those conducting global commercial transactions means that the United States has quite a bit of leverage to strong-arm banks, or the whole SWIFT network, into not doing business with anyone we don’t want them to do business with – i.e. it can impose sanctions. But if there was some easier, faster, less-interdictable-by-Yankees alternative, something that could move money across borders and be exchanged instantaneously with zero-cost, such as a digital yuan, then some people around the world might be tempted to start using that instead of the dollar – in fact many might in time find they have much less use for the dollar at all. In the long run, only the development of a similarly fast, convenient, convertible, widely used, and easily controlled digital architecture seems certain to allow the West to maintain its collective dominance over global financial flows, preventing the enemies of America and its allies from escaping the long arm of the liberal international order’s sanctions regime.

And by enemies of course I mean Russians. So really it’s hard to see who could oppose CBDCs; I mean, are you pro-Russia or something?

It’s just that, once we do our patriotic duty and implement a FedCoin to stop Putin, there are some other potential ways in which the Fed may be tempted to use the One Coin of Power here at home that may be worth considering in advance. You see, the unique “programmability” of CBDCs happens to open up a huge range of intriguing possibilities that you, and I, and maybe even the central banks, might not yet have fully thought through.

When word first arrived that the People’s Bank of China “has tested expiration dates to encourage users to spend it quickly, for times when the economy needs a jump start,” Western monetary policymakers – who struggled for years to use negative interest rates to stop people from saving – probably spat coffee-flavored milk beverage all over their monitors. But that is still pretty midwit-level creative thinking.

We could of course directly subtract taxes and fees from any account, in real time, with every transaction or paycheck, if we wished. And there would be no more tax evasion, either, since we have a complete record of every transaction made by everyone.

And say goodbye to unapproved money laundering, terrorist financing, or financial crime in general. With a CBDC, all transactions are clean and transparent transactions.

In fact, we could levy fines in real time too, as long as we’ve hooked up the internet of things by then – speeding and jaywalking will become the scourges of an uncivilized past!

If we are feeling more generous, there would also no longer be any need to mail out stimulus checks, since money could just be deposited directly into accounts. As could welfare or universal basic income payments – so convenient for the little people!

But why not go higher-resolution than that: How about targeted microfinance grants, added straight to the accounts of those people and businesses that are extra deserving? There’s no need to wait for annual tax credits and loopholes when those are now antiquated.

A Fed-funded discount could even be applied to those businesses the people most want to help; Google and Yelp already flag which businesses are or are not black-owned or LGBTQ-friendly, presumably so people can preference their patronage, so why not assist with a little nudge here and there? Or we could go in the other direction and effectively change the price of anything based on the identity of who’s buying it.

Indeed a CBDC could make ending any kind of systemic inequities much easier and through market-friendly means. And as the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has reminded us, after all, being “‘race-neutral’ is not enough” when it comes to monetary and fiscal policy. The central bank could really be doing more in general.

Discriminatory practices like redlining by banks would certainly be a thing of the past; unless of course we wanted to do a little bit of redlining, just to make things a bit more equitable maybe, in which case we could do it, like, super easily.

Prison abolition has proven challenging. But a CBDC could help: Just geofence the location within which parolees’ money can be used and not disappear – house arrest will never have been better incentivized! This would also work great in case we wanted to keep people confined to their homes for any other reason.

Should people be incentivized to eat the foods we think it’s best for them to eat? CBDCs can do that. Trying to get people to make reductions in their carbon footprint? CBDCs can help with that too.

But why just focus on individuals? Why not provide preferential financing to companies and investors virtuously meeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals? This can be finely graded based on how closely they conform to standards.

And we could help nudge consumers away from organizations and businesses that are undesirable, too. Why not collect additional fees for transactions with “risky” businesses or charities that have low ESG scores? Or slow down their transaction speed to allow for greater “verification”? Just as a nudge, of course; people would still have free choice.

In fact, why not create comprehensive credit scores based on behavior and number of associational connections with dangerous, risky individuals and organizations? It’s only logical as a next step.

Though if it were ever really necessary, like if they were honking truck horns too many times in a row, the most dangerous individuals or organizations could simply have their digital assets temporarily deleted, or their accounts’ ability to transact frozen, with the push of a button, locking them out of the commercial system and greatly mitigating the threat they pose to our democracy – no use of emergency powers required to compel cooperation by intermediary financial institutions!

But that’s just a start. There’s probably no limit to the innovative possibilities, really.

True, making so many interventions could get pretty complex for even a much-enlarged Fed staff to handle, but someday maybe we could plug the whole economy into the black box of a supercomputer AI and let it manage everything for us in minute detail, using perfect surveillance of pricing data to make real-time policy adjustments. Will we be able to comprehend everything that is happening or how judgements are handed down by the algorithm? No, but who cares – do you not already enjoy TikTok? Praise the Fed Spirit, for it will be generous and all-knowing!

Sorry, I got a little carried away there by the bureaucratic thrill of thinking about every remaining mitigating barrier between the private individual and the all-seeing, all-controlling state collapsing into a warm, patriotic plasma of perfect efficiency and social harmony.

It’s just that CBDCs have the potential to be a technocratic central planner’s wet dream. And given the political make-up of the Fed, the direction that dream is likely to take seems to already be pretty firmly fixed.

Meanwhile, in the United States there happens to be no constitutional right enshrining the freedom to conduct property transactions. Which is very convenient for circumventing all those other pesky rights if their bearers happen to stand in the way of the greater good. Freedom of speech? Sure, but it’s not much good if no one can buy those rabble-rousers’ books and they can’t buy ink, let alone web hosting services. Freedom of assembly? Sure, but only if they’re prepared to walk! There’s nothing really in the way of the Fed working to “allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.”

In fact, the implementation of a CBDC could represent the single greatest expansion of totalitarian power in human history. Never has there been any regime with such omnipotent insight into and control over its people’s every transaction as what CBDCs may soon make possible. No Xerxes, no Caligula, no Stalin, no Kim Jong Un has ever held such power. And yet this is what will soon be smuggled into use in our societies in the name of convenience, social justice, and patriotism.

Actually, now that I think about it, maybe we should just say no to CBDCs.

Jason Whitlock on NGL COVID protocols and vaccine mandates,"Let's see if I understand modern-day Jim Crow.

Requiring a government-issued ID to vote is the newest form of racial bigotry terrorizing black people. According to Democrats and corporate media, people of color struggle to obtain legal forms of identification, and therefore any attempts to mandate IDs to vote is an act just short of physical intimidation at the voting booth.

No one has offered any proof that enthusiastic, would-be black or brown voters are being turned away at the polls because they lack a suitable government ID. If anyone has seen one of these disappointed voters interviewed on television or in a print publication, please tweet me a link to the story at @whitlockjason.

To the best of my knowledge, ""Jim Crow 2.0,"" as our current president calls it, is a victimless crime.

But for the sake of this column, I'm going to accept Biden's assertion that a simple requirement such as an ID can be analogized to 1920s-style segregation laws.

So what should we call what's going on in the National Football League? America's pastime is tactically requiring its players and coaches to get the COVID vaccination to play this season. The players and coaches who don't get the vaccine are subject to rules and standards vaccinated NFL employees are not. Unvaccinated players who breach COVID protocols, including being caught not wearing a mask, will be fined $14,000 per infraction.



Let's follow the established logic. Approximately 75 percent of NFL players are black. Data has revealed that black men are the most reluctant Americans to take the experimental vaccines. Democratic Party and corporate media have spent at least the past five years telling black Americans to distrust the country's ""systemically racist"" government. Couple the anti-American sentiment with the well-known, 40-year Tuskegee Syphilis Study that exploited black men and it's not difficult to understand black men's hesitancy to take the experimental vaccine.

The NFL's COVID policing is going to make New York's old stop-and-frisk policing program feel like the Emancipation Proclamation and Juneteenth rolled into one.

What we're looking at is a clear case of what Fox News host Tucker Carlson appropriately labeled ""Medical Jim Crow.""

COVID rules are going to disproportionately and negatively impact black NFL players. The NFL is a microcosm of what's going to happen to the rest of American society. Black men will be disproportionately damaged by COVID restrictions in all American workplaces.

This is Joe Biden's 1994 crime bill all over again. We don't need to wait 20 years to recognize who the COVID protocols will hurt.

This should be a wake-up call to black men in particular and black people in general. Quit assuming your true allies call themselves Democrats, liberals and social justice activists. They are not our allies. They're clever hunters who repeatedly walk us into situations that don't benefit us.

I have to tip my hats to Democrats. They've convinced us that political allegiance is superior to religious allegiance. Voting is a religion. They've persuaded us to believe that our ancestors sacrificed their lives for our right to vote. And they're quite adept at disguising their racism.



ESPN and social media wanted to make Buffalo Bills slot receiver Cole Beasley the face of the anti-vax movement. Beasley is white. He began tweeting his disapproval of COVID protocols months ago.

This week, Arizona receiver DeAndre Hopkins and Tampa running back Leonard Fournette added their public objections. Hopkins and Fournette are black. I knew it would just be a matter of time before black NFL players raised their hands and voices in objection to the COVID rules. We can't be cowards and sheep forever.

I don't have a position for or against the vaccine. Everyone should be allowed to make a personal decision that fits their situation. I'm against the government and the NFL forcing and/or pressuring individuals to consent to any medical procedure.

All the people allegedly concerned with saving vulnerable lives get real quiet when you bring up abortion. Keep that same quiet energy when it comes to the COVID vaccines.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/nfl-covid-protocols-vaccine-whitlock,2021-07-24
"Horowitz: For the first time in our lives, free speech is about to be criminalized","""Our First Amendment freedoms give us the right to think what we like and say what we please. And if we the people are to govern ourselves, we must have these rights, even if they are misused by a minority."" ~James Madison

We never thought this day would arrive in America. Last year, we learned that they can shout ""COVID"" as an emergency, and our life, liberty, and property disappear. They can shout ""racism,"" and our inalienable right to self-defense disappears. The last thing we had was the freedom to criticize what is happening, even if there was nothing we can do about it. Now they can shout ""right-wing terrorism"" or ""right-wing conspiracy"" and say that freedom of speech no longer applies.

Leftists in this country claim that their violence is speech and our speech is violence. That is why they glorified riots last year that burned down numerous cities, caused thousands of injuries, cost billions of dollars, and elevated their cause as the most urgent grievance in need of redress. At the same time, they are pushing to criminalize not just the violent acts and actors at the Capitol on January 6, but any view or speech or assembly predicated on views that are held by those people. This is why they seem to be taking direct shots at the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech for Americans, even as they plan to grant amnesty to those whose entire presence in this country is illegal.

As everyone focuses on the corporate world violating the spirit of the First Amendment by excommunicating anyone with conservative views, watch carefully how the governmental actors are coming very close to violating the letter of the First Amendment with the force of the ""law"" behind it. Big tech might have a monopoly on the internet and communications, but government has a monopoly on violence, law, and the ability to restrain our liberty. If we don't wake up immediately, our speech and freedom to assemble will be not only censored, but criminalized.

It started on January 6, when Tom Edsall published a column in the New York Times noting, ""A debate has broken out over whether the once-sacrosanct constitutional protection of the First Amendment has become a threat to democracy."" This is a tried and tested tactic of the Left – to have their columnists float a radical idea as a ""debate,"" while their governmental actors begin working on it in earnest.

Just take stock of what we are seeing out in the open. They are now arresting people all over the country for merely being in the Capitol, even if they didn't engage in violence, vandalism, or theft. Had this standard been applied to Black Lives Matter, there would literally have been millions of arrests. So no, this is not just about punishing those who acted violently. The FBI is placing signs all over the country asking people to report those who were at the Capitol, something that never happened even in the most deadly BLM/Antifa riots last year, or at Trump's inauguration four years ago in D.C.

They are militarizing D.C. with 20,000 troops, when the threat of violence against Trump's inaugural guests four years ago was exponentially greater. They are declaring emergencies in states as remote as New Mexico with no evidence of violence present. Garrett Soldano, a leader in the anti-lockdown movement in Michigan, claims the FBI paid him a two-hour visit because a local called the FBI and claimed he is a violent extremist.



If the FBI had done this when hundreds of cities were on fire for days on end with no control among local police departments, I would just feel they are being overly cautious. Given that BLM was promoted as the leader of our civic discourse and we are all being treated like terrorists, however, we should be very scared they are coming for the First Amendment, not for national security. Remember, the Justice Department seems to believe this was a planned attack. So the hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters who just came there to express their views had no idea that a few bad actors were planning this. The fact that they are hunting down anyone and everyone should scare us all.

Last week, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said emphatically that the First Amendment doesn't apply to sentiments he disagrees with. ""This idea that saying that Pennsylvania was 'rigged' or that we were 'trying to steal the election' — that's a lie. And you do not have the right, that is not protected speech.""



Thus, from now on, Democrats can unilaterally change election law in middle of an election – up until and including abolishing Election Day in favor of mail-in ballots – and anyone who criticizes it or organizes a rally against it is subject to prosecution? These comments would be comical if they didn't coincide with actions taken by his party coming into power in Washington that look a lot like martial law.

In other words, if you watch the language the Left is using about our speech and the actions the Biden administration and the governors are taking, it's quite evident that Big Tech is not the only thing we have to worry about. If nothing changes, I predict that even if Parler is able to become completely independent in the private market, the government, which has the ultimate monopoly on power, will shut it down.

Last week, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the same man who is prosecuting business owners and threatening them with labor camps for earning a living, said on a conference call with prosecutors that he is investigating those from his state who merely attended the rally.



Already in 2019, Richard Stengel, the Biden transition ""team lead"" for the U.S. Agency for Global Media, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the First Amendment needs curtailment. ""All speech is not equal. And where truth cannot drive out lies, we must add new guardrails. I'm all for protecting 'thought that we hate,' but not speech that incites hate,"" wrote Stengal.

This is pretty bizarre coming from a side of politics that already controls 99% of all speech and big business that controls speech. What exactly are they afraid of? If anything, we are the ones who should be scared of their speech, given the monopoly they hold.

Well, George Washington already warned us about the motivations of those who clamp down on speech. ""For if Men are to be precluded from offering their Sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences, that can invite the consideration of Mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of Speech may be taken away, and, dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter,"" said Washington in an address to the Continental Army on March 15, 1783.

The question facing patriots in the coming days is quite simply this: Will we allow that final domino to fall?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-for-the-first-time-in-our-lives-free-speech-is-about-to-be-criminalized,2021-01-18
"Horowitz: NYC officials target Jewish business owner for COVID citation, while Biden supporters hold wild parties","There's election fraud, but then there's also governing fraud. Even if one legitimately wins an election, he cannot do whatever he wants to the citizenry. We live in a republic where the government is constrained by rules and cannot indiscriminately violate civil liberties. Yet that appears to have gone out the window in New York City, as Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio target Jewish-owned businesses.

You would think they'd be busy with the gang warfare in the city streets or the beatings in the subways, but a New York City sheriff's deputy was seen harassing a woman who owns a pottery shop in Brooklyn for supposed COVID violations. Yesterday, the local city councilman posted the video of the encounter with the following message:

Numerous videos have surfaced on the internet in recent days showing Jewish business owners and schools in Cuomo's ""red zone"" of ""certain zip codes"" Brooklyn being harassed by law enforcement and accused, often wrongly, of violating his latest arbitrary edict.



Perhaps there is something more insidious about the targeting of those zip codes:

The problem with those business owners is that they are not throwing Biden celebration parties with marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs. That would be lauded as the highest form of democratic expression.





Folks, this is the governing fraud on display before your eyes. In some ways, this is a more dangerous form of cheating than even dead people voting. In a constitutional republic, we shouldn't have to worry about our lives being at stake based on the results of an election, even if one side cheats to achieve their electoral win. Now we all have to fear this sort of sickening double standard on civil liberties in Kamala Harris' America. This is an America where criminal is victim, illegal alien is citizen, man is woman, income is welfare, and welfare is income. This is not a part of the sacred document that was signed in 1787.



We are not the ones who badly want our guy in the Oval Office as much as the other side wants their man. We think most decisions should be up to local authority and that certain policies are off-limits and out of constitutional bounds. It is the other side that seeks to dominate us by shutting down our houses of worship, schools, businesses, and even our own mouths and noses.

Meanwhile, as government does everything that it is constitutionally prohibited from doing, it refuses to protect us from criminals. My entire neighborhood in Baltimore County is being ravaged by carjackers, as criminals have become emboldened by the anti-prison stance of the Democrat Party. Now that they know prison is only reserved for someone opening a business or not wearing a mask, they feel they can terrorize neighborhoods with impunity because, after all, they are usually wearing masks when committing their dastardly deeds.



Folks, this is about a lot more than just election fraud. It's about governing fraud that makes King George look like James Madison. Indeed, the great revolution was fought over much less. The tyranny under King George wasn't that bad precisely because the Patriots didn't let the usurpations deteriorate to the point of debilitating their ability to militate against them. As John Adams so presciently warned in 1774, ""Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is the only maxim which can ever preserve the liberties of any people."" Sadly, we've allowed those buds of tyranny to blossom ever so strongly. The question for us: Is it too late?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-nyc-officials-target-jewish-business-owner-for-covid-citation-while-biden-supporters-hold-wild-parties,2020-11-09
Horowitz: Republicans should trap Biden with legislation instituting tough sentencing on gun felons,"Democrats are terrified that they are now trapped between their radical Twitter/woke base that doesn't believe in incarceration and the general public (including many Democrat voters) who want violent criminals locked up. Crime is one of the most potent political issues, and the GOP of the early 1990s would have annihilated the Democrats on this issue by forcing them to oppose tougher sentences in what would become a political bloodbath akin to Hannibal trapping the Romans at the Battle of Cannae. However, if Republicans don't kick their own addiction to the Koch-funded de-incarceration agenda, they will allow Biden to tactically retreat from the morass.

Sensing peril ahead with skyrocketing crime in almost every large and mid-sized city, Biden announced a major anti-crime agenda on Wednesday. Except, for the first time in history, the agenda had nothing to do with locking up criminals.

Notice what is absent from his agenda? Any proposal to lock up the thousands of gun felons who continuously terrorize the streets and are released despite violating their parole by illegally possessing a gun. The New York Times observes how Biden and the Democrats are realizing that defunding the police is a losing issue, which is why Biden is backing off the war on cops while simultaneously trying to direct the angst against criminals into the black hole of gun control.



Republicans, for their part, continue to talk about the need to fund the police. But they don't realize that Democrats have no problem throwing more funding at everything under the sun, including the police. Under current policies, there's no value to funding the police if everyone they arrest will be turned loose by leftist judges and, in some places, even the prosecutors. Which is why, rather than simply focusing on the cheap talking point of funding the police, thereby allowing Biden to co-opt the issue, Republicans should renounce their own support for de-incarceration and force Biden to take a stand on the issue of locking up gun felons.

Republicans should introduce legislation in Congress with the following goals:

Increase mandatory sentencing for gun felons : If guns are so bad that we need red flag laws against those never convicted of a crime, why not increase sentencing on those convicted of assaulting people with a gun or possessing a gun after having been convicted of a violent felony?

: If guns are so bad that we need red flag laws against those never convicted of a crime, why not increase sentencing on those convicted of assaulting people with a gun or possessing a gun after having been convicted of a violent felony? Actually make the mandatory minimums mandatory : Homicide in this country plummeted by over 60 percent precisely over the same period that gun ownership soared. Why? Thanks to Reagan's Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), we actually deterred violent criminals with stiff mandatory sentencing. Yet for all the hand-wringing over ""draconian"" mandatory sentences, they were only mandatory from 1987 to 2005. Following the Booker decision of the Supreme Court, they have been merely advisory. This has created a huge amount of disparity in the system, and in recent years, the lack of mandatory sentencing has decreased the successes of the Reagan-era laws. Take bad guys who use guns (or other weapons) off the streets, not guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.

Take bad guys who use guns (or other weapons) off the streets, not guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. Fix court loophole allowing violent felons back on the streets : Six years ago, in Johnson v. U.S, the Supreme Court ruled that the ""crime of violence"" provision in theACCA is unconstitutionally vague. That has allowed thousands of the worst career gun felons and other violent individuals to get out of jail early or escape reasonable sentencing to begin with. In 2019, in S. v. Davis, Justice Gorsuch joined with the four liberals in expanding the assault on the ACCA, this time by saying that 924(c)(3), the statute that prohibits using or carrying a firearm during a federal ""crime of violence,"" is unconstitutional and therefore vetoed out of existence. Now, armed robbers pointing short-barreled shotguns at store clerks avoid tougher sentencing at the same time liberals claim they want to ""do something!"" about gun violence. Just this past month, the Supreme Court punched another loophole the size of a truck through the ACCA (in Borden v. United States), allowing those already convicted of three violent felonies to escape the 15-year mandatory if subsequently convicted a fourth time for reckless assault and reckless homicide. Kavanaugh, in his dissent, warned that this opinion will result in ""serial violent felons who unlawfully possess firearms"" who would ""otherwise [be] subject to ACCA"" leaving prison ""much earlier than Congress dictated, or avoid ACCA altogether."" Whether one agrees with these court opinions or not, why would a Congress supposedly concerned about gun violence not want to fix these statutory loopholes created by the courts?

Whether one agrees with these court opinions or not, why would a Congress supposedly concerned about gun violence not want to fix these statutory loopholes created by the courts? Limit bail for those charged with gun crimes: So many of the gun crimes in this country are committed by repeat gun felons out on bail pending their next trial. Rather than abolishing bail, how about raising the thresholds for releasing those with prior gun convictions?

Moreover, Republicans in control of every red state should push similar laws at a state level. Recently, Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson suggested that violent crime is going to skyrocket and get worse. ""There's nothing,"" said Jackson, ""that's going to bring this down in the near future."" Nonsense. Ohio's crime problem is being driven by gun felons, particularly juveniles. Getting tough both on gun felons and juveniles would reverse the homicide and carjacking rates very quickly. It's with policies supported by Mayor Jackson and other leftists that crime will increase indefinitely.

In addition, GOP governors should do the following:

Create a searchable database of all violent crime cases where the public can search the disposition of the case by judge, prosecutor, and crime category to see who is being let out on bail and who is being granted light sentences. Biden called on states to use COVID funding to fight crime, so they can use those funds to create such a database.

Convene a commission for victims of crime to audit all the ways violent criminals escape justice and how those loopholes can be plugged.

Pass anti-gang legislation creating tough mandatories on juveniles committing crimes in furtherance of gang activity and making it easier to prosecute them across county lines. Most gun violence stems from gang violence. To attack the gun and ignore the gang is like spitting in the wind.

We all know why crime is increasing. According to this Vera report, theU.S. prison population dropped by over 240,000 persons, a little more than 17%, from 2019 to the spring of 2021. That comes after several years of prior declines in most states. The federal prison population, which is largely composed of hardened career criminals, has dropped 29% since 2013. And this is while the general population is growing.

Let's face it, the reason so many Republicans refuse to push tougher sentencing is because they are scared of ""locking up more black folks."" But the reality is that, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of 2019, the combined state and federal prison imprisonment rate was the lowest it's been since 1995. What's more, the imprisonment rate of black residents was the lowest rate in 30 years, since 1989. And that was all before the insane drop precipitated by COVID policies that led to a 17% decline overall in incarceration since after the study period of the BJS report.

No wonder we are experiencing record crime levels. Are we going to celebrate releasing black criminals (among others) or keeping law-abiding black citizens safe like we did in the 1990s?

Just consider the results of this mass prison release, along with the war on cops. In Milwaukee, from 2014 to 2020, 79% of all murder victims were black. Last year, Milwaukee broke the record for homicide, and this year it is on pace for another record. Guess what? So far this year, 91% of all homicide victims were black! That means almost all the excess homicide victims, crimes that were driven by the obsession with keeping black criminals out of prison, were black.

In Philadelphia, the number of murders has increased by 78% from 2015 to 2020. Meanwhile, the jail population has decreased by 43%. Again, we can either celebrate that black criminals are out of jail or we can lament how black residents, increasingly young children, are being gunned down in record numbers. Homicides in 2021 are already outpacing the record set last year. So far, 85% of all homicide victims were black, even though black people compose less than 45% of the city's total population.



At this point, the only thing gun control will accomplish is preventing law-abiding citizens from defending themselves against the gun felons these politicians release. Ultimately, the question Democrats need to be asked is: Do they truly hate guns more than they love keeping gun felons out of prison? Unfortunately, with Republicans signing on to ""criminal justice reform"" since crime started going up in 2015, Democrats have never felt compelled to answer that question.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-republicans-should-trap-biden-with-legislation-instituting-tough-sentencing-on-gun-felons,2021-06-25
Whitlock: I stand by my comparison of BLM to the KKK — no matter who might object,"Wednesday evening, during an appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program, I analogized Black Lives Matter to the Ku Klux Klan.

It's a provocative and jarring analogy. It's a comparison I truly believe.

Friday morning, a reporter from my hometown paper, the Indianapolis Star, contacted me asking for clarification of my analogy. I told the reporter that I would respond in writing via email because I felt it was the best way to ensure that I thoughtfully addressed the inquiry.

A few hours later, the Indianapolis Star published a fair story relaying my thoughts. Here's a link to the Star story. The Star, even when I was a high school athlete 35 years ago, has always treated me fairly.

However, I believe publishing my full response to the Star is the most effective way to defend my analogy. Here's what I wrote to the Star reporter:

The Ku Klux Klan was founded on Christmas Eve 1865 by Confederate soldiers dedicated to undermining the racial progress sparked by the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation. ""The KKK engaged in terrorist raids against African Americans and white Republicans at night, employing intimidation, destruction of property, assault, and murder to achieve its aims and influence upcoming elections,"" according to History.com. Here's a link to a summation of the KKK's history.



Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests have primarily terrorized and destroyed property in black communities at night. BLM and Antifa have attempted to intimidate white Republicans. BLM protests have been violent and caused the assassination of law enforcement officers and other citizens. BLM is a cleverly marketed slogan that provides cover for extremists to undermine racial progress and bully American citizens to support Democrat politicians. It's not a coincidence that BLM riots pick up during an election cycle and disappear after the votes have been counted.



My analogy is not far fetched or hard to comprehend, particularly for the mainstream media. My analogy is far more substantive and accurate than pretending the events at the Capitol on January 6 were an armed insurrection analogous to Pearl Harbor and 9/11. BLM, founded by self-described trained Marxists, has a stated goal of disrupting Western Civilization traditions and values. Despite the sweet-sounding name, BLM acts as a racial divider — no different from the KKK.

It's my belief that the KKK and BLM share the same intent. They use race, intimidation, violence, and property destruction to achieve political goals on behalf of the Democratic Party.

Cultural changes and technological advances explain the difference in tactics between the KKK of old and its modern-day successor, BLM. Burning buildings have replaced burning crosses. Social media lynch mobs destroy a person's character, strike fear, and silence dissent.

In the KKK's heyday, a black man could have his life destroyed for making eye contact with a white woman. In BLM's heyday, a black man can have his life destroyed for expressing an opinion that contradicts the ideology of white liberals.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/whitlock-i-stand-by-my-comparison-of-blm-to-the-kkk--no-matter-who-might-object,2021-01-22
'Have we heard from Colin Kaepernick or LeBron James?': Jason Whitlock CALLS OUT 'super elites' for Nats Park shooting hypocrisy,"In response to the shooting outside the Washington Nationals ballpark Saturday night, ""Fearless"" host Jason Whitlock explained his position on guns and gang violence and called out ""multimillionaire social activist athletes"" such as LeBron James or Colin Kaepernick, who have failed to publicly denounce the destructive force of America's gang culture.



""I've never liked guns. I still don't,"" Whitlock began. ""But the last decade has helped me understand their value in a free society. A decade ago, I took American freedom for granted. I thought the people who argued that the political left would strip Americans of basic freedoms, I thought they were crazy. Now, I don't think they're crazy.

""The gatekeepers of American culture, the super elites who live in gated communities and employ private security teams, have purposely created a culture that bows to violent gang culture. Look at the reaction to what happened at Washington Nationals ballpark. A fan who left the game to catch an Uber was one of the victims. Gang violence directly impacted the sports world. Are the multimillionaire social activist athletes loudly decrying what happened? Have we heard from Colin Kaepernick or LeBron James? Has Jemele Hill tweeted a word?"" Whitlock asked.

He also called out ""left-wing gatekeepers"" in Hollywood for the ""glorification of gang culture"" through movies and music.

""American culture is in crisis. We've legalized a lethal dose of immorality, dishonesty, and idolatry. Our code of conduct is driven by popularity, profit, and fear,"" he wrote in an op-ed on TheBlaze. ""It's safer to demonize guns than gangs. Guns don't pull triggers. Gangs do.""

Nikki Haley: Here's the ONE Trump victory Biden CAN'T erase,"President Joe Biden spent his first 100 days in office reversing and erasing as many of former President Donald Trump's policies as he could, and Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, believes that was a ""terrible mistake.""

On the ""Glenn Beck Podcast"" this week, Haley joined Glenn to discuss President Biden's ""Trump reversals"" and pointed out the one Trump victory that Biden can't erase — and the proof is playing out right now.

""He just reversed everything,"" Haley said of Biden. ""But the part that he can't erase, and it's really a point of pride, I think, is the Abraham Accords, because this was an amazing thing. Many presidents before Trump had said that the only way to get peace in the Middle East was through the Palestinians. The president went to his first foreign policy speech, it was to the Arab Summit, and he said, 'I want us to unite against terrorism,"" meaning, translation, I want us to unite against Iran. He got the attention of the Arab countries. Then he started to acknowledge truths: Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. We're going to have Israel's back. This is what Israel can do for you,"" she continued.

""I had a meeting, I and the British ambassador had a meeting with the Saudi and the Emirati ambassador, and they were complaining, you know, 'Why doesn't anybody call out the Houthis for the terrorist organization that they are? Why are they always hitting us?' And I stopped them and I said, 'You know, I could make the same case for Hamas and Israel.' We went on with the meeting, and they pulled me aside afterwards, and they said, 'We know you're right.' So I asked, 'Why do you hit Israel the way you do?' The Emirati said, 'We do it because we have to for our constituencies,' and I said, 'At some point you're going to have to have the courage to tell your constituencies the truth.' You fast-forward to the Abraham Accords, and that was the Emiratis having the courage to tell their constituencies the truth,"" Haley explained.

WATCH: Jan. 6 FALLOUT: Biden's Domestic Terrorism Threat Is YOU,"The Capitol riot was foolish and tragic, but Nancy Pelosi's select committee ""investigation"" on the January 6 ""insurrection"" has devolved into a show trial complete with bad tears and bad acting. But this is just a charade designed to distract us.

What's going on behind closed doors is truly nefarious. The Biden White House and the U.S. national security apparatus are seizing that event to redefine domestic terrorism and expand the powers of government to prevent it. There is an alarming blueprint for sweeping government action called the ""National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism,"" put together by the National Security Council.

On his Wednesday night special this week, Glenn Beck exposes the collusion between the Biden administration and Big Tech to surveil, root out, and silence America's deplorables – all in the name of national security.

The New War on Terror: Innocent Until Proven Conservative,"The Left is gearing up to label anyone and everyone who doesn't bend the knee to their radical ideas as a threat to the nation, and they're using the January 6th Capitol riot to do so. That's when ""innocent until proven conservative"" started, and the Democrats' new 9/11-style January 6th Commission will solidify it.

Since the Capitol riot, the Biden administration has shown little transparency while arresting and intimidating hundreds and insisting that ""right-wing terror"" is on the rise. But is there ANY evidence to back up what the government is now doing to its own citizens?

On this week's Glenn TV special, Glenn Beck asks the questions that the corporate media won't and lays out why this may only be the beginning as private companies prepare to help the government spy on YOU. And Sen. Rand Paul joins to detail how Republicans in Congress are standing against the Democrats' new Jan. 6th Commission.

On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Glenn Beck looks back 20 years ago to the modern generation's Pearl Harbor moment. A day of infamy we're STILL feeling repercussions from.

But in remembering 9/11, we need to look toward the future because the Biden administration is setting us up for the NEXT 9/11. They bungled the Afghanistan withdrawal, and now we have video of top al Qaeda commanders — who served with Osama bin Laden — returning to the country. But could America survive another terror attack?

Glenn asks former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the leader who brought America back from the brink. He tells Glenn about the moment he learned the Twin Towers were struck, the actions he took to prevent more terrorism, and if he thinks NYC could survive another attack under Mayor de Blasio's leadership.

Glenn is also joined by Rev. Johnnie Moore, author of ""The Next Jihad."" He warns that Biden's policies in the Middle East are Obama 2.0, and ""if you thought ISIS was bad, you haven't seen anything yet. We must keep our eyes on Iran.""

Small Business Criminals: COVID Tyranny Rises AGAIN,"If you thought the worst of the pandemic was over, think again. With the surge of the Delta variant comes a surge of the other virus that devastated America last year: government tyranny.

The Left is demanding more masks. More vaccine mandates. More lockdowns. But if you don't comply, you're considered dangerous. The Department of Homeland Security issued a new terrorism warning for extremists who disagree with ""potential re-establishment of public health restrictions across the United States."" Never mind the actual terrorists that President Joe Biden just allowed to retake Afghanistan and seize billions of dollars' worth of U.S. military equipment. The real threat is all those pesky American citizens who are fed up with the government trampling on their rights and on the very thing that made America what it is: our entrepreneurial spirit.

Tonight on ""Glenn TV,"" Glenn Beck heads to ground zero in the battle against government control — California — where small business owners aren't just fighting fines and regulations, they're fighting possible jail time.

Glenn asks why they continue to hold the line for freedom almost two years into the pandemic. But they're not alone. Thousands of small businesses around the country now have to make that same decision: Will they return to living in a state of fear, where no matter whether they obey or step out of line, it's game over? Or will they say, ""We will not comply"" — before it's too late?

Crowder opens up about the time he learned he was on an ISIS kill list,"In this clip, Steven Crowder sat down with comedians Nick Di Paolo and Dave Landau and discussed the death threats and terrorist threats they received over the years.

Di Paolo recalled when a threat was made on his life while he was on his way to perform stand-up in Las Vegas.

""I was on the phone with the FBI and we had to make the hotel aware ... It was scary,"" he said.

Crowder recalled when the local police showed up at his house to inform him that his address, his wife's work address, and the driving route from home to his wife's place of work had been exposed to the public on YouTube.

The police became aware of the situation when a fan from London noticed an address posted in the comment section under one of Crowder's YouTube videos and decided to cross-reference the zip code to see who lived there. The fan realized the address was legitimate and contacted the local police. Crowder later learned he was on an ISIS kill list and a terrorist posted the address.

Pat Gray: Could Biden have been any more wrong?,"Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, fell to the Taliban over the weekend as the U.S. military pulled out of the region. On Monday's episode of ""Pat Gray Unleashed,"" Pat discussed the chaos and revisited President Biden's remarks made July 8 about Afghanistan.

During a news conference, a reporter asked Biden if a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was ""inevitable"" in the absence of the U.S. military. Biden answered the reporter with a confident ""no.""

""No, it is not [inevitable],"" Biden said. Biden stated that a Taliban takeover was not inevitable because the Afghan army had 300,000 well-equipped troops while the Taliban only had roughly 75,000.

""I mean, could he have been any more wrong?"" Pat asked rhetorically

Police charge a black woman posing as a member of the KKK with making terroristic threats,"A Georgia neighborhood was terrorized by a person claiming to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

On today's episode of ""Pat Gray Unleashed,"" Pat discussed what, according to the Douglasville Police Department, was a case that involved residents of a neighborhood in Douglasville, Georgia, receiving notes last December from a person who claimed to be a ""white male member of the Ku Klux Klan."" Reports stated that the letters threatened to ""burn down homes and kill people.""

The police investigation led to Terresha Lucas, a 30-year-old black woman, who has since been charged with making terroristic threats.

Detectives are reported to have gone door to door with flyers and checking doorbell cameras, which led to enough evidence to obtain a search warrant for Lucas.

Pat noted that in an age with doorbell cameras, ""you're going to get caught."" He went on to share multiple recent examples of race-hate hoaxes and he raised the question on everyone's mind: Why are they doing this?

"Allie Beth Stuckey CRUSHES Washington Post after they cry about 'Let's Go, Brandon'","The reason every profanity and threat toward President Donald Trump was applauded by the same people who are now having a breakdown over ""let's go Brandon"" is not hypocrisy. Same goes for anything they criticize or defend — protesting, violence, critical reporting, legislation. When it's their side, it's ""truth to power."" When it's the other side, it's ""authoritarianism"" and ""terrorism."" It's not hypocrisy, it's intentional and tactical, BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey argued on a recent episode of ""Relatable.""

Allie noted a recent article in The Washington Post lamenting the ""increasingly vulgar taunts"" Trump supporters are supposedly hurling at President Joe Biden.

""[I]t's clear that after nine months in office, Biden — or at least what he represents — is increasingly becoming an object of hatred to many Trump supporters,"" the Washington Post article claimed.

""The current eruption of anti-Biden signs and chants, however, is on another level, far more vulgar and widespread,"" the article added, going on to bemoan a ""proliferation of chants in recent weeks, both of 'Let's go Brandon!' — now used as a stand-in by the Trump faithful — and the more vulgar original, sometimes shorthanded as 'FJB'.""

Allie noted that the authors fail to talk about why people might be angry or upset with the current president, and instead focus on ""Trump supporters"" and 'the Trump faithful.""

""[The authors] leave the impression that the only reason people could be mad at Joe Biden is 'because Trump.' It's always still 'because Trump'. These people are obsessed with Trump,"" Allie stated.

""This is not really hypocrisy. This is what these journalists and activists do, they actually apply these principles consistently,"" she argued. ""It's okay to harm and harass people that you don't like. It is not okay to harm or harass or even criticize people that you do like ... you are not allowed to disagree with the people they hoist up as political heroes. That's the rule.""

Are you praying for Biden,"Here's a question, how many of you pray for Joe Biden? For all the Christians out there, the Bible tells us to pray for our leaders. Is it time to go from keyboard warriors to prayer warriors?

BlazeTV's Chad Prather encouraged his audience to adopt a new attitude toward the federal government. ""How many of you pray for Joe Biden? The bible tells you to whether you agree with him or not,"" Chad said.

Romans 13:1 tells us that ""authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.""

""For years we have believed in the divine providence of God in America,"" Chad explained, adding that ""the government became so big, we thumb our nose at divine providence and take our country into our own hands.

Chad concluded that since God is the one who puts authority over us, if we want authority, we have to learn how to live under authority.

"'We would've loved a military stand down order at Fort Hood back in 2009"": Jason Buttrill joins Chad Prather","Jason Buttrill, Glenn Beck's writer and chief researcher, joined the ""Chad Prather Show"" last week and discussed what a military stand-down order is and whether or not the current 60-day stand-down order is justified in the context of the events that unfolded on Jan. 6.

Jason, a Marine Corps veteran, recalled the usage of stand-down orders applying in a situation like when a military vehicle needed to be serviced. He explained that a stand-down order would be issued and the team would take a few days and repair the vehicles.

""It's like when your car is recalled and needs to be serviced,"" Jason explained.

According to Jason, the Department of Homeland Security justified bringing in the equivalent of two military divisions to safeguard the inauguration with ""online chatter"" as the reason.

On Feb. 4, a 60-day military stand down was issued, ordering military leaders to spend time talking to troops in an effort to ""weed out extremism in their ranks."" The decision was made after a number of military members were implicated as having participated in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

""We would have loved a military stand-down order at Fort Hood back in 2009,"" Jason said, referring to the tragic day Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan admitted to shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (God is great) just before opening fire and killing 13 unarmed Americans.

""They didn't even want to call [the Fort Hood shooting] terrorism. They wanted to call it workplace violence,"" Jason said.

'The fall of Kabul should be the DOWNFALL of the Biden administration' — CHAD PRATHER,"In the wake of the United States pulling troops out of Afghanistan, the progressive Left in the United States appeared more concerned about preferred pronouns and the Green New Deal than the reality of what had transpired in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city.

In this clip, BlazeTV's Chad Prather asserted what he believed the people of Kabul will face now with the Taliban in control: murder, rape, and death.

On Monday's episode of ""The Chad Prather Show,"" Chad explained why he believed the fall of Kabul should be the ""downfall"" of the Biden administration.

""We [Americans] have no concept of how the rest of the world operates,"" Chad said. He later added that the rest of the world doesn't care about equality but rather who is in control.

Chad savagely dismantled the Biden administration's foreign policy and went on to say that American culture had become weak.

'Who are those idiots?' Bill O'Reilly reacts to STUNNING claims that 'right-wing' groups are bigger threat than THE TALIBAN,"Bill O'Reilly joined ""The Glenn Beck Program"" Friday to discuss a recent House Homeland Security Committee briefing on the impact of the 9/11 terror attacks, during which ""national security experts"" claimed ""right-wing"" groups pose a greater threat to the United States than groups like the Taliban or Al-Qaeda.

Glenn played two video clips from the briefing that showed Senior Fellow Brookings Institute Center for Middle East Policy, Daniel Byman, and former National Intelligence Council Chair during the Obama administration, Christopher Kojm, in apparent agreement that ""right-wing extremists"" are a bigger threat to Americans today than ""jihadists.""

""I'm someone who has written extensively on both jihadist groups, but also right-wing, white supremacist groups,"" Byman says in the first video clip. ""And in my mind, there's no question that today in the United States, the right-wing and white supremacist violence is a much greater risk.""

""I agree with your assessment and those of my colleagues who have spoken already, there's little doubt that the domestic terrorist threat from white nationalists and right-wing extremist groups is greater than the jihadist threat today,"" Kojm states in the second clip.

""Who are those idiots?"" O'Reilly exclaimed. ""It's just unbelievable ... they're not even in the same universe. Yeah, there are bad neo-Nazi Americans running around, yeah, but there are very few of them. I mean, the jihadists are causing death and destruction, death and destruction all over the world. Not just in the United States. These people are so blatantly irresponsible and ignorant, it's just staggering.""

"DHS sounds terrorism alert over ""mis, dis, mal-information""","The Department of Homeland Security has released a new terrorism advisory bulletin, and ""it's bone-chilling,"" Glenn Beck said on the radio program Wednesday.

The DHS has been warning for over a year now that ""false narratives"" could fuel ""some"" people to possibly commit violence. But now, it's warning that ""mis, dis, and mal-information"" online is the real threat. So, which online voices will Biden's DHS decide are spreading ""misinformation"": Joe Rogan? Ben Shapiro? Glenn?

""I would agree [with the DHS] if we were talking about, oh, I don't know, Antifa. If we were talking about people who were burning the streets down. But we're not really talking about those people. In fact, we're not really talking about the people who might be encouraged to go for violence. No. What we're really talking about, are the actors that are using 'mis, dis, and mal-information online' that 'seek to exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions',"" Glenn said of the advisory bulletin.



""Joe Rogan, I hope you're listening. Ben Shapiro, I hope you read that. I know TheBlaze did, and I would like to know, are we one of those websites? It goes on to say that they are working with public/private partnerships that can analyze the online content, and social media [content] to be able to identify these actors that are spreading false narratives. Well, I know that our mainstream media, and also the social media giants have already made TheBlaze a target of misinformation ... all of which we have won when we go to fight it. We win, every single time, but that hasn't stopped them from claiming that we are purveyors of mis or disinformation,"" he continued.

""Just a warning shot, I'm telling you now, burn important information to disk ... because they are like a drowning man. And they are pushing anyone underwater,"" Glenn went on to add. ""The reason why I say, they are drowning ... look at the ratings, online, if you will. You look to the ratings of this program — on line, on radio, on Pluto, on Roku, all of the different ways that we are distributed now — and the footprint is enormous. Enormous. Joe Rogan's footprint, just on Spotify is 11 million. When you look at Tucker Carlson — remember how much they hate Tucker Carlson — he has 3 million a night. Anderson Cooper has 500,000. Okay? It's over for the mainstream media. And they know it.""

Congressman: We have EVIDENCE that White House initiated 'excuse' for FBI crackdown on anti-CRT parents,"A shocking new report by The Daily Wire reveals that the furious father whose arrest at a school board meeting likely sparked the call for the FBI to investigate anti-CRT parents like domestic terrorists was furious for good reasons: The Loudoun County School Board allegedly tried to cover up his daughter's rape.

Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to discuss the incident and explain why he joined 60 lawmakers in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding answers for why the FBI is targeting parents.

""We want to know ... what kind of coordination took place between the White House, activist groups and teachers unions, and the Department of Justice,"" Stewart told Glenn. ""Because we have evidence that there was [coordination] and, in fact, that the White House are the ones who initiated this. They asked for these activist groups to write this inflammatory letter to the Department of Justice saying they were 'intimidated' and that they 'felt threatened', giving the Department of Justice Attorney General Garland, the excuse to say, 'Okay, well, we have to respond'.""

Stewart went on to say he believes the federal government would only involve the FBI in such an issue if its purpose is to silence and intimidate parents concerned about the ""poison"" being taught to their kids in school. So, what can he and the other representatives who disagree with the Biden administration's overreach of power do to stop it?

Glenn Beck: These 3 ingredients for a social credit system are ALREADY HERE,"David Sacks, Founding COO of PayPal, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program to reveal the three ingredients needed to implement a social credit system that are already well established in the United States.

Sacks also explained how his alma mater — PayPal — has already partnered with left-wing groups that blacklist Americans believed to have ""extreme views"" and how there are other financial institutions who are following suit.

""If you think it's bad to deny people the right to free speech and to participate in the online marketplace of ideas, how much worse is it to deny them access in the new economy, to the way that they can buy food and medicine and other products for their families ... it is really a very severe form of punishment and social control,"" Sacks began.

""Let's identify the elements, the ingredients of this toxic stew that already exist [in America.] First of all, you've got Big Tech companies like my alma mater, PayPal, that have been freezing accounts based on working with partisan political groups to shut people out of the financial system. That practice is already taking place,"" he said.

""Second, you've got state of emergency. In states like California where I live, the governor is still operating under a state of emergency. He has invoked emergency powers that never seem to end, even though we just had a Super Bowl where 30, 000 people were sitting elbow to elbow without any mask on, and yet we're still in a state of emergency.

""Third ... the Department of Homeland Security has now defined 'misinformation' about COVID or the election to be a contributor to the terrorist threat levels. In other words, misinformation in their view contributes to terrorism,"" Sacks continued. ""So, we have now all the ingredients … politicians invoking fake state of emergencies. You've got big tech companies shutting people out through the political system, and you've got this very scary and dangerous redefinition of terrorism to effectively apply to domestic political descent.""

"AP warns of pro-life protests, ignores attacks by Jane's Revenge","The Associated Press has issued a dire warning for abortion providers ahead of the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade.

According to an article titled ""'Heightened alert’: Abortion providers brace for ruling,"" abortion clinics nationwide are expecting an increase in ""protests, harassment, and other violence ... in states where abortion remains legal"" if Roe v. Wade is overturned — as a draft opinion leaked in May suggested is likely to happen.

""On the night of last winter’s arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that could end the nationwide right to abortion, people gathered outside a clinic in New Jersey with lawn chairs, a cooler and a flaming torch — a sight that brought to mind lynchings and other horrors of the country’s racist past,"" the AP article began.

The article did go on to cite two incidents of extreme anti-abortion violence — ""the 1993 killing of Dr. David Gunn outside a Florida abortion clinic [and] the 2015 fatal shooting of three people inside a Colorado Planned Parenthood."" But there was almost no mention of the ongoing attacks on pregnancy crisis centers by pro-choice activists, including the violent group that calls itself ""Jane’s Revenge.""

On the radio program, Glenn Beck noted that the closest the current administration has come to calling out Jane’s Revenge was when the Department of Homeland Security published a terror advisory warning of crime on both sides of the Roe v. Wade debate earlier this month. But when was the last time you heard about violent attacks on pro-life centers in the corporate media? There have been several instances of violence by pro-choice proponents, and the Biden administration remains silent.

'Enemies of this nation are baking a new American cake': Jason Whitlock on how we take our country back,"How does a sports writer know how to fix America, and America's racial dilemma?

In a special edition of the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program,"" Outkick sports columnist Jason Whitlock filled in Tuesday for Glenn to explain how we can bring America back together, lean into racial harmony, and restore the values of our Founding Fathers. Because if not us, then who will?

Jason started out by explaining how, during a recent appearance on the program, he felt a spiritual connection with Glenn, regardless of physical differences, as both share a common passion for God and country.

""Glenn and I share a kindred spirit. A kindred passion,"" Jason said. ""We have two things that we love and are passionate about: God and country. I am not a minister. I'm a flawed sinner just like Glenn and just like you. But I am a believer. Believers share an energy that connects them, that cuts through our physical differences and makes those differences irrelevant. That's what I felt when I met Glenn, an energy and a spirit that connects us. We are broadcasters, media personalities, operating in separate spaces, trying to talk to Americans, who share our passion.""

Jason went on to say that he believes there are forces operating, both outside of and inside America, that are working to separate America from God, and that much of what we've witnessed in 2020 — from the racial division stirred by the mainstream and social media, to the rioting and looting by Antifa and Black Lives Matter, to the ""remaking of the sports world into a shrine that celebrates resisting criminal suspects and denigrates this great country at every turn"" — are symptoms and consequences of America's enemies separating God and country.

""We are one nation under God. We are nothing without Him,"" Jason continued. ""The flawed sinners who founded this nation baked God into this country with their Declaration of Independence. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. That among those, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The foreign and domestic enemies of this nation are baking a new American cake. God isn't an essential ingredient in this new cake. He isn't an ingredient at all. The removal of faith is sewing the disharmony that is terrorizing and destroying the United States of America.

""Why am I here today? I'm here to tell you how we take our country back, how we restore the freedoms and the liberties our enemies seek to remove in their remaking of a godless America.""

Nigel Farage: 'DAMAGE that Biden has done to America's international reputation could NOT be greater',"The United States and Great Britain have enjoyed an alliance since World War I, but President Joe Biden's failure to coordinate his Afghanistan withdrawal with allies like the U.K. has devastated America's overseas reputation, argues Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.

Farage joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Monday with the latest on how America's diplomatic relations with its allies may look for the rest of Biden's presidency, and perhaps much further into the foreseeable future.

""You know, I've spent 40 years working for American companies and businesses, being allies, politically, with Donald Trump and many friends of the Republican Party. There's nobody this side of the pond who is more pro-American, more pro-respectful relationship than I am,"" Farage told Glenn. ""And it hurts me to say this, but for Biden to unconditionally withdraw from the military mission after 20 years, without any planning or any foresight as to how we get our nationals out in the case of a Taliban advance, and to do it without even consulting the British prime minister, and refusing to answer his phone call for almost 48 hours, sends a message to us. And the message is, we cannot trust America.

""Despite being our closest partner for over 100 years, we cannot trust America with this man in charge. And it's a sad realization, but it's true. And I think it's even further than the relationship with the UK and the USA. I think NATO, frankly, ceases to function. So the damage that Biden has done to America's international reputation could not be greater,"" he added.

Glenn and Farage also agreed that, while the corporate media accused former President Donald Trump of wrecking the NATO alliance, Nigel explained why it's Biden who has truly thrown that relationship into turmoil.

""The way the international mainstream media wanted to portray the Trump movement, just as they did with the Brexit movement, [was] 'Trump is going to destroy NATO.' No, no, no, what Trump did, he turned up at the NATO HQ of Brussels and said ... that we cannot go on with a NATO where major countries like Germany are only paying half the membership fee,"" Farage explained. ""The NATO rules are actually very fair. Regardless of the size of a country, you must spend 2% of GDP on defense. And the Germans were spending one [percent.]. So actually, in many ways, what Trump was doing was trying to make NATO fair. But it was willfully, willfully misportrayed.

""What Biden has done, is to say, 'Look, we're the big guys in NATO. But, hey, we just do stuff without consulting, despite the fact that you, too, have had many hundreds of people killed in Afghanistan, and put big money into Afghanistan. But without even the compliment of a conversation, we've decided that, effectively, the NATO mission is over.' So, yeah, the special relationship with Britain is completely in tatters. NATO, I'm not even sure it could possibly survive what it's just gone through,"" he continued.

""And, of course, when you look at those photographs today, of Taliban soldiers now dressed in American military equipment with $85 billion worth of U.S. military hardware now in the hands of these people, with the giant lithium reserves that exist in Afghanistan now completely open to exploitation with Communist China, and warnings coming in the UK today that our terrorism threat is now going up directly as a result of what has happened in Afghanistan ... believe me, Glenn, this is on every level a disaster.""

Glenn Beck: WHERE'S the media outrage after BLACK NATIONALIST shoots cop in the head?,"Daytona Beach (Florida) Police Officer Jason Raynor was shot in the head on Wednesday, allegedly by a man who was later apprehended at a black nationalist paramilitary encampment. Raynor miraculously survived the attack but remains in critical condition at Halifax Health Medical Center.

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck couldn't help wondering: Where's the media outrage for Officer Raynor? Where are the crowds chanting, ""Say his name""? And how different would the media reports and reactions be right now if the attacker had been a white supremacist, apprehended at a white nationalist militia camp?

""Jason Raynor, he's fighting for his life after being shot in the head,"" Glenn began. ""The suspected shooter is Othal Wallace. ... Wallace was apprehended at a black nationalist militia camp. Imagine what today's world would be like if that were a white nationalist militia camp.""

Glenn pointed out that reports are focused on Wallace's crimes as an individual and not as a representative of an entire race — which is as it should be. But if the races were reversed, would a white criminal receive the same kind of coverage? Or would the crime become an example of the supposed rising threat of white supremacy in our nation?

Either way, Glenn said it's time we say Raynor's name — just like all the others who've been physically hurt amid our nation's growing racial divide.

Visa refuses then caves on flagging gun and ammo sales,"In a major victory for gun control activists, Visa Inc. now plans to flag firearm sales by separately categorizing sales at gun shops, and other credit card companies, including Mastercard and American Express, may soon follow. But while that's disturbing enough, there's a whole lot more to this story

Earlier this month, Robert B. Thomson III, a senior vice president of Visa, said in a letter to pro-gun control lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), that his company believes that ""asking payment networks to serve as a moral authority by deciding which legal goods can or cannot be purchased sets a dangerous precedent.""

But over the weekend, Visa said it would adopt the new set of standards put forth by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) by creating a special merchant category code for gun stores to use.

“Following ISO’s decision to establish a new merchant category code, Visa will proceed with next steps, while ensuring we protect all legal commerce on the Visa network in accordance with our long-standing rules,” Visa said in a statement on Saturday.

So, if this wasn't Visa's idea, whose was it? And why did Visa suddenly cave?

On ""The Glenn Beck Program"" Monday, Glenn pointed out that none of this originated with the banks or credit card companies. So where is it coming from?

Glenn read a letter written by Sen. Warren and Representative Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) that openly admitted that the implementation of a new merchant category code for gun and ammunition stores would only be ""the first step towards facilitating the collection of valuable financial data that could help law enforcement in countering the financing of terrorism efforts.”

So are progressive leftists in Congress winning the battle for gun control, or is someone even more powerful than the federal government calling the shots?

In the video clip below, Glenn takes a deep dive into this latest attack on the Second Amendment and reveals how this is a step toward something even worse than a federal gun registration.

"WATCH: Rep. Ilhan Omar unknowingly OWNS herself, proves her critics right","On ""The Rubin Report"" Wednesday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin talked about Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-Minn.) anti-Semitic response to charges of being anti-Semitic, President Joe Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki doing mental gymnastics to imply that Republicans want to defund the police, and former President Barack Obama explaining why the sharing of disinformation worries him the most.

First, Dave shared a video clip from Omar's interview with Jake Tapper on CNN. In the clip, Tapper asks Omar if she can understand why some of her comments might be interpreted as being anti-Semitic by her Jewish colleagues. Omar's roundabout response seems to prove her critics right.

'UNCONSCIONABLE as anything I can imagine — but so typical of Obama 2.0': Nikki Haley reacts to Kerry-Iran scandal,"On ""The Rubin Report"" this week, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin sat down with Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to talk about the massive foreign policy scandal involving John Kerry and Iran, as well as the federal government's overreach during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the weekend, a New York Times report based on leaked audio alleged that former Secretary of State John Kerry informed Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of ""at least 200"" covert actions by Israel against Iran in Syria. If true, why would a top diplomat during the Obama administration leak intel to an enemy of the U.S. and endanger one of our strongest allies?

""The idea that you would go and support and help the number one state sponsor of terror around the world, but stab our friend Israel in the back, is as unconscionable as anything I can imagine — but so typical of Obama 2.0. So typical,"" Haley told Rubin.

""I think it's dangerous. I don't trust Kerry. I don't trust him to not have done this. I don't trust Biden to make Kerry answer for it. And I think we still have to be loud about it, because this is not okay,"" she added.

Rubin and Haley noted the mainstream media's obvious bias as they ignore or run defense for Kerry and the Biden administration.

""This is the reason nobody trusts the media anymore. I mean, why should you [when] you're getting one side of the story?"" she asked. ""What happened to the days when [media] just gave us the facts and we decided what we wanted to think? I think ... you'll never see CNN talking about Kerry doing this. You'll never see MSNBC talking about it. So, I think we still need to be loud. I think we have to push it.""
