Biden's Sons: Chad Prather's analysis of 'DICEY' moment from Trump-Biden Presidential debate,"As the dust settled on the Trump-Biden presidential debate in Cleveland, Chad reflected on a ""dicey"" moment when the discussion shifted to Joe Biden's sons.

During the debate, Biden attached his late son Beau's memory to an allegation that Trump called fallen soldiers ""losers"" and ""suckers"" in 2018. Trump hit back, pointing out that he did not know Beau, but he was familiar with Hunter, Biden's youngest son.

Trump shifted the conversation toward Hunter's positive drug test that led to his Navy's administrative discharge and his involvement with Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian-based energy company under Senate investigation for ""suspicious activity.""

According to Chad, by associating comments to his late son Beau, Biden opened the door for Trump to attack his youngest son, Hunter, for past and current misconduct.

Donald Trump Jr. hits back at critics who compare him and his siblings to Hunter Biden,"Donald Trump Jr., the son of President Donald Trump, defended himself Wednesday night from critics who have sought to compare the foreign business deals of himself and his siblings to those of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

What are the details?

Speaking to Fox News's Sean Hannity, Trump reminded the audience that he and his siblings, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, had already established their business careers long before their father took office. ""You want to know the difference between the Bidens and us are?"" Trump said. ""We were international businesspeople before politics, and we gave up doing all new deals going forward.""

""We didn't magically become international businesspeople because of our political position,"" President Trump's son reiterated. ""We put that all aside for years.""

Trump said Hunter Biden couldn't claim the same, saying the former vice president's son's lacked the qualifications for the jobs on his resume. ""How about right out of school he gets a high-paying job from MBNA — the biggest bank and the largest employer in the state of Delaware — where daddy is conveniently a senator,"" Trump said of Hunter Biden.

Trump went on to argue to that Hunter Biden didn't have the credentials to sit on the board of Amtrak, either, nor did he have the language skills or energy experience to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.



Hunter Biden's business deals during his father's tenure as vice president have become a source of enormous controversy. House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over allegations that the president sought to withhold military aid to the Ukraine in exchange for the country relaunching a corruption probe into the company on which Hunter Biden was appointed a board member during the Obama administration.

Joe Biden has defended his son's business deals, saying neither he nor his son did anything wrong, and claims the two have never spoken of the details of Hunter's international contracts — even though Hunter Biden says the two have, indeed, discussed the nature of his international work.",https://www.theblaze.com/contributors/donald-trump-jr-hits-back-at-critics-who-compare-him-and-his-siblings-to-hunter-biden,2019-10-17
"Squires: America is learning: Countries that sow self-hatred, narcissism, and feminized masculinity reap self-destruction","One of the most fascinating developments over the past week has been watching political pundits and social commentators celebrate virtues in Ukraine, from armed resistance to national loyalty, that are frequently criticized in America.

My sense is that the ruling class assumes our citizens would have the same response to a hostile foreign invasion. They may be right, but the biblical principle of sowing and reaping suggests a very different outcome.

A recent tweet from NPR is one example of the type of seed that finds fertile ground in our culture.

“Russia’s attack on Ukraine means there’s a stressful news cycle ahead of us. The reality of conflict is always a shock to the system. Here are 5 ways to cope.”

The entire thread was completely on-brand for NPR, from the thumbnail illustration of an androgynous person of color laying in the fetal position to the language of personal therapy emanating from the subsequent tweets.

It was an easy alley-oop for the conservatives on Twitter who shared the post to the followers, but the post was an important snapshot of the character traits being cultivated in our society.

We have become a fragile nation increasingly unable to deal with the realities of life. The 2016 election of Donald Trump made this crystal clear. Colleges across the country offered students play dough, coloring books, hot chocolate, and bubbles to cope with the stress of an election outcome.

Previous generations of young men between 18 and 22 stormed the beaches of Normandy, fought the Viet Cong in Da Nang, and were beaten during Freedom Rides for civil rights in America. Early adulthood now is characterized by safe spaces and comfort animals.

The NPR post wasn’t just a window into American fragility. It was also another example of our most popular faith – the cult of self. One Army recruitment ad in 2021 followed the story of “Emma,” a soldier who talked about being inspired to join the military after reflecting on the activism of her two moms and adventure-seeking sorority sisters.

The video is a perfect distillation of America in the 21st century – the ultimate act of self-sacrifice has been transformed into a personal vanity project of self-fulfillment. Recruitment ads from China and Russia show young men leaving their families, engaging in physically demanding training exercises, jumping out of planes, scaling walls, and driving tanks. The virtues being promoted in their ads – bravery, sacrifice, honor, discipline, patriotism, courage – transcend language and nationality.

What makes things even more difficult is the extent to which the left uses every organ of culture, from sports to movies, to sell the message that America is irredeemably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic. Who would want to die for such an evil country? Alienating your citizens from their nation is not a wise move when our adversaries in other countries are willing to exploit every perceived weakness to expand their own power.

These weaknesses have been exacerbated by the left’s forward assault on manhood. A Christian professor named Karen Swallow Prior tweeted a video of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a small group of men who committed to stay and fight for their country. She said, “I doubt these guys tweet about ‘manliness.’” The subtext was that conservative evangelical American men talk about masculinity more than they embody it.

What she failed to mention is that American society has been grinding away at men and manhood for decades. A desire to help men get more in touch with their feelings has morphed into something much more ominous. Every few months a new man in a dress is being upheld as brave and courageous for pushing the boundaries of gender. Men who object to the fashion choices of Harry Styles, Billy Porter, or Kid Cudi are seen as toxic and regressive.

This erosion of masculinity extends into the home as well, and not just through depictions of bumbling, incompetent dads on television sitcoms. The one tactical advantage women have in the gender wars is their words. Women who berate and disrespect their husbands are doing untold damage to both their mates and children. We went from mothers saying, “I don’t need a man” to daughters saying, “I don’t want a man” to sons saying, “I don’t want to be a man.”

The domestic power struggle that feminism has been encouraging for decades has led to men who are less assertive and more indecisive than their forefathers. Women who reject male leadership in the home often fear the misuse of authority, but that abdication also removes responsibility. It’s a package deal, in the same way the sun provides both light and heat.

I know many women who object to rigid gender roles, whether in the home or broader society. I don’t know a single one who wants to take on the role of protecting men from harm or the responsibility of being the sole provider in a household that has an able-bodied man present.

This contradiction is captured by a famous quote from C.S. Lewis.

“In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.”

One historian’s new book claims that white evangelicals corrupted Christianity in America with the rugged masculinity embodied by John Wayne. Reading contemporary cultural norms into the Bible can certainly lead to bad doctrine, but the reason some pastors feel compelled to speak about biblical manhood is because they understand what happens to a culture that embraces the church of Jesus and Elton John.



A country that promotes national alienation, paints masculinity as inherently toxic, and rewards fragility, neuroses, and anxiety is in no position to fight external battles. It must first address the corrosion that is occurring within its borders. It’s hard to envision bravery from people who crumble under the weight of microaggressions or go into a state of panic when they see someone without a piece of cloth covering their nose and mouth. War creates a fog for those in it, but it is clarifying for people fortunate enough to live in peace.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-america-is-learning-countries-that-sow-self-hatred-narcissism-and-feminized-masculinity-reap-self-destruction,2022-03-01
Whitlock: Don’t get it twisted: Sacramento mass shooting another reminder of the Second Amendment's importance,"The atrocious mass shooting in downtown Sacramento Sunday morning provided President Joe Biden, NBA coach Steve Kerr, and other political leftists a platform to pretend to care about gun violence and advocate for gun control.

“Today, America again mourns for another community devastated by gun violence,” Biden said in a statement. “In a single act in Sacramento, six individuals left dead and at least a dozen more injured. Families forever changed. Survivors left to heal wounds both visible and invisible.

“We must do more than mourn; we must act. … Ban ghost guns. Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.”

Biden conveniently ignores the fact that California is home to some of the most restrictive gun laws in this nation. Those laws have not stopped one Crip or Blood from possessing a gun and discharging it at their discretion. Criminals do not care about laws. That’s why they’re criminals.

Kerr’s Golden State Warriors were in Sacramento to play the Kings. Kerr is never reluctant to virtue-signal or amplify a Democrat talking point. He did not disappoint on Sunday.

“We’ll have a moment of silence before the game,” he said. “It’s the right thing to do, to have a moment of silence. But I’ll be honest, it’s probably the ninth or 10th moment of silence that I will have experienced as coach of the Warriors, when we mourn people who have died in mass shootings.

“I don’t think moments of silence are going to do anything. At some point – at some point – our government has to decide: Are we going to have some commonsense gun laws? It’s not going to solve everything, but it will save lives.”

Leftists do not want commonsense gun laws. They want to repeal the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. I used to agree with leftists on this issue. A decade ago, following a murder-suicide by Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, I wrote an infamous column attacking the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment. Bob Costas read the column on the air during a broadcast of NBC’s Sunday Night Football.

At the time, I foolishly thought the Second Amendment had outlived its usefulness. The thought was rooted in the belief that all Americans value freedom and order and that those shared values provide us more protection against an oppressive government than guns.

The last decade has made me disavow that belief. The puppet masters of the left do not value freedom and order. They value power and control above all else. Freedom and order, in their view, are luxury items purchased by the uber-rich and rationed to the well-behaved working class.

In the 246-year history of the United States, the Second Amendment has never been more sacrosanct than today. The right to bear arms is the only thing standing between us and an unmasked dictatorship.

Our government is unwilling to protect our constitutionally guaranteed freedoms or our safety. The government surrendered freedom of speech to Silicon Valley tech companies. The government surrendered our major cities to criminals, gangs, Antifa, and Black Lives Matter protesters. Our government emasculated law enforcement. Teachers' unions control the education of kids.

Why would any American citizen turn over their guns in the current climate established by leftists? We’re going to rely on the police?

Police in Canada, at the behest of government, cracked down on peaceful truck drivers. Police and FBI agents in America baited and entrapped unarmed citizens at the Capitol, then served as corroborating witnesses in a bogus corporate media narrative that painted angry protesters as participants in a violent coup attempt.

The behavior and words of Joe Biden and Steve Kerr increase America’s appetite for self-protection through gun ownership. Dishonesty and cluelessness from the people in charge and the people with the loudest voices breed paranoia and belief in conspiracy theories.

You can’t produce order from disorder. People who do not value order cannot produce it.

Gun laws won’t fix broken families. It’s the equivalent of street gangs replacing nuclear families. American citizens know this, even if our politicians and media talking heads are loath to admit it.

We also know what happened in Sacramento this weekend is not remotely unfamiliar to anyone who has spent time in America’s major cities. Nightclubs close, black patrons mill in the parking lot and hope there is no gun violence before they exit the scene in their cars or an Uber. It’s a symptom of urban decay, the rot and destruction of the black family.

One video I watched of the Sacramento incident captured the sound of 76 shots in 54 seconds. It sounded like Friday night in Chicago or Baltimore or Philadelphia or Indianapolis or Ukraine. We’ve grown accustomed to this sound. Ignoring the sound and collateral damage have been normalized.

Maybe we’ll be shocked this time and learn that the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo Boys, and the KKK were responsible for this shooting. That would certainly make Joe Biden and Steve Kerr happy.

But it won’t change the fact that if Biden and Kerr were legitimately interested in a reduction in gun violence, they would advocate for traditional family structure and respect for law enforcement. They would oppose Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and street gangs as strongly as they oppose right-wing militias.

Who do you think is more responsible for dead black men, the Proud Boys or the Crips? Are the Proud Boys responsible for one black murder? But they’re an existential threat to America.



If Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment, they should work to create a climate in which American citizens feel safe from government tyranny, Big Tech censorship, destructive, organized unrest disguised as social justice, and the violence pervasive in single-parent communities.

Three things produce a civil society: truth, nuclear families, and respect for law enforcement. As long as the left opposes all three, don’t get mad that people prefer to keep all of their guns.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-dont-get-it-twisted-sacramento-mass-shooting-another-reminder-of-the-second-amendment-s-importance,2022-04-04
"Whitlock: ESPN, Biden administration, and Alphabet Mafia have big plans for Brittney Griner","Apparently, it is ESPN’s job to transform Brittney Griner into the Kim Kardashian of the Alphabet Mafia.



The Worldwide Leader in Sports spent the weekend force-feeding fans updates on Griner’s activities since being released from a Russian penal colony. On Saturday, ESPN dutifully reported that Griner bonded with the flight crew that transported her back to U.S. soil. Sunday night, ESPN’s top investigative journalist, T.J. Quinn, breathlessly reported that Griner dunked a basketball during her first workout.

So far, Griner has bonded and dunked.

ESPN thinks nine months inside a Russian jail have made the mundane details of Brittney Griner’s freedom fascinating to the American public. ESPN is trying to establish the importance of Griner. The network has set about the business of justifying the Biden administration trading a notorious Russian arms dealer for an irresponsible, pothead hooper, whose real value derives from brown skin and lesbian sexual preference.

ESPN is operating under the fallacy that once the American public recognizes the magnitude of Griner’s stardom, President Joe Biden’s decision to trade a convicted terrorist for her release will make perfect sense.

Unlikely. What is likely is Viktor Bout assisting Russian President Vladmir Putin in his war effort against Ukraine. Meanwhile, Brittney Griner will assist the Alphabet Mafia in normalizing drag queen story hour, gender transformation surgery for kids, and prioritizing sexual and skin color identity above everything else.

It’s a very fair trade when you consider the importance of the work our government has planned for Griner.

She’s spending her first few days back on American soil at a military base, where I’m sure Department of Defense operatives are giving her the right talking points for her new life as a high-profile influencer.

From the ESPN news story about Griner’s practice dunk: “Several sources close to Griner have said that when she does leave, she will not head to her Phoenix home but to what they describe only as a private, secure location.”

Griner’s agent then told T.J. Quinn: “There’s no timeline on her return at this point. She’s reintegrating into a world that has changed for her now. From a pure security standpoint, she’s not going to be able to move in the world the way she did. It’s not a fate that she asked for, but I think she’s going to utilize her fame for good.”

Brittney Griner is famous now. She needs security. She must sequester and isolate herself from a dangerous mob of Americans who could do her harm. Nine months in a Russian jail turned Griner into Tall Kim Kardashian. Griner and her wife, Cherelle, are Alphabet Mafia royalty, the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry of the LGBTQ.

My snark may feel like animus. For that, I apologize. I do not dislike Brittney Griner.

I dislike the way Griner is being used by the Biden administration, corporate media, and the Left. She’s another dumb jock being steered in the direction of misguided social justice activism. She was unappreciative of her American freedom before Russia showed her what real oppression is. A $200,000 salary for playing a game that no one watches isn’t oppression. Getting locked up for 14 years for a tiny amount of hashish oil so you can be exchanged for a terrorist is oppression.

I wonder if Griner understands this now. I wonder if she’ll stand for the national anthem. Or will her Leftist handlers insist that she remain polarizing and divisive?

My instincts say that Nike and other globalist corporations will pay her to follow the path of Colin Kaepernick. Two white Christians rescued Kaepernick as a baby, and he repaid them by portraying them as racist in a Netflix documentary.

America saved Brittney Griner at a ridiculous and unwarranted cost. How will she repay America?

Griner, her agent, ESPN, and the WNBA better milk all 15 minutes of her fame. It won’t make it to minute 16. People will watch her sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey, Don Lemon, or Robin Roberts. Her first WNBA will be watched by a few million people.

But there’s little substance to Griner and nothing interesting. She’s not even that good at basketball. She’s extremely tall. That’s it. She’s not Wilma Chamberlain. She’s never been MVP or a great scorer. Her dunks are unspectacular. She’s covered in unflattering tattoos. She’s not profound.



Like most woke modern athletes, her talking points come straight from Twitter.

Try as they might, neither ESPN nor the Biden administration will be able to elevate Griner’s importance to a level that justifies the trade for Viktor Bout.

A year from now, Griner and the WNBA will be back to trolling patriotic Americans for relevance. It wouldn’t surprise me if in two years, Griner is back playing basketball in Russia, signing an autograph for Viktor Bout.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-biden-administration-and-alphabet-mafia-have-big-plans-for-brittney-griner,2022-12-12
"Whitlock: ESPN is sleeping with your enemy, and so are you","American essayist Charles Dudley Warner coined the phrase “politics makes strange bedfellows.” It was written as an observation in the mid-1800s. Christians should have interpreted it as a warning.

The adoption of a political identity will eventually align you with your enemies and inevitably detach you from your faith.

We can see this process unfolding in the sports world in real time. The ultimate example of American meritocracy and exceptionalism, competitive sports, is no match for politics’ ability to divide, corrupt, and conquer. Politics is always about power and money. It cannot coexist on equal footing with faith. Politics is about the rulership of earth and has no concern with salvation in an afterlife. It is short-sighted, greedy, and unethical.

It obeys Caesar’s creed: “If you must break the law, do it to seize power; in all other cases observe it.”

Just six short years ago, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick made arenas and stadiums platforms for political expression of dissatisfaction. He said he kneeled during the national anthem because police officers killed black men without consequence.

Soon after, soccer star Megan Rapinoe and others joined Kaepernick in protest. And soon after that, on-field protests were about far more than the value of black lives. It was about equal pay for female jocks, LGBT rights, Trump resistance, LGBTQ rights, MAGA resistance, LGBTQ+ rights, voter ID laws in Georgia, and now, finally, LGBTQIA+ rights.

Late last week, ESPN employees called for a moment of silence because Florida governor Ron DeSantis plans to sign a law that, among other things, places limits on what Florida schools can teach young students about gender and sexuality. HB 1557 is the Parental Rights in Education bill. Its critics claim it discriminates against the LGBTQIA+ community. Critics call it the “don’t say gay” bill.

ESPN anchor Elle Duncan, aka light-skin Jemele Hill, took to the airwaves to express displeasure with Florida lawmakers.

“We understand the gravity of this legislation and also how it is affecting so many families across this country, and because of that our allyship is going to take a front seat. And with that, we’re going to pause in solidarity.”

ESPN basketball broadcasters Carolyn Peck and Courtney Lyle were up next.

“There are things bigger than basketball that need to be addressed at this time,” Lyle said. “Our friends, our family, our coworkers, the players, and coaches in our community are hurting right now. Our LGBTQIA+ teammates at Disney asked for our solidarity and support.”

Parents having authority over what their kids are taught in public schools is a threat to the LGBTQIA+ community? Let’s say that it is. Why is this threat being analyzed, discussed, and combatted on Disney’s sports network? Why can't it be covered exclusively on Disney’s ABC news network?

Are there any Disney employees who see abortion as a threat to babies in the womb? And will those employees be allowed to call for a moment of silence?

Sports and religion used to be partners. Teams took knees together in pre- and postgame prayer. Churches sponsored baseball, basketball, and football leagues. The best coaches saw their profession as ministry.

Politics does not leave room for religion. Coaches now prioritize making political statements rather than religious ones. Nick Saban appearing in a Black Lives Matter commercial is good for recruiting. So is hiring female assistant football coaches. In the not-so-distant future, Saban will need to appear in a commercial vowing support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

BLM and LGBTQIA+ are the same organization, the Alphabet Mafia. They’re making offers ESPN, Nick Saban, Gregg Popovich, the NFL, and the NBA can’t refuse.

Black Lives Matter was a Trojan horse for imposing secular values on popular culture. Sports had been the most powerful tool supporting traditional, Judeo-Christian values in American culture. Men’s sports celebrated the patriarchy. That is no longer the case. Kaepernick led the invasion of politics into sports. He gave Disney and ESPN the excuse they needed to overhaul sports culture into something that pleases the Alphabet Mafia by disavowing Christian principles and values.

Securalizing American sports is the gateway drug to overthrowing the U.S. Constitution. That’s a big statement. Let me explain.

Like sports, our Constitution is infused with Christian principles and values. Live sports programming is the strongest content force in American culture. The NFL is the most popular show on five different TV networks – CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN, and the NFL Network. If you want to communicate with a large audience, football (college and pro) is the only product that works consistently at a high level. Basketball works to a lesser degree.

Changing sports to a celebration of secular and Marxist values is preparing American minds for politicians to call for a reimagining of our Constitution. We’re deep into the process. Over the past month, corporate media pundits have called anyone who questions our strategy related to war in Ukraine as “treasonous.” How can an opinion about a war between Ukraine and Russia be treasonous for an American?

The definition of America and American sovereignty is being redefined right now. If an American doesn’t criticize Vladimir Putin loud enough, corporate media says you’re committing treason. But Elie Mystal can go on national TV and call our Constitution trash without being labeled a traitor.



It does not make sense. Unless you recognize that the social engineers are intentionally manipulating the American mind. All things infused with Christian values are under attack. Sports are a battlefield for the attack. A political identity, whether red or blue, will put you at odds with a Christian identity.

Our bedfellows aren’t strange. They’re evil.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-is-sleeping-with-your-enemy-and-so-are-you,2022-03-21
Whitlock: Pro sports leagues riding the gay and black ‘Pride’ paths to hell,"The Bible stakes a clear position on pride. It is regarded as Satan’s aphrodisiac of choice, more powerful than wine, drugs, money, or brute force. A series of verses in the book of Proverbs spell out God’s position on pride.



Proverbs 11:2: “When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.”

Proverbs 16:18: “One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.”

Proverbs 8:13: “The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.”

Proverbs 16:18: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”

Roman Catholics believe pride is one of seven deadly sins – lust, greed, envy, sloth, gluttony, and envy are the others – and the root of all sin.

Ivan Provorov, a defenseman for the Philadelphia Flyers, belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, an offshoot of Roman Catholicism. No one should be surprised that he declined to participate in his team’s “Pride Night” activities. In fact, no serious Christian should involve himself with any celebration of pride, whether it’s gay pride, black pride, trans pride, American pride, Egg McMuffin pride, or even pride pride.

Pride is rooted in idolatry, the prioritization of a symbol, a thing, or an activity above worship of God.

Tuesday night, during pregame warm-ups, Provorov refused to wear an LGBTQ+ jersey and use a stick with rainbow tape. He told reporters he wanted to stay true to himself and his religion. His decision spurred derision and pushback from inside and outside the hockey world. NHL Network broadcaster Ethan Hradek suggested that Provorov should go fight in the Ukraine-Russian war.

“Ivan Provorov can get on a plane any day he wants and go back to a place where he feels more comfortable, take less money, and get on with his life that way if that’s problematic for him. If this is that much of a problem for him, to maybe assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community here in this country, that’s OK. Listen, you can feel any way you want. But the beauty is, if it bothers you that much, there’s always a chance to leave, go back to where you feel more comfortable – I understand there’s a conflict of sorts going on over there, maybe get involved.”

Tim Micallef, host of a popular sports talk show in Canada, ripped Provorov with the popular wrong-side-of-history argument.

“I will always be on the side of equality,” he said. “People will hide behind ideologies, like amazingly enough, religion. But I’m strong on this one and quite comfortable. Either you are for equality or you’re on the wrong side of history. Period.”

Some men pursue God, not history. Man is the God of recorded history. Micallef and others worship man. Provorov worships God.

Man believes pride is a virtue. The Bible says pride is Satan’s best tool for destruction. Who am I to believe?

I see the destructive power of pride on a daily basis. Even man’s written history reflects pride’s destructiveness. White supremacy is rooted in racial pride/racial idolatry. Black pride works just the same way as white pride. That’s why proponents of Black Lives Matter delight in having white people kneel and beg forgiveness.

The prioritization of skin color as a primary identity has led black people to embrace and defend a culture that denigrates and dehumanizes black people. We ignore the slaughter of our children based on the race of the killer. That’s black pride. It forbids black people to hate their sin. God commands us to hate sin, not people. Hating sin is good.

“The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.”

America’s embrace of pride has reversed God’s directive. We hate people and celebrate sin.

Ivan Provorov is hated now because his faith compels him to avoid celebrating a lifestyle the Bible says is unhealthy. He disagrees with feigning pride in an activity he believes is wrong. He does not hate gay people. He’s not advocating that we deny gay people fundamental freedoms, rights, and respect. He’s rejecting pride, a deadly sin in his mind.

What would lead to a better society: hating people or rejecting pride?

The answer is easy. We should reject pride. It spawns wickedness and division. People’s sexual preference does not qualify them for a special night of celebration. Neither does a skin color.

Man’s nature is evil. Ivan Provorov and many other believers embrace the teachings in the Bible because it’s the best way to combat our destructive nature. Provorov wants to be on the right side of God because he knows man is incapable of producing a righteous world without biblical instruction.

Man uses hatred of man to produce justice. God tells us hatred of sin produces justice.

Let me make it simple. I have a weight problem. Man advises me to hate Ronald McDonald. God tells me to hate gluttony.



This sounds like a joke. It’s not. The woke have crafted arguments that obesity is a byproduct of white supremacy. Here’s one example. In a few years, the NHL and other sports leagues will be hosting Obesity Pride Nights. They’ll smother the hockey puck in gravy and demand that players eat fried chicken and cheeseburgers while on the ice.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-pro-sports-leagues-riding-the-gay-and-black-pride-paths-to-hell,2023-01-19
"Biden advisers ignore basic economics, claim increasing US oil supply would have no impact on price","A common political theme on the right is that American Democrats, leftists, and liberals do not understand basic economics. The stereotype, conservatives will say, despite protestations from the left, exists for a reason.

Imagine conservatives' combined frustration and sense of vindication when President Joe Biden's advisers showed up on cable news Wednesday morning to declare that increasing the United States' domestic oil production would have zero impact on the price of oil.

That's right, as the U.S. continues to see record highs at the gas pump and surging oil prices, it appears that Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh believes oil prices are not connected to supply — even though Monday's announcement of a U.S. and U.K. ban on imports of Russian oil had an immediate effect on oil prices, which even President Biden acknowledged in his statement making the ban on Moscow's oil official.

When pressed by MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" cohost Willie Geist on the Keystone XL pipeline, which Biden stopped, and ongoing bipartisan calls for increased domestic production, Singh called the Keystone situation a ""distraction"" and then added, ""Even if we drilled as much as we could, the price of oil is still set globally by the demand and supply conditions, and much of that supply is controlled by tyrants like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.""

Singh cited ""supply and demand"" and then showed he has little grasp on what the term means. Additional U.S. oil supply would have an impact on prices — this is known.

And Singh wasn't alone pushing that line in the media today.

White House Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese went on CNBC to continue the lie.

Deese declared, ""There is no amount of domestic production that we can do when we're dealing with volatile global commodity, where the price is set globally, there's no amount of domestic production we can do to reduce or eliminate our vulnerability as a country to that volatility.""

Biden, himself, has acknowledged that increasing supply would lower prices — not just in his admission Monday that, because of the ban on Russian oil, gas prices are ""going to go up further"" but also in his recent (unsuccessful) attempts to woo the House of Saud and Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro to up their countries' oil output.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/biden-advisers-ignore-basic-economics-claim-increasing-us-oil-supply-would-have-no-impact-on-price,2022-03-09
"Biden calls Putin a 'war criminal.' Psaki tries to walk back the announcement, says it was because of what the president saw on TV.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, imploring the American government to help his country and exposing Russian atrocities committed against his people.

The world has witnessed Russian President Vladimir Putin's slaughtering of innocent Ukrainians in his desire to exert Moscow's control over Eastern Europe and regain some of the lost ""glory"" of the former U.S.S.R.

Shortly after Zelenskyy's speech, a reporter asked President Joe Biden whether Putin is a war criminal.

Biden initially replied, ""No."" Then, after wandering off, he went back to the reporter and offered the opposite take.

After asking the reporter for clarification about whether she was asking if he would call Putin a war criminal, the president said, ""Oh, I think he is a war criminal.""

Naturally, the Kremlin was more than a little put off by Biden's declaration. The government's spokesman called the remarks ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric,"" MSN reported, citing Russia's state-run TASS news agency.

So, why did Biden say what he did about Putin?

Was it because of info shared in the presidential daily briefings, as HotAir's Ed Morrissey asked? Was it because of secret intel Biden has been privy to? Was it because of powerful Pentagon surveillance footage?

Apparently not.

According to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, it was because of what Biden saw on TV — just like everybody else.

A reporter pressed Psaki about the president's seemingly premature decision to label Putin ""war criminal,"" which is a significant designation.

""The Russian actions in Ukraine are under close scrutiny for potential war crimes, but today President Biden directly labeled Putin today a 'war criminal.' Has something changed in the administration's assessment?"" the reporter asked. ""What brought this new remark from the president?""

Psaki replied, ""The president's remarks speak for themselves. He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he's seen on television — which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator.""

Another reporter later noted, ""This war has now been going on three weeks. So far, the president has declined to use this label. As you note, there is an ongoing sort of formal process before you can use this term. So, something must have changed for the president to feel like he could take this additional step today.""

Psaki answered, ""The president was answering a direct question that was asked and responding to what he has seen on television. We have all seen it. Barbaric acts, horrific acts by a foreign dictator in a country that is threatening and taking the lives of civilians, impacting hospitals, women who are pregnant, journalists — others.""

What caused this walk back? Morrissey has a theory: Biden doesn't want to tick off Russia when he needs them to get back into the Iran nuclear deal.



Moreover, with Biden having established that designation after fumbling it initially, this official walk-back at the White House of it being just Biden’s personal view looks like a retreat in the face of Russian complaints. And that might be precisely what it is, because Biden’s still relying on Russia to accommodate Biden’s desperate ambition to re-enter the Iran deal. Biden has put regional and American security into Putin’s hands in regard to a renegotiated JCPOA while calling him a “war criminal,” and at the same time warning that Putin might use WMDs in Ukraine such as chemical weapons and tactical nukes.



Rather than recognize the insanity of that foreign policy, Biden and his White House have decided that it makes more sense to accommodate Putin and walk back the obvious. That may be many things, but leadership it ain’t.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/biden-putin-war-criminal-walk-back,2022-03-17
"'Get ready for $6 a gallon' gas, says former US diplomat to the Middle East","Moms filling up their minivans today are experiencing some serious sticker shock.

Contractors working on a job site with any distance at all from the home office are going to eat some serious travel expenses if they didn't build updated gas and travel costs into their bids.

Drivers and truckers delivering goods to grocery stores, grains to ports, or timber to plants are paying through the nose for diesel to ship what Americans need and want (and they aren't just going to eat the massive spike in fuel prices).

But the news gets worse: If you thought gas was expensive already, just wait. One expert with experience in the Middle East is warning Americans to get ready for $6 per gallon.

David Rundell, a onetime U.S. diplomat in oil-producing nations, told Fortune that the Russian-Ukraine conflict, coupled with our deteriorating relations with Saudi Arabia, spells doom for U.S. consumers' pocketbooks at the pump.

Rundell, who spent three decades as a U.S. diplomat in such oil-producing countries as Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Tunisia, told the magazine that the U.S. put itself behind the eight ball when it comes to negotiating to get the House of Saud to get more oil flowing.

""Russia and Saudi Arabia are the world’s two largest oil exporters. If we had good relations with Saudi Arabia, they would have stepped in to help as they have done many times in the past,” Rundell told Fortune.

The former diplomat, who is now a partner at Arabia Analytica, a consulting firm focused on the Middle East, added that ""our relationship with Saudi leaders continues to worsen. So, get ready for $6 a gallon.""

Rundell issued his warning as Americans saw gas prices hit an all-time high of $4.17 on Tuesday, the outlet said. The price is 11 cents per gallon more than it was the day before and 55 cents higher than just a week ago.

His warning also came before President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. would bar imports of Russian oil and gas.

During his announcement, Biden told the nation that gas prices are ""going to go up further.""",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/buckle-up-get-ready-for-6-a-gallon-gas-says-former-us-diplomat-to-the-middle-east,2022-03-08
US labor unions declare their support for Ukraine by ... printing signs with the nation's flag upside down. Photos quickly disappear as mockery grows.,"The AFL-CIO wants the world to know that the unions really, truly stand with the people of Ukraine.

The union federation is so serious about backing Ukrainians being killed by Russian forces that they posed for a group photo Monday with their leadership raising their fists in solidarity and holding fancy signs the group had printed declaring, ""We stand with Ukraine"" — complete with a dove sitting on barbed wire and the Ukrainian flag as the background.

But there was a problem.

The flags were printed upside down.

After several hours of getting ripped a new one, the group pulled down the posting. Unfortunately for them, the internet is forever, and thanks to the Wayback Machine, the image is still accessible.

Image source: Twitter screenshot

Ukraine's flag has blue on top of yellow, which, as Fox News pointed out, symbolizes a ""blue sky over a bountiful field.""

After the image was spread and mocked online, the AFL-CIO posted a new photo of the same group in the same positions — but with noticeably diminished enthusiasm — holding new signs. The updated new signs were not nearly as slick and pretty as the original screwed-up versions. Clearly, a staffer had merely printed out a bunch of Ukrainian flags and then pasted onto them cutouts of the AFL-CIO logo and a generic ""stand with Ukraine"" declaration.

However, the attempt to save face apparently made things worse, because just hours after tweeting the updated group photo, the AFL-CIO deleted the posting.

Image source: Twitter screenshot

But that wasn't the worst of it. After the AFL-CIO posted the embarrassing group photo, the American Federation of Teachers, an AFL-CIO member, posted a close-up photo of AFT President Randi Weingarten and AFT Executive Vice President Evelyn DeJesus holding a screwed-up sign.

Naturally, the AFT also pulled this photo after getting shamed for the glaring error.

Image source: Twitter screenshot

Critics of the left-wing, anti-school choice, pro-mask, pro-COVID lockdown teachers' union had a heyday.

California state Sen. Melissa Melendez (R) responded, ""That's the flag of Ukraine alright, upside down. Shout out to teachers union for this promotional piece on the importance of school choice though.""

Corey DeAngelis, director of research for School Choice Now, called the AFT photo ""free advertising for school choice.""

Reopen California Schools, which has long taken the un-AFT stance that all Golden State schools should be reopened, used the photo to critique the union's demands to keep schools closed. ""They did to that flag what they did to education these past two years... pretend they care, but really, they just made it upside down,"" the group tweeted.

Libs of TikTok replied to the AFT photo saying, ""This is a great advertisement to homeschool your kids"" and later added, ""These are the people in charge of your child's education.""",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/labor-unions-support-ukraine-flags-upside-down-photos-disappear,2022-03-16
Reporter asks Psaki for Biden's 'biggest achievement in foreign policy.’ She has no answer.,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki loves to ""circle back."" It's kinda her thing.

So it likely came as no surprise to anyone in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on Tuesday when the red-headed Biden mouthpiece avoided answering ""a great question"" that she found uncomfortable by claiming that she wanted to get more input on it before answering.

The question that put Psaki so on the spot that she not only demurred but also quickly called on another reporter in order to cut off any further discussion: “What is President Joe Biden's biggest international win?

That's right. Psaki — knowing what every country's leader knows about this White House — adroitly avoided any discussion of Biden's biggest wins on the international stage.

When faced with the question, ""What does your administration consider your biggest achievement in foreign policy?"" what was she supposed to say?

The Afghanistan pullout?

Not standing up to Putin's aggression toward Ukraine?

Giving in to Moscow on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline?

Going easy on China as it commits genocide among its Uyghur population?

Ticking off France with the AUKUS deal?

Censoring a Taiwan minister during a democracy summit?

She went with the only answer she could muster: ""This is a great question. I want to be thoughtful about it. I want to talk to the president about it.""

Which is ... not confidence-inducing.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/reporter-psaki-bidens-biggest-achievement-in-foreign-policy,2021-12-15
Trudeau attempts to talk tough by declaring ban on Russian oil — but Canada hasn't imported Russian crude in years,"Among the myriad criticisms of President Joe Biden's handling of the Russia-Ukraine situation has been his refusal to announce a ban on imports of Russian crude oil. Though the U.S. has the capacity to supply its own oil, Democrat-imposed restrictions have severely limited our domestic supply and forced the country to become more reliant upon foreign oil imports, including more than 500,000 barrels of Russian crude oil every day.

Despite the fact that oil sales are a major income stream for Moscow — and are thereby funding the Russian attacks on Ukraine — Biden has elected to continue buying Russian oil.

But Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau has no such hang-up and on Monday announced a ban on imports of Russian crude.

“Today, we are announcing our intention to ban all imports of crude oil from Russia, an industry that has benefited President Putin and his oligarchs greatly,"" Trudeau declared, Bloomberg reported.

And he got positive headlines for his stance:

Reuters: ""Canada to supply anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, ban Russian oil imports""

BBC: ""Canada to ban imports of crude oil from Russia""

Times of Israel: ""Trudeau announces Canada ban on Russian oil imports""

Canada's Global News: ""Premier Kenney encouraged by Trudeau ban on Russian oil, wants Biden to follow suit""

Bloomberg: ""Trudeau Says Canada to Ban Russian Crude Oil Imports""

Calgary Herald: ""Canada banning all oil imports from Russia, sending anti-tank weapons to Ukraine""

However, Trudeau's brave stance was nothing but symbolism: Canada has not imported Russian crude oil in years.

In a short update at the very bottom of Bloomberg's report, there's this line: ""Canada hasn’t imported any crude oil from Russia since 2019, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told lawmakers on Monday.""

And though Trudeau did admit in passing during his announcement that ""Canada has imported very little amounts in recent years,"" many reports hailed the PM's announcement but glossed over his admission and hyped the ""message"" Trudeau was sending to Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and his lackeys in the Kremlin.

For example, the Global News echoed the PM's statement that ""Canada is not a major importer of oil from Russia"" while linking to a government report showing that not only is Canada ""not a major importer,"" but had not imported any Russian crude since 2019 — something that neither Trudeau nor the newspaper bothered to point out.

Reuters' and the BBC's reporting skipped over the fact that Canada has bought no Russian crude in years and instead highlighted data on the $228 million worth of Russian energy Canada imported in 2021, making Trudeau's announcement appear more serious than it was.

The BBC even included a note in its report on Trudeau's ""ban"" that a refusal to buy Russia's oil and gas would have a major impact on Russia.

Which is correct. But Trudeau's ban is not actually on gas and other non-crude-oil energy imports. His announcement had no bearing on other energy imports.

Turns out, as the Wall Street Journal noted, Trudeau's declaration is expected to have zero impact on the Canadian economy.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/trudeau-talk-tough-russian-oil-ban,2022-03-01
USA Today fact-checks clearly satirical Babylon Bee report that Biden sold Alaska to Russia,"Big Media just can't help themselves.

The scolds in the liberal press can't hide their disdain for popular satire site Babylon Bee. The site is funny, insightful, punchy, and can be cutting-edge. But the big problem, it seems, is that the Bee, which is conservative and Christian, is effective at driving home points using the power of satire.

So the media have gone on the attack. For example:

The New York Times was forced to retract what the Bee called defamatory and misleading statements about the satirical site when the paper referred to the Bee as a ""far-right misinformation site"" that ""sometimes trafficked in misinformation under the guise of satire.""

Snopes beclowned itself when it fact-checked a Bee satire piece that was clearly a joke to anyone who read it and had at least a room-temperature IQ, but the humorless Karens at Snopes couldn't help themselves.

USA Today actually fact-checked a Bee piece that said the liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the death of late SCOTUS Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

And now USA Today, the nation's biggest newspaper, is at it again. On Tuesday, the paper posted a fact-check of the Bee's recent piece saying that President Joe Biden sold Alaska back to Russia.

In the satirical item, the Bee mocked Biden's refusal to drill in the U.S. (because he wants to satisfy the green agenda) but willingness to push Saudi Arabia and Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro to increase their oil output.

""The deliberate and premeditated invasion of Ukraine by brutal dictator Vladimir Putin has forced the US to reassess the importance of energy independence,"" the Bee wrote. ""With this new resolve, the Biden Administration has taken its first step toward increasing oil production for Americans by selling Alaska back to Russia so we can start drilling for oil there again.""

""Folks, nobody wants to ruin America’s beautiful Alaskan wilderness with oil trucks and drilling rigs, come on!"" Biden said in a made-up quote by the Bee. ""But I’ve never had a problem getting oil from Russia, so there you go, go get him.""

The ""news"" was clearly a joke — as anyone with any sense understood.

But USA Today wasn't sure people were smart enough to see through the Bee's nefarious ""reporting.""

So the paper ran a fact-check to make sure everybody understood: ""There is no evidence Biden said he plans to sell Alaska.""

Thankfully for all the rubes in America, the newspaper was able to determine that the Bee piece was satire.

""Based on our research, we rate SATIRE the claim that Biden plans to sell Alaska to Russia,"" USA Today ruled.

Oh, and if you're wondering, ""Who pays for this nonsense?"" the paper has this note at the bottom of the fact-check: ""Our fact-check work is supported in part by a grant from Facebook.""",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/usa-today-fact-checks-clearly-satirical-babylon-bee-report-that-biden-sold-alaska-to-russia,2022-03-10
Carter Page sues DNC over Steele dossier: 'I'm very confident my case is incredibly strong',"Carter Page, a former adviser to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, found himself at the center of the Russia probe and had his reputation and career destroyed by what we now know were lies from our own intelligence system and the media.

On Thursday, Page filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Democratic National Committee for commissioning the discredited Steele dossier that was used by the FBI to surveil him during the 2016 election.



In this week's episode of ""The Glenn Beck Podcast,"" Page sat down with Glenn to talk about how he became the subject of illegal electronic surveillance for more than two years, and and how the mainstream media helped cover up the corruption that has infiltrated our legal systems.



""It's amazing the impact of the media because people can take little snippets of information and totally twist and spin it in a way which is completely false and an entirely different reality,"" Page said.

Page told Glenn that the biggest obstacle standing in the way of justice is the corrupt bureaucracy that attacked and smeared him in the first place.

""There is a serious cancer that our country is suffering from,"" Page said. ""It started with this metastasizing of the Russia collusion hoax. To me ... that is the biggest problem and thing at the forefront of my mind. There are a lot of things that I'm starting to do to help find a cure, if you will, for both myself and for our entire country, and litigation is one of those things.

""I'm very confident that my case is incredibly strong,"" said Page. ""The thing which sometimes gives me a little bit of caution is, I know what's been done in federal courts by false filings, by U.S. Department of Justice and private institutions, the DNC, and media organizations, in terms of some of my initial battles.

""The reason for that caution is a key story-line in the inspector general report -- those 17 'errors and omissions.' I know my case. If we're basing things exactly upon the facts and what actually happened, I have the strongest case in the world. The challenge becomes when you have really dishonest people hiding in the murk of secrecy, spinning and playing games.""

"Bill O'Reilly: The Left HATES Trump so much, they'd rather vote for the 'senile, corrupt guy'","The king of ""No Spin"" and bestselling author of ""Killing Crazy Horse,"" Bill O'Reilly joined Glenn Beck on this week's podcast to talk about the latest developments in Joe Biden's Ukraine and China corruption scandal. Now that some of the details are finally coming out in the open, does the average Democrat care? Maybe, but the Left doesn't seem to.

O'Reilly argued there's more hatred for President Donald Trump now than in 2016, and that some people hate President Trump so much that they'd rather vote for the ""senile, corrupt"" Joe Biden.

""Hunter got tens of millions of dollars from Ukraine, from Russia, from China because his father was vice president. I have no doubt in my mind,"" O'Reilly said. ""But the hatred for Donald Trump overrides that in the minds of millions of viewers. They're saying, 'You know, we'd rather have the senile corrupt guy than Trump.'""

Asked by Glenn if any other Republican running for president would be met with the same level of vitriol, O'Reilly answered, ""The Left is the Left. They don't like America. The want to redo the Constitution. They want to take some of our freedoms, like the Second Amendment and the First Amendment, and change them. And they want to destroy capitalism and replace it with a big centralized government in Washington that controls the economy … but I'm talking about the folks. I have liberal friends and I say to them, 'Do you not understand that when you vote for Biden, you're voting against your own self interest?'""

Glenn Beck uncovers MORE evidence of DNC collusion with Ukraine to sabotage the Trump campaign in 2016,"On Wednesday's show, Glenn Beck was back at the chalkboard to uncover the behind-the-scenes' connections of lawyer Alexandra Chalupa, the Democratic National Committee's so-called ""part-time consultant"" who can be traced back to the very origin of the Trump-Russia investigation.



In a 2017 report, Politico blew the lid off Democratic National Committee's efforts to help the Hillary Clinton campaign by digging up damaging information on then-candidate Donald Trump and his advisers ahead of the 2016 election. According to Politico, the DNC hired Ukrainian-American lawyer Alexandra Chalupa to consult with ""top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia.""

In response, Chalupa issued the following statement on her Facebook page:



I was a part time consultant for the DNC running a ethnic engagement program. I was not an opposition researcher for the DNC, and the DNC never asked me to go to the Ukrainian Embassy to collect information.

""First of all ... that's a pretty amazing part-time gig,"" Glenn commented. ""The DNC paid her [Chalupa] $71,000 in the election year alone. Wow, that is a lot of money for part time. Good gig, if you can get it.""

""Secondly, even if the DNC did not explicitly ask her to pump the Ukrainian Embassy for information, no one, including Chalupa, denies that she was defiantly pumping them for information, and it was all while she was on the DNC's payroll,"" Glenn added.

Watch the video below to hear Glenn expose the stunning proof of Chalupa's role as an opposition researcher in 2016 and her ""coincidental"" connections with the DNC, Clinton's campaign, and the government of Ukraine.

VIDEO: Glenn Beck exposes the real Biden-Ukraine scandal,"A media firestorm broke out last week over the ""whistleblower"" who alleged that President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine leaders to investigate 2020 Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden.

In August, an anonymous whistleblower filed allegations claiming that President Trump reached out to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and asked him to work with former New York City Mayor and current Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate corruption charges involving the former vice president and his son.

In 2014, when his father was vice president and working on foreign policy with Ukraine, Hunter Biden became a director of a Ukranian natural gas firm called Burisma Holdings, making a reported $50,000 per month. Burisma Holdings has been under investigation by Ukranian prosecutors for alleged tax evasion and money laundering.

Two years after leaving office, the former Vice President bragged, on camera, that he strong-armed then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko into firing the lead prosecutor on the Burisma investigation, by threatening to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee from the United States in 2016.

Over the weekend, Joe Biden told Fox News, "" I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" before calling for an investigation into President Trump's alleged phone call with Ukraine's president.

On Monday, President Trump claimed his call to the Ukrainian president was about making sure ""the country is honest"" and exposing any potential corruption.

""We're supporting a country; we want to make sure that country is honest,"" Trump said. ""It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?

On Monday's TV show, Glenn Beck, who has been looking into this story since April, took to the chalkboard to break down the details of how Vice President Biden steered billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, while his son Hunter partnered with John Kerry's stepson, Christopher Hines, and a friend named Devon Archer to rake in millions through a deal with Ukraine's largest oil company, Burisma Holdings.

On the TV show Thursday, Glenn Beck completely dismantled Kent's testimony -- which The Washington Post and others in the mainstream media say ""debunked"" right-wing ""conspiracy theories"" central to President Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry defense -- in part by using an official document written by Kent himself.

"2020 front-runner Joe Biden's Ukrainian corruption scandal, explained","UPDATE: Former Vice President Joe Biden officially launched his 2020 run for the White House on Thursday. He formally announced his bid for the Democratic nomination in a video released on social media.

This week on Glenn Beck's ""2020 Candidate Profile"" series, Glenn looked beyond former Vice President Joe Biden's troubles with touchiness, and did a deep-dive into the Democratic presidential candidate's alleged dirty dealings in the Ukraine.



After crediting journalists John Solomon and Peter Schweizer for their investigative fact-finding, Glenn launched into a detailed explanation of how Biden steered billions of dollars in aid to the Ukraine, while his son, Hunter Biden, raked in millions through a deal with a Ukrainian energy company.

""This blurs the ethical line so much that you can't even make out the line anymore. What Hunter Biden did may be technically legal, but it is grotesque. And the vice president should never have allowed this on his watch,"" Glenn said. ""This is as bad as anything the Clintons have done.""

Exclusive interview: Rudy Giuliani responds to Sondland impeachment testimony,"During the House impeachment hearings Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that President Donald Trump directed him ""to work with Mr. Rudy Giuliani"" — the president's personal attorney — in an effort to pressure Ukraine officials to investigate Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Hunter Biden.

""Secretary [Rick] Perry, Ambassador [Kurt] Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States,"" Sondland said in his opening statement. ""Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president's orders.""

Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee that Giuliani pressured Ukraine to announce the investigations in exchange for a White House meeting for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, and that the pressure campaign did, in his opinion, constitute as a quid pro quo.

""Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky,"" Sondland said. ""Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President.""

Giuliani joined Glenn Beck in an exclusive interview Wednesday to respond to Sondland's incriminating testimony and expose the information behind the Democrats' impeachment inquiry the mainstream media doesn't want you to know.

Sen Mike Lee: Democrats' impeachment case is 'absurd': Trump 'hasn't done anything impeachable',"Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined Glenn Beck on the TV show Tuesday to discuss this week's phase of the House impeachment inquiry.

Lee argued that the Democrats' allegations against President Donald Trump are ""absurd,"" and that Senate Republicans must call key witnesses, such as the whistleblower and former Democratic National Committee operative Alexandra Chalupa, to the stand.

""This is absurd,"" Lee said of the impeachment inquiry. ""They [the House] shouldn't pass articles of impeachment because he hasn't done anything impeachable. He hasn't done anything that violates the law. He hasn't even done anything that's wrong. He's just had a conversation that involved a foreign leader, and there was nothing wrong with that. So no, they shouldn't pass articles of impeachment.""



Glenn asked what Senate Republicans plan to do in the seemingly likely event that the House does pass articles of impeachment and why the Senate hasn't carried out their own investigation on corruption in Ukraine.

""I'm wondering why there hasn't been an investigation, or a Senate hearing,"" he said. ""I would be shocked, and I would not understand if the Senate -- even if there wasn't a full blown trial -- if they didn't have open hearings and call the whistleblower, and Chalupa, and everybody else that you haven't been able to talk to and find out, 'Wait a minute, what's the truth here? You've just spent all of this money, and all of this time, and what are you really doing in Ukraine?' Is that at least going to be exposed and addressed?""

""If in fact we call witnesses in the Senate at all, it's inconceivable that the whistleblower wouldn't be among them. It's inconceivable that we wouldn't hear from a number of additional witnesses with information about Burisma, with information that may shed some light on why President Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and within Burisma,"" explained Lee.

Lee added that even if the impeachment inquiry does not go to trial, he knows ""multiple committee chairmen within the United States Senate"" who intend to investigate what's really going on in Ukraine.

""I'm not going to speak for them because they told me this in private conversations very, very recently, but I can tell you that it's going to happen,"" he emphasized.

DEVELOPING: Alleged Hunter Biden laptop subpoenaed in FBI investigation,"Monday, Steven Crowder discussed new details involving data found on an abandoned laptop that allegedly belonged to Hunter Biden.

Watch the video for the full story.

Background

Last week, the New York Post published a ""smoking gun"" article that raised questions about how much Joe Biden knew of his son's dealings in Ukraine.

An email obtained by the New York Post mentioned a ""never-before-revealed"" meeting between Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma, Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden that took place in Washington, D.C.

""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to D.C. and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,"" the email reads.

According to the New York Post, ""An earlier email from May 2014 also shows Pozharskyi, reportedly Burisma's No. 3 exec, asking Hunter for 'advice on how you could use your influence' on the company's behalf.""

Did the MEDIA hold Biden and Trump to a different set of standards on foreign collusion allegations?,"Donald Trump Jr. joined Steven Crowder's Final Trump vs. Biden Debate Livestream and discussed how the media covered President Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden during the 2020 election.

In this clip, Crowder and Don Jr. compared Joe Biden's reaction when pressed on allegations of Ukrainian corruption to Donald Trump's response to allegations of working for Russia. Crowder explained how Trump ""unequivocally"" denied allegations of Russian collusion. But, when asked about corruption allegations involving Ukraine, Joe Biden snapped at a reporter with a sarcastic, ""Only you would ask that question.""

Next, Don Jr. and Steven took turns torching the mainstream media for its failure to press Joe Biden on allegations of corruption, holding secret meetings with Ukraine, peddling Iranian disinformation, and much more.

EXCLUSIVE: Giuliani tells Steven Crowder he has proof Hunter Biden's hard drive is authentic,"In an exclusive interview, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani dropped a bombshell that may add more evidence of Joe Biden's first-hand knowledge of business his son, Hunter Biden, conducted in Ukraine. This comes despite the Biden campaign and Big Tech lashing out at New York Post reports of Hunter Biden's secret emails found on a hard drive.



BlazeTV host Steven Crowder spoke to Guiliani on his livestream Thursday night and asked Guiliani to explain how he obtained the alleged Hunter Biden hard drive.

""Here's how I got it,"" Guiliani began. ""Hunter Biden dropped a laptop off to a repairman to repair it. The repairman took it, and Hunter Biden signed a receipt for it, which I have right here.""



Guiliani explained that Hunter Biden never returned to pick up the computer, and per store policy, after 90 days, the laptop became the property of the merchant.



According to Guiliani, the merchant became concerned when he heard talk about the Biden Ukraine scandal on TV, so he opened up the laptop to see if he had evidence in a criminal case. He says the merchant found information that contradicted the Biden narrative on Ukraine.



Crowder continued to press the former mayor to verify the authenticity of the hard drive and emails alleged to belong to Hunter Biden. Guiliani claimed, ""The very morning this [New York Post story] came out, Hunter Biden's lawyer called the [computer repair] merchant and asked him if he could have the hard drive back.""

Crowder asked Guiliani if he had evidence of the correspondence between Hunter Biden's lawyer and the computer repairman.

""[Biden's lawyer] actually did it by telephone and by email and we have the email,"" Guiliani said.



Crowder added that if true, this story is more significant than Watergate.

Elon Musk and SpaceX thwarted a Russian electromagnetic attack on Ukraine,"SpaceX — a company founded and owned by Elon Musk with the express intention of colonizing Mars — successfully stopped a Russian electromagnetic attack in Ukraine.

In March, Musk’s company worked at a breakneck pace to shut down Russian efforts to disconnect Ukrainians from the internet by jamming the country’s access to its Starlink satellite constellation.

Starlink is operated by SpaceX and provides internet coverage to 32 countries. The constellation consists of more than 2,000 mass-produced small satellites that reside in low orbit and communicate with designated transceivers on the Earth’s surface.

At the outset of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, when it became clear that the Russian government was going to target the Ukrainian people’s ability to communicate, Ukrainian officials pleaded with Musk to intervene and provide them with relief.

Dave Tremper, director of electronic warfare for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, lauded SpaceX’s ability to turn on a dime and swiftly stymie Russia’s efforts to jam the Starlink satellite’s ability to provide broadband.

Defense News reported that Tremper said, “The next day [after reports about the Russian jamming effort hit the media], Starlink had slung a line of code and fixed it, and suddenly that [Russian jamming attack] was not effective anymore. From [the] EW technologist’s perspective, that is fantastic … and how they did that was eye-watering to me.”

Tremper noted that it would have taken the American government considerably longer to counteract the Russian electromagnetic attack than it did Musk’s company.

Tremper said, “We need to be able to have that agility. We need to be able to change our electromagnetic posture to be able to change, very dynamically, what we’re trying to do without losing capability along the way.”

Noting that electromagnetic warfare requires very finely tuned machinery and highly skilled operators, Tremper said the Russian invasion of Ukraine indicated how important it was to make sure that American personnel were properly trained in electromagnetic warfare operations.

He said, “It is a very hard problem, if you don’t have well-trained operators. The degree of coordination and synchronization of these types of operations is such that the undertrained operator will have a harder time pulling off those types of events successfully.”

This is not the only time that Elon Musk has thwarted the Russians’ plans in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

When the Russian government threatened to drop the International Space Station on the Earth by ceasing to provide it with resources and technology for propulsion, Musk said that he would keep the station from falling onto the planet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657206014,2022-04-24
An Inspector General is going to investigate the Biden administration's response to the baby formula shortage,"An Inspector General from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will investigate the Biden administration’s response to the nationwide shortage of baby formula.

The ongoing formula shortage finds its roots in an Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan. Last fall, the Food and Drug Administration zeroed in on the Michigan Abbott facility while tracking several bacterial infections in infants who had consumed formula manufactured by the company. The four cases being tracked by the FDA occurred between September 2021 and January 2022. Two of the infants being tracked died, and the others were hospitalized.

The FDA was scheduled to begin a series of inspections of the Sturgis-based facility, but according to Abbott, the investigation was postponed due to an outbreak of COVID-19 among the company’s employees.

Previously, Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, told CNN that the Biden administration was working around the clock to “tackle the issue from every angle possible,” and that the Biden administration was aware of the impending shortage since this past February.

Deese confirmed that the Biden administration became aware of the impending shortage “when the FDA had to take its action back in February.”

In response to the Biden administration’s delayed reaction to the crisis, having not responded to the shortage until several months after it first became aware of it, HHS is going to investigate whether the FDA appropriately handled a baby formula recall from Abbott that has left shelves empty.

According to a statement from the White House, President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to “ensure that manufacturers have the necessary ingredients to make safe, healthy infant formula here at home” and launched Operation Fly Formula to “speed up the import of infant formula and get more formula to stores as soon as possible.”

Axios reported that in a prepared statement the HHS’s Office of the Inspector General said, “We will determine whether the FDA followed the inspections and recall process for infant formula in accordance with Federal requirements.”

Reportedly, the investigation will specifically look at whether the FDA’s actions preceding the February recall of potentially tainted formula from the Abbott facility in Michigan followed the correct policies and procedures when conducting inspections at the manufacturing facility in question.

The FDA is still unable to reach a conclusion as to whether the infant infections were caused by products made in the Michigan Abbott facility.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657457853,2022-06-04
Japan's prime minister is expected to participate in an upcoming NATO summit,"Fumio Kishida, the Prime Minister of Japan, is considering attending a summit of leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss the potential of Japanese collaboration with Western leaders over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Strait Times, a daily English language newspaper published in Singapore, reported that Kishida’s move marks an “unusually aggressive stance for a Japanese leader.” The Times also noted that Kishida has repeatedly condemned the Russian military and the country’s leadership over perpetrating what he has described as a “war crime” against Ukraine.

The leadership of Japan has a long-standing practice of carefully maintaining their country’s relationship with Russia as the two countries have a long history of territorial disputes.

A spokesperson for the Japanese government said that officials will be unable to offer comment on the Kishida’s discussions with NATO allies. Kishida’s attendance of the upcoming NATO summit was first reported by Japanese media outlets this past Saturday.

The NATO summit will take place on June 29 and 30 in the Spanish capital city of Madrid. The meeting is expected to overlap with the Kishida and other Japanese politicians campaign efforts as the meeting will overlap with the upcoming Japanese election cycle.

Kishida is expected to make a final decision as to whether or not he will attend the summit in the coming days as he must take into account the rapidly approaching elections.

NATO leaders have invited officials from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea to attend the summit as its partners in the Asia-Pacific region.

Should Kishida attend the summit, it is expected that his presence will be welcomed and send a strong message of international solidarity during a period of heightened geopolitical tension.

The potential of an increasing Japanese presence among NATO allies could also be a result of China’s potential invasion of Taiwan.

According to leaked audio from a top-secret meeting of Chinese officials, China may soon launch an extremely aggressive invasion of its island neighbor.

Voices on the leaked audio recording discuss the need to secure strategic entry points to crucial economic hubs in mainland China and how many pieces of military equipment and personnel will be required to pull off the invasion.

This past May, it was reported that China’s economic regulators held emergency meetings in April to discuss how to insulate the Chinese economy from Western sanctions should the West use economic isolation to discourage and punish China in the wake of a Taiwanese invasion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657460454,2022-06-05
North Korea launches more ballistic missiles as it prepares to test nuclear weapons,"On Sunday, the North Korean government launched eight ballistic missiles as the country’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, tries to establish the country as a global military force with nuclear capabilities.

The New York Post reported that South Korean military sources confirmed that the North Korean military launched the missiles over a span of 35 minutes near the capital city of South Korea, Pyongyang.

These missile launches are North Korea’s latest provocation of the international community and is the 18th round of missile tests conducted by the reclusive communist nation so far in 2022. This round of missile tests came just one day after the South Korean military conducted a naval drill in the Philippine Sea alongside the U.S. aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan.

Reportedly, North Korean leadership is preparing a nuclear test site in the town of Punggye-Ri as it plans to launch its first nuclear weapons test since 2017. Since 2006, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests.

Kim Jong Un has sought to make a global statement about the North’s military capabilities as it pushes to develop weapons that could potentially reach the U.S. mainland.

Nuclear disarmament discussions between the U.S. and the North stalled out over sanctions pursued against the North in 2019. Some experts believe that Kim’s strategy is to increase his military might so that his country may be able to negotiate from a position of strength on the international stage.

Recently, the U.S. pushed the United Nations Security Council to place further sanctions on North Korea to attempt and quell rising tensions over the North’s continued missile testing. This sanction package was vetoed by Russia and China.

The package vetoed by the two countries would have imposed sanctions on North Korea for its continued launching of intercontinental ballistic missiles that can be used to carry nuclear weapons.

After vetoing the measure, Chinese and Russian representatives said that the countries oppose implementing any further restrictions on North Korea and stressed the need for more dialogues to be held between North Korean and American leadership.

The last sanctions resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council in December of 2017 emphasized collaboration from member states as they committed to implementing further restrictions on petroleum exports to North Korea in response to the country’s continued ballistic missile tests. At this time, it was believed that North Korea’s missiles had intercontinental range.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657460596,2022-06-05
Gas hits record-breaking $5 average nationwide,"The national average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. exceeded $5 for the first time ever Thursday, crushing previous records according to a measure from GasBuddy.

The fuel savings company, which operates a travel and navigation app that helps North American drivers save money on gas, said prices have gone up 66 cents in the last month to reach Thursday's record high, which is the sixth price record set this year. Another measure by the American Automobile Association had the national average price of gas at $4.97 on Thursday.

Supply and demand factors remain the cause of high prices. GasBuddy said U.S. gasoline inventories have fallen over 25 million barrels, or one billion gallons, since March because of a global decline in refining capacity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased demand for gas as people want to travel for the summer. Crude oil prices are also rising as a result of international sanctions against Russia for the ongoing war in Ukraine. Countries that normally rely on Russian oil exports are no longer accepting them, which has reduced international supply of oil at a time of increased demand. Crude oil makes up more than half of the cost of gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.



These factors combined have pushed gas to $5 and beyond in many states, with no sign of prices coming down in the near future.

“It’s been one kink after another this year, and worst of all, demand doesn’t seem to be responding to the surge in gas prices, meaning there is a high probability that prices could go even higher in the weeks ahead,” said Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. ""It’s a perfect storm of factors all aligning to create a rare environment of rapid price hikes. The situation could become even worse should there be any unexpected issues at the nation’s refineries or a major hurricane that impacts oil production or refineries this summer.”

As prices keep going up, President Joe Biden's approval rating keeps going down, reaching a new low of 39% approval this week in the Morning Consult/Politico tracking poll. Americans say inflation is the biggest problem facing the nation, according to a recent Pew Research survey, and frustrations with Biden's failure to alleviate economic pain is reflected in his poll numbers.

Republican critics charge that the administration has treated the fossil fuel industry with hostility, canceling new oil and gas leases and opposing the Keystone XL pipeline project, and this has prevented oil and gas companies from expanding production. The White House counters that gas prices are dependent on factors largely outside the administration's control, and that new oil leases would not have an immediate effect on prices because production won't begin on that land for several years.

Biden has also accused oil and gas companies of price gouging and raking in record profits because of high prices. But industry experts have pushed back against this claim, asserting that oil companies are price takers, not price setters.

While Biden is not solely to blame for high gas prices, his critics and voters say he could be doing more to address the issue.

There will be a Sriracha shortage this summer,"Hot sauce lovers may soon find themselves in hot water as a looming shortage of Sriracha may soon leave grocery store shelves barren of the popular condiment.

Huy Fong Inc., the Southern California-based manufacturer of Sriracha, confirmed that due to a global shortage of chili peppers, it will be suspending the sale of its iconic condiments, The Guardian reported.

In an email issued to loyal customers this past Spring, Huy Fong Inc. described the pepper shortage as “severe” and was related to climate change.

The company reportedly sources many of its peppers from various farms across California, New Mexico, and Mexico, and indicated that weather conditions affecting the poor quality of peppers being grown in these locations are deepening the shortage of chili peppers.

In the company’s email, it was indicated that all orders submitted after April 19 would be fulfilled after Labor Day.

“Unfortunately, this is out of our control, and without this essential ingredient we are unable to produce any of our products,” the company said.

The company added, “We understand this may cause issues. However, during this time we will not accept any new orders to be placed before September as we will not have enough inventory to fulfill your order.”

Hot temperatures and a historically merciless drought across the western regions of the U.S. have been taking a heavy toll on the farmlands where Huy Fong Inc.’s chili peppers are grown. The U.S. Drought Monitor reported that the whole state of California is in a “severe drought” with the state’s Central Valley facing “extreme drought” conditions.

The imminent inability to purchase Sriracha is just the latest shortage to impact American consumers.

In late May, a top U.S. general suggested that the grain shortages were going to get so much worse that the U.S. military might need to conduct manned missions to help Ukraine export grain that is currently unable to be exported due to Russian blockades along the Black Sea coast. It’s unclear, at this time, what such an approach would entail.

Also in late May, the out-of-stock rates for baby formula soared to 70%. Baby formula is not expected to be restocked until mid-July at the soonest. The Abbott Nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan was not able to restart production on baby formula until recently on June 4.

An Inspector General from the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to investigate the Biden administration’s response to the shortage of baby formula.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657495875,2022-06-11
Biden plans to break with his own precedent as he moves closer to buying oil from Saudi Arabia,"President Biden is expected to extend an olive branch to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after promising to make him a ""pariah"" and working to isolate the Saudi regime for months.

On Monday, the White House confirmed that Biden is planning to visit the oil-rich nation this summer, marking the culmination of an 18-month standoff between Biden and the crown prince. Biden is trying to wind up back in the crown prince's good graces as gas prices soar amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Insider News reported that attempts by U.S. officials to convince the Saudis to increase their oil production have thus far been unsuccessful. Reportedly, the crown prince has repeatedly ignored phone calls from Biden when the president has sought to discuss issues of oil availability.

Displaying how vulnerable and dependent the U.S. is on foreign oil, Biden recently directly asked the crown prince to increase Saudi Arabia's oil output.

The Biden administration has previously made an active attempt at keeping the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at arm's length as the president refused to meet with the crown prince for months. The Biden administration may have even issued a personal offense to the crown prince when it said that Biden should deal directly with the crown prince's father.

The U.S. also has a history of sanctioning Saudi officials. Following the circulation of a declassified intelligence report regarding the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Khashoggi's murder was likely ordered by the crown prince.

Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia signals that it is no longer tenable for the Biden administration to adamantly oppose nations that could help alleviate domestic policy woes.

Adam Ereli, a former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, said, ""Do you hold a relationship hostage to human-rights concerns or you can move forward while not abandoning your moral high ground? In his mind, Biden can move forward.""

Despite receiving heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and domestic activists, Biden and the White House insist that any meeting between Biden and the crown prince would serve the immediate interests of the U.S.

Last Friday, Biden said, ""Look, I'm not going to change my view on human rights. But as president of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657497848,2022-06-12
Egypt and Israel are increasing oil exports to Europe to compensate for the EU's embargo on Russian fuel products,"On Wednesday, the countries of Egypt and Israel penned a deal with the European Union to increase liquid natural gas sales to EU member states that are hoping to reduce their dependency on petroleum-based fuel products from Russia.

The deal, which was finalized in a ritzy Egyptian hotel, will require Israel to send gas to Egypt for it to be liquified and then shipped to EU member states, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ABC News reported.

“What a special moment,” von der Leyen proclaimed in a joint press conference alongside representatives of the Egyptian and Israeli governments. “I very warmly welcome the signing of this historic agreement.”

It is not currently clear how much gas will be imported by EU member states from either Egypt or Israel.

Von der Leyen indicated that this new agreement is part of Europe’s ongoing efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russian imports. It highlights an active attempt by the EU to import hydrocarbons from what is labeled “other trustworthy suppliers.”

Von der Leyen indicated that Israel and Egypt are ideal suppliers because of their good relations with EU member states and since both countries discovered large supplies of natural gas off shore.

This new deal will also help Egypt and Israel increase their gas production and drilling explorations in their territorial waters.

During a separate press conference with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, von der Leyen said, “It is known that the Russian war against Ukraine has exposed our European dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and we want to get rid of this dependency.”

In 2021, the EU imported roughly 40% of its gas from Russia and has had immense difficulty imposing sanctions on Russian fuel imports since Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated his country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Israeli Energy Minister Karin Elharrar said the new arrangement was a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in a widespread European energy crisis. She said that the agreement also highlights the increasing cooperation and further strengthening of relations between Egypt and Israel, two nations that used to be enemies.

Elharrar said, “This is a statement to those who see in our region only negative forces such as division and conflict. This (memorandum of understanding) shows us that we are paving a new path of partnership, solidarity, and sustainability.”

Egypt’s Petroleum Minister Tarek el-Molla said that the deal is “an important milestone” for cooperation between the three parties.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657514790,2022-06-15
Republicans blast Biden's gas tax holiday as 'fake fix',"With his poll numbers flailing, President Joe Biden on Wednesday will call for Congress to suspend the federal gas and diesel taxes over the summer to provide relief for American drivers amid record-high gas prices.

If Congress acts, the 18-cent tax per gallon on gas and 24-cent tax per gallon on diesel fuel would be lifted for a three-month period that would coincide with an expected surge in demand for gas as people travel during the summer.

The White House released a fact sheet on the proposal Wednesday morning.

“A federal gas tax suspension alone won’t fix the problem we face, but it will provide families a little breathing room as we continue working to bring down prices for the long haul,” a senior administration official told reporters on a call before the announcement, according to The Hill.

The White House acknowledged that a gas tax suspension is only a temporary action and that in the long term, the tax is needed for the Highway Trust Fund.

""President Biden understands that a gas tax holiday alone will not, on its own, relieve the run-up in costs that we’ve seen. But the President believes that at this unique moment when the war in Ukraine is imposing costs on American families, Congress should do what it can to provide working families breathing room,"" the White House said.

State and federal gas taxes make up about 16.4% of the average retail price for a gallon of gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Proponents of the gas tax holiday say it's a quick and easy way to lower prices at the pump. But Republicans and energy experts criticized the president's proposal, calling it a ""fake fix"" and suggesting it will lead to higher prices overall.

""Joe Biden has caused gas prices to hit historic highs by killing American energy and implementing 39 new regulations and executive orders,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tweeted. ""Suspending the gas tax will not fix Biden's energy crisis. It's a fake fix.""



""Biden's gas tax 'holiday' won't increase supply. Instead, it will increase demand while saving just ~6% of Biden's gas price hike,"" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said. ""It's a bad idea that won't help, but it's par for the course from this incompetent White House.""

The Republican National Committee resurfaced 2008 video of then-candidate Barack Obama slamming a ""gas tax holiday"" as a ""gimmick"" that wasn't real energy policy.

Daniel Turner, the executive director and founder of the nonprofit energy group Power the Future, called Biden's plan a ""transparent election year gimmick.""

“Amid its litany of failures, the Biden Administration has succeeded at creating record inflation, and they have done so by strangling American energy production to appease the eco-extremists. Rather than a temporary gas tax suspension, Joe Biden should permanently suspend pursuit of the green policies that have upended our way of life and sent our economy spiraling,"" Turner said.

President Biden will pitch his plan to the American people in a speech Wednesday afternoon. He will also call on Congress to find $10 billion in other revenues to make up the cost of the tax holiday and fund the Highway Trust Fund.

'America Last in action': $1.7 trillion omnibus bill to fund border security for Arab nations,"U.S. Senate leaders made clear in their new $1.7 trillion federal government funding bill that border security is a priority deserving of American taxpayer dollars, particularly when the borders concerned happen to hem foreign nations thousands of miles away.



According to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the bill seeks to appropriate $772.5 billion for non-defense discretionary funding and $858 billion for defense funding.

The bill would allocate:

$44.9 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies;

$40.6 billion to disaster relief;

$47.5 billion to the National Institutes of Health;

$575 million for so-called ""family planning/reproductive health ... in areas where population growth threatens biodiversity"";

nearly $7 billion to combat HIV/ AIDS in foreign nations; and

hundreds of billions more to a variety of Democrat pet causes, including a ""LGBTQ+"" museum in New York City and a federal building named after outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The authors of the bill also saw fit to once again bolster the borders of Middle Eastern nations with U.S. tax dollars: $410 million ""shall be available to reimburse Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman ... for enhanced border security.""

At least ""$150,000,000 shall be for Jordan,"" a country whose human rights practices the U.S. State Department has called into question.

""Up to $500,000,000 of funds appropriated by this Act for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in 'Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide' may be used to provide assistance to the Government of Jordan to support the armed forces of Jordan and to enhance security along its borders,"" said the bill.

Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) highlighted these planned Middle Eastern border expenditures, noting, ""America Last in action.""

These allocations are not unprecedented. Contrariwise, they appear to be reprints from previous appropriations acts, which have had American funds shore up the defenses of Arab nations for years — especially Jordan.

According to the State Department, America has a long-standing commitment to Jordan's security and stability.

While the Biden administration helped ""Jordan mitigate the effects of regional crises, including the strain of refugees from Syria and Iraq on Jordan's budget,"" over 2.3 million criminal noncitizens stole across the southern border and into the U.S. last year, and 1.7 million came over the year before.

2 US soldiers captured 3 months ago while fighting in Ukraine to return home: Report,"Two men from Alabama who were captured after volunteering to aid Ukrainian forces against the aggressions of the Russian military will soon return home to their families, reports say.

Alex Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, were fighting together in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine on June 9 when they were apprehended and taken captive by a Russian-supported separatist group known as the Donetsk People's Republic, a quasi nation-state within Ukraine that has not been recognized by the United States.

""We are thrilled to announce that Alex and Andy are free,"" the families said in a joint statement. ""They are safely in the custody of the US embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the States.""

Because the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with the DPR, others had to negotiate for the release of Drueke and Huynh. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia announced that it had managed to secure from the DPR the release of 10 total foreign national prisoners, representing the U.S., the United Kingdom, Morocco, Sweden, and Croatia.

Drueke and Huynh are said to be ""in pretty good shape,"" according to Drueke's aunt, Dianna Shaw.

Drueke, an Army veteran, and Huynh, a marine veteran who originally hails from California, lived approximately 120 away from each other in Alabama when they both decided to enlist with Ukrainian forces back in April. Drueke, who first joined the Army after the attacks on 9/11, thought that his experience would be helpful. Huyhn, meanwhile, said that he could not get the plight of the Ukrainian people out of his mind.

""I know it wasn't my problem, but there was that gut feeling that I felt I had to do something,"" Huynh said before he left. ""Two weeks after the war began, it kept eating me up inside and it just felt wrong. I was losing sleep. ... All I could think about was the situation in Ukraine.""

During their captivity, the two men formed a friendship over their home state and their determination to help Ukraine. Drueke was able to have limited contact with family and friends while in DPR. If Huynh had contact with his family during that time, it hasn't been reported.

It is unclear when exactly the two men will return to the U.S. The U.S. State Department has not issued a comment about their release.

5th-grade boy arrested after allegedly threatening to carry out mass shooting: 'Now is not the time to act like a little delinquent',"A 10-year-old Florida boy was arrested over the weekend after allegedly threatening to carry out a mass shooting.

What are the details?

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office said it learned on Saturday of a threatening text message sent by a fifth-grade student at Patriot Elementary School in Cape Coral.

The School Threat Enforcement Team was immediately notified and began analytical research, the sheriff's office said, adding that the Youth Services Criminal Investigations Division assumed the case.

Detectives interviewed the suspect and determined there was probable cause for his arrest, authorities said, adding that that boy was charged with making a written threat to conduct a mass shooting.

“This student’s behavior is sickening, especially after the recent tragedy in Uvalde, Texas,” Sheriff Carmine Marceno said. “Making sure our children are safe is paramount. We will have law and order in our schools! My team didn’t hesitate one second…NOT ONE SECOND, to investigate this threat.”

Marceno added that ""right now is not the time to act like a little delinquent. It’s not funny. This child made a fake threat, and now he’s experiencing real consequences.""

'We are going to kill them'

The day before authorities discovered the 10-year-old boy's alleged mass shooting threat, the Lee County Sheriff's Office posted a video showing Marceno standing in front of six armed deputies — three of them in tactical gear — and issuing a stern warning to those who may be thinking of copying the Uvalde, Texas, mass killer.

Marceno said those in Lee County who ""go into a school [and] present deadly force, they will be met with deadly force immediately. We are going to kill them. We're not gonna hesitate. We're not gonna wait ... You don't get to shoot our children.""

He added that ""haters"" who believe he's issuing such statements for publicity ""are motivators.""

""If you have an issue with me saying, 'we meet deadly force with deadly force,' or you have an issue with me saying, 'when someone presents deadly force against our children, we are absolutely going to annihilate and kill them,' then I don't want your vote,"" Marceno added. ""I don't care what you think. And we have no issue in talking about that, because there's nothing else to say.""

He made no bones about his politics, either, calling Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ""great"" and also stating, ""We spend over 50 billion dollars in helping out the Ukraine. How much of that money goes to target-hardening our schools, school safety, making sure that our children come home — which is most important?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/5th-grader-arrested-shooting-threat,2022-05-30
"70,000 take to the streets in Prague to protest Czech government, EU & NATO","An estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague against the Czech government over the weekend. The protesters expressed anger over soaring energy prices and voiced opposition to the European Union and NATO.

Czech inflation, according to Bloomberg, is currently the highest since 1993. The Czech central bank forecasts inflation to peak at around 20% in the coming months.

Those protesting represented a wide swath of the political spectrum, as supporters of groups ranging from the “major anti-migrant populist” Freedom and Direct Democracy party to the Communist Party showed up, ABC News reported.

""The aim of our demonstration is to demand change, mainly in solving the issue of energy prices, especially electricity and gas, which will destroy our economy this autumn,"" event co-organizer Jiri Havel told iDNES.cz news website.

In addition to questioning the Czech government’s ability to reverse the rise in energy prices, protesters condemned the Czech government for supporting sanctions against Russia. The demonstrators also criticized the European Union’s (EU) plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reach climate neutrality, according to the Associated Press. The Czech Republic is a member of the EU.

Zuzana Majerová Zahradníková of the anti-EU Trikolora party told protesters, “Fiala’s government may be Ukrainian, it may be Brussels, but it is definitely not Czech.” The EU is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The Czech Republic has been an avid supporter of Ukraine in its battle against Russia and has donated weaponry to the Ukrainian armed forces.

""The protest on Wenceslas Square was called by forces that are pro-Russian, are close to extreme positions and are against the interests of the Czech Republic,"" said Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala. Fiala criticized the demonstrators, claiming they were expressing pro-Russia views “that are not in the interest of the Czech Republic and our citizens.” Fiala’s collation government survived a vote of no confidence on Friday.

The Guardian reports that Pavel Blažek – the Czech Republic’s minister of justice and a member of Fiala’s party – warned last week of the risks involved in not addressing the country’s energy issues. “If the energy crisis is not resolved, the political system of this country is at risk,” Blažek said.

73% of Americans agree that extreme political views are hyped by misinformation — like that pushed by the liberal media in these 5 instances,"The latest Pearson Institute/AP-NORC survey was published on Thursday, revealing that Americans overwhelmingly agree that misinformation is a problem. Of the 1,003 adults aged 18 and older who were interviewed between September 9 and September 12, 77% agreed that ""misinformation increases hate crimes"" and 73% agreed it increases ""extreme political views.""

Sheila Kohanteb, forum executive director at the Pearson Institute for Study and Resolution of Global Conflict, said, ""The public continues to see misinformation as a significant problem that is impacting them personally.""



""Many are also worried about the impact on democracy including the ways misinformation fuel hate crimes and extreme political beliefs,"" Kohanteb added.

David Sterrett, senior research scientist with the AP-NORC Center, said of the results, ""There is a consensus among people, regardless of their partisanship, age, or race and ethnicity, that misinformation is a problem.""

MediaWise's director, Alex Mahadevan, suggested that ""uncertainty, polarization, [and] the decline of local news"" have brought about a ""perfect storm that's created a flood of misinformation.""

While the AP assigned blame to ""online misinformation,"" this universal concern over the veracity of false claims and their fallout was no doubt exacerbated in part by a myriad of consequential lies advanced by the establishment media in recent months and years.

Here are five instances where impactful false claims were advanced or amplified by liberal mainstream news organizations.

1. Russian Collusion Hoax



Claim: Then-candidate and later-President Donald Trump and his team conspired with the Russians to secure victory in the 2016 presidential election.

Impact: The false narrative and its supporting claims ultimately resulted in the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller; a two-year-long $32 million Russia probe; a midterm Democratic House victory; a distracted, investigation-addled presidency; and over 55% of Democrats left believing it to be true.

Facts: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 2019 report cleared the Trump campaign, indicating that neither the president nor his team had conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election.

The Russian source of some of the rumors that were widely circulated about Trump is presently on trial and the Steele dossier, which the FBI used to spy on Trump, has been discredited.

2. Hunter Biden laptop story



Claim: The Hunter Biden laptop story initially reported on by the New York Post is Russian disinformation, ""unverifiable,"" and the libelous work of the Trump campaign.

Impact: The media, aided by Big Tech censorship and elements of the intelligence community antipathetic to Trump, successfully downplayed the implications of the damning evidence discovered on Hunter Biden's laptop, which he abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop.

The repair shop's owner received countless death threats and was roundly castigated.

Then-candidate Joe Biden won the 2020 election. A recent TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics poll found that 79% of respondents indicated that “a truthful interpretation of the laptop” by the media would have resulted in Trump's reelection.

Facts: The laptop's authenticity and its contents were verified by the liberal media after the election.

3. 'Fiery, But Mostly Peaceful' riots

Claim: The BLM riots ""were largely peaceful.""

Impact: This and other coordinated efforts to downplay violence committed by BLM rioters allegedly eliminated pressure on politicians to take action while also generating greater distrust in the news media.

Facts: In September 2020, Axios reported that the BLM riots incurred $1 billion in damage and was the ""most expensive in insurance history."" Other estimates put the cost closer to $2 billion.

Of the 8,700 BLM-related events, 574 involved violent acts in over 140 cities, including shootings, arson, looting, vehicular crimes, and explosions.

RealClear Investigations reported that between 6 and 20 persons were killed in the riots.

1 police officer was killed and 2,037 officers were assaulted or injured. 16,241 arrests were made.

4. Deaths at the Jan. 6 Capitol protests

Claim: Five cops were killed by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, one of whom was bludgeoned to death.

Impact: Liberal outlets' suggestion that protesters killed police at or as the result of the Capitol protests lent credibility to those who repeated the lie for political advantage, including the president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and January 6 committee panel chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).

Facts: The only person killed at the Capitol was a protester, U.S. Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, who was gunned down by Capitol police Lt. Michael Byrd.

No police officers died in the line of duty during the Capitol protests.



Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who was claimed to have been killed in or as the result of the fracas, returned to headquarters in ""good condition"" after the incident, but suffered two strokes the following day, reportedly dying of natural causes.

5. Nick Sandmann

Claim: Then-16-year-old Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann tried to intimidate a native American Vietnam War veteran when attending the March for Life at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. When the native elder sought to peacefully march by, Sandmann blocked his way and then prevented him from retreating. At some stage, Sandmann or one of his peers chanted ""build the wall.""

Impact: Sandmann was defamed as a ""racist kid,"" received death threats, and was the subject of vicious, violent rhetoric amplified by celebrities and others online.

CNN, the Washington Post, and NBC were among the outfits that had to settle multimillion-dollar defamation suits filed by Sandmann.

Facts: While waiting for their bus to arrive, Sandmann and his peers were targeted by a nearby group of black Hebrew Israelites, who leveled at them a litany of vulgar, racist remarks. Sandmann reportedly nonverbally motioned for one of his peers to stop engaging with one of Phillips' alleged associates, then nonconfrontationally stood in place.



Nathan Phillips, who is not a Vietnam War veteran, approached Sandmann, banging his drum just inches from the teen's face.

An independent investigation concluded there was no evidence that Sandmann and fellow students used ""offensive or racist"" statements. It also found that Phillips' account of the incident contained ""some inconsistencies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/73-of-americans-agree-that-extreme-political-views-are-hyped-by-misinformation-like-the-liberal-media-pushed-in-these-five-instances,2022-10-14
A former Obama aide will reportedly be charged as a result of Mueller investigation findings,"Former President Barack Obama's first White House counsel expects to be charged in connection with alleged crimes uncovered during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to The Washington Post.

Former Obama aide Gregory Craig was interviewed twice by Mueller's office as a part of Mueller's investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Why would he be charged? Craig, who was Obama's White House counsel from 2009 until 2010, went on to work for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

The firm was hired by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's Justice Ministry in 2012. Skadden produced a report on the prosecution and imprisonment of one of Yanukovych's political rivals, Yulia ­Tymoshenko. That imprisonment was widely condemned in the west, and some human rights advocates accused Skadden of whitewashing what actually happened.



Craig, as a part of his work for Skadden, had numerous contacts with U.S. reporters to discuss the report, which had been disseminated by Paul Manafort, among others, to help Ukraine's image.

The Justice Department investigated whether Craig should've registered as a foreign lobbyist for his work on behalf of Ukraine. Craig's lawyers believe he will soon be charged for providing false statements to the Justice Department about his activities.

Skadden already paid a $4.6 million settlement to the Justice Department in January after admitting to misleading the government about its Ukrainian work and specifically blaming Craig for the false info.

What does Craig have to say? Craig hasn't addressed this publicly yet, but his legal representatives issued a statement in advance of the expected charges, according to The Wall Street Journal.

""This case was thoroughly investigated by the SDNY and that office decided not to pursue charges against Mr. Craig. We expect an indictment by the DC US Attorney's Office at the request of the National Security Division. Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion,"" lawyers for Mr. Craig said in a statement.

A prominent law firm that defends liberal media stars and celebrities is currently representing Russian oligarchs tied to Putin and the Steele dossier despite Western sanctions,"Update: In a statement to TheBlaze, Clare Locke LLP indicated that the firm's business relationship with the Russian oligarchs ""has concluded.""

In the immediate aftermath of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Western nations and institutions moved to cripple the Russian economy through the swift implementation of thoroughgoing sanctions.

In late February, the European Commission — the executive branch of the European Union — along with leadership from France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement declaring their intention to prevent Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT communications network.

In doing so, Western leaders effectively made it impossible for Russia to participate in international trade using the necessary financial infrastructure established by the SWIFT network. Western leaders also took it upon themselves to sanction “the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine” and to “limit the sale of citizenship … that let wealthy Russians connected to the government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.”

Western governments locked arms and declared their opposition to Russia’s invasion, and Western companies began to divest and terminate their dealings within the Russian marketplace. These sanctions and divestments led Russian oligarchs to seek refuge outside of Russia and its new Western rivals’ borders so that they might not have their wealth drained by them.

However, these oligarchs are not without any allies in the West.

The well-known US-based law firm Clare Locke LLP has maintained its relationship with Russian oligarchs Mikhail Friedman, Petr Aven, and German Khan.

The oligarchs repped by Clare Locke have been sanctioned by both the European Union and the United Kingdom for their close ties to Putin and are “locked in litigation against D.C.-based research firm Fusion GPS over allegations in the infamous Steele dossier,” reported the Daily Beast.

Aside from alleged allies of Putin, the Daily Beast also reported that former clients of Clare Locke include “60 Minutes” Executive Producer Jeff Fager, who hired the firm to “effectively neuter” a Washington Post investigation into him; former “Today” show host Matt Lauer; and New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush.

The firm consists of a husband-and-wife duo who established themselves by providing legal defense for men accused of misconduct during the #MeToo era and aggressively pursuing suits against media institutions.

Clare Locke’s website proudly proclaims that the firm’s client list also includes, “Fortune 100 companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, professional sports teams, CEOs, journalists, and other prominent individuals who – by virtue of their success, public profile, and nationally recognized brands – are unfairly targeted by the media.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-prominent-law-firm-that-has-represented-liberal-media-stars-is-currently-defending-russian-oligarchs-tied-to-putin-and-the-steele-dossier,2022-04-02
A top US general suggested there could be a 'military component' if NATO helps Ukraine export grain,"A top U.S. general recently suggested the U.S. military conduct operations to help Ukraine export grain that is being held up as a result of Russian blockades along the Black Sea Coast.

Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who has been nominated to the next commander of NATO, told U.S. senators at a hearing on Thursday that he would consider offering military options to allow for grain exports to resume, the Epoch Times reported.

When asked what he would do, Cavoli said that if he is to be confirmed he would “provide the military options required by our civilian leaders.”

He told lawmakers present at the hearing, “Clearly the way we would approach that would have to be a whole-of-government approach, which may or may not include a military component.”

It’s unclear at this time what Cavoli’s approach would entail. Whether Cavoli would encourage sending U.S. troops to directly engage with Russian forces or the military being involved with alternative means to ship grain remains to be seen.

Ukraine is one of the world’s top exporters of wheat, sunflower oil, and canola oil and due to Russian forces blockading a Ukrainian port in the Black Sea Coast there is a burgeoning global shortage of these essential supplies.

Cavoli noted that U.S. sanctions against Russia in response to Russia President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine have contributed to global shortages of grain.

“The grain s hortages that we’re experiencing from both Russia and Ukrainian production being unable to come out of the countries in large volumes or being sanctioned and not being sold are being felt on the African continent,” Cavoli stated.

About a week ago, an analyst warned the United Nations Security Council that the invasion of Ukraine is adding “fuel to a fire that was long-burning” and that there are only about 10 weeks of worth of wheat supplies left across the globe.

The analyst, Gro Intelligence CEO Sara Menker said, “I want to start by explicitly saying that the Russia-Ukraine war did not start the food security crisis. It simply added fuel to a fire that was long burning. A crisis we detected tremors from long before the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of our supply chains.”

Long before the invasion of Ukraine commenced this past February, there have been intense droughts and weather issues across the globe contributing to the now intensifying grain shortage.

Menker said, “I share this because we believe it’s important for you all to understand that even if the war were to end tomorrow, our food security problem isn’t going away anytime soon without concerted action.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-top-us-general-suggested-there-could-be-a-military-component-if-nato-is-to-help-ukraine-export-grain,2022-05-29
Poll finds that many do not think Biden will run again,"A whopping 52% of the Americans surveyed in a Wall Street Journal poll do not believe that President Joe Biden will seek re-election, while only 29% think he will seek a second term — the outlet linked to another article about the poll which noted that the survey involved registered voters.

The poll found that just 41% of Democrats think that the president will seek re-election, while 32% do not think he will do so.

When David Muir of ABC News asked Biden in December if he plans to seek re-election, the president said ""Yes,"" but added the caveat that he will run if he has ""good health.""

ABC exclusive: Biden on running for re-election l ABC News www.youtube.com

Biden, who is already the oldest U.S. president in history, will be 82-years-old at the the end of his current term. If re-elected, he will be 86-years-old by the end of his second term.

""I don't think President Biden is going to run—not simply because of his age, but he's been doing this for a very long time. You can hear it in his voice. You don't hear the same level of energy and enthusiasm,"" Georgia state Rep. Derrick Jackson, said, according to the Journal. Jackson, a Democrat, is running for lieutenant governor in the Peach State.

The outlet reported that a Democratic legislator, who did not want to be named, said that lawmakers hoped Biden would not make a mistake while delivering the State of the Union address: ""Everybody was very pleasantly surprised with the State of the Union address and breathed a sigh of relief when it was over,"" the legislator remarked.



""Do I think he's the best candidate ever? No. Maybe I'd be more interested in someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez than him,"" said Garr Van Orden, a stay-at-home father from Utah. ""But I think he'll run again, and I will vote for him.""

Actors Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher pledge $3 million in donations to aid Ukraine,"Ukrainian-born actress Mila Kunis and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, have pledged to donate up to $3 million to aid Ukrainian citizens fleeing from their war-torn country as Russia continues its deadly invasion.

What are the details?

In a Thursday video shared to his Twitter account, Kutcher and Kunis said that they were ""proud"" of Kunis's heritage and intended to provide aid for Ukrainian refugees.

“I was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine in 1983. I came to America in 1991,"" Kunis explained. ""I have always considered myself American, a proud American, I love everything that this country has done for myself and my family. But today, I have never been more proud to be a Ukrainian.""

Kutcher added, “And I’ve never been more proud to be married to a Ukrainian.""

“The events that have unfolded in Ukraine are devastating. There is no place in this world for this kind of unjust attack on humanity,” Kunis continued, and vowed to match up to $3 million in donations for refugee relief via GoFundMe.

Fox News reported that the funds will be distributed to necessary causes through Flexport.org and Airbnb.org, which have been assisting needy and fleeing Ukrainians.

“While we witness the bravery of the people of the country that she was born in we’re also witness to the needs of those who have chosen safety,"" Kutcher explained. ""We’re raising funds to support a relief effort that will have immediate impact and supply much needed refugee and humanitarian aid in the area. The principal challenge right now is logistics. We need to get housing, and we need to get supplies and resources into the area.""

"Rep. Kinzinger calls for the establishment of a no-fly zone above Ukraine: 'The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west'","As brave Ukrainian citizens battle invading Russian forces, GOP Rep.

Kinzinger described the situation in dramatic fashion: ""The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west. Declare a #NoFlyZone over Ukraine at the invitation of their sovereign govt. Disrupt Russias air ops to give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight. It’s now, or later,"" he tweeted.

""History teaches that taking a stand is inevitable and gets more costly with time. We own the skies, Russia cannot hold a candle to our Air power. Do this. Putin is too dangerous to hope he is satisfied with 'just Ukraine,'"" he added.

Some people on social media pushed back against the idea.

""This psycho -- held up as some Profile in Courage by establishment liberals who still wake up every morning distraught about January 6 -- is now demanding direct US military hostilities with Russia, which Putin said would precipitate nuclear war. So that's where we're at,"" one person wrote in response to Kinzinger.

Adam Kinzinger introduced a resolution authorizing the US military to engage Russia if Putin uses WMDs,"On Sunday, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said that he introduced a resolution to authorize the U.S. military to engage in combat with Russia should the Russian military use chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Kinzinger said while on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that any such attack in Ukraine would be a “clear red line.” He said that if his proposed resolution was passed by Congress, it would give President Joe Biden the authorization to allow the U.S. to provide military assistance to Ukraine.

The New York Post reported that Kinzinger said, “I don’t think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. I just introduced an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, giving the president basically congressional leverage for permission to use it if [weapons of mass destruction] — nuclear, biological, or chemical — are used in Ukraine.”

Kinzinger said the authorization would provide Biden leverage while also serving as a deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kinzinger said that his resolution wouldn’t ""compel the president to [use military force]. It just says if [WMDs are] used, he has the leverage. It gives him better flexibility, but also it is a deterrent to Vladimir Putin.""

Shortly after his appearance on CBS, Kinzinger released a statement on his official Congressional Twitter account that said, “Words matter, but so do our actions. I’m introducing this AUMF as a clear redline so @POTUS can take appropriate action if Russia uses chemical, biological, and/or nuclear weapons. We must stand up for humanity and we must stand with our allies.”





In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress passed an AUMF. In doing so, the national legislature authorized former President George W. Bush to use the U.S. military to launch military campaigns in the pursuit of punishing the terror groups that launched the attacks.



Congress approved a similar AUMF for the 2002 invasion of Iraq.

Kinzinger said that the U.S. must similarly be ready to engage in military conflict on behalf of Ukraine.

Kinzinger said, “Prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to. I hope we don’t get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-kinzinger-russia-war,2022-05-01
Adam Schiff apparently mischaracterized further 'evidence' in impeachment: report,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) may have mischaracterized new ""evidence"" he wants presented in the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, according to a new report, adding to an existing list of occasions when the congressman has been discredited after making assertions against the president.

What are the details?

Politico reported Tuesday that in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) a week ago, Schiff wrote that Lev Parnas — an associate of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani — ""continued to try to arrange a meeting with [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenksy"" providing a text exchange in which Parnas told Giuliani, ""trying to get us mr Z.""

But an unredacted version of the supplemental documentation obtained by Politico, the outlet says, shows the cited reference to 'Mr. Z"" was referring to Mykola Zlochevsky, the founder of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma—not to President Zelensky.



Burisma is the company that has been the subject of several corruption probes by Ukrainian authorities, and its employment of Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, has been an issue House Democrats have dismissed as irrelevant to the impeachment efforts against President Trump.

Politico referred to Schiff's mischaracterization as ""a possible error the GOP will likely criticize as another example of the Democrats' rushed effort to impeach President Donald Trump.""

The ""possible error"" by Schiff is also another example of the congressman being discredited.

The California Democrat claimedrepeatedly prior to the finalization of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that there was ""ample evidence"" that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Of course, the report concluded that there was no evidence of collusion on the part of the Trump campaign.

After President Trump released the transcript of a phone call between himself and President Zelensky last year in an attempt to show he was innocent of the allegations House Democrats alleged were grounds for impeachment, Schiff delivered his own fictional version of what President Trump said in the call as part of his opening statement at a House Intelligence Committee hearing.

Schiff later called his fabricated rendition ""a parody.""

On Tuesday, arguing as a House impeachment manager on the Senate floor, Schiff asserted President Zelensky was afraid to admit Democrats' claims that he was pressured by President Trump to re-up an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. Once again, Schiff delivered a ""parody,"" this time of what he believes Zelensky would say. President Zelensky has said he did not feel pressured by President Trump.

House Intel Chair Adam Schiff claims during impeachment hearing that he does not know the whistleblower's identity,"During the first public impeachment hearing Wednesday, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower who started the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.

At the beginning of the hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asked Schiff when the committee would be able to vote on having the whistleblower testify.

""You are the only member who knows who that individual is, and your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress who has had a chance to talk with that individual,"" Jordan said. ""We would like that opportunity. When might that happen in this proceeding today?""

""First, as the gentleman knows, that's a false statement. I do not know the identity of the whistleblower and I'm determined to make sure the identity is protected,"" Schiff said in response. ""But as I said to Mr. Conway, you'll have an opportunity after the witnesses have testified to make a motion to subpoena any witness and compel a vote.""

Adam Schiff Says He Does Not Know the Identity of the Whistleblower youtu.be

Is Schiff changing his answer again?

According to TheBlaze's story last month, Schiff claimed neither he nor his committee had contact with the whistleblower and that he might never have found out about the whistleblower complaint if the Intelligence Committee inspector general had not brought it to the committee.

These two statements were blatantly false.

""I should have been much more clear,"" Schiff conceded in an interview with ""Face the Nation."" ""I said so the minute it was brought to my attention that I was referring to the fact that, when the whistleblower filed the complaint, we had not heard from the whistleblower. We wanted to bring the whistleblower in at that time, but I should have been much more clear.""

In reality, the whistleblower spoke with Intelligence Committee staff before filing the complaint, seeking advice on how to proceed, and Schiff was made aware of the nature of the complaint before it was filed, TheBlaze report stated.

Essentially Schiff is now saying it wasn't that the committee hadn't heard from the whistleblower, it's just that the committee hadn't literally brought the whistleblower in for a face-to-face.

It gets worse

Reports broke last week that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Schiff, published the unredacted name of the man alleged to be the whistleblower.

During the committee's testimony, William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, was asked by a staff lawyer on the committee if he was familiar with the name, ""Eric Ciaramella."" A transcript of the exchange was then published and released by the committee.

On Oct. 30, RealClearInvestigations published a lengthy article asserting that Ciaramella was, in fact, the whistleblower who filed the complaint against President Trump that kickstarted the impeachment inquiry.

Schiff's critics are accusing him of attempting to cover-up again in order to avoid having the whistleblower testify before Congress.

Now Schiff has banned the unmasking of the whistleblower

Schiff is not only denying that he knows the identity of the whistleblower, but also that he is ""determined to make sure the identity [of the whistleblower] is protected.""



In a memo circulated to committee members Tuesday, Schiff warned members that the committee will not tolerate the unmasking of the whistleblower, saying to do so would violate ethics rules.

In a section titled, ""Whistleblower Protection and Confidentiality,"" Schiff hearkened to the committee's ""long, proud, and bipartisan history of protecting whistleblowers — including from efforts to threaten, intimidate, retaliate against, or undermine [their] confidentiality.""

""The Code of Official Conduct for Members of Congress requires that every Member 'shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House,'"" he added. ""The Committee on Ethics has historically viewed this provision as 'encompassing violations of law and abuses of one's official position.'""

But this begs the question: If Schiff doesn't know who the whistleblower is, how will he enforce his hearing rule that the whistleblower not be named?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-schiff-claims-he-does-not-know-whistleblower-identity,2019-11-13
Adam Schiff hired alleged Ukraine whistleblower's friend and former co-worker one day after Trump's call with Zelensky,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) hired a friend and former co-worker of the alleged Ukraine whistleblower one day after the call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky that is now the focus of an impeachment inquiry, the Washington Examiner reported.

Sean Misko, a former National Security Council aide who worked closely with former NSC adviser and current CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella, was officially hired as a House Intelligence Committee staffer on July 26. Ciaramella is widely believed to be the whistleblower, although that has not been officially confirmed.

Misko was the Gulf States director, and Ciaramella was the Ukraine director on the NSC during the latter part of the Obama administration and the early part of the Trump administration.

The whistleblower complaint focused on the call between Trump and Zelensky, during which the president requested Zelensky investigate alleged 2016 election interference by Ukrainians, and potential corruption involving Burisma and Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.

The call took place July 25. Misko was hired July 26. The whistleblower complaint was filed Aug. 12. The whistleblower is known to have met with unnamed members of Schiff's staff before he filed the complaint, sometime between July 25 and Aug. 12.

The connections between a Schiff staffer and the whistleblower are of note because Schiff has been somewhat deceptive regarding his prior knowledge of the complaint and his contact with the whistleblower.

Schiff denied having contact with the whistleblower, before later admitting that his staff had been in contact with the whistleblower while still maintaining that he does not know the whistleblower's identity.

During public impeachment hearings, Schiff would not allow witnesses to answer questions that he believed could lead to outing the whistleblower. That led some Republicans to question how Schiff could determine which questions were off limits if he didn't know who the whistleblower was.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-schiff-hired-alleged-ukraine-whistleblowers-friend-day-after-trump-call,2019-12-04
"Adam Schiff obtains, releases personal phone records of Rudy Giuliani, Devin Nunes — without explanation of why or how","With impeachment enthusiasm waning, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) released his committee's 300-page impeachment report Tuesday, formalizing his committee's findings in order that the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump may proceed.

Perhaps the biggest revelation stemming from the report is that Schiff obtained the phone records and text message logs of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney.

In addition, he also collected phone records and text messages of journalist John Solomon and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.

According to NBC News, the phone records fuel speculation that Giuliani in particular acted nefariously to advance the president's personal interests.

Who in the White House budget office called Rudy Giuliani on an August afternoon, and what did they have to talk about for 13 minutes?



It's unclear what legitimate purpose the president's personal lawyer would have to speak at length with the White House Office of Management and Budget. But the revelation is likely to fuel arguments from House Democrats that Giuliani was intimately involved in a scheme to use U.S. taxpayer dollars as leverage to advance Trump's personal political interests.

There is little doubt the phone records were included in the report to advance theories that Trump's staunchest defenders have conspired to protect him and further his interests.

But what the report does not spell out, and what NBC noted, is how — and why — Schiff obtained the records.

At the very least, it is odd for a House committee to subpoena the phone records of its ranking member, a journalist, and the president's personal attorney — let alone in the midst of a presidential impeachment inquiry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-schiff-releases-personal-phone-records-of-rudy-giuliani-devin-nunes,2019-12-04
Adam Schiff threatens to withhold funds from intelligence community over whistleblower report,"House Intelligence Community Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Sunday threatened to withhold funds from the intelligence community unless the government discloses the whistleblower complaint recently lodged against President Donald Trump.

Trump faced new scrutiny last week over an phone conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July during which the president allegedly pressured Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden. A whistleblower complaint was later filed, but not turned over to congressional investigators.

On CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Schiff threatened to withhold funds from the intelligence community to obtain the whistleblower report.

""Wouldn't withholding funds from the intelligence community put the nation's safety at risk?"" host Jake Tapper asked.

""It depends on what funds we withhold. In this case, you have the office of the director of national intelligence that is withholding this complaint in violation of the clear letter of the law,"" Schiff replied. ""And there are funding requests that that office makes that don't go directly to national security that we can withhold.""

""Look, it is a blunt remedy and one that I'm very reluctant to use,"" Schiff continued. ""At the same time, the inspector general has said this is not only serious, this is not only credible, but it's urgent. We cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end. We need an answer.""

""If there is a fire burning, it needs to be put out,"" Schiff said.

Rep. Schiff on CNN: Trump Should Release the Phone Call Transcript and the Whistleblower Complaint youtu.be

Although Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael determined the whistleblower complaint to be of ""urgent concern,"" acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has declined to give Congress full access to the file.

Video: Adam Schiff just gave a very misleading answer on 'public support' for impeachment,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) went on CNN's ""State of the Union"" this morning to defend Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine.



Anchor Jake Tapper pressed Schiff on whether there is sufficient public support for impeaching the president to justify moving forward with the case. ""I don't know if the American people, especially in the battleground states [back impeachment]"" said the CNN host.

To this, Schiff responded that ""the public support for impeachment has grown fairly dramatically over the past two months.""

Schiff is misleading

Schiff is basing his answer on technicalities that may be factually accurate (yes, more Americans favor impeaching Trump now than they did a couple of months ago), but he is grossly exaggerating current public support for impeachment.

An examination of recent polling data demonstrates that his answer is highly misleading:

Schiff is cherry-picking his initial point of comparison to generate a talking point that is favorable to the argument he is trying to make, but falls apart upon closer scrutiny. In September, Americans were hardly aware of any details regarding the Ukraine scandal, as the story was just beginning to break. Logically, of course public support for impeaching President Trump was lower then compared to its current levels. According to FiveThirtyEight's rolling average of impeachment polls, support for impeaching Trump was at 38 percent on September 24.

Polls show that support for impeaching Trump climaxed on or around October 14. This was after weeks of overwhelmingly negative headlines and few rebuttals by Republicans. Yet, even at their best, House Democrats could barely muster a majority of the country to back their efforts with just 50.3 percent favoring impeachment and 43.8 opposed to it.

Since then, as Americans have learned more about the Democrats' impeachment case, public opinion has trended decisively in Trump's favor. As TheBlaze's Chris Enloe noted yesterday, a new Emerson poll shows a 24-point swing against impeachment among Independents when compared to their October study. Moreover, overall net-support for impeachment is down to less than a point (0.7 percent) with 46.3 percent of Americans supporting impeaching Trump and 45.6 percent opposed.

Tapper is correct and Schiff is wrong. After two weeks of public testimonies, and two months of 96% negative media coverage of the administration, Americans are increasingly at odds with him and House Democrats on whether Trump should be impeached.

The numbers don't lie—not even when Schiff does.

'Adolf Putin': Images of Russian president looking like Adolf Hitler pop up as protests against invasion of Ukraine quickly spread,"As protests and pushback against Russia's invasion of Ukraine are picking up steam in a growing number of nations, the Daily Mail reported that images of Russian President Vladimir Putin looking like Adolf Hitler are popping up all over the place — and that even ""Adolf Putin"" graffiti has been scrawled on Russian buildings.

Here are a few other ""Adolf Putin"" examples from around the globe:

What are the details?

The outlet noted that the the ""Adolf Putin"" epithet was written on a wall in Putin's hometown of St. Petersburg as demonstrators have demanded the Russian president end the escalating invasion of Ukraine.

Demonstrators also have taken to the streets of Moscow:

Protests against Russia's invasion also broke out in New York City, as demonstrators held signs showing Putin's face adorned with a blood-stained hand:

Similar sentiments were expressed by protesters in Washington, D.C.:

A European Union spokesman said Friday that Putin's actions are comparable to the Nazis' in World War II, the Daily Mail noted.

""He is talking about de-Nazifying Ukraine, but he behaves like Nazis,"" Peter Stano told reporters in Brussels, the outlet said. ""So this is all in his head.""

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to blast President Joe Biden and others in an early Friday morning video, saying that Ukraine has been ""left alone"" to defend itself against invading Russian forces while Biden watches ""from a distance.""

Russian troops moved into Ukraine's capital city Kyiv on Friday, as officials urged residents to stay indoors and ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend against the advancing enemy force, the New York Times reported.

US left behind $7 billion in military equipment in Afghanistan,"The United States left approximately $7 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan during the tumultuous withdrawal last August, according to a congressionally mandated report from the U.S. Department of Defense. The Pentagon report claimed that the U.S. left behind aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, and communications equipment.

""The U.S. gave a total of $18.6 billion of equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) from 2005 to August 2021,"" according to CNN, which added, ""Of that total, equipment worth $7.12 billion remained in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal was completed on August 30, 2021.""

The abrupt and shambolic Afghanistan withdrawal reportedly left 78 aircraft valued at $923.3 million at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. The deserted aircraft were demilitarized and rendered inoperable before the U.S. military withdrew from the Taliban-controlled country, according to the report.

Also left in Afghanistan were more than 40,000 military vehicles, including 12,000 military Humvees, the report states. The DoD stated that the operational condition of the vehicles is ""unknown.""

The Pentagon report – which was published in March – noted that 9,524 air-to-ground munitions worth $6.54 million were left in Afghanistan.

The Taliban could have access to over 300,000 weapons that the U.S. left in Afghanistan, as well as more than 1.5 million pieces of ammunition worth $48 million, according to the report.

The report claimed that ""nearly all"" of the communications equipment that the U.S. gave to Afghan forces remained in the country at the time of the withdrawal as the Taliban took over the country.

There are allegedly nearly 42,000 pieces of specialized equipment such as night vision and surveillance systems that remained in Afghanistan at the conclusion of the chaotic and deadly U.S. military withdrawal.

The U.S. military was able to transfer over 15 million rounds of Ball rifle ammunition, more than 99,000 40mm high-explosive/fragmentation grenade cartridges, and approximately 119,000 82mm high-explosive mortar rounds to Ukraine, according to the report. The U.S. also reportedly relocated five Mi-17 helicopters to Ukraine from Afghanistan.

""Much"" of the remaining military hardware deserted in Afghanistan reportedly requires ""specialized maintenance that DoD contractors previously provided"" to Afghan forces ""in the form of technical knowledge and support.""



The Pentagon proclaimed in the report that there is no plan to ""retrieve or destroy"" the military equipment.

In August, U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Frank McKenzie declared that the military hardware at the Hamid Karzai International Airport had been destroyed or ""demilitarized,"" and will ""never be able to be operated by anyone again.""



In September, the Taliban flaunted several high-priced U.S. military equipment, including a Black Hawk helicopter, CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, armored tactical vehicles, and firearms.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/afghanistan-withdrawal-military-equipment,2022-04-28
"After call with Putin, French PM warns 'the worst is yet to come' with Russia","French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron was left convinced that ""the worst is yet to come"" with the Russia-Ukraine war after speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a lengthy phone conversation on Thursday.

What are the details?

A senior Élysée Palace official told reporters following the 90-minute phone conversation, which Putin initiated, that a diplomatic breakthrough is nowhere in sight. It was the third call between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.

Macron, in fact, believes ""the worst is yet to come.""

""Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come. The (French) president said so yesterday as well. There is nothing in what Putin said today that should reassure us,"" the French official said, CNN reported.

The French official also revealed that Putin told Macron he plans to ""continue military interventions and to go all the way"" — meaning Putin wants to take over Ukraine.

""Our analysis of the military operations is that the Russian ambitions are to take control of all of Ukraine,"" the French official said.

Macron warned Putin against continuing military operations, reportedly telling his Russian counterpart that Russia ""will pay dearly because it will end up as an isolated country, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.""

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported on the call by saying the ""the special military operation"" — the propaganda phrase Russian officials are using to refer to their illegal invasion of Ukraine — ""will be fulfilled in any case,"" and warned that ""attempts to gain time by dragging negotiations will only lead to additional requirements for Kyiv,"" the Washington Post reported.

Anything else?

Putin's threats to intensify his war come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned on Wednesday that a third world war would involve nuclear weapons.

The threat was particularly jarring because Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert last week, and Russia's plans could involve attacking other countries in eastern Europe, thus provoking a response from western allied powers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/after-call-with-putin-french-pm-warns-the-worst-is-yet-to-come-with-russia-take-control-of-all-of-ukraine,2022-03-03
"After whistleblower's report is declassified, Pelosi says it 'removed all doubt' about the need for impeachment","Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that the whistleblower's complaint against President Donald Trump ""removed all doubt about whether we should move forward"" on impeachment.

What whistleblower?

Democrats in Congress ramped up calls for impeaching the president following a whistleblower's report that that Trump had urged the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter had been paid $50,000 per month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm while his father was president. This complaint had remained sealed until today, but details about what it contained had been leaked earlier.

Pelosi initially resisted calls from within her own party for impeachment, but on Tuesday, she announced that she was ready to change course. ""The president must be held accountable,"" the speaker said in her announcement. ""No one is above the law."" She said that what the president had done, according to the whistleblower,

On Wednesday, Trump released a transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that did show Trump mentioning Biden, but did not, as the president and his team repeatedly pointed out, have any indication of a quid pro quo for this requested investigation.

On Thursday morning, the whistleblower's complaint itself was released. In addition to the reporting the request regarding Biden, the whistleblower also accused the Trump administration of putting the transcript of a this call on ""a standalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action."" The whistleblower said that multiple White House officials had asserted that this was ""not the first time"" that the Trump administration had put something in this secure system ""solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information.""

What did Pelosi say?

In a speech Thursday following the release of the whistleblower's report, Pelosi called out the White House for the whistleblower's accusations that the transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky had been moved into a secure computer system despite not being classified.

""This is a cover-up,"" she said bluntly.

""Last week, we saw something that removed all doubt about whether we should move forward,"" she continued. ""This distinct change in the body of knowledge we had to make a decision. So when people say to me 'what made you change my [sic] mind?' I didn't change my mind. I've always been on the course of finding the facts as we honor our constitution.""

""And the facts are these: The president of the United States, in a telephone call with a head of state, betrayed his oath of office, our national security, and the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/after-whistleblowers-report-is-declassified-pelosi-says-it-removed-all-doubt-about-the-need-for-impeachment,2019-09-26
"AG Barr has 'created a process' to vet Giuliani's info on Hunter Biden, Ukrainian corruption, Graham says","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) revealed Sunday that Attorney General William Barr has ""created a process"" to vet information that Rudy Giuliani discovered regarding Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption.

Speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Graham, who spoke with Barr prior to his interview, said the Justice Department has not been ordered to investigate the Bidens but is vetting all intelligence about Ukraine.

""The Department of Justice is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from Rudy to see,"" Graham said. ""He told me that they've created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified. Rudy Giuliani is a well-known man. He's a crime fighter. He's loyal to the president. He's a good lawyer.""

Graham continued:

What I'm trying to say — to the president and anybody else — is that the Russians are still up to it. Deterrence is not working.



So let's look at Hunter Biden's conflict. Let's look at Joe Biden. Vice President Biden, what did you do when they told you your son was on Burisma's board? It undercuts your ability to fight corruption. Did you take it seriously? Obviously he didn't. But when it comes to documents coming out of the Ukraine, to Republicans and Democrats, be very cautious, turn anything you got over to the intel community.

However, Graham cautioned that Giuliani's information may have been generated as part of a Russian disinformation campaign and urged the lawyer to turn over his intelligence to the Justice Department.

""Here's my message to Rudy: If you've got something coming from the Ukraine, turn it over to the intelligence people, the Department of Justice, to any Democrat,"" Graham said.

Giuliani has spent an extensive amount of time digging for dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden, as well as searching for evidence of Ukrainian corruption. Gordon Sondland, the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he worked with Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.

Air Force recognizes Transgender Day of Visibility,"The U.S. Air Force, which claims that its mission statement is ""To fly, fight, and win…airpower anytime, anywhere,"" faced blowback Thursday on Twitter for peddling radical leftist gender ideology by recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility.

""Today is #TransDayofVisiblity,"" the Air Force tweeted, inviting people to watch a video of Under Secretary of the Air Force Gina Ortiz Jones interviewing Lt. Col. Bree Fram, a member of the Space Force — the tweet calls Fram the ""highest-ranking openly transgender"" Department of Defense officer.

The tweet comes as Russia, a nuclear-armed power, is invading Ukraine. It also comes as the U.S. faces the ongoing threat posed by an ever-ambitious communist China that continually seeks to expand its power on the world stage.

Responding to the Air Force's post, Blaze Media's Jessica O'Donnell questioned, ""how does this help us with war and stuff.""

"Airline passengers sing Christian worship songs throughout cabin. Rep. Ilhan Omar is upset, prompting social media to ask, 'Why do you hate Christians?'","Viral video showed the moment proud Christians began worshipping on a flight from the U.S. to Germany, according to reports.

What are the details?

TMZ reported the video originated from a since-deleted Facebook post by Jack Jensz Jr., who is purported to be a pastor and founder of Kingdom Realm Ministries.

In the video, shared by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), two people can be seen walking the aisle of what is reported to be an EasyJet flight to Europe.

The two can be heard singing while one plays the guitar, leading others in their seats to join in on the worshipping.

According to a report from the Daily Dot, Jensz posted the same video to his Instagram page earlier this month.

“#Jesus is taking over this Flight,” he wrote in the video’s caption, the outlet reported.

According to TMZ, Jensz and Kingdom Realm Ministries were traveling across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees when the impromptu worship service broke out.

Jensz's wife, Lilly, appeared to corroborate the reports through her Instagram posts.

In one post, the Jenszes can be seen with a vast quantity of groceries. The photo is captioned, “Church, because of your generosity, we were able to supply a van full of medicine, food, hygiene products to two pastors who host refugees in their cities from Eastern Ukraine as well as help their congregation and city as products are impossible to get now in their area. They were overwhelmed with your generosity! We are continuing to pray for Ukraine and doing what we can to help.”

What else is there to know about this?

On Saturday, Omar shared the video to Twitter and captioned it, ""I think my family and I should have a prayer session next time I am on a plane. How do you think it will end?""

At the time of this reporting, Omar's tweet has received more than 21,000 comments and has been viewed more than 32 million times.

Her remarks drew heavy criticism.

""Why do you hate Christians, Ilhan?” Georgia House candidate Vernon Jones asked. “If the freedom of religion we enjoy here in America disturbs you, feel free to pack your bags and head back to Somalia, Sudan, or wherever you’re from. Take your brother with you.”

Former congressional candidate Buzz Patterson added, ""I spent decades flying in the Middle East. We weren’t even allowed to bring Bibles into the countries or worship. This sort of impromptu singing would turn into arrests and imprisonment. I’ll celebrate our freedoms here. You do you""

Florida congressional candidate Jose Castillo wrote, ""In America, Muslims can & do pray in public. If she wants a country where Christians aren’t allowed to do the same @IlhanMN should go back to her own country.

Cicely Davis, who is running against Omar for the Minnesota seat, added, ""Qatar — a country you’re very familiar with — plays Islamic prayers on the intercom before takeoff on their planes. They have a designated prayer area & coordinates for Mecca are posted on the screens. It’s no problem. The issue is you hate Christians & Jews & lots of Muslims.""

Twitter user and filmmaker Jonathan Kołodziej Durand chimed in on the conversation and said that he witnessed the group ministering to Ukrainians earlier in the month.

He wrote, ""I just spent a week volunteering at the train station in Przemysl, Poland, right across from the Ukrainian border & saw the same people there. They were playing to Ukrainian refugees stuck waiting hours for transportation, who'd just fled from the bombing of Kharkiv & Mariupol.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/airline-passengers-sing-christian-worship-songs-throughout-cabin,2022-04-18
Liberal attorney Alan Dershowitz: Dems' impeachment case doesn't meet any credible legal standard,"Renowned criminal defense attorney Alan Dershowitz thinks that President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukraine does not meet the standards of bribery set forth in common law, according to Fox News.

""[I]t can't operate when you're the president of the United States and you're conditioning or withholding money in order to make sure that a country isn't corrupt and you're asking them to investigate [something],"" Dershowitz told Mark Levin in an interview that is scheduled to air Sunday night.

""That just doesn't fit any definition of bribery — common law definition of bribery, statutory definition of bribery — however, you define the constitutional word 'bribery.' It just doesn't fit,"" he said.

They're just 'searching for a crime'

The liberal Harvard law professor also stated on ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" that Democratic House members had already decided to impeach the president and merely searched for a crime to justify their decision, rather than using their inquiry as a process for uncovering evidence.

""They have Trump in their sights,"" he said. ""They want to figure out a way of impeaching him and they're searching for a crime.""

Dershowitz pointed out that House Democrats only resorted to the bribery charge after others clearly did not rise to the level of being impeachable offenses.

""First, they came up with abuse of power -- not a crime -- it's not in the Constitution. So now they're saying 'bribery,' but they're making it up,"" he said. ""There is no case for bribery based on, even if all the allegations against the president were to be proved, which they haven't been.""

Reminiscent of the Soviet KGB

In his remarks, Dershowitz recalled how the Soviet Union would first detain defendants and then find crimes to charge them with, a practice that was summarized by the mantra: ""Show me the man and I'll find you the crime.""

""What they're trying to do is what the KGB under Lavrentiy Beria said to Stalin, the dictator — I'm not comparing our country to the Soviet Union -- I just want to make sure it never becomes anything like that,"" Dershowitz concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alan_dershowitz_democrats_no_case_impeachment,2019-12-08
"Alaska governor fires back after Russian MP demands 'reparations' from US, including Alaska and part of California","A top member of Duma, the Russian parliament, wants the United States to pay reparations to Russia for sanctions imposed for the Ukraine invasion — including the return of former territories of the Russian Empire.

But Alaska's Republican governor said Tuesday his state is ready to defend its borders.

What are the details?

Russian MP Oleg Matveychev appeared on Russian state TV on Sunday, where he boasted that Russia is ""going to raise the stakes"" after ""our victory,"" the Daily Beast reported.

Those new stakes will include the ""dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way"" and the ""extradition of all war criminals,"" citing current and former top Ukrainian leaders.

Then Matveychev demanded territorial reparations, which would include Alaska and a part of Sonoma County in northern California.

""We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that, too, costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties — those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia — which has been seized in the United States, and so on,"" he said.

The TV host then asked, ""Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?""

Matveychev responded in the affirmative and added, ""As well as the Antarctic ... we discovered it, so it belongs to us.""

What did Alaska's governor say?

Reacting to Matveychev, Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) said that Alaskans are prepared to fend off the Russians.

""Good luck with that! Not if we have something to say about it,"" Dunleavy said. ""We have hundreds of thousands of armed Alaskans and military members that will see it differently.""

What about Alaska and Ft. Ross?

The U.S. purchased the Alaska territory from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million. The purchase, according to the State Department, ""ended Russia’s presence in North America and ensured U.S. access to the Pacific northern rim.""

Russia had been eager to unload the territory to further separate Russian territory from the British Empire.

Meanwhile, Russia established a colony in northern California — what is today part of Sonoma County north of San Francisco — at Fort Ross in 1812. Russia sold the land in 1841.

Some Russians today claim the land still legally belongs to their country, claiming that the purchaser, John Sutter, never paid the sell amount of $30,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alaska-governor-fires-back-after-russian-mp-demands-reparations-from-us,2022-03-16
"Alec Baldwin, armorer charged in connection to fatal shooting on film set: 'No one is above the law'","After more than two years of investigating and weighing the evidence, a district attorney in New Mexico has decided to charge both Alec Baldwin and a crew member with involuntary manslaughter in connection to the fatal shooting that occurred on the set of the upcoming Western film ""Rust.""

In October 2021, Baldwin was sitting in a pew in a mock church at the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set in Santa Fe when he decided to practice with the gun he was using for the film. He wanted to attempt a cross-draw maneuver, a move that an attorney for armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed described as ""dangerous.""

While rehearsing the cross draw, Baldwin supposedly drew a gun and fired a single shot directly at the camera. That bullet struck both the film's cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, 42, and the director, Joel Souza, 49. Hutchins was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, where she later died from her injuries. Souza was treated at the hospital and later released.

Baldwin has repeatedly denied pulling the trigger of the gun and claimed that it must have malfunctioned. The FBI then tested the weapon repeatedly and determined that, in most circumstances, it did not fire unless a person first cocked it and pulled the trigger. However, investigators did have one instance in which internal components of the gun fractured, causing the cocked gun to fire, even though the trigger had not been pulled.

Baldwin has also cast blame for the shooting on crew members, especially Gutierrez-Reed, who was in charge of weapons and armory on the set, and assistant director David Halls, who handed Baldwin the gun. Last November, Baldwin filed a lawsuit against Gutierrez-Reed and Halls as well as two other crew members. Halls has already agreed to plead guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon in connection to the shooting.

However, New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies has decided that Halls is not the only person responsible for Hutchins' death. She has now charged both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed with two counts each of involuntary manslaughter.

""After a thorough review of the evidence and the laws of the state of New Mexico, I have determined that there is sufficient evidence to file criminal charges against Alec Baldwin and other members of the ‘Rust’ film crew,"" Carmack-Altwies said. ""On my watch, no one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice.""

Both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be ""charged in the alternative,"" which means that a jury will determine whether they are guilty and, if they are, of which definition of involuntary manslaughter they are guilty. The crime itself carries a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine, but one of the two definitions of involuntary manslaughter also involves a firearm enhancement, which would tack on another five years to the sentence.

Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will each receive a preliminary hearing within 60 days to determine whether they will proceed to a trial.

Ever since the shooting occurred, questions have swirled regarding how live rounds ever came to be on the set in the first place, and Carmack-Altwies said previously that the answer to those questions would ""be one of the most important factors going into a charging decision.""

According to the affidavit, Gutierrez-Reed insisted to police that ""no live ammo is ever kept on set."" However, Thell Reed, Gutierrez-Reed's father and a longtime Hollywood armorer himself, later admitted to police that ammunition once in his possession ""may match the ammunition found on the set of 'Rust,'"" ABC News reported. Souza, the director of ""Rust,"" later recalled that someone had referred to the weapon handed to Baldwin as a ""cold gun,"" a term which means safe or unloaded.

""Review of available law enforcement reports showed no compelling demonstration that the firearm was intentionally loaded with live ammunition on set,"" wrote the New Mexico chief medical investigator after conducting a postmortem on Hutchins. ""Based on all available information, including the absence of obvious intent to cause harm or death, the manner of death is best classified as accident.""

Hutchins was a married mother of one child. Originally born in Ukraine, she came to America to continue her career in cinematography. Her family has since settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Baldwin last October. Though the financial details of the settlement have not been disclosed, Matthew Hutchins, the victim's widower, will be named as an executive producer on a film, though it is unclear whether he will be named the executive producer of ""Rust,"" which is scheduled to resume filming this month.

In fact, the entire cast and crew, with the notable exception of Hutchins, are expected to return to the set, including Souza, the director. No charges have been filed in connection to Souza's injuries.

"Husband of killed 'Rust' cinematographer 'so angry' with Alec Baldwin for denying responsibility of shooting, recalls moment he told son that his mother had died","The husband of the ""Rust"" cinematographer who was shot and killed during the filming of the Western film on Oct. 21 broke his silence in a new interview. Matt Hutchins revealed his frustrations with Alec Baldwin for not taking responsibility for the shooting death of his wife Halyna Hutchins. The mourning widower also recalled the heartbreaking moment that he told his young son that his mother had died.

In a ""Today"" interview that aired on Thursday, Hutchins – who traveled 2,000 miles to Halyna's native country of Ukraine to propose only three months after they met – revealed how he found out about his wife being shot on the set of the movie.

""A member of the production team told me that Halyna had been shot, and my heart sank right away,"" Hutchins told host Hoda Kotb. ""It was completely inexplicable to me that it could’ve happened at that moment, and the first thing I thought, I sat down, and I said, 'I have to get my son,' because I had to be with him.""

""And so I rushed home, and on the way decided that we had to go to Santa Fe,"" he said. ""When I got through to the doctor and spoke with him, and he detailed exactly what had happened and that she didn't survive, I was heartbroken. And I knew that I had to tell my son right away when I saw him.""

""I just had to be very direct and blunt because going to pick him up and go to the airport to go to Santa Fe, I didn’t want him to think that we were going to be seeing her and having fun together, and getting his hopes up,"" Hutchins said of his 9-year-old son, Andros.

""I told him, sitting together, that his mother had been shot and died. And, of course, he didn't believe it right away. He didn't want to believe it,"" he explained. ""I think that that kind of news you just have to say multiple times so that it can be believed. And so he believed it, and we cried together then.""

An emotional Hutchins added, ""And every holiday [since], Christmas, New Year's, our anniversary, my birthday, Valentine's Day — I mean every holiday is difficult without her. For me and Andros.""

Hutchins slammed Alec Baldwin for his ABC News interview in December, where he confidently proclaimed that he is not responsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins, who was 42 years old.

In the interview, Baldwin told host George Stephanopoulos, ""Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property. Someone is responsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me.""

When asked if he felt any guilt in the death of the cinematographer, Baldwin responded, ""No. No. I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible, and I don't say that lightly.""

Regarding Baldwin's remarks in December, Matthew said, ""Watching him, I just felt so angry. I was just so angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way and then to not accept any responsibility after having just described killing her.""

""Almost sounds like he was the victim,"" he continued. ""Hearing him blame Halyna in the interview, and shift responsibility to others, and seeing him cry about it. I just feel like, 'Are we really supposed to feel bad about you, Mr. Baldwin?'""

""The idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd to me,"" Hutchins declared.

""But gun safety was not the only problem on that set,"" he added. ""There were a number of industry standards that were not practiced, and there's multiple responsible parties.""

The family of Halyna Hutchins filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers for their involvement in the fatal shooting on the set of ""Rust"" on Feb. 15.

""Halyna Hutchins deserved to live, and the Defendants had the power to prevent her death if they had only held sacrosanct their duty to protect the safety of every individual on a set where firearms were present, instead of cutting corners on safety procedures where human lives were at stake, rushing to stay on schedule, and ignoring numerous complaints of safety violations,"" the lawsuit states.

During the interview, Hutchins was asked, ""When do you miss her the most?"" After letting out a sigh, Hutchins replied, ""I saw a picture of her smiling the other day, and I just thought, 'She'll never smile again.' And that's really hard.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alec-baldwin-shooting-cinematographer-husband,2022-02-24
VIDEO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) slammed at town hall event,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was blasted over her voting record on sending weapons and aid to Ukraine. AOC was confronted by protesters during a sparsely attended town hall event in New York City on Wednesday.

A man is heard on video telling Ocasio-Cortez, ""You voted to send arms and weapons to Ukraine!""

In May, AOC and all Democrats – including all of the ""Squad"" members – voted in favor of sending $40 billion in aid to Ukraine following the invasion by Russia.

During the ""Legislative Victories & Opportunities for Constituents"" town hall event, the man then asked why Ocasio-Cortez doesn't leave the Democratic Party like former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

On Tuesday, Gabbard announced she was departing the Democratic Party because it is an ""elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution."" Gabbard also declared that the Democratic Party is ""dragging us closer to nuclear war.""

The man said Gabbard left the Democratic Party ""because they’re a bunch of war hawks.”

""You ran as an outsider,"" the man said. ""Yet you've been voting to start this war in Ukraine. You've been voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China.""

He asked, ""Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?""

Another man chimed in, ""You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis.""

He yelled, ""You're a coward!""

The man questioned how AOC could be a ""progressive socialist"" while voting to send American funds to Ukraine.

He screamed during the town hall event held in the Bronx, ""You have done nothing!""

The man declared, ""Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts while you have shown cowardice.""

""I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against,"" the alleged supporter said. ""That's what you've become. You are the establishment.""

He continued, ""And you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear war, unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party.""

The man ranted, ""We could be in a nuclear war at any minute, and you continue to fund it. That's what's going on.""

AOC refused to address the man's claims, but she did call him ""rude."" He retorted, ""You're the liar here. Nobody has held you accountable.""

The man concluded, ""And it is time for you to stand up and realize that what you've been saying has been lies. Let your conscience come through for once.""

One of the protesters shared a screenshot of an email he allegedly sent to Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, in which he was hopeful that the up-and-coming New York politician would assist him in a dispute with his landlord.

At the time of publication, AOC – who is extremely active on social media – has yet to address being confronted about her voting record on funding Ukraine.

Regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine, Ocasio-Cortez has never mentioned the conflict on her massively popular personal Twitter account with more than 13.5 million followers. On her much less popular government Twitter account, she has mentioned the conflict three times – the last being in March.

""As Ukraine fights against the Russian invasion, we have a moral obligation to assist any way we can,"" AOC tweeted on March 28. ""The Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act would work to support the immediate suspension of Ukraine’s debt payments, help coordinate comprehensive debt relief, and more.""

In April, Ocasio-Cortez voted against the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act. The bill that passed in the House gives the president the power to ""seize and confiscate assets belonging to any sanctioned foreign person whose wealth is derived through support for or corruption related to the regime of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

In January 2020, Ocasio-Cortez proclaimed that ""war is a class conflict.""

""The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions,"" AOC tweeted. ""It’s not their children sent into the jaws of violence. It is often the vulnerable, the poor, & working people – who had little to no say in conflict – who pay the price.""

Previously, AOC declared that ""the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable.""

""Activists take that discomfort w/ the status quo & advocate for concrete policy changes,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in December 2020. ""Popular support often starts small & grows. To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... that’s the point.""

Editor's note: Due to a typo, the original version of this story incorrectly identified Ocasio-Cortez as (R-N.Y.) rather than (D-N.Y.).

Alleged whistleblower was friends with current Schiff staffer while both were in the Obama White House: report,"CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella, alleged to be the whistleblower whose complaint launched an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's actions toward Ukraine, was friends with a current member of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's staff while they were both working in the White House during the Obama administration, according to the Washington Examiner.

A former National Security Council official told the Examiner that Ciaramella was close friends with Sean Misko, who was the director for the Gulf States at the National Security Council from 2015 to 2018. Ciaramella was on the National Security Council as Ukraine director from 2016 until 2017.

""My understanding was that they were friendly with one another,"" the former official told the Examiner, also saying the two were ""cut from the same cloth"" and had a ""bro-like"" friendship. ""They would walk around the halls. Get lunch together and stuff like that,"" the source said.

Potential connections between the whistleblower and Schiff or his staff are significant in the context of Schiff's inconsistent stances regarding the whistleblower.

Schiff maintains that he doesn't know who the whistleblower is. But his credibility on the matter is in question because he initially claimed ""we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower"" before the complaint, before later clarifying the important detail that the whistleblower met with his staff.

Schiff also went on record numerous times saying the whistleblower should and would testify in the impeachment inquiry, before abruptly pivoting to a stance in which he does not even allow questions to be asked of witnesses that could point in the direction of the whistleblower's identity.

The whistleblower complaint has framed the narrative surrounding President Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky. The complaint alleged Trump was ""using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,"" which is the interpretation accepted by Democrats about the call, although the transcript of the call does not make such an interpretation quite as clear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alleged-whistleblower-was-friends-with-current-schiff-staffer,2019-11-20
American intelligence says that Russia will invade Ukraine as Western allies scramble to find a diplomatic solution,"The United States has intelligence that Russian commanders received orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine, CBS News reported.

CBS News host, Margaret Brennan said, “The president was very clear that he is convinced by U.S. intelligence that this invasion will happen, that President Putin [has] decided to do it. How was he that certain?”

CBS News correspondent David Martin responded by saying, “The intelligence says that Russian troops have actually received orders now, to proceed with the invasion. So, not only are they moving up closer and closer to the border into these attack positions, but the commanders on the ground are making specific plans for how they would maneuver in their sector of the battlefield.”

Martin said that the Russian forces are doing “everything that American commanders would do once they got the order to proceed.”

On Friday, President Joe Biden told reporters that he was “convinced” Russian leadership had decided to invade Ukraine and that he expected Russian forces to invade Ukraine in the “coming days.”

Previously, Ukrainian leadership said that Russia was working to destabilize Ukraine from within to create circumstances that would justify an invasion.

Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s top national security adviser, said that a military invasion would be too costly for Russia given the size of Ukraine’s military and the Ukrainian people’s will to fight.

Danilov also speculated that West continuing to pressure Russia would cause Russian leadership to shy away from conventional means of warfare and pursue a series of intense cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and economic pressure.

However, as tension in the region continues to escalate, the Russian military announced that it would be conducting military drills involving the country’s strategic nuclear forces.

A spokesman for the Kremlin said that Vladimir Putin would watch the drills from the Defense Ministry’s situation room and supervise the practice missile launches in person.

Moscow continues to deny that it has any plans to invade Ukraine and demands that the United States and NATO allies withdraw their military forces from territories near Russia and make legally binding commitments that Ukraine will not join NATO. Leadership in Washington and Brussels refuse to meet these demands.

The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressed that he was interested in meeting with Putin so that they could come to a diplomatic consensus that would end the ongoing conflict.

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris met with European leaders in Munich, Germany, to discuss the conflict and strategize with Western leaders on how they might deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

"Award-winning American filmmaker killed by Russian forces in Ukraine, authorities in Kyiv say. White House adviser vows to 'execute appropriate consequences.'","An award-winning American filmmaker was shot dead while covering the war in Ukraine, according to authorities in Kyiv. Ukrainian police said that an American video journalist was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, Ukraine, approximately 18 miles west of Kyiv.

""A 51-year-old world-renowned media correspondent was shot in Irpen today,"" Kyiv regional police force chief Andrey Nebitov wrote on Facebook, adding that ""another journalist is injured.""

Nebitov claimed that the fallen journalist was Brent Renaud – a video journalist and award-winning documentary filmmaker.



""Of course, the profession of a journalist is a risk, but U.S. citizen Brent Renaud paid his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty, and ruthlessness.""



Initially, Renaud was believed to be covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine for the New York Times since he had press credentials issued by The New York Times. However, the official New York Times communications account on Twitter noted that Renaud formerly worked for the media outlet.

We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to the New York Times over the years. Though he had contributed to the Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at the Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.

The Independent reported, ""The Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, working alongside his brother Craig as the Renaud Brothers, also produced films for HBO, NBC, Discovery, PBS and Vice News, among others, while reporting from Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and across the U.S. and elsewhere.""



PBS correspondent Jane Ferguson wrote on Twitter, ""Just left roadside spot near Irpin where body of American journalist Brent Renaud lay under a blanket. Ukrainian medics could do nothing to help him by that stage. Outraged Ukrainian police officer: 'Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.'""

PBS ""News Hour"" special correspondent Simon Ostrovskysaid, ""Gutting to hear of the death Brent Renaud in Irpin, Ukraine today. A filmmaker without parallel who was working on a global film project about refugees. My thoughts are with his brother and his friends and family.""

""Chronicle 5"" correspondent Nicole Estaphan tweeted, ""Today Brent Renaud was killed while documenting the story of Ukrainians fleeing Irpin. He was talented and fueled by the need to shine the light on people who might otherwise go ignored. Here is some of his work.""



On Sunday morning, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the reports of Renaud's death ""obviously shocking and horrifying.""

""I will be consulting with my colleagues, we'll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it,"" Sullivan said during an appearance on ""Face the Nation.""

""I will just say that this is part and parcel of what has been a brazen aggression on the part of the Russians where they have targeted civilians, they have targeted hospitals, they have targeted places of worship and they have targeted journalists,"" Sullivan added. ""And the United States has been working hard to hold Russia accountable through the imposition of the most far reaching- far reaching sanctions ever imposed and through the provision of military assistance to the Ukrainians to be able to blunt the Russian advance. And we will obviously be tracking this latest development very closely and responding accordingly.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-journalist-killed-ukraine-filmmaker,2022-03-13
American military and diplomats flee Ukraine fearing an imminent Russian invasion,"The United States has partially moved its forces out of Ukraine and ordered the evacuation of most embassy staff, according to CNN.

The American government is worried about the safety of American citizens remaining in Ukraine as the likelihood of a Russian invasion of its neighbor continues to grow.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered members of the Florida National Guard to leave Ukraine and stationed them “elsewhere in Europe.”

In an official statement, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, “They are departing Ukraine and will reposition elsewhere in Europe. The Secretary made this decision out of an abundance of caution — with the safety and security of our personnel foremost in mind — and informed by the State Department’s guidance on U.S. personnel in Ukraine.”

He noted that the Pentagon still supports Ukraine’s military despite pulling American troops out of the country.

Kirby said, “This reporting does not signify a change in our determination to support Ukraine’s Armed Forces, but will provide flexibility in assuring allies and deterring aggression.”

On Saturday, the State Department issued a travel advisory saying that it had “ordered the departure of most U.S. direct-hire employees from Embassy Kyiv due to the continued threat of Russian military action.”

The State Department indicated that the embassy’s consular services will be suspended during this time of heightened tension, and it emphasized that a small diplomatic presence would be maintained, but not in Kyiv. This diplomatic staff will “handle emergencies,” per CNN, and is stationed in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv – about 50 miles away from Ukraine’s shared border with Poland.

CNN reports that on Saturday morning, a Senior State Department official said that it is “past time for U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine” and that “there are limits to what the U.S. can do to assist them in a war zone.”

During an afternoon phone call, on Saturday, President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that if Russia invades Ukraine there will be “swift and severe” costs to Russia and “widespread human suffering.”

The New York Times reported that, according to senior officials in the Biden administration, after the two presidents’ phone call it remained unclear whether Russia would invade.

One senior national security official said that there was “no fundamental change in the dynamic that has unfolded now for several weeks.”

On Friday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the United States government believes a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent.

Sullivan said, “We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. As we’ve said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it.”

Alongside the United States, many other countries are reducing their diplomatic presence in Ukraine and are actively encouraging their citizens abroad to return home.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-military-and-withdrawal-from-ukraine-as-russian-invasion-looms,2022-02-12
American officials travel to Venezuela to re-establish trade and further isolate Russia,"Senior American officials traveled to Venezuela to try and drive a wedge between Venezuela and its longtime ally Russia.

The New York Times reported that this trip is the highest-level visit to Venezuela by American officials since 2019.

In 2019, the United States broke off diplomatic relations with the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro due to allegations of electoral fraud. The Trump administration closed the American embassy in Venezuela and issued sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and senior members of the country’s government.

The Trump administration also moved to officially recognize the leader of Maduro’s opposition — Juan Guaido — as the lawful president of Venezuela. In a direct slight to the Maduro regime, Trump hosted Guaido at the 2020 State of the Union Address.

In response to American sanctions, Venezuela sought economic relief and diplomatic assistance from its counterparts in Russia, Iran, and China.

Russian energy companies have played a crucial role in allowing Venezuela to continue exporting oil throughout the world.

With Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine, the Biden administration is paying closer to attention to the allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in South and Latin America. The Biden administration is concerned that Putin could leverage these relationships in ways that pose a threat to U.S. safety.

As sanctions from Western allies weaken the Russian economy, American leadership is lunging at opportunities to drive a wedge between Russia and its allies who rely on it for economic support.

The New York Times alleged that there is bipartisan support for reestablishing diplomatic relations with Venezuela in an effort to undermine Russia.

Scott Taylor, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, works alongside pro-Venezuelan lobbyists and said, “We should take this opportunity to achieve a diplomatic win and a wedge between Russia and Venezuela.”

Trish Reagan, a former Fox Business host, said, “Venezuela has the largest source of oil reserves yet, we’re handing that to the Chinese and Russians.”

In the past month, prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Nicolas Maduro spoke with Putin by telephone and has hosted Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Yuri Borisov.

Maduro appears to be open to discussing re-establishing trade relations with the United States.

In a public speech he delivered this past week, Maduro said, “Here lies the oil of Venezuela, which is available for whomever wants to produce and buy it, be it an investor from Asia, Europe, or the United States.”

This past week, Venezuelan diplomats at the United Nations did not vote to condemn Russian aggression in Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-officials-travel-to-venezuela-to-re-establish-trade-and-further-isolate-russia,2022-03-06
Powerful videos show angry Iranian protesters flood streets of Tehran over downed jet: 'Death to the dictator',"Enraged protesters flooded the streets of Tehran on Saturday and demanded that Ayatollah Khamenei step down as supreme leader of Iran after the Iranian government admitted its armed forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board.

Video posted to social media showed protesters shout ""death to liars,"" ""death to the Islamic Republic,"" ""Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is also a murderer,"" among other chants.

According to Reuters, the protesters also chanted, ""Death to the dictator,"" a direct reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.

The protests reportedly began as vigils for the victims of PS752, but quickly descended into anti-government demonstrations.

The protests came the same day that Iran admitted that the Iranian Armed Forces shot down the passenger jet using surface-to-air missiles.

For days, the Iranian government claimed the plane crashed due to mechanical error. However, American intelligence disputed the claims, forcing the Iranian government to admit that it shot down the Ukrainian flight.

In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded an apology and compensation from Iran.

""Iran has pleaded guilty to downing the Ukrainian plane. But we insist on a full admission of guilt,"" Zelensky said Saturday. ""We expect from Iran assurances of their readiness for a full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, the return of the bodies of the dead, the payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels.""

President Donald Trump also spoke directly to protesters on Saturday, posting a message to Twitter in Persian, the native language of Iranians.

The message reads in English, ""To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/angry-iranian-protesters-flood-streets-demand-ayatollah-khamenei-step-down-over-shot-down-passenger-jet,2020-01-11
"Annalynne McCord, poem, mother, Vladimir Putin, Russia invades Ukraine,","As the world watches Russia invade the nation of Ukraine, actress AnnaLynne McCord has released a bizarre video in which she stares into a camera and delivers a poem suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have been a completely different person if she had been his mother, because he would have felt loved and secure.

""Dear President Vladimir Putin, I'm so sorry that I was not your mother,"" McCord said at the beginning of the video, which continues for more than two minutes.

""If I was your mother, the world would've been warm, so much laughter and joy and nothing would harm. I can't imagine the stain, the soul-stealing pain, that the little-boy you must've seen and believed, and the formulation of thought quickly taught that you lived in a cruel, unjust world. Is this why you now decide no one will get the best of you? Is this why you do not hide nor away shy from taking back the world?"" she said. ""Was it because so early in life all that strife wracked your little body with fear?""

Antony Blinken gives NATO allies 'green-light' to send fighter jets to Ukraine as Western sanctions cripple Russia's economy,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that NATO member nations are allowed to send fighter jets to Ukraine as the United States and its allies continue to provide assistance to Ukraine in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion.

Blinken said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” on Sunday, that NATO allies sending fight jets to Ukraine “gets a green-light.”

He said, “In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now abut what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if in fact they choose to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they are handing over to the Ukrainians?”

A White House spokesperson told CBS News that the Biden administration is evaluating its ability to provide fighter jets to Poland should the Polish government decide to transfer planes to Ukraine, CBS News reported.

Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. said that she hopes Ukraine will receive fighter jets from Poland “as soon as possible.”

She said, “We are working with our American, especially, friends and allies, on the steady supply of ammunition and anti-air, anti-tank, and planes to be able to effectively defend our county.”

Allied Western nations have provided military and humanitarian aide to Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion and have also issued sweeping sanctions that effectively cripple and isolate the Russian financial system.

Shortly after Russia launched its invasion, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. issued a statement expressing their intentions to remove Russian banks from the SWIFT telecommunication network.

The statement said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion. Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World WAR, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

Since the West locked arms in support of Ukraine, the Russian economy has been rapidly deteriorating. Private financial institutions like Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in Russia, further isolating Russians from participating in the global economy, and the Western energy company British Petroleum announced that it would liquidate its holdings in Russian energy companies and suspend its operations in Russia.

Blinken affirmed that Western sanctions were drastically impacting the Russian economy.

He said, “The impact of the sanctions is already devastating. The ruble is in freefall. Their stock market’s been shuttered for almost a week. We’re seeing a recession set in Russia. Consumers aren’t able to buy basic products because companies are fleeing Russia, so it’s having a big impact.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/antony-blinken-gives-nato-allies-green-light-to-send-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-as-western-sanctions-cripple-russia-s-economy,2022-03-06
Even Ocasio-Cortez is upset at Democratic leadership over SOTU social distancing rules: 'That doesn't make sense',"Progressive Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York joined the chorus of people criticizing the social distancing rules imposed by Democratic leadership for the State of the Union address Tuesday.

Masking requirements were dropped ahead of President Joe Biden's first State of the Union speech, prompting many to accuse officials of following the polling instead of the science.

Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to complain about the rules because they meant some members of the press would not be allowed to attend.

""If leadership decided masks are now optional at SOTU, then how are they requiring social distancing to the extent of excluding press? That doesn’t make sense,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday.

Initially, the guidance from the Sergeant-at-Arms at the U.S. Senate and from the U.S. Capitol's attending physician said all members of Congress could attend the speech but that they would have to wear a KN95 mask and have a PCR test within one day of the event.

Then on Sunday, the attending physician said the guidance was changed to make masks optional just two days ahead of the State of the Union.

Dr. Brian Monahan said in a memo to members of Congress that they “may choose to mask at any time, but it is no longer a requirement.”

Monahan pointed to new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to explain his fortuitous lifting of masking demands.

Many Republicans, like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, indicated that they would forego attending the address because of the testing requirements.

""I'm healthy, so I won’t be taking a test for COVID… so I won’t be attending the #SOTU,"" he tweeted.

""I don't have time to go take a COVID test today. I only take a test if I’m sick,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to explain why he wouldn't be attending.

Biden is expected to address the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia in his speech, as well as the economic challenges besetting his constituents.

AOC demands 'consequences' for big oil 'profiteering'; industry claps back with an economics lesson,"Progressive Democrats are accusing oil companies of ""profiteering"" and are demanding they face ""consequences"" for high prices at the pump as the price of crude oil fell below $100 on Monday and continued to decline Tuesday. But the industry has fired back, saying these Democrats are ""grandstanding"" instead of proposing solutions to the gas crisis.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Monday responded to MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle, who asked ""what's going on"" with gas prices averaging $4.32 per gallon on Monday while the price of crude oil dropped 8% and fell below $100 per barrel. ""Profiteering. And there should be consequences for it,"" the congresswoman replied.

Fellow ""squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) echoed her comments, writing, ""Big oil CEOs need to be held accountable for profiteering, this can’t stand.""

And another congressman, Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), accused oil companies of ""price-gouging"" and said, ""Congress must pass legislation to stop it.""

Their comments drew a harsh rebuke from the American Petroleum Institute, which said, ""The American people are looking for solutions, not finger pointing.""

""The price at the pump that Americans are currently paying is a function of increased demand and lagging supply combined with the geopolitical turmoil resulting from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine,"" API Senior Vice President of Policy, Economics, and Regulatory Affairs Frank Macchiarola explained in a statement to TheBlaze.

""Lawmakers should focus on policies that increase US supply to help mitigate the situation rather than political grandstanding that does nothing but discourage investment at a time when it’s needed the most,” Macchiarola said.

Left-wing accusations of price gouging came after the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark for crude oil, traded at $94.15 per barrel on Monday, coming down from the high of $130 reached a little more than a week ago. Crude oil prices remained below $100 a barrel on Tuesday as well.

Industry analysts said the previous spike in oil prices was fear-based, driven by concerns over how Russia's energy exports would be impacted by import bans from the U.S. and Canada, CNBC reported. The decline in prices is related to hopes that the commodity market will be resilient, as well as expectations that renewed COVID-19 lockdowns in China will prevent millions of people there from traveling and reduce demand for gasoline.

What that means is that in the short-term, gas prices could begin to decline, but a change in prices may come slowly. Crude oil makes up about 56% of the price of regular gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Falling crude oil prices will ""take a lot of the pressure off pump prices,"" but this change will be a ""gradual decline,"" American Automobile Association's Andrew Gross told Newsweek Tuesday.

Claims that oil companies haven't responded to the market are inaccurate. Patrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, observed Monday that there has in been a ""slow decline"" in gas prices, noting that the national average price of gas has decreased four cents per gallon since Thursday.

Some experts have cautioned that the drop in prices may be temporary. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis, told CNN that if crude oil stays around $100 per barrel, fuel prices could drop by about 20 cents per gallon. But he warned that prices could spike again in the spring and summer as people begin traveling more, increasing demand for gasoline. The World Travel & Tourism Council predicts a 6.2% increase over pre-pandemic travel levels within the U.S. this year, which the organization says will add nearly $2 trillion to U.S. GDP, CNN reported.

Kloza said he expects all of that additional travel to bring gas prices up to about $4.50 per gallon. But that figure will be a result of increased demand for a product that's restricted by supply, not greedy corporations taking advantage of consumers.



Gas prices have reached record highs since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, prompting international sanctions against Russia and disrupting oil markets. However, the cost to fill up a vehicle was increasing well before the invasion began, and this is not the first time Democrats have blamed oil companies.

In November, when the average price of gas was $3.22 — at the time the highest level since 2014 — President Joe Biden sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission tying rising prices to alleged ""anti-consumer behavior"" from oil companies. The industry blasted the accusation, arguing rising prices were the result of complicated factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and increased demand for gas. The American Petroleum Institute called Biden's letter a ""distraction"" and said that ""ill-advised government decisions"" were ""exacerbating this challenging decision.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-demands-consequences-for-big-oil-profiteering-industry-gives-economics-lesson,2022-03-15
AOC says 'I'm over it' on impeachment before process even begins,"Democrats haven't held even a procedural vote on impeachment yet, and one of the most vocal impeachment advocates is already apparently bored with it, according to the Washington Examiner.

Even though it's unclear whether there are enough votes in the House to impeach, and there's essentially no chance that the Senate would vote to convict and remove President Donald Trump from office, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y) is ready to move on to bigger things.

""I think the whole thing is boring,"" Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday. ""He should have been impeached a long time ago. I'm over it. And so that's how I feel about it because we've got work to do.""

That's not to say Ocasio-Cortez doesn't still support impeachment, but to her, it won't have the long-term impact Democrats need to pursue.

""Impeachment of this president is the short-term action we need to preserve our democracy,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""But if we are really going to thrive as a country, we need to make long-term investments and keep our eyes on the prize of social and economic and racial justice in the United States of America. And that's what this is all about.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced her support of an impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, after resisting calls for impeachment from Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats for months.

President Trump does not seem to fear potential impeachment. Thursday, he publicly said China should begin investigating Joe and Hunter Biden for their foreign business activities — even though that type of request to Ukraine is what Democrats have focused impeachment inquiries on.

""And, by the way ... China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" Trump said Thursday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-over-impeachment-before-process-begins,2019-10-04
AOC takes major shot at Democratic Party for 'bigger national scandal' involving impeachment,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) blasted her fellow Democrats Saturday and claimed their unwillingness to impeach President Donald Trump is a ""bigger national scandal"" than Trump's alleged improprieties.

""At this point, the bigger national scandal isn't the president's lawbreaking behavior — it is the Democratic Party's refusal to impeach him for it,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

""It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It's another to let him,"" she added in a follow up. ""The integrity of our democracy isn't threatened when a president breaks the law. It's threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP's silence & refusal to act shouldn't be a surprise. Ours is.""

The freshman lawmaker's comments reignite her feud with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and moderate Democratic leadership, which has backed away, and even condemned, efforts to impeach the president.

Earlier this month, amid reports that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) planned to move forward with an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi called impeachment a ""divisive measure."" Pelosi has instead urged her party to follow the facts.

Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi reportedly buried the hatchet in July after a tumultuous start to the summer, where Pelosi criticized Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow freshman progressive lawmakers and Ocasio-Cortez claimed Pelosi's criticisms were racially motivated.

Calls for Trump's impeachment continued last week following reports of a whistleblower complaint against the president involving a conversation Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that involved Hunter Biden.

However, as TheBlaze reported, CNN revealed the whistleblower report was based on nothing but hearsay. Indeed, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko defended Trump Saturday, saying ""there was no pressure"" during the conversation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-pelosi,2019-09-22
Ocasio-Cortez says sympathy for Ukrainian refugees is a 'profound opportunity' to get a pathway to citizenship for all refugees,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said that Democrats should use the overwhelming support for refugees from the Ukrainian war to help get a pathway to citizenship for all refugees.

She made the comments to Rachel Maddow on MSNBC Tuesday after the State of the Union address by President Joe Biden.

While Maddow asked Ocasio-Cortez how to use sympathy for the refugees from the invasion of Ukraine to avoid demonization of illegal immigrants at home, the congresswoman bent the conversation towards amnesty.

""I think that the way that we are looking at immediate granting of TPS to Ukrainian refugees, which is what we need to be doing, as well as many others, is something that we really need to keep in mind. Because I do believe that, for example, the thousands of people who try to seek legal refuge on our southern border, how Haitian refugees have been treated by the United States, not just in past administrations, but frankly this one, is not right,"" she said.



""And we really need to make sure that when we talk about accepting refugees, that we are meaning it for everybody, no matter where you come from. But I do believe that this also presents a profound opportunity because of the amount of extraordinary support for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued.

""If we grant TPS to Ukrainian refugees, this is also an opportunity to finally create a path to citizenship for TPS recipients,"" she concluded. ""So I think that while there is a risk, there’s also a profound opportunity for us to make the crooked path straight on this issue.""

Ocasio-Cortez retweeted a video of her immigration comments by someone who tied the proposal to abolishing ICE, and fighting racism and white supremacy.

It is estimated that about one million refugees have already fled from Ukraine as the Russian military attacks civilian centers, and more are expected as the war drags on.

The Army rejects President Trump's nudging and won't investigate Lt. Col. Vindman over impeachment testimony,"Despite President Trump's nudging, the Army will not investigate Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman regarding his testimony to impeachment investigators, a top leader in the service said Friday.

""There's no investigation into him,"" Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said at a National Press Club luncheon Friday, according to Politico.



Vindman drew ire from the president after he raised concerns about President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, testifying that he didn't think it was ""proper"" for Trump to ""demand that a foreign government investigate"" former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

After Trump was acquitted on impeachment charges in the Senate, he quickly removed Vindman from his post on the National Security Council as a part of a staff shake-up in the White House.

Following Vindman's ousting, Trump said that he imagined the military would ""take a look"" at the ""horrible things"" Vindman told House investigators and decide if he deserved disciplinary action.

Trump did defer on the matter, acknowledging it would be ""up to the military."" Now it appears they have chosen no further action action against Vindman.

Instead, McCarthy downplayed Vindman's return to the Army, announcing that he will simply be designated to a ""bridging assignment"" in Washington before heading to ""a senior service college this summer.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/army-rejects-trump-wont-investigate-vindman,2020-02-14
Groups urge Biden to use Defense Production Act to push green energy,"As Americans face rapidly surging fuel prices, a coalition of groups is calling for President Biden to use the Defense Production Act to push a transition to green energy. They are also calling for the president to reject calls to ramp up America's fossil fuel production.

Sierra Club, Greenpeace USA, Islamic Society of North America, and Our Revolution are just a few of the many groups that joined together in the message to Biden.

The groups expressed support for the president's recent move to ban Russian oil.

""We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and we want to thank you for halting oil imports from Russia. We urge you to continue to resist short-sighted policies such as scaling up domestic fossil fuel production or expanding oil and gas infrastructure or financing, which would only deepen our dependence on fuels that lead to global instability and drive further devastating climate impacts. Instead, we are calling on you to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to ramp up the deployment of renewable energy to transition the world off fossil fuels,"" the groups declared.

While Americans were already facing elevated gas prices, fuel costs have recently spiked dramatically, and the situation could get even worse.

President Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order banning the importation of Russian oil into the U.S., a move meant to squeeze Russia as it perpetrates a destructive and deadly invasion in Ukraine. The order specifically prohibits importing ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products"" from Russia.

""We urge you to utilize the Defense Production Act to ramp up the deployment of renewable energy to transition the world off fossil fuels and generate millions of good quality, union jobs,"" the groups declared in their message to President Biden. ""The DPA – which you have already used to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to wildfires – provides you with the historic opportunity to produce alternatives to fossil fuels, fight the climate emergency, combat Putin’s stranglehold on the world’s energy economy, and support the transition to a renewable and just economy.""

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Wednesday that, ""we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/as-americans-face-skyrocketing-gas-prices-groups-urge-biden-to-push-for-green-energy-and-reject-calls-to-ramp-up-fossil-fuel-production,2022-03-10
Associated Press reporter canned over erroneous report suggesting Russia had launched a missile into a NATO country,"An award-winning Associated Press reporter got the boot on Monday after claiming that a ""senior U.S. intelligence official"" had said Russia fired a missile into Poland. Before the AP offered a correction, 35-year-old James LaPorta's report — containing an erroneous suggestion with potentially catastrophic and nuclear repercussions — was widely circulated, generating panic and stoking geopolitical tensions.

The facts

On Nov. 15, Russia launched a brutal missile barrage targeting energy infrastructure in western Ukraine. During the attack, Ukrainian air defenses reportedly fired an errant missile into Poland.

The resultant explosion rocked the Polish village of Przewodów, just five miles away from the Ukrainian border. Two farm workers were killed.

NATO, Polish, and American leaders suggested shortly after the explosion that it was not a direct Russian attack.

Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch told Poland's TVN24 channel days later that there ""are many indications that one of the (Ukrainian) missiles used to shoot down a Russian missile missed the target. Its self-destruct system did not work, and this missile unfortunately led to a tragedy.""

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called the claim that the explosion was Ukrainian-caused a ""conspiracy theory.""

Fake news, real consequences

Hours after the incident, the Associated Press issued a news alert co-bylined by LaPorta and reporter John Leicester, which stated, ""A senior U.S. intelligence official says Russian missiles crossed into NATO member Poland, killing two people.""

A Russian attack on Poland would have been sufficient to trigger articles 4 and 5 of the NATO charter, potentially putting the U.S. into direct conflict with the nuclear power.



The Washington Post noted that the AP report had been sent to and seen by thousands of news outlets. News organizations frequently reprint reports from the AP.

CNN firmed up the narrative, reporting that Poland ""confirms a Russian-made missile"" was behind the explosion. CNN reportedly omitted any mention of how the Ukrainian military also uses Russian-made weapons.

Fox News and the Daily Mail similarly carried the AP reporter's suggestion, the former running a piece entitled, ""Russian missiles cross into NATO member Poland, kill 2: senior US intelligence official,"" and the latter stating, ""'Russian bombs' kill two in POLAND.""

CBS Evening News tweeted ""RUSSIAN MISSILE STRIKE: Two Russian missiles crossed over the Ukrainian border into Poland, a NATO country, killing two civilians.""

Extra to cable news channels and print news organizations spreading the erroneous information, social media influencers began banging the drums of war on the basis of the AP report, signaling that Russia's war on Ukraine had finally spilled out into a NATO country.

For instance, Irish writer Jennifer Cassidy advanced the AP's claim to her 167,000 or more Twitter followers:

Although it is unclear whether he spoke out on the basis of the AP report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a forceful statement, saying, ""Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died.""

Were LaPorta's news alert true, then millions of people would have been promptly informed of the facts of the matter. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Retraction

After having updated the initial report several times, the AP indicated that a new assessment from three U.S. officials ""contradicts information"" in the original article. Shortly thereafter, the article was reportedly taken offline.

The AP issued a retraction later that day, writing: ""In earlier versions of a story published November 15, 2022, The Associated Press reported erroneously, based on information from a senior American intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity, that Russian missiles had crossed into Poland and killed two people. Subsequent reporting showed that the missiles were Russian-made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack.""

On Nov. 21, LaPorta, a former U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan, was fired. Co-byliner Leicester reportedly is still working at the AP.

An AP spokesman did not comment on LaPorta's firing, but told the Daily Beast that the ""rigorous editorial standards and practices of The Associated Press are critical to AP’s mission as an independent news organization. To ensure our reporting is accurate, fair and fact-based, we abide by and enforce these standards, including around the use of anonymous sources.""



Customarily, the AP ""requires more than one source when sourcing is anonymous,"" with an exception when a source is an authoritative figure who ""provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy.""

The Washington Post reported that LaPorta had received and shared the alleged U.S. intelligence official's tip in an electronic message around 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 15.

One editor asked whether to issue an alert on the basis of LaPorta's tip or to seek ""confirmation from another source and/or Poland?""

A second editor said she ""would vote"" for publishing an alert, noting she couldn't ""imagine a U.S. intelligence official would be wrong on this.""

Although this exchange may suggest wider culpability, the Post reported on the basis of an anonymous source at the AP that LaPorta allegedly told his editors that a senior manager had already vetted the source of his tip, even though that manager had not reviewed the missile story.

AP spokesman Lauren Easton indicated there will likely be no discipline for any AP editor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/associated-press-reporter-canned-over-report-suggesting-russia-had-launched-a-missile-into-a-nato-country,2022-11-22
At least one Democratic senator thinks Hunter Biden is a relevant witness,"As Democrats push for witness testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, at least one Democrat thinks the Senate should hear from another relevant witness: Hunter Biden.

After hearing from the House impeachment managers and Trump's defense team, both of whom referred to Biden heavily in their opening arguments, West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin believes partisanship should be put aside in search of the complete truth.

""I think so, I really do. I don't have a problem there because this is why we are where we are,"" Manchin told MSNBC when asked if Biden was a relevant witness. ""Now I think he can clear himself, what I know and what I've heard, but being afraid to put anyone that might have pertinent information is wrong, no matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican.""

There is no denying that Biden's activities in Ukraine are central to impeachment. One of the articles of impeachment asserts that Trump abused his power to coerce Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Hunter's father, Joe Biden.

That sought-after investigation concerned Hunter's appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and whether Joe Biden used his status as vice president and Ukraine point man to protect Hunter and Burisma from anti-corruption investigations.

Trump's defense team argues that seeking such an investigation, even if it carries some personal political benefit to the president, also serves a public interest because there were serious concerns about a potential conflict of interest involving the Bidens.

The House impeachment managers, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), spent a significant portion of their opening argument claiming that there was no corruption by the Bidens in Ukraine, and that Trump's desire for an investigation was purely for his political benefit.

The Senate will likely vote Friday on whether or not to call new witnesses such as Bolton or Hunter Biden to testify in the trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/at-least-one-democratic-senator-thinks-hunter-biden-is-a-relevant-witness,2020-01-29
"Australian TV host brutalizes Biden for being 'determined to weaken' America, 'emboldening' enemies","Sky News Australian host James Morrow blasted President Joe Biden over the weekend, hammering Biden for being ""determined to weaken America's standing, her military, and emboldening her and our enemies.""

Speaking in a monologue on Anzac Day — Australia and New Zealand's version of Veterans Day — Morrow said Biden is ""making a mockery"" of America and its allies.

""Today is Anzac Day, when we commemorate all those who made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for our freedoms and fighting very often side by side with soldiers from the United States,"" Morrow began.

""Which is why today, it is so depressing to look at what is happening to the U.S. under Joe Biden, who seems, for whatever reason, determined to weaken America's standing, her military, and emboldening her and our enemies, making a mockery of a century's worth of shared sacrifice,"" he continued.

Morrow went on to bash Biden for his ""green eco warrior posturing"" — citing Biden being the only person on a virtual meeting with world leaders to wear a face covering — which he predicted would only embolden American enemies.

""The Biden administration's push to go green and force its friends and allies like Australia to do the same, even as China is allowed to keep emitting and growing willy-nilly, is also going to weaken America's ability to project power around the world,"" Morrow said. ""And that's bad news for all of us.""

""Now, as enemies circle, Biden is also proposing making cuts in real terms to America's national defense budget, and yet the biggest so-called improvements to the U.S. military under Biden have involved, yes, making sure that the Special Operations Command has a chief of diversity, though even that blew up like a Wile E. Coyote booby trap when it was revealed that the new inclusion czar spent his spare time comparing [Former President Donald] Trump to Hitler on Twitter,"" Morrow continued.

Biden 'weakening' US military with 'green push' as enemies circle www.youtube.com

The result of projecting weakness, according to Morrow, is that China and Russia will exploit such weaknesses.



I gotta say, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] must be quaking in their boots … or more likely laughing. Because, ever since Biden took office, both men have been seeking to cause instability and probe Biden and his weaknesses, which go a lot further than just being unable to string together a coherent sentence. China is looking increasingly muscular when it comes to Taiwan, while Russia is conducting an unprecedented military buildup on the borders of Ukraine, actions which, whether they lead to actual conflict or not, have already raised the prospect of how Biden will or will not respond.

But former President Donald Trump understood this phenomenon, which is why American allies welcomed Trump projecting strength.

""Now, Donald Trump, for all his flaws, understood that thugs like Xi and Putin spoke in the language of force and that, as bullies, they would be goaded by weakness,"" Morrow said. ""As Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted the other day, quote, 'Strength deters bad guys, weakness begets war.'""

He added, ""As we honor the sacrifices of the Anzac Day fallen, let us hope that Biden learns this lesson to avoid more such sacrifices in the future.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/australian-tv-host-brutalizes-biden-weakening-america,2021-04-26
Former Ukrainian prime minister says Ukraine should investigate Hunter Biden,"Mykola Azarov, who was prime minister of Ukraine from 2010 through 2014, says that he believes Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden should be investigated, saying, ""It's a fact and not made up. It should be investigated so that the 'i's can be dotted and the 't's crossed.""

According to Reuters, Azarov made the comments from Russia, where he lives in functional exile from Ukraine. Azarov purportedly told Reuters he believes that Hunter Biden's role with Burisma should be investigated to ensure that Biden's role with the company complied with Ukrainian laws.

Azarov was prime minister of Ukraine during the critical time period of 2010-2012, which is of particular interest to prosecutors who are still looking into Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden joined the firm in 2014.

Hunter Biden's role at Burisma Holdings has come under renewed scrutiny after it was revealed last week that President Donald Trump had asked current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate it, and video subsequently came to light of former Vice President Joe Biden bragging that he got Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation, fired.

Liberal media fact checkers have rushed to exonerate Biden, pointing out (correctly) that there was international pressure to fire Shokin based on his overall perceived corruption. However, that does not rule out the possibility that Biden additionally applied pressure at his son's behest, especially in light of documents unearthed by The Hill's John Solomon, which cast doubt on many elements of Biden's story.

As for Azarov, he told Reuters, ""It's a fact (his directorship and fees) and not made up. It should be investigated so that the 'i's can be dotted and the 't's crossed.""

Azarov himself was accused of corruption in office, following a long and distinguished line of Ukrainian former leaders who have been prosecuted for corruption after leaving office. In fact, it's something of a tradition in Ukraine for incoming prime ministers to instigate corruption investigations against their defeated and potential rivals.

For instance, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was arrested and charged with corruption both before and during her national campaigns, and while she was in office, in what her supporters decried as clearly politically motivated prosecutions. These prosecutions were reopened after Tymoshenko lost the 2010 presidential election to the eventual victor, pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych. When Yanukovych was deposed in 2014, he and many of his cabinet — including Azarov — were charged with crimes related to corruption and treason and fled to Russia. It is difficult for any Westerner to accurately sort out to what extent any of these charges stem from true corruption, and to what extent they are the result of Ukraine's unique method of dealing with political rivals.

Azarov himself denies any wrongdoing during his tenure as Ukraine's prime minister.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/azarov-ukraine-hunter-biden,2019-09-29
Bad news for Dems: New polls show gains for Trump and skepticism with impeachment inquiry,"A pair of polls released on Sunday help explain why Democrats had to change their communication strategy last week.

A YouGov survey published on Sunday by the liberal website Huffington Post found that after the first week of testimony in the Democrats' inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, Americans remain evenly divided on whether he should be impeached and removed from office.

According to the poll, 45 percent of the survey's 1,000 respondents said the president should be impeached, while 42 percent said he should not be, a difference of 3 points. This is a notable improvement from the 9-point (47 to 38 percent) gap in favor of impeachment that YouGov found in October.

A different poll found similar results after the first week of testimony in the case. The study, which was conducted by Reuters and interviewed 1,115 Americans, found that 44 percent of adults believe Trump should be impeached, while 40 percent said he should not be impeached — a result similar to the 6-point (46 to 40 percent) margin Reuters found when it asked the same question in mid-October.

Polls show Dems are not moving the needle

Further underscoring the fact that Democrats have failed to convince Americans that Trump should be removed from office is that polls show that support for impeaching the president is more or less the same now than it was even before the Ukraine scandal broke.

A Reuters / Ipsos survey published in March — long before the impeachment hearings began and six months prior to the Ukraine controversy becoming public knowledge in September — found that 48 percent of U.S. adults already thought Trump should be impeached, while 40 percent said he should not be, said US News at the time.

One possible reason for why Democrats are failing to convince Americans that Trump needs to be removed from office is that Americans are sharply divided over Democrats' handling of the investigation. The November Huffington Post / YouGov poll found that 46 percent of Americans disapprove of their handling of the investigation, while 44 percent approve. Also, 49 percent of respondents said the impeachment inquiry has not changed their views of the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, respondents who have followed news stories related to the impeachment inquiry were asked if Democrats in Congress are making a good-faith effort to find out the truth or just playing politics. Among these, 46 percent said the latter while 43 percent said Democrats are making an honest attempt to ascertain facts. It's worth noting that among independents following the controversy, 49 percent said that Democrats are just playing politics while 36 percent said it's an honest pursuit of facts, a significant 13-point difference.

Democrats are also failing to convince Americans that Trump's actions were bad enough to merit impeachment. When asked to characterize whether the president ""withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to get the president of Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption against the Biden family"" amounts to impeachable conduct, 39 percent of respondents in the Huffington Post / YouGov survey said that it does. However, 43 percent said it was either appropriate (17 percent) or inappropriate but not an impeachable offense (26 percent).

Context matters: 96% of media coverage of Trump is negative

Remarkably, congressional Democrats are failing to influence Americans' views on impeachment even while enjoying the home-field advantage of overwhelmingly negative media coverage of the president.

A study by the Media Research Center released last week described broadcast news coverage of President Trump as ""more hostile than normal"" since the Democrats' impeachment inquiry began. MRC found that from Sept. 24 to Nov. 5, the major news networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) dedicated 398 minutes of coverage to the Ukraine scandal in their nightly news broadcasts, amounting to more than three-fifths of the total 645 minutes of news about during administration during the period.

In a memo summarizing the findings, MRC noted that ""out of 684 evaluative comments included in these broadcasts, a whopping 96 percent have been negative, vs. a meager four percent that have been positive.""

MRC also found that despite strong economic news in recent weeks, ""the President's handling of the economy was given a stingy 4 minutes, 6 seconds of airtime during these six weeks, or less than one percent of all Trump administration news.""

Despite this, the Reuters poll found the president's approval rating virtually unchanged since July at 41 percent.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bad_news_democrats_impeachment_poll,2019-11-18
Bret Baier says Democrats' accusations against AG Bill Barr are completely baseless,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier unraveled the accusations from Democrats against U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and concluded that there's ""not a lot there there.""

Baier was on the ""Daily Briefing"" with Dana Perino on Tuesday when he made the comments.

""What is the supposed impropriety that Democrats are suggesting of the president talking to the Australians about the investigation that Bill Barr is conducting about 2016 and the whole origins of that whole investigation,"" Perino asked. ""What is he being accused of doing that is wrong?""

""Well, he's being accused of the same thing that they say happened in the Ukraine phone call minus what they say is the implied quid pro quo with the holding back of funding,"" Baier explained.

""Saying pressuring foreign leaders for information to affect an election, however, it's the last election, and he's talked about this publicly,"" he continued.

""John referenced that May 24th appearance on the South Lawn with reporters in which he said he hoped the attorney general would look at all kinds of documents and information from Ukraine, from Italy, from Australia,"" Baier said.

""He said all this publicly, and the attorney general with the special prosecutor, the special investigator John Durham has been tasked with getting to the bottom of the beginning of the Trump probe and what happened,"" he added.

""So it seems like that allegation about talking about world leaders on that front, that there's not a lot there there,"" he concluded.

AG Barr: 'No reason' to appoint special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden,"Outgoing Attorney General William Barr said Monday he saw ""no reason"" to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden.

Barr, in his final press conference before leaving the Trump administration, assured reporters that the investigation into Biden's business dealings with foreign associates is ""being handled responsibly and professionally.""

""I have not seen a reason to appoint a special counsel, and I have no plan to do so before I leave,"" he said.

His announcement is sure to disappoint President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress who have been pushing for the appointment of special counsels to investigate President-elect Joe Biden's son. Trump reportedly has repeatedly asked for an independent investigator to be appointed so that the next president could not interfere with the investigation of his family's business deals.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) endorsed the idea last week, speaking to reporters about the issue.

""I think it's a good idea,"" he said. ""Let me say this, if you believe a special counsel is needed to look at the Trump rule regarding Russia, how can you say there is no need for special counsel regarding Hunter Biden?""

Continuing, he said, ""It's not just the allegation of tax evasion, which is being looked at, and he's presumed innocent, but it's his business dealings, emails about setting up an office and [giving] the keys to the Vice President Joe Biden ... I don't know if that's accurate or not, but how far integrated into the Ukraine economy did Hunter Biden get?""

The president-elect said last Thursday he's not worried about the investigation or the allegations of corruption surrounding Hunter Biden.

""We have great confidence in our son,"" the elder Biden told Stephen Colbert on ""The Late Show.""

Hunter Biden is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice for tax issues and other financial transactions with Chinese business associates. Biden recently revealed that the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware has opened an investigation into his tax affairs, releasing a statement about the matter. According to the Associated Press, the investigation began in 2018, before Biden's father declared his candidacy for president, but the Justice Department did not disclose the existence of the investigation until now because of a policy against doing so during an election year.

Despite the policy, in October, Sinclair Broadcasting Group's James Rosen reported the existence of an FBI investigation into Hunter Biden and his associates, focusing on allegations of money-laundering. The report was covered by conservative media, but at the time largely ignored in the mainstream press.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/barr-no-reason-special-counsel-hunter-biden,2020-12-21
Belarus is preparing to invade Ukraine and provide support to its Russian allies,"Belarus is preparing to deploy troops into Ukraine in support of the country’s Russian allies.

A Biden administration official said that Belarusian leadership could order the deployment of forces into Ukraine as early as Monday, the Washington Post reported.

The official said, “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin.”

The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has allowed Russian troops to conduct military drills and store supplies within his country.

On Saturday, Ukrainian and Russian leadership agreed to hold peace talks along the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. Lukashenko’s planned invasion of Ukraine will, naturally, complicate these planned talks.

The Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, recently called for sanctions against Lukashenko and the Belarusian regime.



Newsweek reported that Tsikhanouskaya referred to them as “accomplices of Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine.”

A Ukrainian government official told CNN that the Ukrainian government had intelligence indicating that Belarus is ready “to maybe participate directly” in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The official said that the Belarusian government is allowing Russia to use Belarus to enter Ukraine, “in addition to allowing Russians to use their territory as well as letting them cross the border.”

However, as of now, according to a senior U.S. defense official, the American government has not seen Belarusian troops “being readied to move into Ukraine” or “that they are moving or are in Ukraine.”

Anticipating Belarus’ participation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration suspended all operations in the American embassy in Belarus.

The State Department also encouraged non-emergency employees and family members of American diplomats to vacate the U.S. embassy in Russia.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “The U.S. Department of State has suspended operations at our Embassy in Minsk, Belarus and authorized the voluntary departure (‘authorized departure’) of non-emergency employees and family members at our Embassy in Moscow, Russia. We took these steps due to security and safety issues stemming from the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine.”

Over the weekend, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensified as Russian officials threatened to drop the International Space Station on the United States and its allies and Putin ordered the Russian military to put its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

Putin blamed rhetoric and posturing from NATO allies and thoroughgoing economic sanctions against Russia for why he put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/belarus-is-preparing-to-invade-ukraine-and-provide-support-to-its-russian-allies,2022-02-28
Hall is out of Ukraine,"Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was recently wounded in Ukraine, is now out of the war torn country.

""We have an update on our colleague Benjamin Hall who was seriously injured while reporting outside Kyiv on Monday. He is now safe and out of Ukraine,"" Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott told staff in a memo, according to a screenshot of that memo posted by the outlet. ""Ben is alert and in good spirits. He is being treated with the best possible care in the world and we are in close contact with his wife and family.""

Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova, who had been working as a consultant for the outlet, and Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski were both killed.

""In our effort to keep you updated on yesterday's tragic events, we wanted to report that journalist Oleksandra 'Sasha' Kuvshynova was also killed alongside our cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire yesterday while in the field with Benjamin Hall,"" Scott informed staff on Tuesday, according to the outlet. ""Sasha was just 24 years old and was serving as a consultant for us in Ukraine. She was helping our crews navigate Kyiv and the surrounding area while gathering information and speaking to sources. She was incredibly talented and spent weeks working directly with our entire team there, operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country.""

Russia's brutal military campaign against Ukraine has left many dead, including civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, calling for the establishment of a no-fly zone above Ukraine, or alternatively, he indicated that the provision of defense systems and aircraft would help Ukraine defend itself.

Hall was referring to Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshinova, who had been working as a consultant for the media outlet, and Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski.

""To sum it up, I've lost half a leg on one side and a foot on the other. One hand is being put together, one eye is no longer working, and my hearing is pretty blown… but all in all I feel pretty damn lucky to be here - and it is the people who got me here who are amazing!"" Hall said in another tweet.



According to Fox News, Hall is the father of three young daughters.

"Benjamin Netanyahu warns of new 'pernicious' form of antisemitism, reveals behind-the-scene details of Middle East peace deals with Donald Trump, being 'disrespected' by Barack Obama in wide-ranging G","Israel Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu touched on several important topics in a new interview with Glenn Beck. Netanyahu warned there is a new ""pernicious"" form of antisemitism, gave behind-the-scene details of the Middle East accords, spoke on the dangers of Iran, and revealed how he plans to deal with the Russian invasion of Ukraine when he returns to power in Israel.

Netanyahu warns of a new kind of antisemitism

With the current controversies surrounding NBA player Kyrie Irving and rapper Kanye West making headlines, Beck told Netanyahu, ""People don't seem to know what an antisemite is."" He then asked Netanyahu to define what an antisemite is.

""Well, I think it's the opposition to Jews period as a collective body and desire to do away with Jewish people,"" Netanyahu said. ""The culmination of that is obviously Hitler, but there are men who have been smaller Hitlers in history, who don't care about individual Jews, they don't differentiate. Antisemites are just anti-Jews.""

He added, ""But I would say that antisemitism today, has taken on a pernicious new form because you know it's not fashionable to say you're an antisemite.""

Beck chimed in, ""If you know anything about Israel, the point of Israel is so they can live, so you could just live.""

Netanyahu replied, ""The real purpose of the Jewish state is, first of all, to defend the lives of Jews who are subjected to this unforgiving and undiscerning hate.""

""We paid a horrendous price of massacres and displacements and exiles and pogroms and murder and ultimately Holocaust,"" he continued. ""If Israel wasn't strong, we would have been destroyed many times over.""



Netanyahu on being 'mistreated and disrespected' by Barack Obama

Netanyahu was promoting his new memoir titled ""Bibi: My Story.""

In the book, the former Israeli prime minister revealed that he was ""mistreated and disrespected"" by Barack Obama when he was president.

Netanyahu said Obama ""took the gloves off"" during their first White House meeting in 2009.

""With staff present, he made it clear that the U.S. would not tolerate further stalling or obstructions in the peace process, leaving no doubt which party he thought was responsible for such things,"" Netanyahu wrote in his new memoir.



The Times of Israel reported, ""Netanyahu says he felt the president engaged in 'a premeditated shock-and-awe' effort to make clear that past pressures on Israeli leaders on issues pertaining to the Middle East conflict 'would pale in comparison to the ones that would be applied to me.'""

""The prime minister of Israel was being treated as a minor thug in the neighborhood,"" the book read.



Obama allegedly instructed Netanyahu in private, ""I expect you to immediately freeze all construction in the areas beyond the 1967 borders. Not one brick!""

Obama then purportedly boasted, ""You know, people often underestimate me. But I come from Chicago, where I had to deal with tough opponents.""

Without providing much detail, Netanyahu said, ""He then said something out of character that shocked me deeply,"" only cryptically describing the message as ""unmistakable,"" ""offensive,"" and ""highly disturbing.""

The memoir stated, ""The prime minister of Israel was being treated as a minor thug in the neighborhood. It was this sense that the elected leader of a proud four-thousand-year-old nation was being mistreated and disrespected that got me back on my feet. 'Mr. President,' I said slowly, 'I'm sure that you mean what you said. But I am the prime minister of Israel, and I’ll do whatever I need to do to defend my country.'""

Beck asked Netanyahu to elaborate on how Obama ""mistreated and disrespected"" him, but he said he'll save that antidote for a second book.

Recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel

Then-President Donald Trump allegedly asked to speak to Netanyahu about the potential threats of violence if the United States recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Netanyahu told Trump, ""I said, 'Look, I don't see it and my intel guys tell me the same thing, but I'll tell you if there is a danger, it'll be directed first against us, and we're willing to you know, take the brunt of any attack, but frankly I just don't see it.'""

""Anyway he decided luckily or gratefully that he would declare Jerusalem as Israel's capital and of course nothing of the kind that was described happened,"" he said.

Netanyahu said the move was a ""great moment,"" and Trump ""punctured this myth and frankly finally punctured this lie"" that Jerusalem couldn't be recognized as the capital of Israel.

How Netanyahu and Trump helped bring peace to the Middle East

Netanyahu said that he approached Trump with four peace treaties ""ready for the taking.""

""I suggested that he come with an aircraft carrier to the Red Sea in the Middle East, invite me and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and others,"" he said.

Netanyahu said Trump was ""not convinced initially,"" but Trump came around after a few years.

Netanyahu said the American contribution to the peace deals was ""essential,"" ""stellar, and important to finish seal the deal.""

The incoming Israeli prime minister said, ""More will be coming.""

Netanyahu on the global dangers of the war in Ukraine

Netanyahu told Beck about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ""Well I think everybody sees that something could unravel and if it unravels it could go to a place that could jeopardize the peace of the world in an unprecedented way, really especially the slippery slope of tactical nuclear weapons and so on so.""

Israel's relationship with Russia

Netanyahu said Russia's alliance with Turkey and Iran is ""not good,"" but said Israel's relationship with Russia has ""actually changed"" and ""in many ways for the better.""

""We have a complex relationship, a nuanced relationship with Russia, yet what I said before – this question of the possible unraveling of Ukraine into a global catastrophe – is something that should occupy every leader and anybody who can contribute to preventing this or somehow ending this tragedy should do so,"" he declared.

How to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear threat

Regarding Iran obtaining nuclear weapons, Netanyahu stressed, ""The only way you could stop Iran from becoming nuclear is through crippling economic sanctions coupled with a credible military threat. If you don't have that no deal that you sign we sign – which they'll violate promptly – will make any difference we talk about.""

How America and Israel are similar

Netanyahu remarked, ""I think that the case of America and Israel, we were both founded on an ideal. Our idea was to return to the promised land, and your idea was to create a new promised land of liberty.""

"Biden says COVID-19 pandemic is 'over,' not sure if he'll run in 2024, and claims he was not briefed about documents at Trump's home in first '60 Minutes' interview","In his first interview with an American TV journalist in 220 days, President Joe Biden said the COVID-19 pandemic is ""over.""

Speaking to ""60 Minutes"" for the first time in his presidency, Biden told host Scott Pelley, ""The pandemic is over.""

""We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lot of work on it ... but the pandemic is over,"" President Biden said. ""If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it’s changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.""



According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current 7-day moving average of daily new cases is 59,856 as of Sept. 14, 2022. The current 7-day average of daily new cases is similar to the numbers in late April and in July 2021 – when there were many COVID-19 restrictions still in place across the country.

In December 2021, Biden raised the alarm for unvaccinated Americans.

""We are looking at a winter of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated, for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they'll soon overwhelm,"" Biden fearmongered.



Pelley asked Biden, ""Mr. President, as you know, last Tuesday the annual inflation rate came in at 8.3%. The stock market nosedived. People are shocked by their grocery bills. What can you do better and faster?""

Biden replied, ""Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective. Inflation rate month to month was just – just an inch, hardly at all.""

When pressed about the 40-year-high inflation of 8.3%, Biden argued, ""No, I'm not saying it is good news. But it was 8.2% or – 8.2% before. I mean, it's not – you're ac– we act– make it sound like all of a sudden, ""My god, it went to 8.2%."" It's been–.""

Pelley asked if U.S. military forces would defend Taiwan from an invasion by China.

Biden declared, ""Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.""

When questioned if ""U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women, would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion,"" Biden said, ""Yes.""

Regarding aiding Ukraine during the Russian invasion, Biden declared, ""We're gonna stay with 'em as long as they need our help."" Biden added that the United States would provide financial aid to Ukraine for ""as long as it takes.""



Biden claimed that he had not been briefed about the alleged classified documents the FBI found at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.

""I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take,"" Biden alleged. ""I– I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not.""

Biden was asked, ""Sir, are you committed to running again, or are there certain conditions that have to be right?""

President Biden said, ""Look, if I were to say to you, I'm running again, all of a sudden, a whole range of things come into play that I have – requirements I have to change and move and do.""

He added that because of election laws and other reasons make it ""much too early to make that kind of decision"" about running for president in 2024.

""I'm a great respecter of fate. And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job,"" he continued. ""I'm gonna do that job. And within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.""

""Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again,"" he stated. ""But it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-60-minutes-interview-pandemic-over-trump,2022-09-19
"Biden admin to grant 24,000 Venezuelan migrants humanitarian entry via air travel","On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced that it would grant 24,000 Venezuelan migrants humanitarian entry through air travel as part of a deal with Mexico. In exchange, future Venezuelan border-crossers will be expelled back to Mexico.



The humanitarian entry will only be granted to Venezuelans with U.S. sponsors who can prove that they can support the migrant for up to two years financially. The program would not apply to those already in America.

Officials noted that Venezuelans who illegally cross into the U.S., Mexico, or Panama after the Wednesday announcement would not be eligible for the entry program. The administration hopes that the program will encourage asylum-seekers to fly instead of traveling by foot to the southern border.

""These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,"" U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said. ""Those who attempt to cross the southern border of the United States illegally will be returned to Mexico and will be ineligible for this process in the future.""

Mexico has also requested that the U.S. provide an additional 65,000 temporary visas to migrants for non-agricultural jobs. The Biden administration plans to reserve 20,000 spots for Central Americans and Haitians.

As part of the southern border deal, Mexico has agreed to ""temporarily"" grant access to migrants through the U.S. border but did not specify how many it would accept. Previously, Mexico has generally refused to take back migrants who had illegally crossed into America.

While it is unclear how the Biden administration arrived at the number of 24,000, the entry program is modeled after the ""Uniting for Ukraine"" program, which granted Ukrainian asylum-seekers access to the U.S. Similarly, applicants had to secure an American sponsor.

During Biden's term in office, a record-breaking 1 million illegal immigrants have been released into the United States while awaiting deportation proceedings in immigration court, the New York Times reported. That total does not account for the hundreds of thousands who have slipped into the country undetected.

Between October 2021 and August 2022, over 150,000 Venezuelan migrants were apprehended at the southern border. During that period, Venezuelans accounted for only approximately 7% of all border crossings.

John Thomas, a Republican strategist, told the New York Times that the announcement was simply a calculated political decision with midterms around the corner.

""This is more of an effort to soften people's anger on what's happening on the southern border,"" Thomas said. ""It also gives the administration a talking point that they are 'doing something.'""

Biden administration set to ban imports of Russian oil and gas,"The Biden administration plans to ban imports of oil and natural gas from Russia as soon as Tuesday.

Two people reportedly with knowledge of the matter told the Washington Post that President Joe Biden intends to punish Russia for invading Ukraine by implementing an import ban.

Biden is scheduled to speak Tuesday morning and announce “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”

These new sanctions will ban imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal, Markets Insider reported.

The administration’s decision to ban these products came after lengthy discussions with European allies. However, at this time, those European nations are not joining the United States in banning Russian energy imports with the exception of the United Kingdom, per Politico.

Western nations have been particularly hesitant to stop importing oil from Russia since Russia provides them with a substantial amount of their energy. The European Union, for instance, gets around 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Russia accounts for roughly 12% of global oil production.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned that a Western ban on Russian oil would yield “catastrophic consequences” for the global market and cause oil prices to surge beyond $300 a barrel.

Oil prices were already reaching historic highs before the White House considered barring the import of Russian energy.

Last week, crude oil futures listed prices at more than $113 per barrel. This is the highest that oil has traded since 2011.

And for the first time since 2008, the average price of gas in the U.S. is over $4 a gallon. In some states, like California, gas is well over $5 a gallon.

Despite the skyrocketing costs of energy consumption, the Biden administration is adamantly opposed to increasing domestic oil production.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki argued that instead of increasing domestic production, the U.S. should pivot away from fossil fuels altogether.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,"" Psaki said. ""Domestic production has not insulated us from the price volatility of fossil fuels or the whims of those who control them such as President Putin. Americans know that.""

The Biden administration has even floated the possibility of buying oil from countries that are openly hostile to the United States, like Iran and Venezuela, instead of increasing domestic oil production.

Senior American officials are even meeting with representatives of the Maduro regime in Venezuela to discuss the possibility of purchasing oil from the Venezuelan reserves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-set-to-ban-imports-of-russian-oil-and-gas,2022-03-08
"Biden administration set to ship 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe to protect NATO allies from Russia","The United States is preparing to deploy around 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe as Russia continues growing its military presence along the border of Ukraine.

NBC News reported that in the coming days, roughly 1,000 American soldiers who are currently stationed in Germany will be repositioned to Romania to support American forces already in the country.

John Kirby, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said that the reinforcements are part of a Stryker infantry unit that is “designed to deploy in short order and move quickly.”

Kirby stated, “This force is designed to deter aggression and enhance our defense capabilities and frontline allied states, and we expect them, as I said, to move in coming days.”

He also said that the United States will be moving an additional force of about 2,000 troops from the United States to Europe “in the next few days.” Most of these troops will be stationed in Poland.

Kirby continued, “Collectively, this force is trained and equipped for a variety of missions — to deter aggression and to reassure and to defend our allies.”

It is believed that these troop movements are “not permanent” and that the United States will reassess the situation as it continues to evolve.

Last week, President Biden committed to stationing American troops in NATO countries, saying, “I’ll be moving troops to Eastern Europe in the NATO countries in the near term.”

Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “We are ready, capable, and prepared to uphold our obligation under treaty to NATO. An attack against one NATO ally is an attack against all.”

Differentiating these reinforcements from the 8,500 troops placed on “heightened alert” for potential military conflict with Russia by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Kirby noted that these forces “are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to maintain robust defense of our NATO allies.”

A senior official within the Biden administration said, “At the president’s direction and following Secretary [Lloyd] Austin’s recommendation, the Department of Defense will reposition certain Europe-based units further east, forward deploy additional U.S.-based units to Europe, and maintain the heightened state of readiness of response forces to meet these commitments.”

The 8,500 troops placed on “heightened alert” have not yet been given deployment orders.

Two weeks ago, when this decision was announced, Kirby said, “I want to reinforce that as of now, the decision has been made to put these units on high alert and higher alert only.”

Currently, Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine, and its leadership believes that its Western adversaries are not taking its demands seriously.

Biden approval sinks to record low in NPR poll taken before Russia invaded Ukraine,"A majority of Americans believe President Joe Biden's first year in office was a ""failure,"" according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.

Support for the president has dropped to the lowest level recorded by the survey, with Biden holding just a 39% overall approval rating with U.S. adults. His overall approval rating is slightly better with registered voters, though still at a dismal 40%. The president's overall disapproval rating is at 55% with both groups.

A 56% majority of both U.S. adults and registered voters rate the president's first year in office as a failure, the survey found. Only 39% said it was a success.

These crushing poll numbers come as Americans are expressing widespread dissatisfaction with how Biden is performing on the economy, the pandemic, and with foreign policy. Most survey respondents, 54%, said Biden is not fulfilling his campaign promises, and 52% said he has done more to divide the country than unite it, even though uniting the country was a central theme of Biden's 2020 campaign for the White House.

On the issues, Biden receives just 36% approval for his handling of the economy and 47% for his handling of the pandemic. A plurality of 37% of registered voters say inflation should be the top priority for Biden right now, as consumer prices have increased at the largest rate in 40 years over the past year.

Other important issues rank far behind inflation, with the pandemic being the top concern for 12% of registered voters, voting laws for another 12%, and foreign policy and violent crime each for 10%.

Foreign policy is a rising concern for Americans with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Importantly, this poll was conducted between Feb. 15 and Feb. 21, before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. When this poll was taken, 50% of U.S. adults said they disapproved of how Biden was handling the situation, while only 34% approved.



A pitiful 30% of respondents said they think the U.S. is headed in the right direction.

""These are sort of rock-bottom numbers,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, in a statement. ""It's about as low as you're going to see him.""

NPR identified three key groups that Biden is struggling with that explain his disastrous poll numbers: Independents, suburban voters, and the Democratic base.

Only 29% of self-identified independents approve of Biden's job performance. An astonishing 64% of independents disapprove of Biden, more than double the percentage that approve. It's a far-cry from the support Biden held in 2020, when he won the presidency with majority support from independents.

As for suburban voters, just 38% approve of the president, a decrease of 11 percentage points from December. Biden has seen a double-digit decrease in support from suburban women over the past two months alone, down to 45% from 57%.

The president is also suffering from a lack of intense support from Democrats. Only 14% of U.S. adults strongly approve of Biden's performance, a worse rating than President Donald Trump had at any time during his presidency, according to NPR.

Credit Biden's souring approval with his supporters to the 50-50 U.S. Senate. Major initiatives like the Build Back Better social spending package and a federal overhaul of U.S. elections have been stymied by lack of support in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster.

The only major pieces of legislation advanced under Biden's tenure have been a coronavirus relief package, called the American Rescue Plan, and a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Those achievements are decidedly not enough to make up for Biden's failure to ""shut down"" the coronavirus pandemic, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ongoing supply chain issues and rising prices.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-approval-sinks-to-record-low-in-npr-poll-taken-before-russia-invaded-ukraine,2022-02-25
Biden calls it 'bizarre' to claim his big spending caused high inflation,"President Joe Biden said on Thursday that it was ""bizarre"" to claim that his big spending plan has lead to high inflation.

Biden made the comments in an interview with the Associated Press.

“The need for mental health in America, it has skyrocketed, because people have seen everything upset,” Biden said. “Everything they’ve counted on upset. But most of it’s the consequence of what’s happened, what happened as a consequence of the COVID crisis.”

He went on to say that the overall mindset of Americans is not good.

“People are really, really down,"" Biden said.

When asked about whether his coronavirus relief package worsened inflation, Biden unequivocally denied the claim.

“You could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation,” he continued. “I don’t think it did. And most economists do not. But the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre.”

Americans faced more economic bad news on Thursday when the stock market continued its collapse, but Biden claimed that it was unlikely to mean a recession was coming.

“First of all, it’s not inevitable,” he said about a recession. “Secondly, we’re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation.”



He was also defensive about his role in causing the rise in inflation.

""If it’s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I’m not being a wise guy,” he asked.

A poll in March showed there are more Americans who blame Biden and his policies for the rise in inflation than there are who blame the invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, or greedy corporations. The Biden administration has tried to deflect blame from their policies to all three, but Biden's favorability continues to sink lower and lower ahead of pivotal midterm elections.

"Twitter reactions to Biden blaming stations for high gas prices, Jeff Bezos reacts","President Joe Biden was taken to task over a recent tweet where he blamed gas stations for sky-high fuel prices. While Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was critical of President Biden's latest scapegoat for record gas prices, Chinese state media applauded Biden for realizing ""that capitalism is all about exploitation.""

President Biden demands gas companies lower prices

Less than two weeks ago, President Biden demanded oil companies lower their gas prices.

""To the companies running gas stations and setting those prices at the pump, this is a time of war, global peril, Ukraine. These are not normal times. Bring down the price you are charging at the pump. Do it now,"" Biden commanded.

President Biden doubled down on his directive for gas companies to lower prices with a tweet on Saturday.

""My message to the companies running gas stations and setting prices at the pump is simple: this is a time of war and global peril,"" the tweet said. ""Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you’re paying for the product. And do it now.""

Gas industry experts tell a different story

According to the National Association of Convenience Stores, ""Only about 0.1% of the fueling outlets in the country are owned by a major oil company."" NACS stated that 62% of U.S. gas stations are owned by an individual or family who only operates a single retail gas location.

NACS also noted that gas stations make a ""10- to 15-cent profit"" on a gallon of gas.

NBC News reported, ""Station owners make most of their profits in their stores, on sales of food and drinks, as well as alcohol where sales are legal.""

Twitter Reactions to President Biden blaming gas stations

Commentators quickly called out the president for not taking responsibility for record gas prices while assigning guilt to gas stations, Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump, and the COVID pandemic.

Congressional candidate Robby Starbuck:

Entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David: ""First the White House blamed Trump. Then COVID. Then Putin. Then Oil companies. Now gas station owners. What’s next, blaming car owners for driving too much?""



Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): ""My message to the guy running your teleprompter: It’s YOUR fault. Reverse the dozens of executive orders, regulations & agency actions targeting American energy, and gas prices will fall…FAST.""

Journalist Erielle Davidson: ""The market sets the price at the pump, not the gas stations. How are you this economically illiterate. How.""

""Fox & Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade: ""Maybe if u met with the oil executives last week instead of the Wind theorists u would know they are not at fault, your policies are- and here’s the best news, you can still change them & help the country.""

Novelist Walter Kirn: ""I grew up working in gas stations. They aren’t predatory money machines. Can’t afford to be due to intense competition, because there’s usually another one just down the block — whose prices are posted on a big sign for all to see. What silly amateur condescending bulls**t.""

Former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai:

Jeff Bezos slams the Biden administration



Bezos – the owner of the Washington Post – denigrated the Biden administration for pointing the finger at energy companies for high gas prices.



""Ouch. Inflation is far too important a problem for the White House to keep making statements like this,"" Bezos wrote on Twitter. ""It's either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics.""

Commentators note that Bezos has 'buyer's remorse'

Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden simply said, ""Buyer's remorse.""

Former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell bashed Bezos, ""Tell this to your own newsroom! YOU are part of the problem. Republicans should never help you….or your work ways.""



Columnist Derek Hunter also mocked Bezos, ""You should try reading the Washington Post, Jeff. There isn't anyone there who understands or respects how markets work either. Know anyone who could change that?""

Actor Rob Schneider: ""When you lose liberal billionaire/Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, you have lost the ideological war. If the Biden administration is out of touch with Billionaires, imagine how the average American worker feels…""

Biden garners support from Chinese state media

Chen Weihua – EU bureau chief of the state-owned China Daily newspaper – wrote on Twitter, ""Now US President finally realized that capitalism is all about exploitation. He didn't believe this before.""

Biden previous said record gas prices were part of an 'incredible transition'



In May, President Biden proclaimed that record-high gas prices are part of an ""incredible transition"" that will make America less dependent on fossil fuels.

“When it comes to the gas prices, we’re going through an incredible transition that is taking place that, God willing, when it’s over, we’ll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over,” Biden declared during a joint press conference with Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-blames-stations-high-gas-prices,2022-07-03
"Joe Biden called a 'pervert,' questioned about Ukraine during contentious campaign stop","Former Vice President Joe Biden was heckled during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Sunday, accused of being a ""pervert"" for his history of touching people without consent and grilled about his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine, according to reporters at the event.

Biden was at a campaign rally in a gymnasium in Milford, New Hampshire, when two separate outbursts by protesters interrupted the start of the event.

The first heckler, a male who appeared to be recording on a phone camera, attacked Biden's age and race, and accused him of improper touching.

""You touch kids on video, and women,"" the man yelled. ""We don't need another old, white man running for president. It's time that a minority stepped up. You don't touch kids ever again. Don't touch kids, you pervert!""

Biden maintained his composure, saying ""this is a democracy"" before the next heckler got started.

""The truth is going to come out, buddy!"" the woman yelled as she slowly backed toward the exit. She then began chanting ""Quid pro Joe,"" an apparent reference to accusations toward Biden regarding the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor while Biden was vice president.

Biden may see an increase in hecklers on the campaign trail, as he has shown in the past that he can be provoked to react aggressively.



Earlier this month in Iowa, a voter in attendance asked Biden about Ukraine and accused him of using the vice presidency to get his son Hunter a lucrative job in Ukraine, and of selling access to the president.

Biden appeared to react angrily, calling the voter a ""damn liar"" before possibly almost calling him fat and challenging him to a push-up contest and an IQ test. Sunday's interaction, however, seems to indicate Biden is now more prepared for potentially hostile members of the audience at his events.

Biden calls press ‘lid’ — won’t speak to reporters — following bombshell report about alleged meeting with Burisma executive,"The Biden campaign called yet another press ""lid"" Wednesday morning following a bombshell report showing that former Vice President Joe Biden may have lied about meeting with an executive from Ukraine energy firm, Burisma Holdings, in 2015.

The New York Post reported early Wednesday about a newly obtained ""smoking gun"" email that appeared to show that Hunter Biden brokered a meeting in April 2015 between his father and and Burisma's ""No. 3 exec,"" Vadym Pozharskyi. Biden has repeatedly denied ever discussing his son's ""overseas business dealings.""

""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,"" the e-mail from Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden reads.

The revelation, which calls into question Biden's honesty regarding his son's past lucrative position on the Burisma board, is certainly a subject of interest to the media.

Feeling the heat, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates hit back at the report in a statement, saying, ""We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.""

But a prepared statement from the campaign is not quite the same as a candidate responding to reporter's questions. Unfortunately, at least for the remainder of the day, press will be unable to get a direct response from Biden himself on the matter.

Daily Mail reporter Nikki Schwab posted part of a press release on Twitter late Wednesday morning, showing that while the Biden campaign had called a lid, the candidate would still be participating in a fundraiser later in the day.

""The Biden campaign has called a lid. Later this afternoon, Biden will participate in a virtual fundraiser. Your pooler will send a report at its conclusion,"" the release said. ""At 7 p.m., Biden is delivering pre-taped remarks to American Muslims at the Muslims Making Change: National Honors event. Those remarks are open press.""

It should be noted that calling early press lids — arcane signals that mean a candidate is done campaigning for the day and won't be speaking to reporters — have become a common practice for the 77-year-old Democratic nominee during this year's election.



The gaffe-prone candidate has generally relied on a low-profile, under-the-radar campaign and has fielded far fewer questions from reporters than his opponent, President Trump.

So while the action of calling a lid is not unusual for Biden, the timing of Wednesday's lid is what some are finding suspicious.

Biden campaign issues warning to the media: Fall in line and debunk corruption claims,"On Monday, Joe Biden's presidential campaign issued a warning to reporters and editors in a circulated memorandum demanding that they debunk claims of corruption against him.

The memo, titled, ""The Imperative for Honest Coverage of Trump's Ukraine Conspiracy Theory,"" dealt specifically with the charge that then-Vice President Biden, as the Obama administration's point man in Ukraine, pushed for a Ukrainian prosecutor to be fired by threatening to withhold aid to the country.

The fired prosecutor, Victor Shokin, was reportedly removed at the same time he was investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Biden's son, Hunter, sat on the board.

It is 'malpractice' not to debunk the claims

According to the Biden campaign, President Trump's impeachment was due in large part to his efforts to spread this theory.

""[Trump's] objective was to pressure the Ukrainian government into spreading a malicious and conclusively debunked conspiracy theory: that Vice President Biden engaged in wrongdoing when he executed official United States policy to remove a corrupt prosecutor from office,"" communications director Kate Bedingfield wrote in the memo.

In the memo, Bedingfield cites numerous mainstream news outlets that agree with Biden's version of the story and that discredit the theory that Biden pushed for the firing of the prosecutor to cover up corruption.

Accordingly, she goes on to instruct the media to ""state clearly and unambiguously that [such claims of corruption] have been discredited and debunked"" during their ongoing impeachment coverage.

To do otherwise would be journalistic ""malpractice,"" she warns.

""It is not sufficient to say the allegations are 'unsubstantiated' or that 'no evidence has emerged to support them.' Not only is there 'no evidence' for Republicans' main argument against the Vice President — there is a mountain of evidence that actively debunks it. And it is malpractice to ignore that truth.""

Reporting on the news, The Hill called the Biden campaign memo the ""strongest rebuke yet"" of corruption allegations against the candidate.

The media falls in line

Despite numerous outlets having reported the claims as false, Republicans and Trump defenders are not so convinced.

In fact, it was Biden himself who added fuel to the theory's flame when he openly bragged on camera about successfully securing Shokin's firing during a meeting with the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

""I said, 'I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars.' I said, 'you're not getting the billion.' I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.'"" Biden recalled.

""Well, son of a bitch,"" he continued to laughter. ""He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

But, HotAir reported that following the memo's release, already some in the media have agreed to the campaign's imperative.

MSNBC's Heidi Przybla said on air that the campaign's warning is ""a preemptive strike against the disinformation that is really at the heart of the president's defense.""

""This is a reminder ... that the entire premise of the [president's] argument is debunked. It is not just unsubstantiated,"" she continued, repeating the talking points.

Another MSNBC reporter, they note, tweeted out the talking points:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-campaign-warning-to-press,2020-01-22
"Biden caves to Russia on sanctions in new Iran nuclear deal, will enrich Russia: Report","The Biden administration will reportedly lift certain energy sanctions on Russia to comply with the forthcoming renegotiated Iran nuclear deal.

What are the details?

The revived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, includes American concessions negotiated by the Biden administration that immunize Moscow from certain sanctions deployed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, the Washington Free Beacon reported, citing Russian and Iranian documents.

Specifically, the new deal will allow Rosatom, Russia's top state-controlled energy company, to ""cash in on a $10 billion contract"" to help Tehran expand its Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, according to the Free Beacon. Bushehr is one of the most controversial nuclear sites in Iran.

Thus, the new JCPOA establishes a ""sanctions evasion hub"" providing Russian companies with money, essentially counteracting energy sanctions deployed after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

A State Department official confirmed to the Free Beacon the U.S. will ""not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the JCPOA.""

""The United States will take actions as necessary to ensure that U.S. sanctions do not apply to the implementation of JCPOA nuclear-related projects and activities by non-U.S. individuals and entities,"" the official explained. ""Perhaps it is now clear to Moscow that, as we have said publicly, the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its implementation.""

The Russian Foreign Ministry also confirmed the development.

""Additions were made to the text of the future agreement on #JCPOA restoration to ensure that all the JCPOA-related projects, esp. with Russian participation, as well as Bushehr NPP, are protected from negative impact of anti-Russian restrictions by US & EU,"" the ministry's Vienna mission said on Twitter.

The U.S. is also lifting sanctions on Iran.

As part of the deal, the U.S. will lift economic sanctions on Tehran that prevented the country from accessing funds held in South Korean and Japanese banks. Unfreezing the funds will allow Iran to pay Russia for working on its nuclear program.

Additionally, Axios reported the U.S. is considering removing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from terrorist lists. The IRCG is known to fund terrorism against the U.S. and its allies across the Middle East.

Anything else?

Republican lawmakers have been extremely critical of Biden's administration for renegotiating the JCPOA over fears the U.S. would give up too many concessions.

Unfortunately, those fears will probably be realized once the deal is finalized.

In fact, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's lead negotiator, recently bragged that Moscow, Tehran, and Beijing essentially took the U.S. to the cleaners in getting what they wanted from the deal at the expense of America.

""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" Ulyanov said. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-caves-to-russia-on-sanctions-in-new-iran-nuclear-deal-will-enrich-russia-report,2022-03-17
"Biden claims 'We're gonna free Iran,' undoing weeks of calculated messaging around Iranian protests","Amid a discussion about how his administration might improve care for veterans, particularly those who recently fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Joe Biden told Democrat supporters at a rally on Thursday that ""we're gonna free Iran.""

Biden's comment reportedly negates weeks of work by U.S. officials to carefully counter the Iranian regime's narrative that America is steering the Persian protests.

Comment and context

Biden went to a Democrat rally in San Diego to promote Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.), who is at risk of losing his seat to Republican challenger Brian Maryott.

Outside the event was an Iranian freedom protest. There was some spillover of the protesters' sentiment into the rally, as several audience members held up ""free Iran"" signs.

The Hill reported that Biden was talking about veterans' health care and expanding benefits for millions of military members exposed to toxins while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Audience members' tangential concern — not with American veterans' health, but with the Iranian regime's persecution of women, anti-government protesters, and others — captured the president's attention.

Biden said, ""Don't worry. We're gonna free Iran. They're gonna free themselves pretty soon.""

Freeing Iran

It was not immediately clear what Biden meant.

Although one NSC spokesman claimed Biden had just been reiterating his support for the Iranian protests, Bloomberg reported that Biden's remarks ""undercut the carefully constructed US approach to the protests,"" which sought to ""avoid the impression that the US is somehow steering them, as Iran's leaders have claimed.""

Although Biden's remarks may soon be walked back by the White House as another ""gaffe,"" the we/they framing of the hypothetical Iranian liberation prompted the Iranian regime to recall previous U.S.-backed we/they interventions.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi responded to Biden's remarks saying, ""Mr. President, Iran was freed 43 years ago. ... Iran is determined not to fall into your captivity and will never become your cash cow.""

Raisi was referencing the 1979 Iranian revolution, when the last shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown. Pahlavi had been installed as the result of an internationally coordinated coup.

On Aug. 19, 2013, the CIA formally admitted that it had helped the British overthrow Iran's democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosadegh, in 1953. NPR reported that Mosadegh had indicated that, after decades of British control over the country's oil, he would break off negotiations and deny British involvement.

Sanctions, exclusions, and bombs

Biden has recently faced pressure to ensure that Iran doesn't acquire nuclear bombs and to hold Raisi's regime accountable for ""ruthlessly gunning down its own citizens in the streets.""



Presently, the Biden administration has sought to use diplomatic pressure and sanctions, despite the same not having worked on Russia in recent months.

CNN reported that the U.S. aims to remove Iran from the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in the wake of the death of a 22-year-old woman held captive by Iran's ""morality police.""

On Oct. 26, the U.S. imposed new sanctions against Iranian officials in light of the regime's nationwide crackdown on protesters.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the U.S. ""is committed to supporting the Iranian people and ensuring that those responsible for the brutal crackdown on the ongoing nationwide protests in Iran are held accountable.""

"Classified docs found in Biden's office were marked 'top secret' — contained info related to Ukraine, Iran, UK: report","The classified documents discovered in President Joe Biden's private office last fall include American ""intelligence memos and briefing materials"" related to Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom, CNN reported.

Sources told CNN the documents were dated to the second term of the Obama administration, from 2013 to 2016. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, conducted business in Ukraine during those years.

The sources confirmed the documents were discovered in boxes that also contained unclassified documents. Many of the documents in those boxes also fell under the Presidential Records Act, and thus should have remained in possession of the U.S. government.

According to CNN, some of the classified documents were marked ""top secret"":

Fewer than a dozen classified documents were found at the office, another source told CNN. It is unclear why they were taken to Biden’s private office. The classified materials included some top-secret files with the “sensitive compartmented information” designation, also known as SCI, which is used for highly sensitive information obtained from intelligence sources.

Biden was allegedly unaware the documents were in his private office, and he allegedly doesn't know what information the documents contain.

If Biden did not know they were there, the question then becomes: Who, having access to highly classified information, stored the documents in Biden's private office without his knowledge?

One thing, however, is clear. Despite the gnashing of teeth over Donald Trump retaining classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Democrats are playing a game of whataboutism, stressing this instance of misuse of classified information is not comparable to Trump's because fewer documents are involved, Biden allegedly did not know they were there, and Biden's attorneys immediately turned over the documents to the National Archives.

Meanwhile, it's not clear whether the documents that Biden's attorneys handed over are all of them. The only documents turned over were those immediately discovered to be marked with classified headings. It's not clear if government investigators searched for more classified documents.

"Biden condemns invasion of Ukraine, announces harsh sanctions against Russia","President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the U.S. will impose severe economic sanctions against Russia after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two rebel regions of Ukraine as independent states.

Biden condemned actions Putin took on Monday, including deploying troops into eastern Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions to carry out ""peacekeeping functions."" Russia's Parliament also authorized the use of military force in Ukraine on Tuesday, which the president characterized as the beginning of an invasion.



""To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""Last night, Putin authorized Russian forces to deploy into these regions. Today, he asserted that these regions actually extend deeper than the two areas he recognized, claiming large areas under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian government. He's setting up a rationale to take more territory by force, in my view.""



Biden announced that in response, the U.S. would impose sanctions ""far beyond"" those imposed against Russia in 2014, when Putin annexed the Crimean peninsula. The president called Putin's actions ""a flagrant violation of international law"" that ""demands a firm response from the international community.""



""Russia has now undeniably moved against Ukraine,"" Biden said.

The new sanctions will be levied against large Russian financial institutions and members of the country's elite, as well as their families. The United States will also place ""comprehensive sanctions"" on Russian debt.

“That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western finance,” Biden said. “It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.”

The president acknowledged that Americans will likely see rising gas prices as a result of levying sanctions against Russia.

“As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs, for us as well and here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that. But as we do this, I'm going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.”

The president vowed to continue placing sanctions on Russia should Putin proceed with a further invasion of Ukraine. He also said that the U.S. is working with Germany to freeze the Nord Steam 2 pipeline project.

Earlier Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his country has stopped the certification process for the pipeline, which Russia badly desires to be completed to permit Russian oil to flow directly to Germany, circumventing Ukrainian oil-transit taxes. The U.K. government also said it would sanction members of the Russian Parliament who voted to recognize the independence of the separatist regions in Ukraine.

“This is the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson told U.K. lawmakers on Tuesday.

These actions come as western leaders struggle to develop a policy to contain Putin's ambitions to expand Russia's borders. In a fiery speech Monday, Putin showed his hand by condemning the fall of the Soviet Union and denying that Ukraine has a right to exist as a free state outside of Russian control.

Putin asserted that Russia has a national defense interest in protecting ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking residents of the eastern part of Ukraine, remarks that drew comparisons to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's justification for the invasion of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.

His ultimate goal is the restoration of Russian greatness by reclaiming parts of the old Soviet empire, starting with Ukraine.

To shore up defenses in other Eastern European nations, Biden said he has authorized additional movements of U.S. forces and military equipment to ""strengthen"" allies in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

“Today, in response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized additional movements of US forces and equipment, already stationed in Europe to strengthen our Baltic allies: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,” Biden said.

He emphasized that these forces are being stationed as a ""defensive"" move and that the door to a diplomatic resolution to the crisis remains open, should Russia be willing to deescalate.

""Whatever Russia does next, we're ready to respond with unity, clarity, and conviction,"" Biden said.

Biden says corruption claims against Hunter Biden are 'totally discredited.' But that's not true.,"Joe Biden claimed during Tuesday's presidential debate that scrutiny surrounding his son's financial dealings with Russian interests has been ""totally discredited.""



But that's not exactly true.

What did Biden say?

About halfway through the chaotic debate, President Donald Trump homed in on Hunter Biden and scrutiny surrounding his work in Ukraine and Russia during the Obama administration, for which he was paid handsomely. Biden's critics have suggested the financial payments are evidence of corruption and a conflict of interest while Biden was vice president.

Trump asked, ""While we're at it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave your son $3.5 millions of dollars. What did he do to deserve it?""

""None of that is true; it's been totally discredited,"" Biden responded.

When Trump attempted to rebut, debate moderator Chris Wallace, an anchor at Fox News, continually interrupted Trump and gave Biden the floor.

What are the facts?



Last week, Senate Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee and the Finance Committee released a joint report leveling new, serious allegations against Hunter Biden.

The report detailed more than a dozen ""key findings"" that connect Hunter Biden's time on the board of Burisma in Ukraine to possible corruption, aiding Moscow's disinformation efforts, and even hindering U.S. foreign policy.

One of those ""key findings"" was that ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""

As TheBlaze reported:

Baturina is a Russian businesswoman and the country's only frail billionaire. Her riches came when her husband, the late Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, orchestrated a number of municipal contracts with her company. Luzhkov was fired in 2010 by then-President Medvedev over corruption allegations, the report says.



Baturina wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's investment firm for a ""consulting agreement,"" the committee states.

The investment firm in question, Rosemont Seneca Thornton, was ""co-founded by Hunter Biden that was incorporated on May 28, 2013 in Wilmington, Del.,"" the Senate report explained. The firm is apparently an offshoot of another firm, Rosemont Seneca, which was co-founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, stepson of John Kerry, who at the time of the transaction of Baturina was serving as secretary of state.

The Senate report cited ""confidential document 6"" as proof of the financial transaction.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, told PolitiFact that the Senate report is not true. ""Hunter Biden had no interest in and was not a co-founder of Rosemont Seneca Thornton, so the claim that he was paid $3.5 million is false,"" he said.

However, PolitiFact noted that Mesires refused to show documents to corroborate his claim that Biden was not associated with Rosemont Seneca Thorton.

Senate Republicans provided no definitive proof to substantiate their claims, though many of the supporting documents are cited in the report as ""confidential.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-corruption-claims-hunter-discredited,2020-09-30
Biden warns of possible cyberattack from Russia on critical infrastructure: 'It's coming',"President Joe Biden issued another warning of the possibility of a Russian cyberattack on critical infrastructure in the U.S.

“The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming,” said Biden Monday at a business roundtable meeting.

""The federal government is doing its part to get ready,"" he added and called on the private sector to respond accordingly. He also suggested that it would be their ""patriotic duty"" to invest as much as they could to improve their technological defenses.

The warning was based on preparatory activity identified by U.S. intelligence that could precede a cyberattack.

""I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners,"" said Biden in a statement.



""It’s part of Russia’s playbook,"" he added. ""Today, my administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks.""

The White House urged companies to improve and update their cyber defenses as a precaution.

White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology Anne Neuberger told reporters at a media briefing that the Biden administration was prepared to respond to a cyberattack from Russia.

“As the president has said, the United States is not seeking confrontation with Russia, but he has also said if Russia conducts disruptive cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, we will be prepared to respond,” Neuberger claimed.

Biden also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin might lash out in a cyberattack because the invasion into Ukraine is not going according to their timeline.

""The more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ,"" Biden said.

Biden declares 'there's going to be a new world order' in address to business executives,"While speaking with corporate leaders from some of America’s largest companies, President Joe Biden affirmed his faith in the “new world order.”

“We’re at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy, not just the world economy, the world, that occurs every three or four generations,” the president said, “[A general told me] that 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946 and since then we’ve established a liberal world order, and it hasn’t happened in a long while.”

“And now is a time when things are shifting,” Biden continued, “We’re going to — there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it. And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.”

According to a transcript of Biden’s address released by the White House, the discussion emphasized the need for American companies to continue working with the White House in “reducing costs and a whole lot more” while accounting for the ongoing disruptions to agricultural markets and energy production.

The president applauded American corporations for assisting American leftists to further their radical social messaging across the globe as they “innovate with and for diversity.”

Biden said, “I’m pleased to see American companies stepping up and doing their part.”

Biden’s address also patted the transnational business leaders on the back for their role in decimating the Russian economy in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

“You did a hell of a lot to help us impose sanctions and incur costs,” the president said to the room full of CEOs. “We’re seeing now that it mattered. It was really important what you all did.”

The president was also very optimistic about the future of American manufacturing. He asked for America’s business leaders to “invest in America itself in manufacturing.”

“As one of my colleagues from the Midwest said: We’re not going to talk about the Rust Belt any more,” Biden said. “We’re going to talk about new, expanded manufacturing capacity in the Middle — in the Middle Atlantics — excuse me, in the Midwest.”

Biden called on business leaders to “invest in America itself — in manufacturing, climate resilience, clean energy — so America can win the competition in the 21st century.”

He referred to Intel's recent $20 billion investment in Ohio as an event that will help bring about this goal.

“Intel is investing $20 million — billion in a semiconductor campus in Ohio. … The point is: These are [history-making] investments.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-declares-there-s-going-to-be-a-new-world-order-in-address-to-business-executives,2022-03-22
"Joe Biden denies that he fat-shamed Iowa voter during fiery debate, campaign offers an improbable cover story","Former Vice President Joe Biden denied that he was caught on video fat-shaming a man who confronted him at his event, and his presidential campaign instead offered an improbable cover story.

Video of the fiery debate between Biden and an angry critic at his campaign event went viral on Thursday.

Many believed that Biden was beginning to say ""fatso"" to the argumentative man during the exchange.

Biden's senior adviser Symone Sanders took to her Twitter account to explain why people didn't hear on the video of the altercation what their ears told them they heard.



""Let's be clear RE: the exchange VP Biden had with a voter in Iowa earlier today: 1) the gentleman is a self identified Warren supporter who said he would vote for the VP in a general election 2) his facts were flat-out wrong and 3) the crowd backed VP Biden up in his response,"" Sanders tweeted.

""To be clear: Any assertion VP Biden said a word about the gentleman's appearance is making this something it is not. In the latter part of the exchange, the VP began to say ""Look, facts"" then said ""here's the deal."" If you've been to a Biden event, you've heard this before,"" she said in a second tweet.



""These lies will not go unchecked & we'll continue to lay out the facts,"" Sanders concluded helpfully.

Biden himself denied that he used the word ""fat"" later to Bo Erickson of CBS News.

""No I didn't!"" he responded. He did not answer when asked to clarify what it was he said to the man.

Biden claims his economic plan is 'working' despite historically high inflation,"The Biden administration faced an onslaught of online criticism after saying that his economic plan was ""working"" despite the year-over-year inflation figure remaining historically high.

President Joe Biden addressed the newest inflation report on Wednesday from the White House.

""I want to say a word today about news that came out today relative to the economy. Actually I just want to say a number: zero,"" said Biden.

""Today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July. Zero percent. Here's what that means. While the price of some things go up, went up last month, the price of other things went down, by the same amount,"" he continued.

""The result is zero inflation last month,"" Biden added. ""But people are still hurting. But zero inflation last month.""

Biden went on to say that the low unemployment rate and an increase in jobs added last month showed that his economic policies were working well.

""Our work is far from over but two things should be clear,"" said Biden.

""First the economic plan is working and second is building an economy that will reward work. Wages are up this month, provide opportunity, help the middle class and still have work to do but we're on track,"" he added.

Many on social media took Biden to task for claiming that inflation was zero percent based on the monthly inflation figure that completely ignored the year-over-year figure that remained historically high.

While Biden may believe his policies are working, the voters do not. Polls have shown that Americans are hurting from high inflation and they blame the high spending policies of the Biden administration far more than other contributors, such as the war on Ukraine and the pandemic lockdown.

Here are Biden's comments on the inflation fiasco:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-economy-working-inflation,2022-08-10
"Biden offers his solution to high gas prices, and the online backlash is fierce","President Joe Biden faced online ridicule and mockery after he offered one solution for high gas prices that the average American would likely find completely unfeasible.

Biden made the comments in a speech Thursday from the White House where he touted his plan to tackle the problem of high gas prices.

The president blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic for the rising of gas prices.

""Putin's war is imposing the costs on Americans and our allies, and on Democracies around the world,"" said Biden in his speech.

He called the increase in gas prices ""Putin's price hike"" and said that his plan would lead to American energy independence.

""Under my plan, which is before Congress now, we can take advantage of the next generation of electric vehicles, that a typical driver will save about $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump,"" Biden explained.



Gas prices have skyrocketed in past months due to inflation from government overspending, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the Democratic efforts to phase out fossil fuels.

'Way out of touch'

Many critics of the Biden administration took to Twitter to respond to the unfeasible solution.

""Just drop $60,000 on a new car and you could save $80/mo it's not that hard,"" replied Abigail Marone.

""A 'typical driver' with an average credit score financing a bare bones Nissan Leaf will have a car payment of around $560 a month. So a net 'savings' of -$480 per month,"" tweeted writer Jim Jamitis.

""The old man and his whole staff is way out of touch,"" read another very popular response.

""These people live in a totally different world than the average citizen. They just don’t get it or else they do get it and keep pushing it hoping it comes true,"" replied one critic.

""These people are just mocking the poor and working class people,"" said another detractor.

Biden's two-prong plan to reduce gas prices included releasing millions more barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve and punishing oil companies who don't follow his command to increase oil production.

A recent poll found that far more people blamed Biden and his energy policies for high gas prices than those that blamed Putin, the pandemic, or greedy corporations.

Majority of voters say special counsel should be initiated to investigate Biden family regarding overseas dealings: poll,"A new poll of registered voters discovered that a majority of voters, including nearly one-third of Democrats, say that if Joe Biden becomes president, then a special counsel should be initiated to investigate the accusations of corruption regarding overseas dealings that his family reportedly participated in.

A Just the News Daily Poll with Scott Rasmussen asked voters: ""If Joe Biden becomes President, should a special counsel be appointed to investigate allegations of corruption involving his family's dealings with China and Ukraine?""



In the survey that took place between Nov. 12-14 of 1,200 participants, 52% answered ""Yes,"" that a special counsel should be established to examine the assertions that the Biden family was involved in potentially shady international business deals. The responses broken down by party affiliation found that predictably 81% of Republicans were in favor of a special counsel, but more surprising was that 32% of Democrats supported an investigation into the Biden family over corruption.

In late October, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) remarked that he is not a ""big fan of special counsels,"" but cautioned that one may be needed if Biden makes it into the White House.

""You know, I am not a big fan of special counsels, but if Joe Biden wins the presidency, I don't see how you avoid one,"" Johnson told Maria Bartiromo during an interview on Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria."" ""Otherwise, this is going to be, you know, tucked away, and we will never know what happened. All this evidence is going to be buried, so I think we have to have a special [counsel] if Joe Biden wins.""

In mid-October, emails allegedly obtained from Hunter Biden's laptop claimed that Joe Biden met with a top executive at Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company that his son was on the board of, when he was vice president.

Reported emails from Hunter's laptop also claimed that Hunter was pursuing ""lasting and lucrative"" deals involving a Chinese energy company that he said would be ""interesting for me and my family.""

Hunter's alleged former business partner, Tony Bobulinski, claimed that the former vice president not only knew about his son's overseas dealings, but also profited from an agreement with the now-bankrupt Shanghai-based China Energy Fund Committee.

On Thursday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) published new findings in their investigation into Hunter Biden's overseas dealings in a document titled, ""Hunter Biden, Burisma and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.""

Joe Biden has denied the allegations, and said that he has never received money from any foreign source.

Biden makes bizarre comment about death of a business leader in latest gaffe,"President Joe Biden made a bizarre comment noting the death of a business owner and he's facing more criticism on his latest gaffe.

Biden made the comments at the beginning of a speech at the White House where he offered his condolences to the family of Matt Susz, the executive vice president and chief financial officer of JOANN Fabric and Craft Stores.

""By the way, my sympathies to your – the family of your CFO, who dropped dead very unexpectedly,"" Biden said.

""My best to their family, that's tough stuff,"" he added.

Biden went on to sign the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022.

Critics of the president responded on social media to the clumsy comments.

""That was pretty heartless,"" responded one detractor.

""Wow!"" replied another critic. ""How would he like someone referring to his son with those words?""

""I would say that you can hear the gears grinding in his head, but I'd be lying. You can, however, hear the wind noise...a howling sound,"" joked one detractor.

Others on the left claimed Biden critics were trying to distract Americans from the ongoing Jan. 6 Committee investigating the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

Biden is well known for making inappropriate and embarrassing gaffes. In one incident from March, the president implied to U.S. soldiers that they would be sent to Ukraine despite there being no order or intention for the U.S. military to actively join the war.

In another instance from April, Biden sputtered badly in the middle of a speech when he could not pronounce the word ""kleptocracy."" And also in April, Biden confused the mask mandate with Title 42, a policy related to illegal immigration, forcing the White House to clarify his comments.

""For the good of the country, he needs to stop speaking extemporaneously in public,"" responded Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas at the time.

'God willing': Biden calls gas price crisis moment of 'incredible transition' away from oil and gas,"President Joe Biden appeared to celebrate the gas price crisis on Monday as a moment of ""incredible transition"" away from a reliance on fossil fuels.

What did Biden say?

During a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, a reporter asked Biden whether Americans should prepare for an economic recession.

When Biden said Americans should not worry about a recession, he claimed his administration has made ""significant progress"" toward improving the economy before repeating talking points about ""Putin's tax"" (referring to record-high gas prices) and the war in Ukraine worsening domestic problems.

Then Biden said the quiet part out loud, exclaiming that, ""God willing,"" Americans will be less reliant on gas when the energy crisis subsides.

""Here’s the situation: When it comes to the gas prices, we’re going through an incredible transition that is taking place that — God willing — when it’s over, we’ll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over,"" Biden said.

The Biden administration has repeatedly tried to reframe the energy crisis in positive light. It believes record-high prices at the gas pump (another new record was set on Monday) will encourage Americans to abandon their internal combustion engines for electric vehicles, all in the name of climate change.

However, there are two significant problems with this theory.

First, electric vehicles are significantly more expensive than internal combustion cars. For example, Kelley Blue Book said the average cost for an EV in February was $64,685, while the average costs of a compact car and compact SUV or crossover were $26,196 and $33,732, respectively. Thus, considering the median household income is under $70,000, most Americans would have to take on a massive amount of debt to purchase an EV.

Second, the cost of metals that are required in the manufacturing of EV batteries, such as lithium carbonate, has gone through the roof with no relief in sight.

Anything else?

At the end of his answer, Biden said he believes the best course of action to address the energy crisis is to pressure OPEC to increase production and to focus on growing the U.S. economy.

He made no mention of increasing domestic energy production.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-gas-price-crisis-incredible-transition-from-fossil-fuels,2022-05-23
Biden interview with Lester Holt on Afghanistan,"President Joe Biden said he rejects the findings in an investigative report by the U.S. Army that accused his administration of not adequately preparing for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The comments were made during a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Lester Holt, and at one point President Biden got testy with the host.

On Tuesday, the Washington Post released an article detailing an Army report that contains documents and sworn testimony from U.S. military commanders involved in the Afghanistan withdrawal last summer. The 2,000-page investigative report – which was released to the outlet through a Freedom of Information Act request – claimed that White House and State Department officials failed to understand and prepare for how fast the Taliban would capture Kabul. The report claimed that senior officials disregarded advice by military commanders to prepare for the evacuation of embassy staffers and Afghan allies as the Taliban marched toward the capital city.

In the end, 13 American service members and more than 180 Afghan civilians were killed in August by an ISIS-K suicide bomb attack outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport during the frantic evacuation.

During the ""NBC Nightly News"" interview, President Biden said he rejected the findings of the report.

""On the subject of American citizens, I have to draw your attention to that Army report, an investigative report that’s come out about the lead up to the withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" Holt said. ""It interviewed many military officials and officers, who said the administration ignored the handwriting on the wall. Another describe trying to get folks in the embassy ready to evacuate, encountering people who are in essentially in denial of the situation. Does any of that ring true to you?""

Biden responded, ""No. No. That’s not that I was told.""

""Look, there was no good time to get out, but if we had not gotten out, they acknowledged we would have had to put a hell of a lot more troops back in,"" Biden continued. ""It wasn’t just 2,000, 4,000, we would have to significantly increase the number of troops, and we’re back in this war of attrition.""

Biden then had difficulty remembering which country he was talking about.

""And, and there was no way we were ever going to unite Ukraine, I mean, excuse me, Iraq, Afghanistan,"" Biden said. ""No way that was going to happen. And so this is a much wiser thing to do.""

Holt asked Biden if he was rejecting the findings of the report, to which the president replied, ""Yes, I am.""

When asked if the findings are not true, Biden retorted, ""I am rejecting them.""

President Biden got a bit peeved during the interview when Holt asked about the latest inflation report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. On Thursday, it was announced that the consumer price index rose in January to an annual rate of 7.5% – the highest inflation rate in 40 years.

In July, President Biden said that inflation would be temporary.

Holt told Biden, ""I think a lot of Americans are wondering what your definition of temporary is.""

Biden responded, ""Well, you're being a wise guy with me a little bit, and I understand that's your job.""

He then blamed the supply chain crisis for inflation.

""But look, at the time what happened was the — let's look at the reasons for the inflation,"" Biden said. ""The reason for the inflation is the supply chains were cut off, meaning that the products, for example automobiles—the lack of computer chips to be able to build those automobiles so they could function — they need those computer chips. They were not available. So what happens? The number of cars were reduced but made up at one-third the cost of inflation because the price of automobiles were up. ""

On the topic of Russia potentially invading Ukraine, Biden told American citizens living there to ""leave now.""

""It’s not like we’re dealing with a terrorist organization. We’re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It’s a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly,"" Biden said.



Holt asked the commander in chief if there was a scenario in which he would send troops to Ukraine to rescue American citizens, to which Biden replied, ""There’s not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another.""

Holt asked if Biden was afraid that ""some states and cities are moving too quickly to loosen indoor mask mandates.""

""I committed that I would follow the science, the science as put forward by the CDC and the federal people,"" Biden answered. ""I think it's probably premature, but it's a tough call.""



Regarding finding a replacement for Justice Stephen Breyer, Biden said he has done a ""deep dive"" on ""about four people."" He believes his nominee will get a vote from Republicans because he's looking for someone who will have ""the same kind of capacity"" as Justice Breyer.

Joe Biden says he's 'angered' by Lindsey Graham opening probe into his son's dealings in Ukraine,"Presidential candidate Joe Biden responded on Friday to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) opening a probe into his dealings in Ukraine during his time as vice president, and he said he was ""angered"" and ""disappointed.""

Graham has admitted to being an admirer of Biden in the past, and has praised him highly as his friend and a decent person.

""There's asking Lindsey Graham, they have him under their thumb right now. They know he knows if he comes out against [President Donald] Trump, he's got a real tough road for re-election. Number one,"" Biden said to CNN's Don Lemon.

""I am disappointed, and quite frankly I'm angered, by the fact, he knows me; he knows my son; he knows there's nothing to this,"" he added.

On Thursday, Graham officially opened an investigation into charges of abuse of power by Biden in relation to actions he took in Ukraine that could have benefited a company his son was working with at the time.

""Trump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wouldn't yield to. The Ukrainians would not yield to 'investigate Biden' there's nothing to investigate about Biden or his son,"" Biden continued.

""Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life,"" he added.

Lemon asked him if he had any direct words for Graham.

""I say Lindsay, I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing. For you!"" Biden responded.

""I mean, my Lord!"" he concluded.

Critics rip into 'pathetic' and 'utterly insane' Biden decision to reject Poland's plan to supply Ukraine with fighter jets,"Critics from both sides of the partisan aisle took aim at the Biden administration for refusing Poland's plan to supply Ukraine with fighter jets after calling on other nations to do so.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that NATO allies were allowed to send fighter jets to Ukraine and said they were in talks with Poland to do exactly that.

On Tuesday, Poland caught the administration by surprise when it announced that it would deliver a fleet of MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and allow the U.S. to dispose of them as it saw fit.

The administration first said the plan was not ""tenable"" and then on Wednesday, rejected it altogether.

“Our American partners rejected this proposal, because they have come to the conclusion that it was too escalatory,” said Poland's ambassador to the U.S.

“We need to be careful about every decision we make so that we aren’t making the potential for escalation worse,” said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby on Wednesday.

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas led a chorus of critics excoriating the administration for the decision.

""Biden's decision to block Poland from sending MiG-29s to Ukraine is pathetic. It's weakness, and the Administration's rationale makes no sense. How are jets 'escalatory' when we are already sending Javelin missiles?""

""Sending jets for Ukrainians to use isn't escalatory—Putin's decision to invade and bomb children's hospitals is escalatory,"" he added in a second tweet.

""This is an utterly insane and unbelievable response from the Pentagon. The US Government must reverse course on this. We cannot win this war from a position of tepid fear. Ukraine fights for us all, we can give them the tools. Thank you to #poland,"" tweeted Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.

Even some Democrats criticized Biden's decision.

""Poland wants to provide its MiG-29 jets to Ukraine via the US,"" tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.).

""This isn’t a novel concept. US gave Stingers to Lithuania & Latvia and they transferred them to Ukraine,"" he added. ""I urge the @DeptofDefense to figure out asap how to get air assets to Ukrainians. Their survival is at stake.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also demanded that NATO establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine in order to give its citizens a fighting chance against the Russians. That option has been denied because of the near certainty of dragging more countries into a war with Russia.

Biden kills an hour with TikTok 'influencers' brought to DC to receive Democrat marching orders,"Eight people were flown to Washington, D.C., this week to meet with President Joe Biden. Their stated purpose was neither to bolster border security nor to address inflation but rather to utilize the Chinese-controlled social media app TikTok to help Democrats hold on to and secure more power.



Crystallizing public opinion

The Washington Post reported that a handful of so-called influencers, including Nia Sioux, Mona Swain, Vitus Spehar, Kat Wellington, and Mattie Westbrouck, were flown for free to D.C., where they met with Biden, former president Barack Obama, and leaders of both the Democratic National Committee and House Democrats' campaign committee.



Streaming their experiences, the influencers toured the Supreme Court and received a private tour of the Capitol.

The penultimate stop on their whirlwind visit was a news conference where the 79-year-old president claimed the COVID-19 mRNA booster ""is going to be required"" before sitting down to receive one himself.

Finally, in a detour planned directly by the White House, the influencers received an hour more of Biden's time than Americans along the southern border have received in person since he took office.

In the Oval Office, Biden reportedly explained why he got into politics and why the healthy young streamers should get COVID-19 mRNA boosters. He then walked them around the West Wing.

22-year-old Westbrouck, who has over 10.2 million followers on TikTok, said, ""It felt like a little room tour but by the president.""

Though Spehar, the host of the TikTok news channel ""Under the Desk News,"" said Biden ""didn't mention the election or voting,"" the influencers had already received their marching orders by the time they had reached the Oval Office.

High-level Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staffers instructed the influencers on how they could best serve the interests of the party in the midterm election. The Post indicated that DCCC staffers highlighted key districts in battleground states where the influencers' help was required and could be used to great effect.

Obama, like Biden and other Democrats, impressed upon these prospective agents of the state how important it was that the Democrats win in the midterms.

""I genuinely think it's a scary time for people who can get pregnant and won't be able to have rights to an abortion,"" said 21-year-old Nia Sioux, who has 8.3 million followers. ""I will be talking about my stance on that, and I will have more information in [my] social media content.""

Kat Wellington, 24, similarly found the Democrat immersion trip activating. She said, ""This trip helped me make the push to use my platform for that. I don't want to be afraid to share my genuine beliefs about politics, even if it's going to upset some people.""

Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, told the Post, ""We know people listen to trusted messengers, and as an increasing number of young people turn to Instagram, TikTok and other platforms for news and information, we need to engage with the voices they trust directly.""

Shelby Cole, deputy mobilization officer at the DNC, underscored the need for Democrats to exploit the reach of content creators to engage ""young voters to remind them of the stakes in this election and how to make a plan to vote.""

Vaccines and votes

In recent years, the Biden administration has invested a great deal of time and energy into leveraging TikTok to achieve its political ends.

Earlier this month, Judicial Watch obtained evidence of an extensive media campaign executed by the Biden administration aimed at driving up acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. While records revealed the administration had colluded with establishment media, major corporations, and various institutions to advance its vaccine narrative, its messaging strategy also relied heavily upon social media influencers.

For instance, the Biden administration noted its intention to request ""major TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram influencers to create videos of themselves being vaccinated and start a special campaign of funny and/or musical videos about being vaccinated to encourage others to create content and post.""

The documents acquired through Judicial Watch's freedom of information lawsuit also revealed the administration's belief that in order to capture the minds of young people, it would have to ""target endemic content creators, with a particular focus on Youtube, and TikTok.""

17-year-old Ellie Zeiler was one of those paid by the Biden administration to push vaccines as part of the so-called ""influencer army."" Although just a high school student, Zeiler was useful to the administration because she had over 10 million followers.

Owing to influencers' perceived utility, they are often given preferential treatment.

TheBlaze noted last week that it's difficult to schedule an interview with Biden. He has only agreed to 28 interviews since taking office. Transsexual fetishist Dylan Mulvaney managed, however, to secure an exclusive interview with the president, which aired on Sunday. Mulvaney is a TikTok user with 8.3 million followers.

Mulvaney was assigned priority, like the influencers invited to the White House this week, in part because the interview was able to deliver more eyeballs than the traditional media networks that Democrats have long depended upon, such as CNN, which frequently has trouble seizing even the interest of 600,000 viewers.

The Biden administration has used influencers to supplement its establishment media support since the beginning. The Washington Post reported that in 2020, TikTok for Biden assembled a collective of over 500 Tiktok users to endorse Biden.

In the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, top White House and National Security Council staffers met with influencers. Forbes reported that in March, persons whose only qualifications were comfort using a phone and access to a big audience were briefed on the war and prompted to disseminate the White House's narrative to their followers.

Compromised apparatchiks

While Democrats are relying more and more on TikTok influencers for strategic and governmental functions, they do so despite warnings that the platform is compromised in more than one way.

TikTok has censored conservative speech and artwork, such as rapper Bryson Gray's ""Let's Go, Brandon"" song, as well as content flagged as unacceptable by foreign dictators. Earlier this year, the platform banned the founder of the pro-life group Live Action and barred the group from posting ads.

Fox News Digital reported that a whistleblower indicated the Chinese government, which controls TikTok, has been using the app to ""suppress minorities, censor freedom of speech and mask human rights violations.""

In addition to being used to selectively silence certain groups and amplify the voices of others — such as those anointed on trips to the White House — TikTok is a security threat.

A report released last week accused TikTok's parent company ByteDance of planning to use the location data it collected on the app to track and monitor American citizens. The company is also being accused of seeking to gather users' personal and private information without their consent.

This week, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) said, ""Donald Trump was right on TikTok years ago ... If your country uses Huawei, if your kids are on TikTok ... the ability for China to have undue influence is a much greater challenge and a much more immediate threat than any kind of actual armed conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-kills-an-hour-with-tiktok-influencers-brought-to-dc-to-receive-democrat-marching-orders,2022-10-27
"Biden laughs when asked about federal investigation against his son, calls Rudy Giuliani a 'thug'","The months-long impeachment crusade against President Donald Trump may be over, but the underlying questions about the Bidens and their actions in Ukraine still remain. However, Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden doesn't seem too worried about the prospect of a federal investigation into the matter.

During an interview on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday, cohost Anthony Jacobs informed the the elder Biden that the Justice Department is taking in information about Hunter Biden's work for a natural gas company in the Ukraine — which occurred while his dad was vice president — from Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

""[Sen.] Lindsey Graham [R-S.C.] told CBS News the Justice Department is vetting information from Rudy Giuliani about about your son's work in Ukraine,"" Jacobs asked. ""Are you concerned a federal investigation may be launched?""

Biden began chuckling at the first mention of Giuliani's name and continued laughing as Jacobs repeated his question a second time, before his demeanor transformed into a more serious one as he gave the answer, ""No.""

""Look, I expect, I expect Trump to do the same exact thing he's been doing,"" the former vice president elaborated.

""Why has he been attacking me from the beginning, why did he risk — and he should have been impeached — why did he risk getting convicted by going to a foreign leader to say, 'You don't have to get me anything on Biden, there's nothing to get, just tell me you're going to investigate him so I can hurt him,'?"" Biden added, echoing a Democratic impeachment allegation about the president's motives in dealing with Ukrainian officials last year. ""Have you ever seen a sitting president as concerned about a single nominee, in trying to stop a nominee?""

When asked a follow-up on whether or not Hunter is ""fair game,"" Biden responded, ""I don't think our sons are fair game at all. No one has said he's done anything wrong except the thug, Rudy Giuliani. Come on, Rudy Giuliani?""

Graham told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that he had spoken with Attorney General William Barr and that Barr told him the Justice Department had set up a ""process"" for Giuliani to turn over information he'd gathered in Ukraine so that it could be vetted for accuracy.

Graham explained, ""We're to make sure that Hunter Biden's conflict of interest is explored because it's legitimate. How could Joe Biden really fight corruption when his son sitting on the Burisma board?"" He also said that vetting information coming out of Ukraine was critical because of the possibility of Russian misinformation.

On Monday morning, Barr said that there is a process to take in and look over information on Ukraine from Giuliani as well as others, but that the department would proceed very cautiously in doing so.

""As I did say to Sen. Graham, we have to be very careful with respect to any information coming from Ukraine,"" Barr cautioned at a DOJ press conference. ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, there are a lot of cross-currents, and we can't take anything we receive from the Ukraine at face value.""

Barr explained that the department has set up an ""intake process in the field so that any information coming in about Ukraine could be carefully scrutinized by the department and its intelligence community partners"" and the same ""is true for all information that comes to the Department related to the Ukraine, including anything that Mr. Giuliani might provide.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-laughs-when-asked-about-federal-investigation-against-his-son,2020-02-10
Reports indicate Biden may announce oil release from SPR,"As Americans suffer under the heavy financial burden of sky high gas prices, reports indicate that the Biden administration may announce a plan to release one million barrels of oil per day from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

The Associated Press reported that Biden is preparing to call for dispensing up to one million barrels daily, according to two individuals familiar with the decision. The outlet said the length of the release had not been settled, but that it could continue for months.

Bloomberg reported that according to individuals familiar with the issue, the administration is considering a plan to unleash around a million barrels each day for multiple months. The full amount dispensed might be as much as 180 million barrels the individuals said, according to the outlet.

An announcement could occur on Thursday.

Reuters reported that according to the White House, Biden is slated to speak about ""his administration's actions to reduce the impact of Putin's price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families.""

Americans have been feeling acute pain at the pump — as of Wednesday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $4.236.



High fuel costs not only hurt drivers directly when they go to fill up their tank, they also increase the cost of transporting goods, which can in turn drive up the costs of various goods and broadly inflict financial pain on consumers.

An NBC News poll of registered voters found that 69% would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports increasing domestic oil and natural gas production in order to tamp down on gas and energy prices.

If high fuel prices persist, the issue will likely pose a political problem for Democrats heading into the midterm elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-may-announce-plan-to-release-oil-strategic-petroleum-reserve,2022-03-31
Biden earns abysmal job approval rating in poll,"A recent NBC News poll of adults indicates that President Joe Biden's job approval rating is deeply underwater, with 55% who disapprove of his job performance compared to just 40% who approve of it. While 42% strongly disapprove of the job Biden is doing, 16% strongly approve, 13% somewhat disapprove, and 24% somewhat approve.

A whopping 63% disapprove of how the Biden is dealing with the economy, while only 33% approve.

And while 52% disapprove of how Biden is handling the Russia-Ukraine war, only 41% approve. The poll also found a dearth of confidence in the president on this issue: While 44% expressed having ""Very little confidence"" in the president's ability to react to the conflict and manage the crisis, 27% had ""Just some confidence,"" 16% had ""Quite a bit of confidence,"" and 12% had ""A great deal of confidence.""

Earlier this month, Biden issued an executive order to prohibit the importation of crude oil and other products into the U.S. from Russia. The poll found that 79% agree with the move by the U.S. to block Russian oil, even if it produces higher fuel prices.

The poll, which was carried out March 18 to 22, does not bode well for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections as the party aims to maintain control in Congress.

Among registered voters, 46% would prefer for the election to result in a GOP-controlled Congress, while 44% would prefer for the election to result in a Democrat-controlled legislature, a close split which falls within the margin of error.



""What this poll says is that President Biden and Democrats are headed for a catastrophic election,"" Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinions Strategy said, according to NBC News — the outlet noted that McInturff carried out the survey along with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.

"Drain, baby, drain: Biden admin will deliver another 10 million barrels of oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve in November as OPEC+ cuts production by 2 million barrels per day","The White House expressed opposition to the decision of OPEC+ to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day beginning in November and said that the U.S. will release another 10 million barrels of oil from America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve next month.

A collection of OPEC and non-OPEC nations has determined to decrease overall oil production ""from the August 2022 required production levels, starting November 2022,"" according to a press release.

In a bid to tackle soaring gas prices, Biden announced a plan earlier this year to release one million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over a six-month period.

While gas prices are not as high as they once were, they are still very high — as of Wednesday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.831.

High gas prices could prove politically problematic for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections next month.

""The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council director Brian Deese said in a statement.

""At the President’s direction, the Department of Energy will deliver another 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the market next month, continuing the historic releases the President ordered in March. The President will continue to direct SPR releases as appropriate to protect American consumers and promote energy security, and he is directing the Secretary of Energy to explore any additional responsible actions to continue increasing domestic production in the immediate term,"" they said in the statement.

Republicans responded to the news about OPEC+'s plans to cut oil production by blasting President Biden.

""OPEC’s decision to cut oil production would have a minimal impact on people in Wyoming if the U.S. were still energy independent. The American people will continue to suffer at the pump due to Biden’s attack on domestic energy production,"" GOP Sen.

White House has to clean up Biden's embarrassing gaffe to US soldiers in Poland to avoid international incident,"President Joe Biden made an embarrassing gaffe to U.S. soldiers in Poland, and the White House had to hastily issue a clarification on his comments to avoid international provocation.

Biden implied that the U.S. was sending troops into Ukraine when speaking on Friday to members of the Air Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Rzeszow, Poland, just 60 miles from the border with Ukraine.

""And you, some, some of you have been there,"" said Biden. ""You're going to see, you're going to see women, young people standing, standing in the middle of, in front of a damn tank, just saying, 'I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground.' They're incredible.""

""But they take a lot of inspiration from us,"" he added, according to the White House transcript of his comments.

The president has said previously that the U.S. engagement in the war in Ukraine would be limited to economic sanctions against Russia and sending non-personnel military aid and economic aid to Ukraine. The presence of U.S. troops would be a significant escalation and provocation against Russia.

The White House released a statement clarifying that Biden's statement was made in error.

""The President has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position,"" read the statement sent to Andrew Feinberg of the Independent.

Biden followed up his comments calling the troops the ""organizing principle"" around which the free world revolves.

""And you know, the woman who just died, the secretary of state used to have an expression, she said we are the essential nation,"" he said, quoting the late Madeleine Albright.

""It sounds like a bit of hyperbole, but the truth of the matter is, you are the organizing principle around the rest of the world, the free world, is moving.""

Biden also took selfies and ate pizza with the troops.

"New poll finds more Americans blame Biden for inflation than the pandemic, corporate greed, or Putin's invasion","Recent polling shows that very few Americans are buying the excuses the Biden administration are making for high inflation and instead blame the President Joe Biden and his policies.

The NBC News poll asked Americans who they thought was to blame for the high inflation that they are suffering under and offered some of the culprits blamed by the president and his supporters as possible answers.

Among the options listed, Biden and his policies were blamed by a plurality of Americans polled, at 38%.

Only 28% blamed the coronavirus pandemic, another 23% blamed corporations raising prices, and barely 6% blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Over recent months, the Biden administration has attempted to blame the invasion of Ukraine, the greed of meat conglomerates, and the pandemic for the high inflation eating away at Americans' savings and wages.

The same poll found the president's approval rating to drop to 40% while an astounding 55% disapprove of the job Biden is doing. When asked about the economy, only 33% said they approved of the job he's doing, while 63% said they don't approve of the job Biden is doing.

The astonishing poll is just the latest in a long series showing devastating results for Democrats ahead of the midterms, where they would have faced an uphill battle even without horrible polling.

The terrible polling has lead to greater division in the Democratic party among the centrist establishment wing, which blames progressive extremism, and the far-left progressive wing that blames Biden for not going far enough to the left.

Socialist Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Thursday said that the low polling came from progressives and young voters who were disappointed that Biden had done enough to satisfy their left-wing demands.

Poll: Americans say Biden's first year was a failure,"Two new polls were recently released regarding the job performance of President Joe Biden, and they paint a potentially disastrous picture for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections.

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Friday finds that a majority (56%) of Americans think Biden's first year in office has been a failure, compared to only 39% who said it was a success.

There was also a majority of Americans who said Biden is ""not fulfilling campaign promises"" (54%) and is ""doing more to divide the nation than to unite it"" (52%). Biden campaigned heavily on the promise of uniting Americans.

A mere 30% of Americans feel as though the country is headed in the right direction. This is similar results to a Fox News poll released on Thursday that found just 35% of Americans believe the country is better off now than a year ago.

There were 38% of the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll participants who said that President Biden's top priority should be inflation – far higher than any other issue. Earlier this month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the highest inflation rate in 40 years.

Of the respondents, 11% said Biden should concern himself about the coronavirus, and another 11% said voting laws were a top priority. There were 10% who said Biden needs to focus on foreign policy, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There were also 10% who believed violent crime was the most important issue.

Biden's job approval rating was a paltry 39%, down from 41% in December. There are 55% who disapprove of Biden's job performance and a whopping 41% who ""strongly disapprove.""

A new ABC News/Washington Post poll spelled even more trouble for Biden and Democrats in the midterm elections.

Heading into his first State of the Union address, Biden has a meager 37% approval rating – the lowest of his term.

ABC News delivered some historical relevance to such a poor rating of a president in their first year:

Analyzing data going back to Harry Truman's administration, only two presidents have had approval ratings this low heading into their first State of the Union address, which Biden delivers Tuesday. Those two were Donald Trump, at 36%, and Gerald Ford, at 37%. Disapproval has been higher, by a nonsignificant 3 percentage points, only for Trump. (More were undecided about Ford, then just five months in office.)



However, it isn't just President Biden who appears to be in political turmoil, according to polls. Democrats also face alarming polling numbers.

The ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed:

Seventy-five percent of Americans rate the economy’s condition as not so good or poor, the most in ABC/Post polls since 2013. The public by a 3-1 margin says it’s gotten worse rather than better since Biden took office, 54-17% (with the rest saying it’s stayed the same). That “gotten worse” number is more than double what it was when measured during Trump’s presidency in 2019 (22%) and 11 points higher than under Obama in 2012.

In early midterm voting preferences, the poll found that Republican congressional candidates have a 49-42% advantage over Democrats among registered voters. The GOP advantage spikes to 54-41% among Americans who say they both are registered and certain to vote in November.

""In the new data, among independents who are registered to vote – often swing voters – GOP candidates lead by 14 points,"" Langer Research Associates stated.

Biden says 2022 midterm elections could be illegitimate,"President Joe Biden is facing swift backlash after he said that the 2022 midterm elections could be ""illegitimate.""

During President Biden's rare press conference on Wednesday, he was asked if the 2022 midterm elections would be ""fairly conducted"" and the results ""legitimate"" if Congress doesn't pass voting rights legislation.

""Well, it all depends on whether or not we’re able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election,"" Biden responded, referring to more stringent voting rules enacted by Republicans following the 2020 election.

""Well, I think if, in fact — no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and — and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote,"" Biden said. ""I think you’re going to see the people who they’re trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.""



Later in the press conference, a reporter asked a follow-up question about the legitimacy of the 2022 midterms.

""I just wanted to clarify: A moment ago, you were asked whether or not you believed that we would have free and fair elections in 2022 if some of these state legislatures reformed their voting protocols. You said that it depends,"" the reporter said, before asking, ""Do you — do you think that they would in any way be illegitimate?""



""Oh, yeah, I think it easily could be — be illegitimate,"" Biden replied. ""Imagine — imagine if, in fact, Trump had succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.""

The reporter attempted to focus the question back on the 2022 midterm elections.

Biden reacts, ""Oh, 2022. I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit.""

""I mean, sure, but — I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit,"" President Biden said of the 2022 midterm elections.

""The increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these — these reforms passed,"" Biden said.

""But I don’t think you’re going to see — you’re not going to see me and I don’t think you’re going to see the Democratic Party give up on coming back and assuming that the attempt fails today,"" Biden concluded.

Republicans skewered President Biden for making claims that the upcoming November elections could be illegitimate. Many noted that former President Donald Trump was attacked by the media and Democrats for questioning the results of the 2020 presidential election.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) told Fox News: ""It's unfortunate. As you know, the Democrats have been highly critical of those Republicans who refused to accept the results of the last election and use the word ‘rigged’ to say that elections weren't fair. They're using the exact same language and casting doubt on elections. It's irresponsible.""

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) declared: ""I think it was shocking, to be honest with you. Just shocking. To have the president of the United States trying to undermine the results of an election before there's actually an election is a stunning manifestation.""

Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) remarked: ""Joe Biden dangerously claiming results of 2022 elections will be illegitimate unless Congress passes his election power grab.""

Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel slammed the president: ""In the same press conference, Biden continued to baselessly smear election integrity provisions, and then signaled to Putin that a 'minor incursion' into Ukraine is ok. Unreal.""

But it wasn't just Republicans who slammed Biden for proclaiming that the 2022 midterm elections could be illegitimate.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) disagreed with Biden: ""We might have a difference of opinion. I believe in the Department of Justice doing its job.""

As the Daily Wire pointed out, even CNN blasted President Biden for suggesting that the midterm election results could be tainted.

CNN chief national correspondent John King emphasized: ""It is striking to hear an American president not named Donald Trump raise questions about the legitimacy and sanctity of our democracy.""

CNN anchor Jake Tapper said: ""And quite strikingly, the president said that the upcoming midterm elections might not be legitimate if the election reform bills before the Senate are not passed. … President Biden just said, with Donald Trump’s history when it comes to the big lie on the elections, but he refused to say that the election results this midterm — in these midterms in November would be legitimate. He refused it.""

CNN anchor Dana Bash slammed Biden: ""Well, particularly the first part, Anderson, what he said, was — actually the entire thing, but the first part was probably the most jarring to hear a President of the United States who is not Donald Trump, even suggest ahead of time that an election isn’t legitimate.""

On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki attempted to do some damage control: ""Let's be clear: @potus was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election. He was making the opposite point: In 2020, a record number of voters turned out in the face of a pandemic, and election officials made sure they could vote and have those votes counted.""



""Today"" host Savannah Guthrie pressed Vice President Kamala Harris on Biden suggesting that the 2022 elections could be illegitimate.



""[Biden] openly cast doubt on whether the 2022 midterm elections would be legitimate. He said it all depends, which is astonishing to hear a president question whether our elections will be legitimate. We’ve heard it before, but not from this president,"" Guthrie said, then asked, ""Is he really concerned that we may not have fair and free elections?""



Harris dodged the question and responded, ""The president has been consistent on this issue. And the issue at hand, the issue — I was there last night in the chamber of the Senate, and the issue is that there are two bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, that have been the solution that has been offered to address the fact that around our country states have put in place laws that are purposely making it more difficult for the American people to vote.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-press-conference-illegitimate-election,2022-01-20
"Biden, tweet, Putin","Amid the Russia-Ukraine situation, many on the political right have recently been highlighting a two-year-old tweet posted on the account of then-candidate Joe Biden — the tweet declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not want Biden to become America's president.

""Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with him,"" the February 2020 tweet declared.

Biden requests $2.6 billion from Congress to fund global gender equity programs,"President Joe Biden is requesting $2.6 billion to fund gender equity programs across the globe.

The announcement was made on Tuesday, reported The Hill, to commemorate International Women’s Day.

The $2.6 billion will be part of the Biden administration’s 2023 congressional budget request and, if approved, will double the amount requested for gender equity programs last year.

In a prepared statement, Biden said, “On this day and every day, let us recognize that all of us have a better future when women and girls can reach their full potential – and together, let’s renew our efforts to advance dignity, equality, and limitless possibilities for all.”

Biden affirmed that International Women’s Day recognizes the achievements of women and girls and celebrates progress in gender equity. The president also recommitted himself and his administration to work that he says still needs to be done to achieve gender equity.

He said, “Ensuring that every woman and girl has that chance isn’t just the right thing to do – it’s also a strategic imperative that advances the prosperity, stability, and security of our nation and the world. Yet too often, in too many places, women and girls face obstacles that limit their possibilities and undermine their participation in economic, political, and social life.”

Biden stated that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated many existing issues that women face on a regular basis. He suggested that women’s participation in the work force declined, that additional burden was placed upon caregivers, and that gender-based violence increased.

The president’s announcement marks the one-year anniversary of the administration debuting the White House Gender Policy Council.

The White House announced the $2.6 billion over a livestreamed video conference to commemorate International Women’s Day, U.S. News reported.

The conference featured Secretary of State Antony Blinken, acting budget director Shalanda Young, U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Samantha Power, and the director of the Gender Policy Council, Jen Klein.

First lady Jill Biden, who was also present, marked International Women’s Day by making a video tribute to women throughout the world “who courageously use their voice, no matter the cost.”

She said, “To our sisters from Ukraine who are fighting to keep their country free and their families alive: We stand with you in solidarity. To our sister in Russia who are protesting and speaking out against the invasion at great personal risk: We see your courage.”

“And to women warriors around the world, those fighting for justice and working for a change: Thank you for building a better future for all of us,” the first lady added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-requested-2-6-billion-to-fund-global-gender-equity-programs,2022-03-08
US releases convicted drug trafficker to Russia in swap for jailed marine,"U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed was freed from prison in Moscow on Wednesday when the U.S. exchanged a convicted Russian drug trafficker for his freedom.

The New York Post reported that in a prepared statement, President Joe Biden said, “Today we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly. Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention.”

Biden shared his intention to free Reed with his parents, Joey and Paula, saying that he “heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence.”

Biden said, “I’m grateful for the tireless and dedicated work of Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation John Sullivan, and many others across our government to ensure that Trevor came home safely.”

He added, “The negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly.”

Reed had been imprisoned in Russia since 2019. He was serving a nine-year sentence on charges stemming from an incident where he assaulted two Moscow police offers who were driving him to a police station the night after a party, at which he reportedly got blackout drunk.

A senior U.S. official and Russia’s foreign ministry confirmed that Reed’s release was negotiated as part of a collaborative prisoner exchange. The U.S. received Reed in exchange for giving Russia Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted Russian drug trafficker who was serving a 20-year prison sentence in Connecticut.

The swap is reported to have taken place in an unidentified European country, but a plane belonging to the Russian federal security service was seen flying to Ankara, Turkey, just hours before the exchange occurred.

In recent weeks, Reed’s parents had grown increasingly concerned over their son’s health, as he had begun a hunger strike to protest his treatment by Russian officials.

Reed’s father said, “Trevor had some injury where he thinks he might have broken a rib. Plus, he has all the symptoms of active tuberculosis. He went to a prison hospital for about 10 days, and they didn’t treat him.”

His father said that his son requested to remain in the hospital but was instead placed in solitary confinement, where he began to cough up blood and had “something protruding out of his side.”

The Reed family thanked Biden “for making the decision to bring Trevor home.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-russia-prisoner-swap,2022-04-27
"As Russian invasion of Ukraine demands urgency, Biden says, 'Let's have a conversation in another month or so to see' if new sanctions are 'working'","President Joe Biden responded Thursday afternoon to Russia's rapid full-scale invasion of Ukraine by announcing new sanctions against the warring nation. However, when pressed on what else he would do to confront Russia over its warmongering, the president suggested only that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the sanctions ""are working.""

The lackluster response is sure to spark widespread criticism amongst the American people and allies around the world for not matching the urgency of the moment.

Biden delivered the remarks while speaking with reporters in the East Room of the White House Thursday in response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.

During the speech, Biden announced that the U.S. and its NATO allies would swiftly sanction more major Russian banks and impose export controls to curtail Russia's access to high tech as a way to punish the Kremlin for its ""premeditated attack."" He declared the new measures would be ""devastating"" for Russia by limiting the country's ability to do business ""in dollars, pounds, euros, and yen.""

But when a reporter noted that Putin had thus far been undeterred by sanctions and that Biden was in fact still withholding other sanctions at his disposal — such as removing Russia from SWIFT, a prominent international banking cooperative — Biden balked.

""Respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?"" the reporter asked. In under 24 hours, Russia has reportedly destroyed 74 Ukrainian military installations and begun attacking civilian facilities en route to overthrowing the government in Kyiv.

Biden answered by alleging that his new sanctions are plenty powerful and suggested that before taking any more aggressive action against Russia, the U.S. should adopt a wait-and-see approach.

""Let's have a conversation in another month or so to see if they are working,"" he said of the current sanctions.

Other reporters pressed Biden on his refusal so far to personally sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin. In response, the president refused to answer why he hasn't taken such an approach, saying only that it remains ""on the table.""

At another time during the press conference, Biden acknowledged that sanctions were never expected to prevent Russia from attacking. But he said they may prove, in time, to sting Russia for their bad behavior.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official is reporting that Russia is advancing on Ukraine's capital with ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.""

According to Ukraine, at least 40 troops and up to 10 civilians have been killed thus far in the assault. Many more casualties are expected.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-sanctions-russia-over-ukraine-war,2022-02-24
Biden says Putin 'cannot remain in power' in remarks the White House says weren't a threat,"On Saturday, while delivering a speech in Poland, attempting to rally NATO allies to stand against the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden called for regime change in Russia.

“A dictator, bent on rebuilding an empire, will never erase the people’s love for liberty, Biden said of his Russian counterpart, Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.”

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said.

Throughout the crisis in Ukraine, Biden has lobbed insults at Putin, calling him a “murderous dictator” and a “war criminal,” but has never previously called for Putin’s removal from power unlike other prominent politicians.

A White House official has since attempted to walk-back the president’s statements saying that Biden “was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change, but was instead insisting that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors in the region,” CNBC reported.

This is the second high-profile, alleged gaffe that Biden had made while on this European excursion.

On Friday, Biden told US troops who were stationed in Poland that they would witness the bravery of the Ukrainian people “when you’re there,” explicitly insinuating that American troops would be deployed to Ukraine.

The New York Post reported that Biden said, “You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle in front of a dammed tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground.’”

The White House quickly clarified that Biden was mistaken and that the president was not, in fact, changing his stance on deploying the military into Ukraine.

During his Saturday address, Biden reiterated his belief that the only thing that will get Russian leadership to cease its invasion is by instituting debilitating sanctions on the Russian economy.

Per the New York Times, Biden said, “Swift and punishing costs is the only thing that will get Russia to change course.”

Biden also suggested that the invasion has been a failure for Russia, saying: ""This war has already been a strategic failure for Russia. Having lost children, myself, I know that’s no solace to people who’ve lost family.”

Biden also indicated that the West does not find fault with, or hold responsible, the Russian populace, despite implementing sanctions that are devastating their way quality of life.

He said, “This is not the future you deserve for your families and children. I’m telling you the truth, this war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-says-putin-cannot-remain-in-power-in-remarks-the-white-house-says-weren-t-a-threat,2022-03-26
Biden points finger at Putin on inflation woes,"During remarks on Friday at the House Democrats' retreat in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden said that ""inflation is largely the fault"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Biden said that prices have been rising as a result of factors related to COVID-19, including supply chain issues and heavy demand for certain goods. He also directed blame toward the Russian president.

""The second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin,"" Biden said. The U.S. president said that gas prices rose as Putin staged troops on the Ukrainian border — Biden noted that Putin then invaded Ukraine. ""Make no mistake, inflation is largely the"" Russian figure's fault, Biden claimed.

WATCH LIVE: Biden at House Democrats' retreat in Philadelphia youtu.be

The president rejected the notion that the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that Democrats passed last year made gas prices rise. Congressional Democrats rammed the plan through without GOP support.

Biden said that the San Francisco Federal Reserve indicated that the American Rescue Plan ""contributed to 0.3% of inflation.""

People have been getting hammered by skyrocketing gas prices. As of Friday, the AAA national average price for regular gas was $4.331 per gallon.

Earlier this week, President Biden signed an executive order to ban the import of Russian crude oil into the U.S. — the order also prohibits importing ""petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products"" from Russia.

Americans have been suffering the financial strain caused by rapid inflation. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index rose by 0.8% in February.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.8 percent in February on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.6 percent in January,"" according to BLS. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 7.9 percent before seasonal adjustment.""

Biden said in a statement on Thursday that, ""A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions. As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin’s unprovoked war, but Americans can know this: the costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing.""



Steven Rattner, who served as counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury during a portion of the Obama administration, fired back: ""Well, no. These are Feb #'s and only include small Russia effect. This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-says-putin-largely-to-blame-for-inflation,2022-03-12
'I'm going to do it again': Biden allegedly told Al Sharpton he's running again in 2024,"In a private conversation last month, President Joe Biden confided in MSNBC's Rev. Al Sharpton, informing him of his intention to run for reelection in 2024. ""I'm going to do it again ... I'm going,"" Biden allegedly said on September 2 in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

This confidential admission, which Sharpton reportedly broadcast to his National Action Network staff immediately after the meeting, comes amid much uncertainty whether the president should or would seek to hold on to power.

Sharpton suggested that the recent meeting paralleled another, in January 2019, during which Biden allegedly solicited his advice on whether to pursue the highest office in the land.

Biden's intentions

Biden recently cast doubt on whether he would seek reelection in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired on September 18. The 79-year-old said that his ""intention, as I said to begin with, is that I would run again.""

However, he added, ""it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen. ... Within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, [I will] make a judgment on what to do.""

Biden recently suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris, whose 2020 presidential campaign was a failure, ""won't be the last woman to be vice president or president,"" intimating that perhaps she might soon have an opportunity to take the top spot.

Democrats' disagreements



Democrats are not united behind the prospect of another four years of Biden.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer laughed at the question of whether Biden should run, saying, ""I'm not having that conversation.""

Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) flat-out opposed the idea, stating that he thought ""the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up.""

Rep. Angie Craig concurred, suggesting that while it was entirely up to Biden on whether to run, in terms of having his support, ""I would say we need new leaders in Washington up and down the ballot in the Democratic Party.""

Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), now running against J.D. Vance for a Senate seat, said last month, ""My hunch is that we need leadership across the board ... I think it's time for a generational move.""



While some Democrats have expressed a desire for a change, others have attempted to remain diplomatic.

At a September 22 news conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who may similarly be on her way out, eulogized Biden's first term, stating he ""did a great service to our country: he defeated Donald Trump. Let's not forget that."" She added that she wouldn't go ""into politics about whether the President should run or not.""

Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told CNN that Biden ""beat Donald Trump before; he'll beat Donald Trump again ... I think Joe Biden is the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump in 2024.""

Recent YouGov and ABC News/Washington Post polls have Biden and Trump nearly tied, whereas a late September McLaughlin & Associates poll had Trump up by nine points.

When asked by Time magazine whether she'd want Biden to campaign with her, Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska) answered, ""I'd like to take a wait-and-see approach. I don't know what is on the horizon.""

Jim Roosevelt, a top DNC member, told CNN, ""If he feels he can do it ... people would want him to do it.""

The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll suggested otherwise. Only 35% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want to see the party nominate Biden in 2024. Over half of Democrats (56%) want someone else.

Voters' apprehensions

A September 22 Marquette University National Survey indicated that nearly three-quarters (72%) of Americans don't want the president to run again. Alternatively put, only 28% of respondents want Biden to run again. That's three points lower than the current national support for former President Donald Trump to run again.

Although up considerably higher than in previous months, a September Gallup poll placed Biden's approval at 42%. The average for U.S. presidents is 53%.

On Monday, a Monmouth University poll gave Biden a failing score on all of America's issue priorities, with the exception of the COVID pandemic, regarded as the nation's second-lowest priority, where he secured a 50% approval rating.

30% of likely voters approve of his handling of inflation; 32%, crime; 31%, immigration; 31%, abortion; and 41%, his handling of student loan debt.

49% of the public believe Biden is performing worse than they had imagined he would as president.

Biden, the second U.S. president to claim to be a Catholic, now majoritively lacks the support of Catholic voters. An EWTN News and RealClear Opinion Research poll indicated on September 29 that 58.4% of likely Catholic voters think Biden should not pursue a second term. Only 22.2% think he should run again.



Cognitive dimensions

Biden, the oldest president ever to hold the office, is a month shy of becoming an octogenarian. There is mounting concern over whether he will be able to continue to serve as president in light of what some have suggested may be signs of mental deterioration.

In August, an Issues & Insights/TIPP poll revealed that 59% of respondents were ""concerned"" about Biden's mental health. 36% stated they were ""very concerned."" Although this concern skewed along political lines, 39% of Democrat respondents nevertheless expressed concern.

When asked whether age may present a challenge to Biden in 2024, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That is not a question that we should be even asking."" The 48-year-old added, ""I can't even keep up with him.""

Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), a former White House doctor, observed that Biden is now slow, frail, forgetful, confused, and short-tempered. ""All these things are physical and mental manifestations of cognitive decline and it's related to age,"" said Jackson.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jackson suggested that Biden should resign.

Jackson told Fox News Digital, ""The whole country is seeing his mental cognitive issues on display for over a year now, and there's really no question ... that he's not cognitively the same as he used to be and, in my mind, not fit to be our president right now.""

Biden's routine gaffes have stoked much of this worry.

Last week, the president asked for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), who died this summer in a car crash. Biden had previously issued an official statement in which he offered her family his condolences.

In a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Biden was asked about his mental focus. His answer became the subject of much ridicule.

In July, Biden said that it was important to ""bear witness, to keep alive the truth and the honor of the Holocaust,"" having originally been scripted to say ""horror of the Holocaust.""

Biden shields Ukrainians in US from deportation with temporary protection during war,"The Biden administration will temporarily shield tens of thousands of Ukrainians in the United States from deportation and grant them work permits for as long as they are unable to return to Ukraine because of the ongoing war with Russia, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday.

According to the agency, any Ukrainian resident in the U.S. who has been here since March 1 or earlier is eligible for Temporary Protected Status for a period of 18 months. Ukrainians who arrived in the country after March 1 are ineligible for this designation, DHS said in a release.

The federal government's action comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, air, and sea in what has become one of the largest wars in Europe since World War II. President Joe Biden strongly condemned Russia in his State of the Union address earlier this week, calling the attack ""premeditated and unprovoked.""

The president detailed economic sanctions the U.S. and European allies have placed on Russia in his address, and promised additional aid to the Ukrainian people during this conflict. He also announced that Russian flights would be cut off from American air space to ""squeeze"" the Russian economy as punishment for Putin's war.

Biden's administration has determined that the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine and ""extraordinary and temporary conditions"" will prevent Ukrainian nationals in the U.S. from returning home safely. The TPS designation for Ukrainians in America will grant them access to work permits and enable them to remain in the U.S. after their visas expire, for as long as the status lasts.

""Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a written statement.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it had paused deportation flights to Ukraine due to the ""ongoing humanitarian crisis,"" Reuters reported.



Since the war began, more than 1 million Ukrainians have fled their country seeking refuge in European nations to the west. Half a million of these refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which said this could be the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, CNN reported.



U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said Thursday, ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.""

""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy,"" Grandi added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-shields-ukrainians-in-us-from-deportation-with-temporary-protection-during-war,2022-03-04
Biden snaps at reporter who confronts him over effectiveness of sanctions. Then even NBC calls him out.,"President Joe Biden snapped at a reporter Thursday who confronted him over contradictory statements about the purpose of American-imposed sanctions on Russia.

What is the background?

The Biden administration infamously waited until Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine to impose harsh sanctions on Russian leaders, businesses, and the Russian economy.

The purpose of sanctions, the Biden administration has maintained repeatedly, is deterrence.

Vice President Kamala Harris said on Feb 20: ""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence.""

""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence."" National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Feb 11: ""The President believes that sanctions are intended to deter.""

""The President believes that sanctions are intended to deter."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Feb 20: ""The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war.""

""The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war."" White House press secretary Jen Psakihas reportedlysaid the purpose of sanctions is to have a ""deterrent impact"" or deterrent effect.""

What happened with Biden?

During a press conference at NATO headquarters in Belgium, CBS News correspondent Christina Ruffini confronted Biden after he announced that NATO had agreed to imporse additional sanctions against Russia.

""Sir, deterrence didn’t work. What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you’ve taken today?"" Ruffini asked.

In response, Biden claimed that he has never said sanctions are meant to deter Russia.

Let’s get something straight: You remember, if you’ve covered me from the beginning, I did not say that in fact the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions — the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain, and the demonstration — why I asked for this NATO meeting today — is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we’re doing not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That’s what will stop him.

When Ruffini asked her question again — whether new actions would ""have an impact on making Russia change course in Ukraine"" — Biden accused Ruffini of ""playing a game.""

""That’s not what I said. You, you — you’re playing a game with me,"" Biden chided.

""The answer is no,"" the president continued. ""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified, and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people’s lives that are being lost and ruined, and what’s going on. That’s the important thing.""

What about NBC News?

While reporting on Biden's remarks, NBC News correspondent Kelly O'Donnell fact-checked the president.

Biden snaps at reporter asking if his comments can be used by Russia for propaganda purposes: 'It's ridiculous!',"President Joe Biden appeared to lose his temper at a reporter asking if his controversial comments about regime change in Russia could be used for propaganda purposes by President Vladimir Putin.

Biden was speaking to reporters on Monday when he was challenged by PBS reporter about an offhand comment he made calling for Putin to be ousted from power over the war crimes in Ukraine.

""I still want to get back to your original words that he cannot remain in power? Can you help us understand, you have more foreign policy experience than any president who has ever held this office,"" claimed PBS NewsHour correspondent Lisa Desjardins.

""Whether those are your personal feelings or your feelings as president, do you understand why people would believe you, as someone commanding one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, saying someone cannot remain in power is a statement of U.S. policy?"" she asked. ""And also are you concerned about propaganda use of those remarks by the Russians?""

""No and no,"" Biden replied flatly.

""Tell me why, you have so much experience, you are the leader of this country,"" Desjardins pressed.

""Because it's ridiculous! Nobody believes we're gonna take down, I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that, number one,"" Biden emphatically explained.

""Number two, what have I been talking about since this began? The only war that's worse than one intended is one that's unintended. The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia,"" he added.

""That's not part of it. I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man. It's outragous, it's outrageous, and it's more an aspiration than anything, he shouldn't be in power,"" Biden concluded. ""There's no, I mean, people like this shouldn't be ruling countries but they do.""

Many criticized Biden for what were unscripted remarks that could unnecessarily provoke Putin at a very tense and unease time in global politics. Biden's defenders claimed that his comments were akin to that of Ronald Reagan when he challenged then-Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev to take down the Berlin Wall during the Cold War era.

Others criticized Desjardins for claiming Biden was the most experienced in foreign policy of any president who had ever held the office.

"Joe Biden: Sorry for comparing impeachment to lynching, but it's worse when President Trump says it","After apparently forgetting he had compared impeachment to lynching years before President Donald Trump did so Tuesday morning, former Vice President Joe Biden has apologized for the comparison — while still maintaining that it's worse that Trump said it.

How did we get here?

President Trump called the Democrats' impeachment inquiry a ""lynching"" in a Tuesday tweet.

Predictably, every prominent Democrat made a point to condemn a comparison of a legal investigation to an unjustified mob murder — particularly because lynching has dark racial connotations in American history. So, Joe Biden jumped on the bandwagon.

Next, everyone reminds Biden that he went on television in 1998 and compared the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton to lynching.

Joe Biden in 1998 uses term “lynching"" on impeachment youtu.be

An apology, but not really

Backed into a corner after being seen on video doing exactly the ""abhorrent"" and ""despicable"" thing Trump did, Joe Biden, in one tweet, apologized for what he said and attempted to differentiate his lynching comparison from the president's.

Apparently the argument Biden is making here is that he said ""lynching"" accidentally, and he's really sorry, but Trump uses it with the deliberate intention of stoking racial divides. Even though, it must be emphasized, the two men used the word in the exact same context.

This is Biden's move, which he is also employing with regard to Ukraine. President Trump is corrupt for allegedly tying aid money to a political motive, but Biden is not corrupt for doing the same thing. President Trump is corrupt for allowing his children to profit from foreign business, but Biden is not corrupt for allowing his son to do the same.

Although it still doesn't seem to be hurting Biden in the polls with Democratic voters, it may be the case that Biden is much more like Trump than he cares to admit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-sorry-for-comparing-impeachment-to-lynching-but-its-worse-when-trump-says-it,2019-10-23

Biden also reiterated that U.S. forces will not engage with Russia in Ukraine, noting that America and its allies will defend all NATO territory.

The president, who continues to remain underwater on various job approval polls, also spoke against defunding the police. The policy is promoted by some Democrats, but strongly opposed by many Americans.

""We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police, it's to fund the police,"" he declared.

Biden described the state of the American union as ""strong,"" claiming that the country is stronger now than one year ago and that it will be even stronger one year in the future.

Biden says US will intervene if China invades Taiwan,"President Joe Biden has announced that the United States will militarily intervene if the People's Republic of China decides to invade Taiwan, according to reports.

What are the details?

During a Monday press conference in Tokyo, Biden said that the United States military will help Taiwan defend itself against China if necessary.

A reporter asked the president, ""You didn't want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?""

""Yes. That's the commitment we made,"" Biden responded while delivering in remarks alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

The president added that China should not take Taiwan ""by force.""

""[It] is just not appropriate,"" he said.

A White House spokesperson told Fox News that the Biden administration's One China policy ""has not changed.""

""As the president said, our policy has not changed,"" the spokesperson said. ""He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.""

Fox News noted that America's ""One China policy"" states that the U.S. recognizes the People's Republic of China as the ""sole legal government of China, but only acknowledges, without endorsing, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China.""

What else?

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he was unhappy with and opposed to Biden's remarks.

""China has no room for compromise or concessions on issues involving China’s core interests such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Wang said.

In October, Biden issued similar remarks and said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, to which a ministry spokesperson warned, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination, and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

"Biden, the oldest president ever to take office, acknowledges concerns about his age: 'I could drop dead tomorrow'","President Joe Biden, the oldest president ever to take office in the United States, reportedly told Al Sharpton last month that he plans to run for reelection in 2024. That seems a long way off, especially in light of Biden's suggestion in an interview that aired on Sunday that he ""could drop dead tomorrow.""

An age-old question

In a recent interview for MSNBC's ""The Sunday Show,"" host Jonathan Capehart mentioned how his aunt Gloria had been a big Biden supporter in 2020 but now has reservations about him running in 2024 on account of his age. Biden is, after all, turning 80 in November, and the CDC announced in August that the average life expectancy for men in the U.S. in 2021 was 73.2.

Capehart asked Biden to explain why people like Gloria, wary about his age, should vote for him in 2024 — even if former President Donald Trump doesn't run again.

Biden replied, ""I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone's age, including mine. I think that's totally legitimate,"" adding that ""the best way to make the judgment is to, uh, to, you know, watch me.""

The president outlined telltale signs prospective voters should look for: ""Am I slowing up? Am I don't have the same pace? Or, you know, uh, and that old joke, you know, uh ... everybody talks about the, you know, the new 70s, 50s, and all that stuff. You know, I, you know, it could be, I'm a great respecter of fate.""

Having meandered onto the topic of fate, Biden warned, ""I could get a disease tomorrow. I could drop dead tomorrow.""

""In terms of my energy level, in terms of how much I am able to do, I think people should look and say, 'Is he still have the same passion for what he's doing?' And if they think I do and I can do it, then that's fine,"" he said. ""If they don't, they should vote against me,""

Realizing he had suggested that those who are concerned about his age shouldn't vote for him, Biden corrected himself, saying, ""Not against me. They should encourage me not to go. But that's not how I feel.""

'Watch me': Looking for signs of cognitive impairment

It's not just Capehart's aunt paying close attention to Biden's potential mental deterioration.

An August Issues & Insights/TIPP poll revealed that 59% of respondents were ""concerned"" about Biden's mental health. 36% stated they were ""very concerned.""

While Republicans expressed greater overall concern, 39% of Democrats nevertheless noted their apprehension.

Biden's so-called gaffes are myriad and responsible, in part, for feeding these apprehensions.

Historian and classicist Victor Davis Hanson wrote earlier this month, ""Biden's messaging is even more confused than his medium. On any given day, Biden may impetuously announce that U.S. soldiers will defend the soil of Taiwan, or that the 'killer' Russian President Vladimir Putin, unhinged head of nuclear Russia, must be removed from office promptly.""

Hanson noted that whereas former President Donald Trump's ""leftist opponents sought to remove him by the 25th Amendment,"" ""the same [leftist] arm-chair psychiatrists offer no such worries about Biden's clear mental decline.""

In answer to the question, ""How is your mental focus?"" posed during a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Biden said, ""Look, I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, my own head, the number of years. I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly.""

This response was the subject of much scrutiny and ridicule.

When responding to a question about why certain Democrat candidates do not want Biden on the campaign trail with them, the president provided an answer that similarly devolved into incoherence.

Gaffes, or clumsy social errors, are not the same as failures of memory, comprehension, or will.



In late September, Biden looked about the room for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), who died this summer in a car crash. Biden was, or ought to have been, cognizant of Walorski's death, considering he previously issued an official statement in which he offered her family his condolences.

In June, concerns were expressed over Biden's cognitive well-being and autonomy when he accidentally flashed a note card containing detailed instructions delineating his every action, including when to sit down and whom to address.

""I hope this is not true because if it is we need to ask who's in charge of our president,"" wrote activist Sarah Idan.

Former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller: ""White House staff clearly has exceptionally low confidence in Biden’s cognitive abilities. If GOP gains house they will need to hold hearings on Biden’s diminished capacity and subpoena aides to get their testimony under oath.""

TheBlaze previously noted that Biden had also:

suggested that the 2018 Parkland, Florida, mass shooting had taken place in 1918;

spoke to the ""selfishness"" (contra ""selflessness"") of American troops;

claimed to have cancer in a speech about climate change;

demanded a regime change in Russia, which the White house soon had to walk back; and

mistook Ukraine for Iran during his State of the Union address.

Dead weight?

According to an Oct. 18 Reuters/Ipsos poll, 54% of Americans disapprove of the president.

A Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted in late September indicated that 45% of registered voters said Biden should ""definitely not"" run again, and an additional 19% said he should ""probably not run.""

A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in July showed that 64% of Democrat voters would prefer someone other than Biden. The number of voters under the age of 30 wanting someone else was far higher, figuring at 94%.

Biden threatens oil companies with new tax over 'war profiteering.' But top Dem economist says it will backfire.,"President Joe Biden threatened oil and gas companies with a ""windfall tax"" on Monday, accusing them of ""war profiteering.""



What did Biden say?

Speaking at the White House, Biden accused oil companies of netting ""outrageous"" profits, which he attributed to the exploitation of the war in Ukraine.

Biden said oil companies need to reinvest their profits and reduce the cost of oil — or else.

""If they don’t, they’re going to pay a higher tax on their excess profits and face other restrictions,"" Biden said. ""It’s time for these companies to stop war profiteering, meet their responsibilities to this country, and give the American people a break and still do very well.""

The U.S. is not, in fact, at war.

Moreover, Biden claimed that if oil companies were not profiteering, then Americans would be paying, on average, at least 50 cents less per gallon of gas. He did not provide evidence to back that claim.

What was the response?

Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary who served in the Clinton and Obama administrations, predicted Biden's windfall tax will backfire.

""I’m not sure understand the argument for a windfall profits tax on energy companies. If you reduce profitability, you will discourage investment which is the opposite of our objective,"" Summers pointed out.

""If it is a fairness argument, I don’t quite follow the logic since even with the windfalls Exxon has underperformed the overall market over the last 5 years,"" he noted.

As Summers observed, the oil business is highly volatile.

For instance, while Biden emphasizes the industry's current profits, the five biggest oil companies — ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and TotalEnergies – lost $76 billion in 2020. Biden, however, made no mention of that.

Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute also pointed out in a response to Biden that the oil industry does not control the price at the pump.

""Oil companies do not set prices—global commodities markets do,"" API president and CEO Mike Sommers said.

Economists at the Federal Reserve of Dallas have explained why oil companies are not responsible for the high prices of gas at the pump. According to their calculations, less than 60% of the price of gas is directly related to the price of oil. Other costs associated with the price of gas include oil refining, distribution, and taxes.

The truth is that gas stations control the price of gas at the pump.

""Since only 1% of service stations in the U.S. are owned by companies that also produce oil, U.S. oil producers are in no position to control retail gasoline prices,"" the Dallas Fed explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-threatens-oil-companies-windfall-tax,2022-11-01
Biden to waive sanctions on firm building Russian pipeline into Germany: report,"The Biden administration is planning to waive sanctions against the company in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia into Germany, according to a new report.

What are the details?

Axios reported Tuesday that according to two sources briefed on the matter, the State Department is set to submit its 90-day report to Congress detailing which entities linked to Nord Stream 2 ""deserve sanctions.""

""The State Department will also acknowledge the corporate entity in charge of the project — Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO, the Putin crony and former East German intelligence officer Matthias Warnig — are engaged in sanctionable activity,"" the outlet noted, adding, ""However, the State Department will waive the applications of those sanctions, citing U.S. national interests.""

The move would be an about-face from former President Donald Trump's position on the pipeline, but it would also appear to go against Secretary of State Antony Blinken's declaration during his confirmation hearing that he was ""determined to do whatever we can to prevent that completion"" of the project.

The Hill pointed out that the ""completion of the pipeline would allow fuel from Russia to bypass Ukraine to reach Europe, undermining the nation's connection to western Europe.""

In order to stop the project — which is 95% complete and could be finished this summer — the Biden administration has determined they would need to sanction German citizens, a move they are not willing to make because of the damage it could cause to U.S.-German relations.

How are people reacting?

Reactions to the news were mixed on social media.

Journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted, ""This is genuinely a huge gift to Putin: Biden is waiving sanctions which will effectively allow Germany to buy natural gas from the Russian pipeline. Trump spent years trying to sabotage this deal: crucial to Russian interests. Biden is allowing it.""

""Good,"" one person replied. ""Sanctioning Europe for where it buys its gas is insane.""

Greenwald responded, ""Of course. But so was the four-year narrative that Putin controlled Trump, especially given Trump's argument that Germany should buy natural gas from the US, not Russia, given NATO expenditures to protect Germany. But the media didn't care.""

Another individual weighing in on the Axios article wrote, ""Wait, wasn't Trump supposed to have been the Russian agent?""

Someone else tweeted,"" I agree with [Biden] revoking the sanctions,"" leading another to reply, ""So does Vladimir.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-to-waive-sanctions-on-firm-building-russian-pipeline-into-germany-report,2021-05-18
Joe Biden's own words come back to haunt him after he tries to blame Republicans for economic woes,"President Joe Biden was reminded of his own words over the weekend after he attempted to blame Republicans for the ongoing economic woes plaguing Americans.

What did Biden say?

On Sunday, the president claimed that Republicans ""are doing nothing but obstructing"" the Biden administration's tireless efforts to help Americans and their checkbooks.

""Republicans are doing nothing but obstructing our efforts to crack down on gas-price gouging, lower food prices, lower healthcare costs, and hopefully, soon, lower your prescription drug costs,"" Biden said.

""This is not right,"" he added. ""And that’s why this election is going to be so darn important.""

The escalating rhetoric from Biden comes as the 2022 midterm elections inch closer.

Democrats, who could face significant losses, are trying to shed responsibility for economic woes — like sky-high inflation and record-high gas prices — because every poll shows those are the issues American voters believe are most important. Thus, Democrats believe that blame-shifting will deceive some voters into actually believing that Republicans, who do not control Congress or the White House, are responsible for economic problems.

Do people believe Biden?

Deflecting blame did not go over well. In fact, the social media response unearthed remarks from Biden that contradict his attempt to blame Republicans for problems happening under his watch.

In June 2020, Biden vowed: ""It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike [Donald Trump] I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.""

""It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike [Donald Trump] I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you."" In April 2020, Biden said: ""The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.""

""The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job."" In August 2020, Biden promised: ""Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.""

And what about Russian President Vladimir Putin? As Christina Pushaw, spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, pointed out, for months the Biden administration blamed skyrocketing gas prices and other economic woes on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So which is it? Republicans or Putin?

A plethora of otherpeople discountedBiden's blame-shiftingby observing thatDemocrats currently exert the most influence over the direction of government because they control the White House and Congress.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-tries-to-blame-republicans-economic-woes,2022-07-11
Biden says US troops will head 'in the near term' to NATO countries in Eastern Europe,"President Joe Biden said Friday evening that he would be sending U.S. troops to NATO countries in Eastern Europe ""in the near term.""

The decision is seen as a challenge to Russian Federation president Vladimir Putin, who has amassed more than a hundred thousand troops on the border with Ukraine.

Biden made the comments to reporters at Joint Base Andrews after returning from Pittsburgh where he gave a speech on infrastructure spending.

“I’ll be moving troops to Eastern Europe in the NATO countries in the near term,” said Biden. “Not too many.”

Numerous countries have made statements in support of Ukraine and have pledged to help defend the country if Russia invades. Moscow has denied any plans involving an attack on the former Soviet satellite country.

Biden has twice made statements that appeared to accept the possibility of an eminent invasion, but the White House has twice walked the statements back. Ukrainian officials have called on the U.S. president to stop creating panic about the tense situation.

He has also promised that Russia would face damaging economic sanctions if Putin follows through with a military attack.

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley pressed for a diplomatic solution in a media briefing Friday and said that a Russian invasion would incur ""horrific"" costs.

“Given the type of forces that are arrayed, the ground maneuver forces, the artillery, the ballistic missiles, the air forces, all of it packaged together. If that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,” Milley explained.

But he said the U.S. was ready to defend its NATO ally.

""We are ready, capable and prepared to uphold our obligation under treaty to NATO,"" Milley said. ""An attack against one NATO ally is an attack against all.""

The Pentagon has placed about 8,500 troops on high alert in anticipation of deployment to Eastern Europe.

Biden is getting torched on social media for begging dictators to produce more oil after criticizing US oil production,"President Joe Biden is seeking to solve the oil crisis in the U.S. by begging foreign dictators and despots to increase their territories'' oil production and many on social media are torching him for it.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that they would not be seeking to increase domestic oil production and instead insisted that the crisis meant they should depend more on renewable sources.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” Psaki claimed. “The only way to protect U.S. over the long term is to become energy independent.""

Oil prices have been skyrocketing since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many in the U.S. are calling for the Biden administration to stop all oil imports from Russia while it continues to attack Ukrainian sovereignty.

Republicans and other critics of the administration criticized him on social media for seeking increased production from questionable foreign sources while seeking to shut down domestic producers of oil.

""It is wrong for the Biden Administration to beg for oil from Venezuela & legitimize Maduro’s communist regime during an official visit. The U.S. should hold Maduro accountable while increasing domestic energy production so we won’t need to rely on hostile regimes for energy,"" responded Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).

""Apparently Biden thinks producing more of our own oil in America is bad for the climate but somehow producing more oil in #Venezuela is not,"" tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).

""Gas is up 13% in just the past week. What will it take for Joe Biden to increase oil production in America?"" replied Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).

""Gas wouldn’t be this expensive if Joe Biden opened up America’s oil pipelines,"" tweeted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). ""Anyone telling you otherwise is lying.""

""Biden should be turning to AMERICAN energy producers for more oil and gas—not dictators in Venezuela, Iran, and Saudi Arabia,"" tweeted Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.).

""Joe Biden would rather get oil from socialists in Venezuela than from American workers in Texas,"" added Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas.)

""At this point, the Biden administration is actively considering incentivizing both Iranian oil and Venezuelan oil, but has thus far shown no interest in incentivizing *checks notes* American oil. Up is down. Down is up,"" said Newsweek opinion editor Josh Hammer.

While the administration is now blaming oil companies for the high price of gas and claiming their policies have not reduced production, Biden previously said that it would be necessary to transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.

Also on Monday, the stock market continued to collapse over fears due to inflation and the continuing invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

Biden admin warns it 'will not be in a position to evacuate US citizens' from Ukraine if Russia invades. Critics compare it to Afghanistan debacle.,"The Biden administration warned over the weekend that it ""will not be in a position to evacuate U.S. citizens"" from Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion, and critics quickly drew comparisons to the administration's previous failures in Afghanistan.

What are the details?

Hundreds of thousands of Russian troops have been massing on the country's border with Ukraine in recent months, foreshadowing a possible invasion. Diplomatic attempts to resolve the tensions so far have appeared to fail.

In response to the military movements, the U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of family members of diplomats and authorized the departure of some U.S. government employees.

The department previously increased Ukraine's travel advisory status to ""Level 4 — Do Not Travel"" due to Russia's military threat. In a news release Sunday, the State Department alerted U.S. citizens in the country that the U.S. government would essentially be unable to assist their evacuation in the event of a Russian attack.

""As President Biden has said, military action by Russia could come at any time and the United States government will not be in a position to evacuate American citizens in such a contingency, so U.S. citizens currently present in Ukraine should plan accordingly, including by availing themselves of commercial options should they choose to leave the country,"" the State Department said.

State Department officials reportedly echoed the same statements to reporters in a conference call.

""We've authorized the departure of some US government employees, but we have ordered the departure of all family members of US government employees at our Embassy in Kyiv. The State Department has also elevated our travel advisory for Ukraine to level four,"" a spokesman said, according to Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin.

What was the reaction?

Critics on social media quickly responded by slamming the Biden administration's efforts to help U.S. citizens trapped in war zones, or lack thereof. Many drew comparisons to the administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, during which hundreds — if not thousands — of Americans were left behind amid a Taliban takeover of the country.

Oliver Jia posted, ""The U.S. to its citizens trapped in war zones,"" followed by a gif of a man throwing up the peace sign before disappearing.

What else?

Citing British intelligence, the Daily Beast reported on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has plans to install a pro-Russian regime in Kyiv and has identified former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev as a potential front-runner to lead the takeover.

On Sunday, the Biden administration was said to be considering the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops, as well as warships and aircraft to NATO allies in Eastern Europe as a deterrent to Russian action. But some experts said the action would be too little, too late.

Last week, President Biden stunned Ukrainian officials after he appeared to offer an incredibly weak response to Russia's threat in a long, rambling press conference. During the conference, Biden seemed to downplay a potential ""minor incursion"" by Russia in the coming days.

Ukrainian officials reportedly slammed Biden for effectively giving ""the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-ukraine-evacuation-russia-threat,2022-01-24
"Biden unveils new plan to target, punish oil companies for gas crisis he blames on Putin","President Joe Biden is asking Congress to punish oil companies for allegedly placing profits over oil production.

The allegations are the latest development in Biden's total abdication of any responsibility for the gas price crisis. Energy experts say the Biden administration's hostile policies are playing some role in the crisis, but the White House blames Russian President Vladimir Putin and oil companies.

While Russia's invasion of Ukraine undoubtedly shook the oil market, the White House has blamed oil companies for not using as many as 9,000 approved oil leases. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was making that claim before the war.

What are the details?

In an announcement, the White House pushed blame for the gas price crisis on oil companies, claiming they are putting profits over production.

""[T]oo many companies aren’t doing their part and are choosing to make extraordinary profits and without making additional investment to help with supply,"" the White House said in a statement.

To stop oil companies from their alleged profiteering, Biden wants Congress to impose fees on companies for not using approved leases.

""Today, President Biden is calling on Congress to make companies pay fees on wells from their leases that they haven’t used in years and on acres of public lands that they are hoarding without producing,"" the statement said.

""Companies that are producing from their leased acres and existing wells will not face higher fees,"" the White House continued. ""But companies that continue to sit on non-producing acres will have to choose whether to start producing or pay a fee for each idled well and unused acre.""

But what is the problem?

Three significant problems exist with the White House's claims.

First, while the oil industry is highly lucrative, it is also volatile. Although major oil companies measure annual revenue in the tens of billions of dollars, the same measuring standard applies to losses. In fact, the world's biggest integrated oil companies — ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and TotalEnergies — lost more than $70 billion in 2020. That means gains in 2021 essentially offset losses from the previous year.

Second, many oil companies, while making investments in renewable sources, are slowing investments in fossil fuels because the U.S. government is enacting policies that are increasingly hostile toward oil. Why would a company make additional investments in oil, like the White House's statement indicates the Biden administration wants, if U.S. policy makes oil production untenable?

Third, not every approved oil lease is viable. In fact, the process of finding, acquiring, and developing oil under an approved lease is a lengthy one — only if oil exists under the land for which a lease is approved. To make matters worse, leases are often hung up by litigation and bureaucratic red tape.

Anne Bradbury — CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council, a national trade organization that represents oil companies — has called the White House's accusation a ""red herring.""

""It's really a distraction from the fact that this administration has paused leasing on federal lands, something that we're concerned about and something that we think needs to continue right away,"" Bradbury told Fox Business. ""The fact is that industry is producing at a higher level on existing leases on federal lands than in the last 20 years and these leases take many years to explore, to develop and produce on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-unveils-new-plan-to-target-punish-oil-companies-for-gas-crisis-he-blames-on-putin,2022-03-31
Whoopi Goldberg defends embarrassing Biden moment when he calls for politician who died a month ago,"Whoopi Goldberg defended President Joe Biden's embarrassing moment when he called for a politician who passed away in August.

Critics of the president mocked and ridiculed him on social media over the video showing him calling for Republican Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana during an event at the White House Wednesday.

""I want to thank all of you here ... including bipartisan elected officials like Senator Braun, Senator Booker, Representative ... Jackie, are you here? Where's Jackie?"" Biden said.

""I think she was going to be here to help make this a reality,"" he added.

Walorski died in early August along with two of her aides when their car got into a head-on collision with another vehicle. The driver of the other vehicle died as well.

Reporters pushed hard against White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre when she tried to claim that Biden only had Walorski on ""top of his mind"" when he made the comments.

Goldberg offered her own defense while on the ""The View"" show Thursday.

""You know, my gosh, c'mon, you can't go after him for, you know, not giving aid to Florida, or not tackling the infrastructure, and he's given aid to Ukraine, and so you can't go after him for that!"" Goldberg said.

""But you can go after him for forgetting that someone has passed!

""I mean, and she passed last month, not like a hundred years ago. 'Cuz we dealt with that as well, where people said, you know, that person who died a hundred years ago did a great job,"" she added, referring to a moment when then-President Donald Trump spoke as if Frederick Douglass were still alive.

Critics have pounced on these kinds of moments to undermine faith in 79-year-old Biden's health and mental faculties.

Biden was warned in early 2017 about problematic Ukraine ties by man recently indicted for funneling Russian money to US politicians,"One of the four men indicted Thursday for a scheme to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians to buy political influence issued a cryptic warning to former Vice President Joe Biden about his and his son's Ukraine ties — all the way back in January 2017.

David Correia was among those charged with trying to buy influence from state and national U.S. politicians using money with ties to Russia. Two of the men indicted in the scheme are associates of President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.

In a now-deleted tweet to Biden's VP account, Correia referred to Hunter Biden's appointment to the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma.

Biden had posted a tweet on Jan. 19, 2017, the day before Trump's inauguration, that said, ""15.8 million new jobs. 20 million more people insured. 165,000 troops home from war. Serving as your VP was the greatest honor of my life.""

Correia replied to that tweet on Jan. 22, 2017, saying, ""I assume the day your son took his position in Ukraine was also a great moment? I have a feeling that chapter isn't closed.""

Hunter BIden was named to the board of Burisma in May 2014, following a period of governmental turmoil and regime change that resulted in the presidency of Petro Poroshenko. Hunter Biden had no known qualifications for the job, yet was paid about $50,000 per month. He left the board earlier in 2019.



Joe Biden has been scrutinized recently for allegedly using his influence as vice president, and as the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating Burisma.

In addition to Correia, two Giuliani associates — Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman — were arrested and charged with campaign finance violations for allegedly donating money to former Texas Rep. Pete Sessions (R) in an effort to influence the ouster of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Andrey Kukushkin, a Ukrainian-born American, was also arrested and charged.

According to the indictment, Parnas, who is also a Ukrainian-born American was acting ""at least in part"" at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials. From the New York Times:

According to the indictment unsealed in New York, Parnas, Fruman and other defendants ""conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with the candidates, campaigns, and the candidates' governments."" The indictment does not mention Giuliani or suggest that he was part of the alleged crimes.

According to the Times, Parnas and Fruman worked with Giuliani to spur investigations in Ukraine into Joe and Hunter Biden. Giuliani is not mentioned in the indictments.

Parnas and Fruman donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump Super PAC, America First Action, in 2018 through a company called Global Energy Producers. Prosecutors allege that donation was part of a plan ""to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-warned-about-ukraine-ties-in-2017,2019-10-10

""If there's a Senate impeachment trial, they might want to call you as a witness is that something where you would appear voluntarily?"" asked Doocy.

""No I'm not going to let them take their eye off the ball,"" responded Biden.

""The president is the one who has committed impeachable crimes and I'm not going to let him divert from that. I'm not gonna let anybody divert from that,"" he added.

Democrats have begun an impeachment inquiry based on the accusation that the president withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate Joe Biden's influence in their country.

Allies of the president have defended him by saying that there was enough evidence to seek an investigation into decisions Biden made as vice president that could have benefited his son, then a consultant at a Ukrainian energy company.

Biden did not add whether he would answer to a subpoena if it were issued by Senate lawmakers.

"Biden tries walking back Senate subpoena defiance, but refuses to clarify if he would comply with one","Former Vice President Joe Biden took to Twitter on Saturday to ""clarify"" recent comments where he implied that he would not comply with a Senate subpoena requiring him to testify in the upcoming impeachment trial of President Trump.

When asked by the Des Moines Register on Friday if he would appear before the Senate, Biden said his presence would only ""[t]ake the focus off"" Trump.

""You guys are going to cover for three weeks anything that I said. And (Trump's) going to get away. You guys buy into it all the time. Not a joke … Think what it's about. It's all about what he does all the time, his entire career. Take the focus off. This guy violated the Constitution. He said it in the driveway of the White House. He acknowledged he asked for help,"" he said.

Biden's response raised eyebrows, in part, because one of the articles of impeachment against Trump charges him with instructing witnesses to ignore congressional subpoenas.

Biden's tweets raised new questions



The former vice president sought to address the controversy this weekend and walk back his answer, but his tweet thread raised new questions about his willingness to cooperate with the Senate's impeachment investigation.

I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.



But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump's conduct, not mine.



The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump's shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.

Why would the Senate subpoena Biden?



Some Republicans have indicated they may use the trial as an opportunity to probe business dealings by Biden's son, Hunter, and whether the former vice president pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who was investigating a company where Hunter sat on the board.

However, while Biden accused Trump on Saturday of ""shaking down the Ukraine government,"" it remains unclear if he would comply with a Senate subpoena.

"Bill Gates says Russian invasion of Ukraine will be 'good for the long run' because it will force countries to transition to green energy, praises ESG investments","Software developer Bill Gates declared that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be ""good for the long run"" because it will force European nations to embrace renewable green energy.

Gates appeared on CNBC's talk show ""The Exchange"" this week, where he pushed green energy alternatives over fossil fuels and touted efforts to promote the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiative.

""The 'E' part — lot of controversy, but there is a way to measure it, and it should be one of the factors people look at when they invest in companies,"" Gates said of the environmental aspect of ESG.

Gates commended BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as a ""great example of private-sector leadership"" in regard to climate change policy.

“Anyone who says that climate shouldn’t be a factor in how you evaluate the future of a company – that’s not capitalism,"" Gates claimed. ""Because companies that have emissions, they are going to be subject to border adjustment tariffs or taxes. If you’re dealing with severe weather events, that’s got to be factored in.""

Gates argued, ""Climate does affect the economy, which does affect investments.""



BlackRock is an investor in Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which aims to invest in green solutions that usher in a zero-carbon world. Earlier this year, the tech billionaire told Forbes that his Breakthrough Energy organization is ""only focused on investments that will have a substantial effect on climate change.""

Gates conceded that society can't stop using fossil fuels cold turkey because it's ""how people get to work today"" and "" how people avoid freezing to death in the winter.""

However, Gates said the transition to green energy still must happen. He said the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused a ""setback"" in the transition to green energy as European countries attempt to replace sanctioned fossil fuels from Russia.

""You know, it's a setback, you know, we need to find non-Russian hydrocarbon sources to substitute for those. So there's coal plants running and variety of things because you know, keeping people warm, keeping those economy's in decent shape is a priority,"" the Microsoft co-founder said on Tuesday.

""Now, on the other hand, it's good for the long run because people won't want to be dependent on Russian natural gas,"" Gates told CNBC’s Diana Olick. ""So they'll move to these new approaches more rapidly.""

The ""new approaches"" are likely green energy alternatives that the Breakthrough Energy organization plans to invest in.

Gates – who has a net worth of $101 billion – said efforts to combat climate change need to expand to things like green steel, green cement, and green hydrogen.

During the Breakthrough Energy Summit in Seattle this week, Gates said, ""The ultimate measure of success is global greenhouse gas emissions: We need to go from 51 billion tons a year to zero in the next three decades.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-gates-green-energy-esg,2022-10-20

""Watching the reactions to war in Ukraine these past few weeks, it’s become obvious that America in this age suffers acutely from a particular disease of the mind, which is: Everything proves what we already believed and everything goes back to the thing we already hate.""

""All issues today: Pandemic, war, whatever, become a stress test for our reflexive partisanship,” he continued. “Can you take a vastly complex situation that is 100% not about your thing and somehow still make it about your thing? Our answer is, 'Watch me.'""



Maher noted that Republicans ""naturally"" blamed the invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden because they believe he is the ""worst president ever."" Maher also stated that Democrats feel the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened because they believe Donald Trump was the ""worst president ever.""

The liberal talk show host criticized Biden who asserted that Putin's latest aggression was brought on by the Jan. 6 riot.

During a speech about infrastructure on March 2, Biden claimed, ""Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to split up the United States. Look, how would you feel if you saw crowds storm and break down the doors of the British Parliament and kill five cops, injure 145? Or the German Bundestag or the Italian Parliament?""

Five Washington, D.C., police officers died following the Jan. 6 riots, however one died from a stroke and four others died because of purported suicides.

Maher asked the question, ""OK, but if Putin thought Trump was really that supportive of him, why didn't he invade when Trump was in office?""

""It's at least worth asking that question if you're not locked into one intransigent thought,"" Maher said.

Maher also questioned Trump's reason for Putin's invasion.

""Now, one guy we know is locked into one thought is Donald Trump, who was asked what went wrong with Ukraine said, 'Well, what went wrong was a rigged election.' Kanye thinks less about Pete Davidson than Trump thinks about the rigged election,"" Maher joked.

Maher was also befuddled by ""1619 Project"" author Nikole Hannah-Jones – who suggested that Ukraine was garnering attention because they ""appear white.""

The HBO host mentioned that there was a Vanity Fair piece that said the war in Ukraine is ""also a fight for LGBTQ rights.""

""Don't take this personally, but don't take everything personally,"" Maher said.

""Ukraine is not mostly about your pet grievances, it's about Vladimir Putin. And Putin is bad, very, very, very bad,"" he added and then joked, ""But he's still better than the guy who brings every conversation around to bitcoin.""

Bill Maher says he regrets impeachment of President Trump,"Bill Maher said that he regrets the impeachment led by Democrats against President Donald Trump, and added that it ""turned out to be a horrible thing.""

""The impeachment, I mean, if I could do it over again, I wouldn't,"" Maher said on Friday's episode of ""Real Time."" ""Because it just emboldened him.""

""Now, he can conduct this war on accountability, and nobody even — it barely made the papers,"" Maher continued. ""I bet you most people are watching this and going, wow, I hadn't heard that. Because the news is all COVID.""



Maher also said that special counsel Robert Mueller ""f***ed it up."" The show's guest, Michael Moore, alleged that Trump ""bullied Mueller, he threatened him, and Mueller got scared and wouldn't even bring him in to be interrogated.""



Last month, Maher said Trump deserved to be impeached for ""favoring"" states that ""are nice to him"" during the coronavirus pandemic.

""I find one of the most galling parts about this is that the president is favoring certain states over the others. Governors who are 'nice' to him, as he calls it, get a lot of attention and all of the equipment they want,"" Maher told Sen. Bernie Sanders. ""To me, this is even more of an impeachable offense than what he did with Ukraine or Russia.""

In January 2019, Maher voiced his support for impeaching Trump. ""I don't know how we get out of this except by getting him out of office,"" Maher said. ""I wasn't necessarily for impeachment until recently, but I think you have to go ahead and do it.""

Also during the latest episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" leftist filmmaker Michael Moore said the only way Trump will win reelection is if he cheats.

Moore proclaimed that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden would win the popular vote by five million votes, but added that Trump could still win the Electoral College.

""The only way they are going to pull it off is if he's able to cancel the election or postpone it,"" Moore said. ""That is what we're going to have to fight against because I'm certain that is what is going on in his head right now.""



""The only way Republicans can win, and this has been true for a few elections, is to cheat,"" Moore claimed. ""Is to somehow game it, rig it, do whatever they need to do.""



Moore also mocked the armed protestors who demonstrated at the Michigan Capitol building last month against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's lockdown extension.

""This time he's already got his gun guys. The guys with the guns. You saw this in Michigan,"" Moore said. ""Showing up at the capitol for the last couple of weeks with their long arms and threatening everybody to the point where the governor, last Tuesday, just shut the legislature down. She was so afraid.""



""I want to appeal to people to not be afraid of these guys with the guns,"" Moore said. ""I went to high school with them. I know. They want to kill Bambi. That's their idea of a real fight. Them and a deer. If the deer were ever armed — if it was a fair fight, these guys would never be in the woods.""



""He's just trying to scare liberals because liberals get scared easy,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-regrets-trump-impeachment,2020-05-23
"Bill Maher says punishing the Russian people in response to the Ukrainian invasion is 'not fair,' says it would be 'racist' if Russians 'weren't white'","On Friday, late night television host Bill Maher took to the air to lambast people who are using the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine to condemn and ostracize Russian people who are not involved in any way with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war.

Fox News reported that Maher asked the panelists on his eponymous talk show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” “Do you think we’re, um, lumping the Russians too much with their government?”

He said, “I feel like in this country what we’re doing now, everything Russian is bad an every Russian is bad.”

“First of all, it’s not fair,” Maher continued, “If they weren’t white, I feel like we’d call that racism, you know. To lump everybody together – not every, I mean a lot of the Russian people don’t know what’s going on.”

One of Maher’s guests, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, suggested that the anti-Russian sentiment has spilled over and “gone way too far” after mentioning how Alexander Malofeev, the 20-year-old Russian piano prodigy, had his Canadian engagements canceled because of his Russian heritage.

Author Max Brooks, another of Maher’s guest panelists, said that the global ostracization of the Russian people is “unwise.”

He said, “What we were very smart about doing in World War II is, we knew the war was going to come to an end. And we knew that if we punished all Germans the way we did after World War I, we would back them into a corner.”

“So we crafted the narrative that ‘You Germans are led astray by Hitler,’” he continued, “because we knew, even if in some cases it wasn’t true, you know, we said to the average Nazi, you still got to run to the post office.”

Brooks, son of comedic legend Mel Brooks, said, “We have to think, we cannot back the Russians as an entire ethnic group into a corner. If we can separate Putin from the Russians in general, then we don’t only have a victory, we have a post-war plan.”

Maher, an avowed liberal-Democrat, has been considerably outspoken about the American government’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

He criticized both the Democratic and Republican parties for making the conflict into partisan mess.

Maher said, “Don’t make World War III about you. Watching the reactions to war in Ukraine these past few weeks, it’s become obvious that America in this age suffers acutely from a particular disease of the mind, which is: Everything proves what we already believed and everything goes back to thing we already hate.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-says-punishing-the-russian-people-in-response-to-the-ukrainian-invasion-is-not-fair-says-it-would-be-racist-if-russians-weren-t-white,2022-03-19
"Bill Maher hammers liberals who say masculinity is always toxic. 'Real Time' host praises males defending Ukraine, points out how 'the world still needs grown-ass men.'","Bill Maher laced into liberals who attack men for having supposed ""toxic masculinity."" The ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host used Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and men taking up arms to defend Ukraine from the Russian invasion as examples of how masculinity can be anything but toxic.

""If there's one thing we've learned from the crisis in Ukraine, it's that everyone loves, and the world still needs, grown-ass men,"" Maher began his rant.



Maher noticed that American women are obsessing over Zelenskyy, who the New York Post and Forward labeled as a ""sex symbol"" earlier this month. Maher stressed that progressives can't consider Zelenskyy a sex symbol while also denouncing masculinity as toxic.

The liberal talk show host jokingly hypothesized, ""Could it be that as much as women may want to create the perfect man there's always going to be a little bit of toxic mixed in with our masculinity and no amount of training will turn us into your favorite 'Twilight' character.""



""Masculinity is like coffee even when you decaffeinated, there's still a little caffeine in there,"" Maher quipped.

""Now there's certainly no denying that there has been a lot of toxicity associated with men throughout history, oceans of brutality, all of which is horrible, and some of which is why our species still exists on earth,"" Maher acknowledged.

""There are brave women fighting in Ukraine, but the images of people fleeing all seem to be women and children while every able-bodied man in Ukraine is sticking around to fight and maybe die,"" Maher noted. Ukraine has prohibited most Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 from fleeing the country, forcing them to defend against the Russian invasion.

""It's not always a great advantage being a man and toxic though we may be,"" he proclaimed. ""We do sometimes come in handy.""



""Turns out after 200,000 years, there's still a lot of 'Another tribe is coming to kill us.' And when that happens, you want a little big d*** energy,"" Maher said of military conflicts.

Maher remarked that for years he has been told that ""women just want a man who listens"" and ""won't try to fix their problems. He dared, ""Put that to the test sometime. Go over to her house tomorrow and fix her radiator. I bet she loves it.""

""When there's a noise downstairs, someone has to go into the dark and most women still want a man to do it,"" Maher joked. ""And if he doesn't, or can't or won't, it's not sexy.""

The HBO host shared a study that American adults having sex hit a 30-year low. He highlighted a study that one in four adults in the U.S. haven't had sex in the past year. Maher also pointed out how sperm counts of U.S. men have been drastically declining over decades.

Maher questioned the manlihood of today's American male, and suggested it could be because of the constant lecturing about toxic masculinity.

""It's the result of having it drilled into us in recent years that masculinity is itself toxic and scary and unevolved,"" he proposed. ""And women don't like it and the ones who think they do they really don't. And if you think you do, you're wrong, too.""

""Even the act of just asking a girl out is now seen by many younger people as overly aggressive,"" he said. ""There's a feeling that the attributes traditionally characteristic of men are inherently problematic. Which sounds a lot like men are born wrong.""

Maher lashed out at the Obama administration for using a man who became known as ""pajama boy"" to try to ""sell Obamacare to a skeptical nation.""

Maher ridiculed the marketing of Obamacare, ""This is what they put out as an image of the perfect man. The only thing he loves more than affordable health insurance is his therapy cat and 'Emily in Paris.' That ad might as well say, 'Ask your doctor if chemical castration is right for you.'""



Regarding the ""pajama boy"" campaign, there was a Politico opinion piece at the time titled: ""Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-Child.""

""You could win the battle and lose the war if you harangue men into becoming less like us and more like you,"" Maher stated.



""Women aren't attracted to these girly men they've created,"" Maher declared. ""The guy you whipped into total sensitivity isn't sexy to you anymore.""

Maher joked, ""There's a special place in a woman's heart for a man who learns to suppress his masculinity, it's called the 'friendzone.'""

Maher then lambasted men for ""sulking"" and ""complaining"" about not being able to be with a woman.

""Girls don't want to have sex with you unless you put in a little effort,"" Maher exclaimed. ""So put in a low effort. Yes, stupid lazy f***s.""

Bill would label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism,"GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have introduced a bill to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Currently, the only nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism include Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea.

Graham called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a terrorist,"" according to a press release.

""Putin has crossed every line of civilized norms during the war in Ukraine and years before,"" Graham said, according to the release. ""He has engaged in state-sponsored assassinations, the Wagner group supported by Russia terrorizes the world, and the war crimes being committed in Ukraine on a daily basis shock the conscious,"" he said, according to the press release. ""If Putin's regime is not a State Sponsor of Terrorism after all this, then the designation is meaningless. We believe that it is long past due to designate Putin's Russia as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and suffer the consequences thereof because he is a terrorist. Ukrainians have been asking for this designation, and we are listening. This will be a game changer in how we deal with terrorists worldwide.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have been advocating for Russia to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.

But according to Reuters, President Joe Biden answered, ""No,"" earlier this month when he was asked whether Russia should be named a state sponsor of terrorism.

""What has been revealed in Ukraine's success on the battlefield is not only its military prowess and Russia's weakness, but also Putin’s reliance on brutal atrocities, genocide, and war crimes against the people of Ukraine. Russia has more than earned the right to be among the club of pariah nations,"" Blumenthal said, according to the press release.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-russia-state-sponsor-terrorismbill-russia-state-sponsor-terrorism,2022-09-15
Hundreds of gallons stolen from gas station,"As Americans have been facing high gas prices, nearly 400 gallons of gas were stolen from a North Carolina gas station on Monday.

The theft occurred Monday night in High Point, North Carolina after the Bizzy Bee Grocery and BP gas station had closed.

WXII 12 reported that owner Hardik Patel said that store keeps the fuel pumps on after closing for the evening. Patel noted that about 398 gallons were stolen. He told Fox 8 WGHP that the pumps will now be turned off at night so he will not ""go through this again.""

Reports indicate that the payment system was circumvented, allowing the gas to flow. Surveillance footage showed someone appear to utilize a device to circumvent the payment system, Patel said, according to CNN — multiple cars came and stole the fuel.

""It wasn't free, they were stealing,"" Patel told CNN.



Drivers have been feeling pain at the pump as gas prices, which were already high, have recently risen even higher. As of Thursday, the AAA national average for a gallon of regular gas is $4.289.



Last week, President Joe Biden issued an executive order banning the importation of crude oil and other products into the U.S. from Russia.

A Trafalgar Group poll of likely general election voters that was conducted earlier this month found that a whopping 77.3% think that in the wake of Russia's incursion into Ukraine, Biden should make boosting U.S. energy production a priority.

If high gas prices persist, they could prove to be a signifiant liability for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections later this year. Not only do high gas prices hurt drivers, they could also lead to higher prices for a variety of goods as rising fuel costs drive up the cost of transporting items.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bizzy-bee-gas-theft-north-carolina,2022-03-17
'Black people are locked out from employment': Black rights groups in Austin march for 2A and against illegal immigration,"Several black rights groups in Texas recently took to the state capital of Austin to protest against illegal immigration and in favor of their Second Amendment rights and black reparations.

On Saturday, the groups, led by the Elmer Geronimo Pratt Pistol and Rifle Gun Club, held the third annual ""Second Amendment Unity Walk,"" chanting various slogans, including:

""What do we want?"" ""Closed borders!"" ""When do we want them?"" ""Now!""

""Guns up!"" ""Shoot back!""

""Black power!""

""We all we got!"" ""We all we need!""

They also carried a banner that read, ""REPARATIONS NOW!""

One person reportedly even tried to begin a ""Build the wall!"" chant in reference to former President Trump's call to build a wall on the U.S. southern border, but the rest of the crowd did not follow along with it.

At least one group leader stated very candidly that the marchers do not necessarily align with those on the political right.

""Republicans, do not dare to make the mistake of thinking you will get our vote just because we believe in exercising our Second Amendment,"" the unnamed woman said into a microphone.

""Yes, I'm talking to you, [Senator] Ted Cruz and Governor [Greg] Abbott,"" she continued. ""Don't think we are standing with you because we are against illegal immigration.""

Various speakers also called out Vice President Kamala Harris for failing to protect black Americans by failing to secure the border. The founder of the EGP gun club, Nick Bezzel, elaborated on the reasons why his fellow marchers believe illegal immigration is particularly harmful to the black community.

""We don't have a problem with immigration itself,"" Bezzel said, ""but we do have a problem with illegal immigration because, a lot of times, jobs are taken away from black people.

""Black people are locked out from employment due to illegal immigration,"" he added.

Bezzel also argued that reparations are a matter of justice.

""What we don't want to hear is 'America doesn't have the money,'"" he said, especially as the federal government continues to send money overseas to foreign allies such as Ukraine.

Now that the march is over, the gun club and other groups say they plan to continue lobbying politicians in Austin until they address what marchers called the ""black agenda.""

And the gun club views the so-called ""black agenda"" as multifaceted. In addition to advocating for ""responsible gun ownership, gun safety, and protecting our Black communities,"" the EGP also works to end no-knock raids and collects food, clothing, and hygiene products for the homeless and those in single-parent homes. Whether the club distributes these items exclusively to black recipients is unclear.

BlackRock president warns 'entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice' that they will soon face shock due to major shortages: 'Put on your seatbelts',"The president of the world's largest asset management company just issued a stark warning to members of America's ""entitled generation.""

BlackRock co-founder and president Robert Kapito said Tuesday that the global supply chain and soaring inflation crises will soon have dramatic effects on the U.S. economy that will result in a noticeable scarcity of goods not experienced before by many younger Americans.

That scarcity, he said, will likely be a shock to the system for many who are accustomed to an abundant and comfortable lifestyle.

""For the first time, this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want,"" Kapito said, adding, ""We have a very entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice.""

""I would put on your seatbelts, because this is something that we haven’t seen,"" he asserted, in reference to what he called ""scarcity inflation.""

Kapito's remarks, first reported by Bloomberg News, were made at the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association convention — an annual gathering of oil and gas industry leaders.

The warning comes just days after Bloomberg economists advised Americans to consider budgeting an extra $5,200 this year — or $433 monthly — to prepare for the effects of historically high inflation.

Inflation under the Biden administration has skyrocketed in the past year, rising at the fastest pace in four decades. Inflation is measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index, which increased nearly 8% over the past 12 months, according to government data released for February 2022.

The dramatically inflated prices have reportedly resulted in 64% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.

The last time inflation rose at such a fast rate was in 1982. That year, the U.S. economy went into a recession. Now, some experts are warning that another economic recession is ""inevitable.""

The Biden administration has been peddling a litany of excuses for the economic downturn — including the coronavirus pandemic, corporate greed, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine — but American voters reportedly aren't buying it.

A plurality of respondents to a recent NBC News poll (38%) blamed President Joe Biden for the increase in the cost of consumer goods, while just 28% blamed the coronavirus pandemic, 23% blamed corporations raising prices, and only 6% blamed Putin.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blackrock-inflation-scarcity-entitled-generation,2022-03-31
Sec. of State Blinken says Putin wants to advance beyond Ukraine as White House is hit hard over 'failed' diplomatic strategy: 'Putin was playing Biden all along',"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that Russia's military invasion of Ukraine is likely only part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's designs for the European continent.

Blinken made the remarks in an interview with CBS News managing editor Norah O'Donnell. When asked by O'Donnell if the U.S. had any specific intelligence indicating Putin will advance beyond Ukraine, the nation's top diplomat shrugged off the question, suggesting it's obvious.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants,"" Blinken said. ""He's made clear that he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.""

Blinken made it clear that any attack on a NATO member country would trigger a global response.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders, there's something very powerful standing in his way,"" Blinken noted. ""That's Article 5 of NATO — an attack on one is an attack on all. It's exactly why we've been reinforcing NATO's eastern flank.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on alarming developments in Ukraine www.youtube.com

It remains to be seen, however, what strength of response NATO countries, including the U.S., would offer. President Biden has thus far been tepid and diplomatic in his approach to Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe. Though it depends on who you ask. In a press conference Thursday, Biden responded to Russia's unprovoked military invasion by unleashing a slew of sanctions he said would be ""devastating"" — in ""another month or so.""

The U.S. has also been supplying weapons to the Ukrainian government, as well. But when pressed by reporters Thursday on whether more could be done — such as personally sanctioning Putin and removing Russia from SWIFT, an international banking cooperative, for starters — Biden demurred.

Politico reported Thursday that Putin was ""playing Biden all along."" Reuters, too, reported that Biden's negotiating returned zero results. Other voices, some notorious, chimed in with varying degrees of criticism.

Despite the president's tough rhetoric toward the would-be tyrant in the past, during meetings this year, Biden attempted to appeal to Putin's reason, pleading with him to ""return to diplomacy"" for the sake of Russia's ""credibility worldwide,"" the Politico report stated.

With the launch of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine this week, Putin proved that Biden's reasoning and emotional appeals had little effect on him.

""Biden’s appeals to Putin’s geopolitical ego didn’t work,"" the report added. ""For Biden and his team, it is a deeply frustrating moment. Their strategy toward Russia has largely failed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blinken-says-putin-wants-to-advance-beyond-ukraine,2022-02-25
Bloomberg opinion executive editor says 'how quickly it's unraveling' for President Trump is 'delicious',"The panelists who spoke Tuesday with MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace appeared just a tad excited about the subject on most everyone's lips: The prospect that President Donald Trump will be impeached over the Ukraine scandal.

One of them — Tim O'Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion — made no attempt to downplay his position on Trump, actually saying ""it's delicious"" with regard to ""how quickly it's unraveling"" for the president.

'Just hitting the plunger on the TNT box himself'

""One of the, I think, startling and delicious aspects of all this is how quickly it's unraveling,"" O'Brien said. ""When you think about ... the Mueller investigation was two years long. There were a lot of unknowns. It felt opaque. There were a lot of names. It felt very complicated to voters and to journalists and everyone watching it. And then suddenly you have the president reaching into the glass box and just hitting the plunger on the TNT box himself and —""

Wallace interjected, ""And then releasing the transcript where he does it!, where he's like, 'Hey, look at me!' It's —""

'He's profoundly ignorant'



""Because he's profoundly ignorant,"" O'Brien continued. ""He doesn't really understand any of this stuff ... he's never had adult supervision his whole life. He sort of had crossing guards who get him from one side of the road to another, and now he's been dumped in the middle of this highway where there are cars zipping past him at about 80 miles an hour; he doesn't know where to go. If he steps in the wrong way, in the wrong direction, he's gonna get hurt.""

Bolton breaks his silence: Democrats' impeachment of Trump was 'grossly partisan',"Former national security adviser John Bolton broke his silence Wednesday and slammed the Democratic Party-led impeachment of President Donald Trump as a ""grossly partisan"" effort.

Bolton, who is the author of an upcoming book on his experience in the White House, also said that his testimony would not have changed the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial, according to the Associated Press. He made the comments at a public appearance alongside Susan Rice, his counterpart under President Barack Obama.

While the former diplomat refused to disclose any details regarding his book, he did say he believed that the House ""committed impeachment malpractice."" This, the AP reported, drew ""grumbling from the audience.""

Democrats alienated Republican allies

The retired official also noted that the manner in which Democrats handled the impeachment ""drove Republicans who might have voted for impeachment away because it was so partisan.""

He also noted that, contrary to claims by Democrats who called upon him to testify, he does not believe that his testimony would have changed the final impeachment outcome — though he did not expect the Senate to vote against having him appear.

""People can argue about what I should have said and what I should have done,"" Bolton said. ""I would bet you a dollar right here and now, my testimony would have made no difference to the ultimate outcome.""

Rice disagreed, telling Bolton and the audience that nothing would have caused her ""to refuse to share information with Congress or the public that I thought was of national import.""

""I can't imagine withholding my testimony, with or without a subpoena,"" she added. ""I also can't imagine, frankly, in the absence of being able to provide that information directly to Congress, not having exercised my First Amendment right to speak publicly at a time when my testimony or my experience would be relevant.""

'Implied threat of criminal prosecution'

Bolton said the reason why he did not ""spill his guts"" regarding the president's dealings with Ukraine is that he could have faced criminal prosecution if he had shared, even inadvertently, information that is deemed classified. When asked if he would have complied with a House subpoena, Bolton cited the White House review process that is determining whether the contents of his book can be disclosed.

""I'm not here to speculate on that with the pre-publication review process under way,"" Bolton said, which drew laughter from some in the audience. ""Laugh all you want. This is the judgment of my counsel, somebody I worked with 35 years ago, 30 years ago at the Department of Justice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bolton-breaks-his-silence-democrats-impeachment-of-trump-was-grossly-partisan,2020-02-20
MSNBC viewers melt down on social media after John Bolton says Biden has failed to handle the Ukraine crisis,"MSNBC viewers lashed out at the progressive cable news channel after veteran journalist Andrea Mitchell interviewed John Bolton about the Biden administration's failures in Ukraine.

The former national security advisor in the Trump administration criticized President Joe Biden for failing to proactively prevent Russia's invasion into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic.

""I think [Russian President] Putin was undoubtedly waiting for a second Trump term. but he's getting almost effectively what he would have expected then,"" said Bolton. ""This is gonna be a victory for Russia.""

""You think that what the Biden administration is doing, rallying the NATO allies,"" Mitchell replied before getting interrupted.

""It has failed,"" Bolton fired back. ""The president has said it has failed.

They went on to debate whether NATO was more unified under the real threat of Russian invasion or whether it remained divided, but the viewers were not impressed by Bolton's presence on the show or Mitchell's reactions to his critique.

""I don’t want to hear John Bolton’s opinion on what we should be doing with Russia or anything for that matter,"" tweetedfailed congressional candidate Richard Ojeda.

""Literally the last person on earth who should be giving foreign policy advice right now. Perpetually incorrect bloodthirsty warmonger,"" replied YouTuber Kyle Kulinski.

""I would literally interview satan about Russia/Ukraine before even asking John Bolton how he likes his coffee,"" read one very popular tweet.

""Why would @andreamitchell give air time to a filthy traitor like john bolton? I despise her, for good reason,"" read another popular tweet.

Putin announced in an angry rant on Monday that Russia would be sending what he termed as ""peacekeepers"" into separatist regions of the former Soviet republic. Ukrainian leaders have warned that the ruse was likely a precursor to Russian forces seizing control of the country. Putin also said that other former Soviet republics should have never been allowed to leave Russia.

Bolton has fallen out of favor with supporters of former President Donald Trump after Bolton made damaging claims about him in a book he wrote after leaving the White House in 2019.

John Bolton decides that he will testify in Senate impeachment trial if subpoenaed,"John Bolton, former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, has decided he will testify in the Senate impeachment trial if he is subpoenaed.

""Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,"" he said in a statement posted on his website Monday.

Why does this matter?

Rumors about Bolton's possible appearance as a witness before Congress have swirled for months following news that he allegedly possesses crucial knowledge regarding the Trump administration's dealings in Ukraine.

Democrats have sought for Bolton, along with White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, to appear as witnesses in the forthcoming Senate trial believing their testimony would be damaging to Trump. Democrats hope that Bolton's testimony would prove that Trump committed an impeachable offense in requesting that Ukraine launch investigations into the Bidens and Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, while withholding military aid from the country.

While Republicans have not to this point agreed on calling any witnesses, Bolton's decision to testify if subpoenaed undoubtedly adds pressure for them to do so. Still, the whole matter is at a stand-still at the moment while Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) delays transferring the articles of impeachment to the Senate.

What's the background?

After his tumultuous exit from the White House, Bolton became a target witness for impeachment prosecutors due to his potential firsthand knowledge of the president's thoughts and actions.

During the House impeachment inquiry, he was invited to testify but did not attend his scheduled deposition and was not subsequently subpoenaed.

Bolton reportedly had major concerns regarding Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine.

Fiona Hill, the White House's former top Russia adviser, testified during closed-door testimony that Bolton was so concerned about the Ukraine intervention of Giuliani that he directed Hill to inform a White House lawyer about it.

According to Hill, Bolton called the intervention a ""rogue operation"" and a ""drug deal"" conducted by Giuliani, Mulvaney, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.

""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Hill recounted Bolton saying. He then allegedly called Giuliani a ""hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.""

In November, a lawyer for Bolton teased that his client has information about ""many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed"" in the impeachment probe.

If Bolton were to appear before Congress for questioning, he would become the closest adviser to President Trump to testify in the impeachment proceedings.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bolton-will-testify-if-subpoenaed,2020-01-06
Bombshell revelation buried deep in CNN report unravels whistleblower scandal involving President Trump,"The whistleblower who lodged a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general about communications between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not have ""direct knowledge"" about the communications — but filed a complaint anyway.

The new revelation was buried deep in a CNN report detailing the fallout over the alleged July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Trump has allegedly asked Zelensky multiple times to help Rudy Giuliani investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden.

According to CNN, the whistleblower complaint was filed on nothing more than hearsay:

The whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN. Instead, the whistleblower's concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration's determination that the complaint didn't fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.

The revelation unravels the whistleblower scandal that enveloped the president this week after the Washington Post reported, ""Trump's communications with foreign leader are part of whistleblower complaint that spurred standoff between spy chief and Congress, former officials say.""

According to the Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson determined the complaint to be of ""urgent concern,"" which meant it needed to be shared with congressional investigators.

However, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire disagreed and declined to hand it over, presumably because it was based on unconfirmed rumor.

On Saturday, Ukranian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko defended Trump.

""I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,"" he told media, Fox News reported. ""There was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bombshell-revelation-buried-deep-in-cnn-report-unravels-whistleblower-scandal-involving-president-trump,2019-09-21
The party's over for Boris Johnson: UK prime minster resigns amid scandal,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation Thursday and will step down as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister following multiple scandals and significant loss of support from members of his party. Johnson indicated that he would remain as prime minister until the Tories can elect a new leader.

In a short address delivered from the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in London, Johnson said it was ""clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader ... and therefore a new prime minister.""

He thanked voters for handing Conservatives ""the biggest Conservative majority since 1987"" in the landslide election of 2019 and said he was grateful for the accomplishments of his government, which include Brexit, managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and ""standing up to Putin"" after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Johnson said he would have preferred to remain prime minister, but that ""the herd instinct is powerful and when the herd moves, it moves.""

He was referring to the fact that dozens of Conservative ministers had resigned from his government this week, following revelations that Johnson had named Conservative MP Chris Pincher to his government even though he was aware of sexual misconduct allegations against him. Pincher resigned from Parliament last week amid new allegations that he sexually assaulted two men at a club.

Conservative lawmakers were already on the verge of breaking from Johnson after the so-called ""Partygate"" scandal — allegations that Johnson had hosted parties and other intimate gatherings at his residence during the pandemic in violation of the U.K.'s lockdown rules. Last month, Johnson faced a vote of no confidence in Parliament, but survived by winning simple majority support from Conservative lawmakers.



However, the new Pincher scandal was the straw that broke the camel's back. Beginning with Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Chancellor Rishi Sunak's resignations Wednesday morning, at least 59 of Johnson's ministers exited his government, leaving him scrambling to find enough new ministers to continue governing.

When it became clear he could not fill his government, Johnson resigned.

""In the last few days I've tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we're delivering so much, and when we have such a vast mandate, and when we're actually only a handful of points behind in the polls even in midterm after quite a few months of pretty relentless sledging,"" Johnson said.

""I regret not to have been successful in those arguments and, of course, it's painful not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,"" he continued.

Adding that no politician is indispensable, Johnson said, ""our brilliant and Darwinian system will produce another leader,"" to whom he will pledge his full support.

Brawl breaks out at Adam Schiff speech after protesters unfurl Trump 2020 flag — and it's all on video,"Video captured a brawl between supporters of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and protesters who unfurled a Trump 2020 flag during his town hall event on Saturday.

Schiff was speaking at an event organized in support of a measure to condemn the Armenian Genocide in Glendale, California.

Protesters disrupted the event as he spoke by holding up signs reading ""don't impeach!"" in reference to his efforts as a Democratic leader.

When they were asked to leave the event, they responded by chanting ""liar!"" and a brawl broke out.

The scuffle was captured on video and posted to social media:

A protester can be heard on the video yelling to Schiff, ""you will be going to jail for treason!"" as others yell back, ""get out!""



Later a man was accosted for unfurling a flag for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign and a brawl ensued over the flag.

Police helped usher the protesters out. There were no injuries from the altercation.

Schiff is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and has led Democratic efforts to investigate the president over claims of inappropriate conduct in relation to military aid slated to go to Ukraine. Democrats allege that Trump withheld the aid in order to pressure officials to investigate claims of corruption in the country against Joe Biden.

Republicans excoriate Democrats after they defeat resolution to censure Adam Schiff,"Democrats defeated a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Monday on a partisan vote of 218 to 185.

Every Democrat voted to table the measure, and all Republicans voted against tabling it. Schiff was criticized for lying about whether the Ukraine whistleblower had contact with his office, and also for falsely quoting the president during a congressional hearing.

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) criticized Schiff in a statement after the vote.

""Each member of Congress must uphold a high standard of honesty and integrity. When it comes to matters of our national security, that responsibility is even greater,"" McCarthy said.

""Chairman Schiff has fallen short in his duty,"" he continued. ""From claiming he had evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign to covering up his committee's relationship with the whistleblower, he has demonstrated a pattern of lying to the American people on matters of intelligence.""

Schiff responded in a tweet from his account.

""It will be said of House Republicans,"" tweeted Schiff. ""When they found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.""

Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley (Ill.) went to CNN to excorate Republicans and accuse them of trying to deflect from the controversies swirling around the White House.



""They don't want to talk about the President, what he did and his abuse of power,"" Quigley said.

UPDATED: White House says Russia could invade Ukraine at any time,"White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Friday that U.S. officials believe a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent, pending a decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull the trigger on war.

""We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. As we've said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it,"" Sullivan said during a White House press briefing.

The briefing was held shortly after PBS foreign affairs and defense correspondent Nick Schifrin reported that U.S. officials were certain that Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and has communicated that decision to the Russian military.

Sullivan declined to comment on the details of U.S. intelligence information.

""I do want to be clear, [an invasion] could begin during the Olympics despite a lot of speculation that it would only happen after the Olympics,"" Sullivan said. ""As we've said before, we are ready either way. We are ready to continue results-oriented diplomacy that addresses the security concerns of the United States, Russia and Europe, consistent with our values and with the principle of reciprocity. We've continued to make that clear to Russia in close coordination with our European allies and partners.



""We are also ready to respond decisively alongside those allies and partners should Russia choose to take military action,"" he added, warning that the U.S. and its western allies would impose ""severe sanctions"" against Russia in response to war.

The warning comes after Schifrin said Friday that six Western and defense officials told him the U.S. expects the invasion to begin next week.

""US officials anticipate a horrific, bloody campaign that begins with two days or aerial bombardment and electronic warfare, followed by an invasion, with the possible goal of regime change,"" Schifrin reports.

Sullivan emphasized to reporters that the U.S. government does not believe Putin has made a ""final decision.""

""I want to be crystal clear though, we are not saying that a decision has been taken, a final decision has been taken by President Putin. What we are saying is that we have a sufficient level of concern based on what we are seeing on the ground and what our intelligence analysts have picked up that we are sending this clear message,"" Sullivan said.

He warned Russia against invading Ukraine.



""If Russia proceeds, its long term power and influence will be diminished, not enhanced, by an invasion. It will face a more determined transatlantic community. It will have to make more concessions to China. It will face massive pressure on its economy and export controls that will erode its defense industrial base, and it will face a wave of condemnation from around the world,"" Sullivan said.



He also repeated President Joe Biden's warning to Americans remaining in Ukraine and Russia to flee both nations, reiterating that in the event of war there will be ""no prospect"" of a U.S. military evacuation of American citizens.

""American citizens should leave now,"" Biden said in an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt on Thursday.

“It’s not like we’re dealing with a terrorist organization. We’re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It’s a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly,” he said.

Israel's Foreign Ministry on Friday also issued a travel warning for Ukraine and announced that embassy workers and the families of Israeli diplomats stationed in the country will be evacuated in anticipation of war, the Times of Israel reports.

A senior Israeli official reportedly said that Russia has amassed enough troops on Ukraine's borders to begin an invasion at any time.

“The Russians began a military exercise in Belarus that may soon become an offensive against Ukraine,” the unnamed official told Walla news.

Russia has placed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders. Putin has publicly denied having plans to invade, but has issued warnings to western powers to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet block nations out of NATO.

Video: CNN's Brian Stelter is challenged on mainstream media bias by college student at 'Disinformation' conference,"CNN media critic Brian Stelter was confronted by a college freshman about the failures of journalism at CNN during a conference on disinformation.

Stelter dismissed the question as a ""right-wing narrative"" after taking the question from the audience at a ""Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy"" conference at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics.

The question came from a young man who identified himself as a college freshman named Chris Phillips.

""My question is for Mr. Stelter, you've all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation but CNN is right up there with them,"" said Phillips.

""They pushed the Russian collusion hoax, they pushed the Jussie Smollett hoax, they smeared Justice Kavanaugh as a racist, and they also smeared Nick Sandmann as a white supremacist, and yes, they dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop affair as pure Russian disinformation. With mainstream corporate journalists becoming little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime is it time to finally declare the canon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative?"" he asked.

""All the mistakes of mainstream media and CNN in particular seem to magically all go in one direction, are we expected to believe that this all sort of random coincidence, or is there something else behind it?"" Phillips added.

""It's too bad, it's time for lunch!"" Stelter joked to some applause from the audience.

""I think my honest answer to you, and I'll come over and talk in more detail after this, is that I think you're describing a different channel than the one that I watch. But I understand that that is a popular right wing narrative about CNN,"" replied Stelter.

""We talk about shared reality and Democracy all these networks and all these channels have to defend Democracy,"" he added. ""And when they screw up, admit it.""

He went on to point out how CNN and other news crews showed how they supported each other when they helped Fox News journalists when they were attacked during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""We don't talk about it enough though, we don't share that reality about how that happens. And with regards to the regime, I think you mean President Biden, well the last time I spoke with a Biden aide, we yelled with each other,"" Stelter continued.

""So that's the reality of the news business, the people don't see, the people don't hear, they imagine it's a situation that it simply is not, but I think your question speaks to the failure of journalism to show our work and show the reality of how our profession operates,"" he added.

""We have a lot of work to do, I think,"" Stelter concluded.

Bribery crux of impeachment proceedings against President Trump noticeably absent from impeachment articles,"Democrats announced late Monday they would file two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, one for abuse of power and another for obstructing Congress.

Noticeably absent are charges of bribery, the crux of the impeachment proceedings.

Indeed, House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry on the basis of accusations that Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, threatening to withhold U.S. aid if Ukraine did not publicly announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.

But quid pro quo's are not necessarily illegal; what is illegal, however, is bribery.

In fact, the House Judiciary Committee released a report over the weekend previewing the possibility that the committee would file impeachment articles against Trump. Included in the report was a charge of bribery.

From The Associated Press:

The report released Saturday is an update of similar reports issued during the Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton impeachments and lays out the justification for articles under consideration, including abuse of power, bribery and obstruction.



The report examines treason, bribery, serious abuse of power, betrayal of the national interest through foreign entanglements and corruption of office and elections. Democrats have been focused on an overall abuse of power article, with the possibility of breaking out a separate, related article on bribery. They are also expected to draft at least one article on obstruction of Congress, or obstruction of justice.

It is not clear why Democrats will not include bribery charges in their articles of impeachment, especially considering that the heartbeat of the impeachment proceedings are the president's alleged Ukraine dealings that allegedly included bribery in the form of a quid pro quo.

What is clear, however, is that many key witnesses in the impeachment investigation testified to Congress that they did not have direct evidence of a quid pro quo.

While the Democrats' public campaign against the president has included allegations of a quid pro quo, because there is not sufficient evidence to prove such a charge — some claim there is no evidence of a quid pro quo — bribery could not be included in the impeachment articles because they require actual legal standing of alleged wrongdoing as outlined in the Constitution.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bribery-crux-of-impeachment-proceedings-against-president-trump-noticeably-absent-from-impeachment-articles,2019-12-10
LGBTQ+ activist in Office of Nuclear Energy once defended website that sex-trafficked young boys,"A man who now has the chance to affect nuclear policy at the U.S. Department of Energy once excoriated the federal government for raiding a website that trafficked young, vulnerable boys as escorts.

In an op-ed published by the Advocate in September 2015 and unearthed by the National Pulse just this week, Sam Brinton — the new deputy assistant secretary for Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy in the Department of Energy — wrote a scathing rebuke of federal law enforcement agencies for raiding Rentboy.com, a now-defunct website that reportedly ran an illegal prostitution ring that often sold the sexual services of young boys to much older clients.

Brinton didn't see things that way, though. Back in 2015, he argued that federal agents, not the pimps at Rentboy, had thrown the lives of these young boys ""into turmoil.""

""The raid on its headquarters has thrown many gay, bisexual, and transgender young adults into turmoil as their main source of income has been ripped away due to irresponsible and archaic views of sex work,"" Brinton wrote at the time.

In addition to condemning the practice of so-called ""conversion therapy,"" Brinton argued that taking these young boys out of the care of Rentboy and returning them to their families would endanger them.

""The rent boys weren’t harming anyone. But now these young men might have to return to communities and homes which have rejected who they are. And that’s when the real danger begins.""

The colloquial term rent boy refers to young boys who are paired up with older men, likely for sexual services.

According to an indictment, Rentboy.com frequently flouted age verification processes and continued to promote advertisements for escorts whose ages could not be confirmed.

“In one case, after an escort agency failed to provide photo identification for an escort, a RENTBOY.COM employee advised the escort agency that he had deleted photographs with the face of the subject escort, but left the advertisement online and left photographs that showed only the escort’s body,” the National Pulse quoted from the indictment.

The indictment also reportedly states that former Rentboy CEO Jeffrey Hurant, who was arrested in 2015, told employees ""to apply lesser standards in doing age verification of Asia-market advertisements.""



Yet Brinton lamented back in 2015 that ""irresponsible and archaic views of sex work"" brought the company to an early demise.

Though that op-ed remained hidden when Brinton's nomination to the DOE position was announced back in January, Brinton has long been an outspoken LGBTQ+ activist working within the federal government. He has reportedly given lectures about ""kink"" on college campuses and claims membership in a Washington, D.C., drag club called the ""Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.""

Though many outlets have claimed that the Biden administration appointed Brinton to the role at the DOE, Brinton denies that assertion: ""To clarify, I am not a Biden appointee (despite what was reported) and instead serve as a career employee in the Senior Executive Service - I intend to be serving my country in this role through many many presidencies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brinton-lgbtq-child-prostitution,2022-07-05
Brit Hume exposes 'huge fallacy' in Alexander Vindman's testimony to House impeachment panel,"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was ""deeply troubled"" by what he believed were President Donald Trump's attempts to ""subvert U.S. foreign policy,"" the Washington Post reported Friday, citing Vindman's testimony given to the Democrat-led House impeachment inquiry last week.

From the Post:

[Vindman] told lawmakers that he was deeply troubled by what he interpreted as an attempt by the president to subvert U.S. foreign policy and an improper attempt to coerce a foreign government into investigating a U.S. citizen.

Vindman's testimony received widespread attention because it furthered the narrative that Trump is a rogue president determined to act out of self-interest, rather than in the interest of the American people.

But according to Fox News' Brit Hume, there is a ""huge fallacy"" in Vindman's line-of-thinking.



That fallacy, Hume went on to explain, is that Trump cannot ""subvert"" U.S. foreign policy precisely because he is the ""constitutional author of foreign policy.""

""Actually, it's the fact that the president is the constitutional author of foreign policy, so the idea he is 'subverting' it is illogical,"" Hume explained.

Indeed, as the Constitutional Rights Foundation explains, the executive branch has the most significant role in crafting U.S. foreign policy, and because the president is the head of the executive branch, the president essentially determines the direction of U.S. foreign policy while in office.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brit-hume-exposes-huge-fallacy-in-alexander-vindmans-testimony-to-house-impeachment-panel,2019-11-03
British Petroleum divests from Russian state-owned oil ventures,"The British Petroleum Company (BP) plans to sell its nearly one-fifth stake in the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft.

BP plans to liquidate its 19.75% stake in Rosneft “with immediate effect” following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sky News reported.

Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, will also resign from his role on Rosneft’s board along with another BP executive, Bub Dudley.

The chairman for BP, Helge Lund, said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

“It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue,” Lund continued, “We can no longer support BP representatives holding a role on the Rosneft board.”

He added, “The Rosneft holding is no longer aligned with BP’s business and strategy, and it is now the board’s decision to exit BP’s shareholding in Rosneft. The BP board believes these decisions are in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders.”

Russia’s economy has been in a freefall since the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine.

In response to the Russian invasion, leaders of Western nations have proceeded to implement a wide array of sanctions on the Russian economy.

The Western sanctions specifically target Russia’s financial institutions. President Joe Biden issued sanctions that target Russia’s two largest banks, Sherbank and VTB, which will make it effectively impossible for Russians to conduct transactions through the American financial system.

Biden’s sanctions restrict nearly 80% of Russia’s banking assets.

On Saturday, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement that announced their intention to remove Russia from the SWIFT telecommunication network.

Kicking Russia out of SWIFT will significantly damage the Russian economy and make long-term recovery incredibly difficult. This move will economically isolate Russia and prevent Russian businesses and banks from engaging in international transactions.

Natural gas and fossil fuel exports make up more than 80% of Russia’s GDP. Restricting Russia’s ability to sell fuel to the rest of the world will effectively cripple its economy.

The Russian ruble also continues to lose value rapidly.

To try and stabilize the cratering Russian economy, the Russian central bank said that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market and expand the list of securities that it is willing to accept as collateral.

Russia’s removal from SWIFT will put the Russian central bank in a tight bind as it will not be able to freely manipulate Russian monetary policy to offset inflation and the economic impact of Western sanctions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-petroleum-divests-from-russian-state-owned-oil-ventures,2022-02-27
British prime minister front-runner ‘ready’ to push nuclear button,"Liz Truss, Britain’s Foreign Secretary and front-runner to become the nation’s next prime minister, said she would be ""ready"" to use the U.K.'s nuclear arsenal if she was to become prime minister.

Truss was speaking at a debate (known in the U.K. as a “husting”) hosted by Times Radio’s John Pienaar. Pienaar asked Truss how she would react if she were put in a situation where she had to consider activating the UK’s nuclear arsenal.

Pienaar laid out the scenario: ""Your orders to our Trident boat captain on whether you, prime minister Liz Truss, is giving the order to unleash nuclear weapons. It would mean global annihilation. I won't ask you if you would press the button, you'll say yes, but faced with that task I would feel physically sick.""

""How does that thought make you feel?"" Pienaar asked.

Truss replied, “I think it’s an important duty of the prime minister and I’m ready to do that,” adding, “I’m ready to do that.”

Truss’ response was met with applause from the live audience. Rishi Sunak, Truss’ opponent, reportedly was not asked the same question at the debate.

The issue of nuclear war has become more pressing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

Truss has taken a hardline position against Russia. “I will go further as prime minister by doing everything possible – including declassifying more intelligence – to expose Putin’s playbook to the world,” Truss wrote in the Daily Telegraph. She added, “My government will use intelligence strategically to reveal the Kremlin’s attempts to undermine and destabilize freedom-loving democracies.”

The U.K. first developed and tested nuclear weapons in 1952, making it the third nuclear country (after the U.S. and Soviet Union.) It is one of five officially recognized nuclear states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Nuclear weapons have been used twice in warfare — in the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. About 13,400 nuclear weapons reportedly remain today. There have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted since the original Trinity test in 1945, according to the United Nations.

"American basketball star Brittney Griner pleads guilty to drug charges in Russia, faces up to 10 years in prison","Brittney Griner — an American basketball star busted in February after Russian authorities said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage — on Thursday pleaded guilty to drug charges in Moscow, NBC News reported.

Griner faces up to 10 years in prison, the network added.

What are the details?

Her lawyer, Alexander Boikov, said following the hearing that Griner admitted the vape canisters found at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport were hers but that she brought them to Russia unintentionally, NBC News noted.

Griner's other lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, said they hoped for leniency, the network reported, adding that Griner’s next hearing is scheduled for next Thursday.

NBC News said it wasn't in the courtroom when Griner spoke.

Griner's arrest happened just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, the network said, adding that the Kremlin is accused of using Griner as a political pawn. The Biden administration insisted Griner has been “wrongfully detained,"" NBC News said, adding that Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Griner was being held hostage.

'I'm terrified I might be here forever'

Earlier this week Griner, 31, wrote an emotional letter to President Joe Biden, pleading with him to bring her home, the network said.

Griner's handwritten letter was delivered Monday morning to the White House, the Griner family told CBS News, adding that she wrote, ""I'm terrified I might be here forever. On the 4th of July, our family normally honors the service of those who fought for our freedom, including my father who is a Vietnam War Veteran. It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate this day because freedom means something completely different to me this year.""

The White House said Biden read Griner's letter, CBS News noted in a separate report. Biden reassured Griner’s wife that he was trying to secure her release as quickly as possible, NBC News added.

Anything else?

WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in April that Griner was in an “unimaginable” situation amid her detention in Russia.

""She continues to have our full support,"" Engelbert said at the time. ""Certainly, we’re trying everything we can, every angle, working with her legal representation, her agent, elected leaders, the administration. Just everybody in our ecosystem to try and find ways to get her home safely and as quickly as we can.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brittney-griner-pleads-guilty-russia,2022-07-07
"Brutal new poll reveals '5-alarm fire' for Democrats as GOP gains significantly among black, Hispanic voters","A new Wall Street Journal poll released Friday depicts what is being described as a ""5-alarm fire for the Democratic Party.""

The poll of 1,500 registered voters showed that a majority of voters (57%) disapprove of President Joe Biden's job performance, while 63% of registered voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and 65% of voters believe the economy is headed in the wrong direction.

Those are horrible numbers for the Democratic Party, which exercises the most political control in Washington. The sentiments also underscore the uphill battle Democrats face if they want to retain that control after the 2022 midterm elections.

In fact, a majority of respondents in the Journal poll overwhelmingly believe that Biden — the head of the Democratic Party — is not focused on the right issues, and disapprove of his handling of the economy, inflation, the border crisis, immigration, and crime. They also agreed that Biden is not a strong leader.

Compounding problems, the poll found that more registered voters are likely to vote for Republicans than Democrats (46% to 41%) in the upcoming election. Thus, they believe the Republican Party is the antidote to the problems that Biden and Democrats have failed to fix.

Despite all of those problems, it somehow gets even worse for Democrats: Republicans are making significant inroads among Hispanic and black voters.

In fact, since the last Journal poll in November, Republicans have gained nine percentage points among Hispanic voters, while Democrats lost 21 points among black voters. In the November survey, 56% of black voters said they favor voting for a Democrat in 2022. Now, just 35% say they favor Democrats. Support for Republicans among black voters, then, rose a whopping 12 points from the November survey to 27% today, the Journal reported.

Philip Klein, writing at National Review, summarized the reality of the poll: ""It’s fair to say that if these numbers are anywhere close to the actual results, Democrats will be massacred in November.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brutal-new-poll-reveals-5-alarm-fire-for-democrats-as-gop-gains-significantly-among-black-hispanic-voters,2022-03-11
Pro-free-speech Christian rapper Bryson Gray permanently suspended from Twitter,"Christian conservative rapper Bryson Gray has been permanently banned from Twitter, after previously remarking that Elon Musk's takeover of the platform was generally a good move for free speech.

Gray is no stranger to either bans or controversy, having had songs removed from Apple Music as well as Spotify and YouTube within the last two years, specifically for ""medical misinformation"" in at least one instance.

The reason for the Twitter suspension is not immediately clear, even to Gray; Twitter did not did not reply to a request for comments on the situation.



""I think I got banned because I called Elton John gay, which would be weird for obvious reasons,"" Gray told Blaze Media.

""Elon Musk censors speech more than the old Twitter. That's an objective truth that people look over because he allowed a few people back on Twitter,"" the rapper continued.

Gray is referring to the new Twitter policy under Musk, which still allows for ""shadow-banning"" on certain posts deemed to be hateful, ""deboosting"" and ""demonetizing"" them, according to the owner.

""New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach. Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.

Buttigieg says there's no 'dial in the Oval Office' to lower gas prices,"Gas prices reached another record high on Monday while the Biden administration continues to deny any responsibility for rising costs.



The national average price per gallon of regular gas was $4.87 Monday, a new record high according to the American Automobile Association. Gas prices jumped 25 cents from last week's average of $4.62, and rose nearly 60 cents over the past month.

Industry analysts have predicted that gas could reach an average of $5 per gallon this summer, as Americans hit the road for vacations and demand for fuel surges, per CBS News.



But Biden's officials insist there's little the president can do to lower the cost of filling up your car.



Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday there's no ""dial"" in the White House that sets the price of gas.

He told ABC News' ""This Week"" that the president's decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ""helped to stabilize global oil prices.""

Buttigieg added that Biden's decision to suspend the Environmental Protection Agency's summertime ban on 15% ethanol gas could help lower prices. Permitting oil and gas companies to use 15% ethanol blends instead of the usual 10% should lower prices because there's less crude oil in the blend. But energy experts have warned the impact on prices could be minimal, according to the New York Times.

""We know that the price of gasoline is not set by a dial in the Oval Office,"" Buttigieg said, before asserting greedy oil companies were to blame for high prices.



""When an oil company is deciding, hour by hour, how much to charge you for a gallon of gas, they're not calling the administration to ask what they should do. They're doing it based on their goal on maximizing their profits,"" he said.

“It’s been very striking right now to see these oil companies, who have become almost ridiculously profitable, and you hear these oil executives on the record talking about how they’re not going to increase production,” Buttigieg continued.

“Why would they? They’re doing great right now, That’s why the president has called it a use it or lose it policy where, if you’re sitting on these thousands of permits and you’re not doing anything with them, then you’re going to be held accountable for them. So far, Congressional Republicans have blocked action to do something like that, but we think that’s another step that would make a difference.”

Buttigieg repeated an old assertion from the White House that oil and gas companies are not using their drilling permits. Industry experts have previously said this accusation is a ""red herring;"" that Biden officials were ignoring how the process actually works and that energy companies need to discover whether there is actually oil and gas where they've obtained leases before they can start to drill. They also have to obtain permits to drill, a process that could take years.

Oil and gas industry representatives have also accused the Biden administration of double talk on energy production. On the one hand, Buttigieg and other officials insist companies are not doing enough to increase production. On the other, the Biden administration is canceling the sale of some oil and gas leases and increasing regulations and fees on others, which undermines production.

High gas prices are a consequence of supply and demand. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, there's more demand for gas because people are starting to travel again. At the same time there's restricted supply on multiple fronts — lingering supply chain issues from the pandemic, production that was shut down and hasn't restarted yet, and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine that has interrupted international oil and gas exports, to name a few



It's true that many of these factors are outside of Biden's control, but the president has responded by trying to make deals with anti-American regimes in oil-producing nations like Iran and Venezuela instead of ramping up domestic supply. Biden will travel to Saudi Arabia this summer to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite pledging to turn the country into an international ""pariah"" for the assassination of a prominent dissident and journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.



While Republicans and oil executives have demanded that Biden open up more federal lands for drilling and decrease regulations so Canada can build more pipelines to the U.S., Democrats and environmentalists have opposed these measures because they would contribute to global warming.

Buzzfeed says leaked audio recording shows Iran knew immediately that it shot down a Ukrainian plane,"Buzzfeed News' Christopher Miller said Monday that a snippet of leaked audio suggests that Iran knew immediately that it shot down a Ukrainian Boeing 737 in early January.

The massive crash took the lives of 176 people. The airplane had just taken off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport.

What are the details?

According to the outlet, the leaked audio footage features a conversation between an Iranian pilot on an incoming flight and an Iranian air traffic controller.

Buzzfeed's Miller reported that because of the interaction between the pilot and the air traffic controller, authorities in Tehran likely knew immediately that an Iranian missile had struck a Ukrainian passenger jet.

""If air traffic control was aware of something as hazardous as a missile being fired, it's likely to have notified government officials straightaway,"" Miller wrote.

Miller reported that the audio, which was broadcast on Sunday evening on a Ukrainian television channel, featured the exchange between the pilot and air traffic control. He also noted that the transmission ""has been acknowledged as genuine"" by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as Hassan Rezaeifar, head of the Iranian investigation team.

Rezaeifar, according to Miller, said Iran would cut cooperation with Ukraine ""due to the conversation being published.""

""This file was among the materials provided to a group of experts who are investigating the disaster. [Its publication] by the Ukrainian side suggests that we will not transfer any materials to them anymore,"" Rezaeifar reportedly said.

A partial transcript follows:

Pilot: ""There's a flare on the route, like something from a missile. Should anything like this be happening there?""



Controller: ""Zone 320? How many miles away? Where?""



Pilot: ""Can't say for sure. But I think it is near (airfield) Payam, (city) Karaj.""



Tower: ""How many miles? Where?""



Pilot: ""I now see the light as it flies off of there.""



Tower: ""We were not informed of this.""



Tower: ""How does it look like? What does this light look like?""



Pilot: ""That's definitely a flash from a missile.""



Tower: ""It's not flying toward the city (Tehran), is it?""



Pilot: ""It might be. Oh, no it was flying from the direction of the city.""



Tower: ""We were informed of nothing, but keep watching.""



What else?



Iran initially claimed that the flight crashed due to technical issues with the plane.



Later, however, Tehran admitted that its Revolutionary Guard inadvertently fired on the airliner because it believed the plane was incoming U.S. cruise missiles instead. Tehran was on high alert at the time, as Iran had only just hours prior launched missile strikes on U.S. troops stationed in Iraq. The missile strikes were in retaliation for the U.S.-sanctioned killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

Following the crash, Reuters reported flames from the wreckage were ""so heavy"" no rescue was possible. Rescue measures included 26 ambulances and a helicopter.

"Texas AG Ken Paxton, Parkland dad demand more school security in wake of Texas massacre: ‘Armed guard, single point of entry, teacher training’","In the aftermath of a horrific school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday that left 19 elementary-aged students and three adults dead, some — including a father who lost his teenage daughter in a separate school shooting — are calling on the government to ramp up school security.

Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow died during a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, issued a plea for enhanced security measures and funding at schools across the country Tuesday evening.

""Armed guard, single point of entry, teacher training,"" he wrote in a tweet, adding, ""We send out $Billions to other countries all the time. Why not fund school safety in America?""

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) made similar remarks during an interview with Fox News on Tuesday.

""Look, we just spent $40 billion on Ukraine to help protect another nation,"" Paxton said. ""It seems like the least we could do is fund a police officer or at least a program because obviously there are thousands and thousands of schools in this country.""

""A program that trains people in the school, so that when this does happen, because it will happen again, we know what's going to happen. So if we know what's going to happen, let's do everything we can to prevent it from turning into the situation we just had yesterday,"" he added.

Others, including conservative political commentator Dana Loesch, lamented the lack of serious investigation following the tragic shooting.

""Not a single politician is asking: 1) How did this murderer get into the school? 2) What security did this school have and how can we protect schools like we protect our concerts, banks, museums? 3) WHERE WERE HIS PARENTS AND THE ADULTS IN HIS LIFE? 4) How did he buy a handgun? 5) Did he pass a background check? 6) No one in his house saw what was going on?"" she tweeted.

After shooting and critically wounding his grandmother, troubled 18-year-old Salvador Ramos entered Robb Elementary School late Tuesday morning wearing a tactical vest and brandishing at least one firearm.

According to CNN, Ramos was engaged by police but was able to flee and get inside the school, where he barricaded himself inside a classroom and started shooting. All of the children killed in the attack were inside that classroom.

The Austin American-Statesman added that authorities said Ramos overpowered a school officer on his way into the building, though that claim has not appeared in reports from other outlets.

""The shooter was able to make entry into a classroom, barricaded himself inside that classroom, and again just began shooting numerous children and teachers that were in that classroom, having no regard for human life. Just a completely evil person,"" Lt. Christopher Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety told NBC's TODAY on Wednesday.

""[He] just began shooting anyone that was in his way. At that point we had a tactical law enforcement team arrive — made up of multiple federal officers, local officers, as well as state troopers — that were able to able to make forcible entry into that classroom. They were met with gunfire as well but they were able to shoot and kill that suspect,"" Olivarez added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/calls-for-school-security-funding-after-texas-shooting,2022-05-25
Canada buying 88 American F-35 stealth fighters amid rising tensions with China and Russia,"Canada has finalized a deal to purchase 88 F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States, despite a 2015 campaign promise by then-Liberal candidate Justin Trudeau to scrap the Conservatives' F-35 fighter jet program.

This deal makes America's NORAD partner and NATO ally the last of the F-35 program's original eight partners to embrace the fifth-generation fighter, reported CNN. Canada previously invested over $600 million into the aircraft's development as part of the program.

What are the details?

The Canadian government announced on Monday that it would be procuring 88 F-35 fighter jets through an agreement with the U.S. government, Lockheed Martin, and American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.

According to the National Post, the mandatory delivery criteria agreed upon by Lockheed Martin stipulates ""the 9th fully mission capable future fighter platform will be delivered no earlier than 1 December 2025 and no later than 1 December 2027.""

The deal is valued at roughly $14.2 billion USD or $19 billion CAD, constituting the Canada's largest investment in its air force in thirty years. Canadian defense firms have reportedly earned over $1.4 billion in contracts to build F-35 parts.

CTV News noted that the cost of purchasing and operating the jets over the course of the aircraft's projected 40-year lifespan may run Canadian taxpayers around $52 billion.

The first four jets are expected to be delivered in 2026, followed by an additional six in 2027, six more in 2028, and the remainder by 2032, thereby phasing out the Royal Canadian Air Force's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet aircraft.



""The F-35 is a modern, reliable, and agile fighter aircraft used by our closest allies in missions across the globe. It is the most advanced fighter on the market, and it is the right aircraft for Canada,"" the National Defence Department said in a statement.

The RCAF indicated that this acquisition is a ""positive step forward"" that will enable it to ""enforce Canada's sovereignty as outlined in Canada's Defence Policy and meet Canada's NORAD and NATO commitments for decades to come.""



Canada, like other American allies, has been growing increasingly wary about the threat of Chinese aggression, extra to the reality of Russian hostility.

Canada's Defence Minister Anita Anand provided geopolitical context for the purchase, writing, ""As our world grows darker, with Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable attack on Ukraine, and China’s increasingly assertive behavior in the Indo-Pacific, this project has taken on heightened significance – especially given the importance of interoperability with our allies.""



According to the U.S. State Department, American defense arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country. Additionally, U.S. and Canadian military forces cooperate on continental defense within the framework of NORAD, the world's only binational military command.

In part due to this interoperability, Canada's aging air force and waning military capabilities have been cause for American concern in recent years. Former President Donald Trump called Canada ""slightly delinquent"" in 2019 for failing to live up to NATO's target for spending on defense.

The Toronto Star reported that former President Barack Obama similarly made an issue of Canadian's defense capabilities.

In 2021, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, David Cohen, underscored the need for ""Canada's policies [to] reflect its words in terms of the treatment of China,"" adding that the northern nation and the U.S. had to improve their collaboration in taking on ""the existential threat that is China.""

Canada, which was not brought into AUKUS, a defense alliance composed of the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, may also have been spurred by President Joe Biden's suggestion to former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the ""United States has no closer or more reliable ally than Australia — our nations have been together for a long time.""

Although it is unclear whether Canada will eventually join AUKUS, which Trudeau claimed was about nuclear submarines, the acquisition of the new F-35s will enable the Canadian military to more seamlessly operate alongside its allies, reported CTV News.

The purchase of the F-35s represents a significant about-face for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who criticized the previous Conservative government for considering the acquisition back when the Canadian-U.S. exchange rate was far more favorable.



Trudeau castigated the Conservatives for ""cling[ing] to an aircraft [the F-35] that does not work and is far from working.""

He told reporters in 2015, ""The Conservative government never actually justified or explained why they felt Canada needed a fifth-generation fighter. They just talked about it like it was obvious. It was obvious, as we saw through the entire process, that they were particularly, and some might say unreasonably or unhealthily, attached to the F-35 aircraft.""

Conservative defense critic James Bezan said with regards to Trudeau's change of heart, ""This is a situation where he originally said he would never buy the F-35 and did everything in his power to stop it from actually happening, but at the end of the day, this is the only modern fighter jet that can deliver the capabilities Canada so desperately needs.""

""And so here we are today, where Justin Trudeau has to eat crow and do what's right for Canada, do what's right for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and do it right for our NORAD and NATO allies,"" added Bezan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/canada-buying-88-american-f-35-stealth-fighters-amidst-rising-tensions-with-china-and-russia,2023-01-10
"Catholic bishop knows just how to respond when Hillary Clinton compares America to Afghanistan, Iran over abortion rights","A Catholic bishop from Texas sharply rebuked Hillary Clinton after she compared women suffering from systematic persecution and war to American women who cannot get abortion on demand.

What did Clinton say?

Clinton claimed at a women's rights summit last Thursday that American women, in light of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, face similar peril as women in Iran, Afghanistan, Ukraine.

""We have come a long way... on so many fronts, but we are also in a period of time where there is a lot of pushback and much of the progress that has been taken for granted by too many people is under attack. Literally under attack in places like Iran or Afghanistan or Ukraine — where rape is a tactic of war — or under attack by political and cultural forces in a country like our own when it comes to women's health care and bodily autonomy,"" Clinton said.





The twice-failed presidential candidate went so far as to claim America is just like Afghanistan or Sudan, two war-torn nations, because of the status of women's rights.

""It’s so shocking to think that in any way we’re related to poor Afghanistan and Sudan,"" she said, Fox News reported. ""But as an advanced economy, as we allegedly are, on this measure, we unfortunately are rightly put with them.""

""This struggle is between autocracy and democracy, from our country to places we can’t even believe we’re being compared to,"" Clinton added.



What was the response?

Bishop Joseph Strickland, who presides over the Diocese of Tyler in Texas, responded to Clinton's comments by calling her an ""evil woman.""

""Please, please don’t listen to this evil woman,"" Strickland said. ""Her lies and immorality need to be silenced for the good of humanity.""

The Catholic bishop is no stranger to using his platform to criticize politicians for espousing ideas antithetical to Christian ethics.

"At least 2,000 cattle die amid dangerous heat wave","At least 2,000 cattle have died in recent days due to a heat wave baking Kansas, NBC News has reported.

What are the details?

Kansas, the third-largest cattle-producing state in the country, took a hit this week after high temperatures and humidity caused the cattle to die from heat-related distress.

A spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said that the cattle deaths were also attributed to the lack of grain supply brought on by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. According to Reuters report, Ukraine is one of the leading exporters of corn worldwide.

According to the report, the death toll estimate has come from facilities and farms that reached out to the agency for help in disposing of livestock carcasses, which may indicate that the final tally may be greater than 2,000.

Temperatures soared to at least 108 degrees in areas of Kansas this week, and meteorologists say that temperatures could climb to over 110 over the weekend. Over the last 30 days, the national drought tracker released at least twostatements warning that regions of Kansas are facing drought or extreme drought conditions.

Agricultural meteorologist Drew Lerner told Reuters that the coming days will be ""oppressively hot and stressful for the animals.""

CNBC quoted Brenda Masek, president of the industry association Nebraska Cattlemen, who said that ranchers need to be on their A-game in order to help cattle survive the oppressive summer heat.

“You can’t say, ‘Oh I checked them three days ago,’” Masek said. “When it gets hot, you’ve got be to out every day and making sure that their water is maintained.”

The Post added that the price of livestock has significantly risen across the country and pointed to a recent study that noted overall production in the U.S. is expected to decline 6.8% before the next century.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cattle-die-heat-wave,2022-06-16
Charlamagne tha God shocks panel when he praises 'genius' Ron DeSantis for exposing Dem 'hypocrisy' on immigration,"Charlamagne tha God called Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) a ""genius"" last Thursday for exposing the hypocrisy of Democrats on immigration.

Speaking on his Comedy Central show ""Hell of a Week,"" Charlamagne tha God praised DeSantis for exposing the double standard of sanctimonious Democrats outraged over Republican governors transporting migrants to sanctuary cities.

""For months, Republican governors have sent busloads of illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities like New York, D.C., and Chicago, with the message of, 'If you like them so much, they’re yours, OK?'"" Charlamagne began. ""Well, just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis upped the game by sending two planefuls of immigrants to the East Coast, elites’ favorite vacation island, Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

""I personally think it’s genius,"" he declared.

According to Charlamagne, Republicans governors are forcing Democrats to prove they do not want immigrants in their communities despite posturing as migrant sanctuaries.

""But I wish that governors like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott would give Democratic governors and mayors more of a heads-up, because then, that would expose the hypocrisy of the Democrats, which is they don’t want immigrants here, either,"" he said.

Charlamagne & His Panelists Debate About DeSantis Flying Migrants to Martha's Vineyard www.youtube.com

Charlamagne's panel — consisting of Angela Rye, Malcolm Gladwell, and Roy Wood Jr. — actually made salient points themselves.

Wood, for instance, pointed out that sanctuary cities, which are mostly run by Democrats, are the ""same cities that ship out their homeless people to the outside counties.""

""A lot of these Democratic cities, 'Oh, we love people, oh we love people. Hey homeless man, get your a** out of here.' They deliberately hide people already. So a lot of these Democrats that are complaining about the Republicans are running something similar within their own counties,"" Wood said.

Rye, meanwhile, asked why the U.S. government repeatedly sends billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight its war against Russia while the border crisis and migrant crisis rage on stateside.

""Why can't we use those same resources to figure out what to do with immigrant populations here?"" she asked.

Rye, however, claimed that Republican governors are sending migrants out of their states because they have brown skin (which isn't always true; Hispanic people are born with every tone of skin color, from white to dark brown).

For Rye's claim to be true, she would have to explain why Martha's Vineyard immediately expelled the migrants to Cape Cod.

After all, more than 89% of residents in Duke County, which mostly consists of Martha's Vineyard, are white, according to U.S. Census data. It sure seems like the inverse of Rye's claim is true.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/charlamagne-tha-god-desantis-genius,2022-09-20
China is expected to increase military spending in 2022,"China is expected to increase spending on its defense budget in 2022.

The Global Times, a tabloid newspaper owned and operated by the Chinese Communist Party, said, “Ahead of China's announcement of its defense budget for 2022, analysts and observers predict that the country will likely continue to steadily increase its military expenditure, at a rate possibly slightly faster than last year.”

“China enjoys a positive economic development but faces security threats,” the global times continued, “The two factors provide a foundation and need for China to further develop its national defense capabilities to safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and rightful interest.”

Military experts believe that the Chinese defense budget could grow by as much as 7 percent.

Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, said, “China will likely continue to expand its military expenditure this year, as the defense spending should be closely related to the development of the national economy.”

China has made single-digit increases to its annual defense budget every year since 2016. In 2021, China’s GDP expanded by 8.1 percent marking the fastest growth in the Chinese economy in almost a decade.

“While the economy has been affected by COVID-19, China did well with epidemic prevention and control, and is enjoying a relative healthy economy,” Fu added, “So, it is likely that China will spend more on national defense.”

Many in the West expect China to invade the island nation of Taiwan in the near future. In fact, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it clear that it is a matter of “when” and not “if” China makes a move on Taiwan.

Chinese leaders have even said that if the United States comes to the aid of Taiwan and affirms the nation’s independence it could lead to military conflict between America and China.

In a recent interview with NPR, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, said, ‘If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.”

Xi Jinping recently reached out to his counterpart in North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, and called for the two communist countries to come to a “common understanding” as they work to build supportive and friendly relations under “a new situation.”

The increasingly likelihood of Chinese aggression in Asia has prompted Japan to break with its post-WWII pacifistic tendencies and reconsider its approach to national defense.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe suggested that Japan house nuclear weapons on behalf of the United States as a preemptive defensive measure against China.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-is-expected-to-increase-military-spending,2022-03-06
Chinese officials scramble to find ways to insulate China's economy from Western sanctions as tensions with Taiwan grow,"Stoking fears that China is preparing for an invasion of Taiwan, Chinese officials are looking for ways to defend their country from economic isolation should Western nations opt to sanction China in a similar fashion to how they sanctioned Russia after it invaded Ukraine.

The Daily Mail reported that China’s economic regulators held emergency meetings in late April with officials from the Chinese central bank, the finance ministry, domestic banks operating in China, and international leaders in the financial sectors like HSBC.

In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Western nations locked arms and issued thorough sanctions on the Russian economy. These sanctions caused the Russian economy to plummet and prompted drastic retaliatory threats from the Russian government.

These Western sanctions greatly restricted Russia’s ability to conduct business with other nations by limiting its use of the SWIFT telecommunications network and making it virtually impossible for it to conduct business with the global reserve currency – the U.S. dollar.

The crippling effect these sanctions have had on the Russian economy prompted the emergency meeting between Chinese officials and financial executives. Chinese President Xi Jinping has been startled by the dollar freeze and is concerned about a similar policy being leveraged against China.

Reportedly, the U.S. is considering implementing similar packages of sanctions against China in the event that it moves forward with an invasion of Taiwan. Recent and repeated rhetoric from Chinese leadership indicates that it is not a matter of “if” but a matter of “when” China launches an invasion of Taiwan.

A source close to the Chinese officials who met said, “No one site could think of a good solution to the problem. China’s banking system isn’t prepared for a freeze of its dollar assets or exclusion from the Swift messaging system as the US has done to Russia.”

Reportedly, one idea proposed in the meeting was to force Chinese businesses that export to other nations to part ways with their holdings in U.S. dollars in exchange for Chinese renminbi.

Other proposed solutions such as swamping U.S. dollar holdings to favor the Euro were not thought to be practical.

Some of the Chinese leaders present doubted whether the U.S. even has the capacity to issue such sanctions on China’s economy.

Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong, said, “It is difficult for the U.S. to impose massive sanctions against China. It is like mutually assured destruction in a nuclear war.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-taiwan-usa-sanctions,2022-05-02
China threatens US: There will be 'military conflict' if Biden supports Taiwanese independence,"In what could be read as either a warning or a threat, China's ambassador to the United States said Thursday there will be ""military conflict"" between the U.S. and China should the island nation of Taiwan attempt to become fully independent from Xi Jinping's communist regime.

In an interview with NPR, ambassador Qin Gang asserted that Taiwan is ""walking down the road toward independence"" and said, ""If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.""

While Russian aggression on Ukraine's borders may precipitate war in Eastern Europe, China is taking increasingly aggressive action toward Taiwan under President Joe Biden's watch. Days ago, Chinese warplanes flew through Taiwan's southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone in what was the largest incursion on Taiwanese territory since last October, when China few 38 planes, including bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, through the ADIZ.



The People's Republic of China has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, which is the last foothold of the old pre-communist Chinese government and a democracy. Last year, dictator Xi pledged to ""reunify"" Taiwan with mainland China and ""smash"" any attempts by the island nation to achieve independence from the PRC.



The United States has traditionally supported Taiwan's right to be free of ""force or threat"" from the PRC. President Barack Obama's administration sold $1.83 billion worth of arms to the Taiwanese military in 2015, which was opposed by the PRC. As a candidate for president, Joe Biden said that the U.S. has a ""commitment"" to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. But since assuming office and talking with Xi, Biden has backed down and said the future of Taiwan is in the country's own hands.

""We are not encouraging independence,"" Biden said in November.

Though Biden has made noncommittal statements about Taiwan, Qin said the region's status remains ""the biggest tinderbox"" in U.S.-Chinese relations. He denied that China wants to pursue war to take control of Taiwan.

""People on both sides of Taiwan Straits are Chinese, so we are compatriots. So the last thing we should do is to fight with compatriots. And we will do our utmost in the greatest sincerity to achieve a peaceful reunification,"" Qin said. ""But ... that Taiwanese authority is working down the road towards independence, emboldened by the United States. So China will not commit to giving up the un-peaceful means for reunification because this is a deterrence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-threatens-us-there-will-be-military-conflict-if-biden-supports-taiwanese-independence,2022-01-28
China threatens war if US interferes with possible Taiwan invasion,"China's defense minister threatened all-out war while discussing Taiwan's independence during a meeting between top Chinese and American military officials. The threats were made on Friday during the first face-to-face meeting of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe.

""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will definitely not hesitate to start a war no matter the cost,"" warned China’s defense spokesman Wu Qian – who was quoting General Wei.

The saber-rattling continued as the Chinese defense minister declared that Beijing would ""smash to smithereens"" any effort to maintain Taiwan's independence. The ministry vowed that Taiwan would be made part of China for the ""unification of the motherland.""

During the 30-minute summit at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Wei ""stressed that Taiwan is China's Taiwan... Using Taiwan to contain China will never prevail.""

Qian said the meeting was a ""good start"" to resuming normal military dialogue, and both countries agreed to continue communicating.

Austin pointed out there has been a ""steady increase in provocative and destabilizing military activity near Taiwan.""

Austin called on China ""to refrain from further destabilizing actions toward Taiwan.""

""We remain focused on maintaining peace, stability and the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,"" Austin proclaimed. ""But the PRC's moves threaten to undermine security, and stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.""

Austin hinted at a parallel with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating that the indefensible assault on a peaceful neighbor has galvanized the world and ... has reminded us all of the dangers of undercutting an international order rooted in rules and respect.”

Austin added, ""Rules-based international order matters just as much in the Indo-Pacific as it does in Europe.""

""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is what happens when oppressors trample the rules that protect us all,"" Austin said. ""It's what happens when big powers decide that their imperial appetites matter more than the rights of their peaceful neighbors. And it’s a preview of a possible world of chaos and turmoil that none of us would want to live in.""

Austin said the U.S. is committed to ""assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.""

The Pentagon released a statement regarding the meeting.



""Secretary Austin discussed the need to responsibly manage competition and maintain open lines of communication,"" the statement said. ""The Secretary underscored the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue on improving crisis communications and reducing strategic risk.""



""Secretary Austin discussed global and regional security issues, including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" the Pentagon stated.

Austin told his counterpart that the United States ""remains committed to our longstanding one-China policy.""

The Center for Strategic and International Studies defines the one-China policy as: ""The United States recognizes the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China but only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China. Thus, the United States maintains formal relations with the PRC and has unofficial relations with Taiwan.""

Last month, President Joe Biden broke away from the strategic ambiguity of whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan against an invasion by China.

When asked if the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily if the CCP invaded, President Biden said, ""Yes... that's the commitment we made. The idea that it [Taiwan] can be taken by force... is just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine.""

The Taipei Times reported this week that Beijing estimates that the Chinese military will be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.



""China has over the past few years stationed an increasing number of warships along its southeastern coast, as it is seeking to maintain its military advantage in the region and attempting to build a system of intelligence warfare by 2027,"" the report said. ""By 2027, China is expected to possess regional air defense capabilities, and long-range sea and airstrike systems, which would greatly extend its combat range, following the introduction of its aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong, a second-generation Type 003 vessel, as well as the mass production of Type 055 destroyers, Y-20 tanker aircraft, and J-20 fighters.""

Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, and Taiwan has been self-governed ever since. China claims that Taiwan is a breakaway province.

CCP leader Xi Jinping has vowed to reclaim Taiwan.

""No one should underestimate the Chinese people's staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Xi said last year. ""The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-war-us-taiwan-invasion,2022-06-11
China's ambassador to Israel found dead at home,"China's ambassador to Israel, Du Wei, has been found dead on Sunday at his home in a coastal suburb north of Tel Aviv, officials said. No cause of death was provided, and Israeli police said it was investigating.

Israeli news organizations reported that there were no signs of violence or foul play. ""As part of the regular procedure, police units are at the scene,"" a spokesman said.



Unidentified emergency medical officials said initial indications show that Du died in his sleep of natural causes, according to Israel's Channel 12 TV.



Chinese officials have yet to comment on the ambassador's death.

Du was living in Herzliya, about six miles north of Tel Aviv.



Wei became ambassador to Israel in February, and previously served as envoy to Ukraine. Du arrived in Israel on Feb. 15 and immediately had to self-quarantine for 14 days because of coronavirus precautions.

In a message published on the embassy's website just weeks after his appointment as ambassador, Du praised the relations between ""the second largest economy in the world and Israel the start-up nation.""



The friendly exchanges between Chinese and Jewish peoples date back to one thousand years ago. Our two peoples admired and supported each other, leaving us with numerous touching stories. Over the recent years, the people-to-people exchanges between China and Israel have been growing on a fast track, which injected new vitality to the tree of friendship between our peoples. The Chinese Embassy in Israel is committed to promoting friendship and cooperation between our two countries.

Du's death comes two days after the Chinese embassy in Israel condemned comments made by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who accused China of hiding information about the coronavirus outbreak.



""Currently, the United States is the epicenter of the pandemic, But, the current situation in the US is not caused by China, rather the inaction of a few American politicians who missed the window of opportunity to bring the virus under control. From this perspective, the tragedy in the US is not only a natural disaster but also a result of mismanagement,"" the embassy told the Jerusalem Post.

"Report: Chinese communists operating covert police operations in the US, Canada, and Europe","Chinese communist agents are reportedly conducting extralegal and clandestine policing operations across the globe to intimidate and hunt down persons wanted by Beijing. The United States, Canada, and Europe are among the countries home to the CCP ""police service stations"" involved in this work.

According to a new report, these police stations, while purportedly created to combat fraud, are a means to extend the genocidal communist regime's influence and powers of ""transnational repression."" This confirms the acceleration of a well-documented trend of the communist power infringing upon the ""rights and freedoms of overseas Chinese and minority communities in exile.""

Parallel policing mechanisms

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" detailing how the communist Chinese regime has employed ""overseas police service stations"" on five continents.

On January 22, Liu Rongyan, director of the Overseas Chinese Police Office of the Public Security Bureau in Fuzhou City, announced that the ""first batch"" of 30 overseas police services in 25 cities across 21 countries had been opened. There are now reportedly 54 such CCP-backed centers.



There are allegedly one station in New York, three in Toronto, and dozens across Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

Whereas China contends that these stations serve expats in the capacity of micro-consulates, aiding with administrative tasks (e.g., filing police reports or renewing drivers' licenses), Safeguard Defenders indicated that the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law.

""These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate international law,"" said the report. Furthermore, they may ""violate the territorial integrity of third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods.""

The development of these centers occurred alongside the CCP's campaign to intimidate and extort Chinese nationals and expats to return to China to face criminal proceedings. Between April 2021 and July 2022, communist authorities claimed 230,000 nationals were ""persuaded to return.""

Safeguard Defenders identified two methods frequently used to prompt nationals to return.

First, CCP agents track down a target's family in China ""in order to pressure them through means of intimidation, harassment, detention or imprisonment into persuading their family members to return 'voluntarily'.""

Second, CCP agents or proxies are dispatched to threaten and harass the target into returning ""voluntarily.""

For proxies and willing co-conspirators, Freedom House reported last year that communist officials rely upon ""a broader framework of influence that encompasses cultural associations, diaspora groups, and in some cases, organized crime networks.""

The Safeguard Defenders report stressed that these methods and the stations that may provide support to their executors leave ""legal Chinese residents abroad fully exposed to extra-legal targeting by the Chinese police, with little to none of the protection theoretically ensured under both national and international law.""

Chinese authorities claim that the hundreds of thousands of people persuaded to return to China were suspected of fraud and telecom fraud; however, there have been recent indications that such intimidation campaigns have been utilized against political dissidents, religious minorities, and refugees fleeing communist oppression.

Growing infrastructure of repression

Pastor Pan Yongguan and 61 Christian congregants belonging to the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church fled China in 2019, seeking refugee from communist persecution. Yongguan's family, who remained in China were penalized as a result of his actions.

Pressure was similarly applied to other congregants' families (e.g., a newborn's legal status was denied by authorities), with the expectation that the expats would return to face charges of treason and ""collusion with foreign forces.""

Although Yongguan suggested CCP agents were stalking him in Thailand, he has not yet been captured. Other targets of the CCP who fled to countries with closer Chinese ties were, however, quickly apprehended.

For instance, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

A 2021 Freedom House report stated, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

It may be expedient for the communists to accuse those in these groups instead of fraud, the alleged focus of their foreign police service stations.

Regardless of the accusation, the tactics utilized are the same, ranging from ""direct attacks like renditions, to co-opting other countries to detain and render exiles, to mobility controls, to threats from a distance like digital threats, spyware, and coercion by proxy.""

American operations

While New York City may be the only known American location of a CCP police service station administered by the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau, there is nevertheless a great deal of communist interference and intimidation nationwide.

In September 2020, NYPD officer and U.S. Army reservist Baimadajie Angwang (of Tibetan descent) was allegedly conscripted by Chinese officials to spy on the Tibetan community in New York City on behalf of the communist regime. He was charged with acting as an illegal agent of the CCP as well as committing wire fraud, making false statements, and obstructing an official proceeding.



In October 2020, eight illegal Chinese agents were charged for surveilling, locating, and intimidating targets of the CCP. They intended to coerce their targets back to China, where ""they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials.""

On July 7, five men including one current and one former Department of Homeland Security agent, Craig Miller and Derrick Taylor, were indicted for crimes related to a communist Chinese transnational repression scheme to silence critics of the regime.

On September 26, a Chinese national, 31-year-old Ji Chaoqun, was found guilty of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government. The former U.S. Army reservist had informed on individuals targeted for recruitment to the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security. These individuals included other Chinese nationals operating as engineers and scientists in the U.S.

Governments looking the other way

The Globe and Mail reported that one of the three CCP stations allegedly operating in Toronto was the office belonging to the Canada Toronto FuQing Business Association. This association was reportedly ""established 'under the guidance' of a number of Chinese and Fujianese government organizations, including a municipal committee of the United Front Work Department, the body that projects the Chinese Communist Party's influence overseas.""

It remains unclear whether these alleged communist police service stations operate ""with the imprimatur or even knowledge of the host government.""

Camille Boily-Lavoie, a spokesman for the RCMP, told the Globe that the federal police force was aware that ""foreign states may seek to intimidate or harm communities or individuals within Canada.""

According to the National Post, dissidents targeted by the CCP have long warned Canadian authorities of organized harassment by communist agents.

Canadian critics of the CCP's genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been targeted by CCP proxies in harassment campaigns.

Cherie Wong, for instance, faced rape and death threats from communist activists in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Wong indicated that critics of the CCP and its murderous policies can expect their family members back in China to get a threatening ""tea visit"" from Chinese officials.

Chinese dissident Shen Xue, who moved to Canada fleeing communist persecution, was allegedly threatened by CCP agents in Toronto. ""I thought that I escaped from the fear,"" she said. ""But I realized that they are here, their people, their network, their power, and everything is here.""

In light of a cabinet letter, the House of Commons is reportedly ""aware that foreign states, including the People's Republic of China or its proxies, may attempt to harass, threaten and intimidate Canadians, persons residing in Canada or their families, in Canada or abroad.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who publicly stated that he admired China's ""basic dictatorship,"" was warned last year by Canada's spy agency that the communist Chinese interference campaigns ""have become normalized.""

The Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China called the Trudeau government's response to communist interference and influence campaigns weak and ""piecemeal at best, and, more often, unsatisfactory and ineffective at identifying and addressing the sources of these violations.""

The group stated that ""many individuals fear that Chinese government or consular agents are monitoring their speech or their activities. ... Chinese state actors have almost certainly become emboldened by the inadequate responses of Canadian officials.""

Charles Burton, a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, called the presence of the CCP police stations in Toronto ""an outrage.""

""Chinese police setting up offices in Canada, then 'persuading' alleged criminals to return to the motherland to face 'justice' — while our own government and security services apparently choose to look the other way — represents a gross violation of Canada's national sovereignty, international law and the norms of diplomacy,"" he wrote.

Burton added, ""China is extending the grip of its Orwellian police state into this country.""

It's not just Canada that has permitted CCP agents to put up shop.

According to the Italian publication Il Foglio, there is a ""Fuzhou Overseas Police Station"" in the Tuscan city of Prato. Some Chinese expats reportedly use the station as an alternative to a legitimate Italian court, much like the Sharia law courts that operate extralegally in Britain.

The communist-linked police station is reportedly ""not of particular concern"" to the real Italian police because it ""only deals with administrative practices and not public security.""

According to the Safeguard Defenders report, there are communist Chinese-linked police stations in the following British, European, and Balkan countries: The Netherlands; Ireland; Portugal; Czech Republic; Hungary; Italy; France; Germany; Slovakia; Austria; Ukraine; Serbia; Sweden; Spain; Scotland; England; and Greece.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-communists-operating-covert-police-operations-in-the-us-canada-and-europe,2022-09-30
Ice cream from China tests positive for coronavirus,"Ice cream in China has been contaminated with COVID-19, according to a new report. During recent routine government testing, three samples from the ice cream manufacturer tested positive for coronavirus.

The tainted ice cream was produced by the Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company, a frozen dessert business located in north China's Tianjin Municipality.

All of the products produced by the Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company ""have been sealed and contained after the samples it sent to the municipal center for disease control this week tested positive for coronavirus,"" Sky News reported.

""Most of the 29,000 cartons in the batch had yet to be sold, the government said,"" according to The Associated Press. ""It said 390 sold in Tianjin were being tracked down and authorities elsewhere were notified of sales to their areas.""

Chinese officials suspect that 4,836 boxes of the ice cream may have been contaminated, of which 2,089 boxes had been sealed away in storage.

""A total of 935 boxes of the ice cream, out of 2,747 boxes that entered the market, were in Tianjin and only 65 were sold to markets,"" according to Sky News.

The Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company's 1,662 employees have been ordered to quarantine and underwent nucleic acid testing on Thursday.

There were no indications that anyone contracted coronavirus from the ice cream.

The ingredients of the tainted treats include milk powder imported from New Zealand and whey powder from Ukraine.

Dr. Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, told Sky News that the coronavirus was able to survive because of the cold temperature and the fat in the ice cream.

Griffin said there is likely no reason for alarm, ""We probably don't need to panic that every bit of ice cream is suddenly going to be contaminated with coronavirus.""

""It's likely this has come from a person, and without knowing the details, I think this is probably a one-off,"" he added.

""Of course, any level of contamination is not acceptable and always a cause for concern, but the chances are that this is the result of an issue with the production plant and potentially down to hygiene at the factory,"" Griffin said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, ""Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming food is associated with COVID-19.""

""Coronaviruses, like the one that causes COVID-19, are thought to spread mostly person-to-person through respiratory droplets when someone coughs, sneezes, or talks,"" the CDC explained.

""It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or food packaging, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,"" the CDC added. ""However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated, ""Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19. Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects.""



""If you are concerned about contamination of food or food packaging, wash your hands after handling food packaging, after removing food from the packaging, before you prepare food for eating and before you eat,"" the FDA advised.

The agency recommended to frequently clean and disinfect surfaces, especially food preparation areas.

On Friday, the U.S. State Department revealed that it had new evidence that suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic originated from a virology lab in Wuhan, China.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-ice-cream-tests-positive-for-covid-19,2021-01-17
GOP lawmaker dresses down Congress for ramming through $40B aid package despite having just hours to read it,"Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) dressed down the House of Representatives on Tuesday for voting on a massive aid package to Ukraine without giving lawmakers ample time to read the bill.

What did Roy say?

Speaking on the House floor, Roy rebuked lawmakers for rushing to pass the aid package despite only having hours to review it before voting.

""We got a $40 billion bill at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I haven't had a chance to review the bill. My staff was poring over the pages trying to see what's in it,"" Roy began.

""You want to talk about the institution? You want to talk about standing up alongside Ukraine? Why don't we actually have a debate on the floor of the people's house instead of the garbage of getting a $40 billion bill at 3 o'clock in the afternoon — not paid for, without any idea of what's really in it, with a massive slush fund that goes to the State Department: $13 billion dollars, $8 billion to the economic support fund, $110 million for embassy security,"" he continued.

Instead of passing yet another aid package for Ukraine, Roy said lawmakers' time would be better spent addressing issues hurting Americans.

""We've got $40 billion that is unpaid for and you want to sit here and lecture this body about what we're going to do or not do about standing alongside Ukraine? Why don't we talk about the American people who are hurting?"" he said. ""The wide-open borders, the inflation that's killing people, the jobs that people can't get because the cost of goods and services in this country.""

Roy concluded his speech by moving for an adjournment, which did not happen. Democrats, instead, charged that approving the aid package was necessary to demonstrate American solidarity with Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even appeared to quote the Bible when she argued for the necessity of the aid package.

Ultimately, the House passed the aid package by a vote of 368 to 57. Only Republican lawmakers voted against the package.

The Senate is expected to vote on the bill later this week. If it passes, that means Congress will have approved more than $50 billion in aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion nearly three months ago. In March, Congress approved a $13.6 billion aid package.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chip-roy-ukraine-aid-package,2022-05-11
Chris Christie for impeaching Trump for Capitol insurrection,"Chris Christie believes that President Donald Trump deserves to be impeached and removed from office for his actions leading up to the riot at the U.S. Capitol building last Wednesday.

While appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" Christie said Trump's actions were an ""impeachable offense,"" and urged Republicans to ""vote their conscience.""

When asked by host George Stephanopoulos if he had a vote in Congress if he'd impeach the president, Christie responded, ""If I think it's an impeachable offense, that's exactly what I would do.""



""But I'm not in there,"" Christie said. ""If you want my opinion, that's my opinion.""

""I think if inciting to insurrection isn't [an impeachable offense], I don't really know what it is,"" Christie told Stephanopoulos.

""We had an incitement to riot at the United States Capitol,"" Christie, a former U.S. attorney, said. ""We had people killed, and to me there's not a whole lot of question here.""



""Listen, I think they're going to have to vote their conscience and look at what happened,"" Christie said of Republicans in Congress.

""What I've heard from fellow Republicans is that they've had enough and that the president's conduct quite frankly since [the riot] has gotten them upset,"" Christie said.

Christie pointed out that the Democrats' impeachment over the president's phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tarnished their credibility. ""I will say to that the Democrats, by what they did earlier on Ukraine, have kind of cheapened this a little bit too,"" Christie said.

Christie had been one of Trump's closest political allies dating back to the 2016 presidential campaign, and as recently as September when the former Republican governor of New Jersey helped Trump prepare for a presidential debate against Joe Biden.



Christie joins other Republicans who have considered Trump to be impeached over his actions leading to the storming of the Capitol building, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse.

Also on Sunday, former Republican California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger blamed Trump for the violence at the Capitol, and said he ""will go down in history as the worst president ever.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-christie-trump-impeachment-capitol,2021-01-10
CNN's Chris Cuomo accidentally validates Trump's claim about Ukraine phone call on live TV,"CNN host Chris Cuomo attempted during a live broadcast to disprove a claim made by President Donald Trump about a phone call that has become a focus of the impeachment inquiry, but appeared to validate that the president was indeed correct.

David Holmes, a political counselor at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, has testified about a phone call between President Trump and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland on July 26 while Sondland, Holmes, and other embassy staffers were eating lunch at a restaurant in Ukraine.

Holmes testified that he overheard both sides of the phone call — both what Sondland was saying, and what the president was saying over the phone, even though the call was reportedly not on speakerphone. Holmes testified that the president was speaking so loudly that he overheard him asking Sondland about ""investigations"" Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky had agreed to.

President Trump tweeted that it would not be possible for Holmes to hear him speaking to Sondland if the call was not on speakerphone.

""I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life,"" Trump wrote. ""My hearing is, and has been, great. Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I've even tried, but to no avail. Try it live!""

Cuomo took the president up on his offer Thursday and called his mother on air to test whether she could be heard by others while she was not on speakerphone. As it turned out, she couldn't, and the stunt supported President Trump's assertion.

""Very interesting theory from our president,"" Cuomo said. ""He's never been able to hear a phone call when it wasn't on speakerphone — from anybody. So let's just play with that for a second.""

MSNBC's Chris Hayes gets torched for suggesting the US turn to Iran for help to relieve gas crisis,"MSNBC host Chris Hayes got lambasted on social media for suggesting that the U.S. alleviate the skyrocketing price of gas by turning to the Iranian regime for help.

Hayes linked to a proposal to buy gas from Iran in response to increased prices as caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as from growing inflation.

""If you’re a) devoted to cutting off Russia’s oil revenues and b) worried about inflation and spiking oil prices, this is one possible solution…,"" Hayes Tweeted.

Critics excoriated Hayes and the suggestion to seek oil from one murderous regime in response to the military aggression of another murderous regime.

""Actually, giving billions to American-murdering terrorists is a really bad idea,"" responded Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

""Oh great, give our money to Iran instead of Russia. Much better than revamping domestic production,"" read one popular tweet.

""Maybe start producing more of our own oil and gas? You know, like we were doing until Joe happened?"" said another critic.

""Or, you know, we could just let Americans make lots of money producing it domestically instead of funding a terror state,"" another user offered sarcastically.

""Buying oil from Russia and Iran after cutting our own supplies is the act of an imbecile or a traitor. There is no logic to any Democrat environmental idea,"" responded another detractor.

""Funding terror to end terror?"" asked Ian Haworth.

Others pointed out that Hayes had been against the Keystone XL pipeline in 2014, which could have relieved some of the lack of oil supply.

The Biden administration had blamed inflation on everything from supply chain issues related to the pandemic to the ""greed"" of ""meat conglomerates."" The pain of high inflation has been cited among the many causes of the very low favorability rating for President Joe Biden ahead of the midterm elections.

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy admits to meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. His explanation raises more questions than answers.,"Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), hoping to quell speculation of wrongdoing, has formally responded to reports that he held a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Ziraf last week. But his explanation may raise more questions than it answers.

What's the background?

The Federalist first reported Monday that Murphy and other Democratic senators held a ""secret"" meeting with Zarif last week at the annual Munich Security Conference. The news immediately began to circulate in the media and led to speculation as to whether Murphy had undermined U.S. foreign policy or even potentially violated the Logan Act by holding the meeting.

The Logan Act is a federal law that forbids unauthorized American citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in a dispute with the United States.

Tuesday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commented on the reports, seeming to scold Murphy and his Democratic colleagues for meeting with Zarif, who, Pompeo noted, is ""the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27"" and ""is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world's largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.""

""If they met, I don't know what they said. I hope they were reinforcing America's foreign policy and not their own,"" Pompeo added.

What is Sen. Murphy saying?

Murphy had not commented on the news until late Tuesday morning when he published a behind-the-scenes account of his trip on Medium, along with additional thoughts in a brief Twitter thread.

In the senator's account, he said that he has ""no delusions about Iran"" and even characterizes Iran as an ""enemy"" and ""adversary"" of the United States. But he adds: ""Discussions and negotiations are a way to ease tensions and reduce the chances for crisis,"" before concluding that ""Trump, of course, has no such interests.""

Then Murphy confirmed that the meeting happened and commented at length about its subject matter:

I plan to meet Zarif Saturday night in his hotel suite, and I have several goals for the meeting. First, I want to gauge whether he thinks the reprisals for the Soleimani assassination are over, and I want to make sure it is 100 percent clear to him that if any groups in Iraq that are affiliated with Iran attack the United States' forces in Iraq, this will be perceived as an unacceptable escalation. Zarif may not have control over Iran's military decisions, but he is the country's chief diplomat and I want him to know that our government is united on this point.



Second, I want his help in Yemen. I tell him that I know it is not a coincidence that the recent uptick in attacks from Iranian-aligned Houthis in Yemen started right after the Soleimani killing. I tell him that Iran shouldn't let the Houthis waste an opportunity for peace. Of course, he predictably tells me that it's the Saudis, not the Houthis, that are holding up progress on peace talks ...



... Lastly, I raise the issue of American prisoners held in Iran. He is ready for this inquiry — he already knows how much I care about releasing innocent Americans from custody — and we spend a few minutes discussing how the situation could be resolved.

A regular reading of Murphy's account could plausibly characterize the conversation as a negotiation. In a follow-up tweet, Murphy used words like ""urged,"" ""pressed,"" and ""pushed"" in describing his stance toward Zarif at the meeting.

""Congress is a co-equal branch to the executive. We set foreign policy too,"" he added in the Twitter thread, before acknowledging that ""no one in Congress can negotiate with Zarif or carry official U.S. government messages.""

In a concluding statement about the meeting in his account on Medium, Murphy seems to backpedal a bit, saying he's ""just a rank and file U.S. Senator.""

I don't know whether my visit with Zarif will make a difference. I'm not the President or the Secretary of State — I'm just a rank and file U.S. Senator. I cannot conduct diplomacy on behalf of the whole of the U.S. government, and I don't pretend to be in a position to do so. But if Trump isn't going to talk to Iran, then someone should. And Congress is a co-equal branch of government, responsible along with the Executive for setting foreign policy. A lack of dialogue leaves nations guessing about their enemy's intentions, and guessing wrong can lead to catastrophic mistakes.

Yet, one potentially troublesome line from the statement is Murphy's assertion that ""if Trump isn't going to talk to Iran, then someone should.""

Anything else?

Perhaps none of this would be a problem had Murphy been more forthright about the meeting and his motivations for holding it before it took place. TheBlaze reached out to Sen. Murphy's office, requesting comments regarding allegations that the meeting was conducted in secret and that it potentially violated federal law.

In an email response, the senator's communications director, Lia Albini, directed us to the Medium publication and Twitter thread cited above, but did not address the specific requests for comment.

So, in a follow-up email, TheBlaze pressed again for specific responses to whether the meeting was intended to be secretive and if the senator had thoughts about allegations that he violated the Logan Act. In addition, TheBlaze sought to know if other congressional colleagues were present with Murphy at the meeting.

"Feminist Chrissy Teigen, George Conway call GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik 'trash'","Chrissy Teigen, feminist activist and supermodel, joined George Conway in calling Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) ""trash"" on social media.

Conway, who is known for his hatred of President Donald Trump despite being married to Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, circulated a fake photo of Stefanik flipping off cameras during the impeachment hearing Friday and took to Twitter to call the GOP representative a liar.

""[Elise Stefanik] is lying trash,"" Conway posted to Twitter, urging people to donate to her Democratic challenger Tedra Cobb.

Conway was upset by Stefanik's claim that House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) denied her attempts to ask former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch questions during the House impeachment inquiry hearing Friday.

While video recording of the hearing shows Schiff stymieing ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes' (R-Calif.) efforts to yield Stefanik the balance of his time, Schiff was within his rights to do so under House rules governing the hearing.

If Stefanik, by being outspoken and persistent in her complaint, was attempting to rile up Trump critics — it worked.

Stefanik responded in a tweet of her own: ""And for you [George Conway] — the one thing I've NEVER been called in my life is TRASH. You need serious help. My opponent Taxin' Tedra can have your sick misogynist support.""



Teigen then jumped into the feud by adding in response to Stefanik: ""Really? I've called you trash before.""

Teigen, who is married to Grammy award-winning singer John Legend, is an outspoken feminist and ardent Trump detractor.



In April, the couple spoke at a three-day policy retreat for House Democrats, where they made their feelings known about the Trump presidency, his Twitter habits, and how women should conduct themselves in society.

During a panel event, when asked what women should say more, Teigen replied ""F*** you"" to laughter in the room.

What jumpstarted all of this?

Stefanik has been vocal in calling out Rep. Schiff's ""regime of secrecy"" during the Democrats' impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

""This was Adam Schiff's first opportunity in front of the public; these hearings have been conducted in a basement bunker, part of his regime of secrecy,"" Stefanik said following the Wednesday hearing, the Daily Wire reported. ""And this was an abject failure for the Democrats and Adam Schiff.""

The GOP congresswoman was also effective in her questioning of witnesses during the impeachment inquiry's public hearings last week.

On Friday, she pressed the issue while questioning Yovanovitch, eventually getting Yovanovitch to admit that she was prepped on how to answer questions regarding Hunter Biden and his involvement with Burisma by the Obama administration before her Senate confirmation hearings.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chrissy-teigen-george-conway-elise-stefanik-trash,2019-11-18
"Christine Blasey Ford gets ACLU 'courage' award, complains of 'well-financed attack machine' out to get her 'anytime I raise my head'","Christine Blasey Ford was given the American Civil Liberties Union's Roger Baldwin Courage Award Sunday night in Los Angeles, KCBS-TV reported, adding that her appearance was a surprise and that she was recognized for her testimony during Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination process in 2018.

Ford — who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers over 30 years ago — told the adoring crowd that ""when I came forward last September, I did not feel courageous. I was simply doing my duty as a citizen, providing information to the Senate that I believed would be relevant to the Supreme Court nomination process. I thought anyone in my position of course would do the same thing.""

It's worth noting that Debra Katz — Ford's attorney as she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee — said her client was partially motivated to come forward because of her opposition to Kavanaugh's stance on abortion.

'I was not prepared for the venom'

After bringing up the ""example of Anita Hill"" — who accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his 1991 nomination process — Ford recounted at length what she endured as a result of her testimony:

I understood that not everyone would welcome my information, and I was prepared for a variety of outcomes, including being dismissed. I was not prepared for the venom, the persistent attacks, the vilification, the loss of personal privacy, and the collateral damage to my friends and my family. I was not prepared to be physically threatened or to be forced out of our home for over three months. I have learned a lot over the past year. I have learned that there's a well-financed attack machine out there ready to flood the Internet and the media anytime I raise my head. And I know it's not gonna go away. I've also continued to learn that the ethical promise to sexual assault survivors to do no further harm is easily ignored by journalists who selectively abstract meaningless details that are twisted and weaponized against me. And although I underestimated the pain, I also underestimated the love and the support that I have received.

Ford also invoked former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and ""all the brave men and women"" who ""come forward to tell the truth.""

Yovanovitch — who testified against President Donald Trump as part of House impeachment hearings — admitted the Obama administration prepped her on how to answer questions regarding Hunter Biden and his involvement with Burisma prior to her Senate confirmation hearings. It's also been alleged that Yovanovitch lied under oath during her closed-door testimony with House impeachment investigators on Oct. 11.

Ford also mentioned former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick — a previous winner of the ACLU courage award who's known for kneeling in protest during the national anthem. Kaepernick was ripped by rapper Jay-Z and the NFL over the weekend after his last-minute scrapping of a scheduled workout in conjunction with the league and then holding his own workout at an Atlanta high school over an hour away from the previously agreed upon site.

Christine Blasey Ford urges Americans to believe Trump critic and impeachment witness Ambassador Yovanovitch,"Christine Blasey Ford — who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year of sexual assaulting her when they were teenagers — has come out urging Americans to stand up for impeachment witness and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose testimony was critical of President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

Blasey Ford made the call for support of Ambassador Yovanovitch while accepting a ""courage"" award from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, who honored the professor ""for her brave testimony before Congress last year.""

After speaking about her experience in the spotlight during and since she testified at the contentious nomination hearings of Justice Kavanaugh, Blasey Ford told her audience, ""It's not just survivors that we have to stand up for. It's all of those who come forward to support our country.""

Singling out the former diplomat, Blasey Ford said, ""Ambassador Yovanovitch — all of the men and women who bravely come forward — they come forward to tell the truth, and to help our country. They might also be vilified, and they need to hear our voices of support, also.""

Blasey Ford did not elaborate on the details of Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony to the House — which lasted several hours — but her comments to the progressive crowd were met with cheering and applause.

Politico described part of Yovanovitch's testimony to Congress as ""a top-to-bottom rebuke of the president, his associates, and his foreign policy.""

Yovanovitch accused the Trump administration of terminating from her position as ambassador earlier this year ""without cause,"" a claim President Trump adamantly denied. The president took to Twitter to say her performance in the role was unsatisfactory and that ""the new Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky] spoke unfavorably about her.""

You can watch Blasey Ford's acceptance speech in its entirety below. Her comment about Yovanovitch begins around the 14:20 mark:

"MSNBC’s Chuck Todd dismisses Americans’ economic woes under Biden, blames 'right-wing echo chamber'","MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd this week expressed shock and frustration at recent polling showing the majority of Americans are unsatisfied with the economy under President Joe Biden, calling the negative public opinion a result of ""right-wing echo chamber"" lies.

In a stunning dismissal of the Americans hurt by historic inflation levels and a supply chain crises under the Biden administration, the liberal media figure suggested that Americans simply ""don't feel first-world enough"" and should go live in another country before they criticize the president.

What did he say?

""Fifty-one percent believe the economy is in a recession or depression. I mean, look, it's just not true,"" Todd exclaimed during a panel segment on ""MTP Daily"" Tuesday, posted by Real Clear Politics.

Todd was citing a USA Today and Suffolk University poll conducted in February. Displayed alongside it onscreen was another recent poll published by the Washington Post and ABC News that returned similar findings; namely, that a whopping 75% of Americans felt the economy is ""not so good"" or ""poor.""



""This economy is frustrating,"" he continued. ""This economy with COVID has been — 'I've got money and I can't find something' — but my God, there's jobs. There's good jobs.""

""Is this the right-wing echo chamber is better than the Democratic echo chamber problem?"" he asked guest Jennifer Palmieri. ""Or is there something else missing?""

Palmieri, a former Obama White House communications director, responded by agreeing with Todd's assertion and claiming that liberals don't just repeat what they've been told like conservatives do. She went on to add that Americans' gripes about the economy are just a feeling, not reality.

""That’s the real issue. They don’t feel secure about that right now,"" Todd declared.

What else?

At that point, Republican strategist Matt Gorman entered the discussion to suggest that negative responses to the economy over the last year are ""broader"" than economic measurements. He said people are feeling the squeeze when they go to restaurants without adequate staffing or to grocery stores that are void of product.

""We don't feel first-world enough,"" Todd jumped back in to say as if the real issue had just dawned on him.

""I want to tell people, 'Go live in another country,' and realize we have it pretty good here,"" he added.

Todd's complaints are unlikely to change anyone's perception of the economy, however, as skyrocketing inflation hit a 40-year high last month and the country continues to grapple with supply chain issues and staffing shortages. That's not to mention the pain Americans will likely feel at the gas pump over the coming days and weeks amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Report: Clandestine CIA program prepared Ukrainian troops for war with Russia,"In the months leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden's administration pulled covert Central Intelligence Agency personnel out of the country, including war-zone-hardened agency paramilitaries. The CIA operatives had been there since 2014, training Ukrainian forces in modern warfare tactics, a report from Yahoo News revealed.

Although Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine 36 days ago, the Kremlin's forces have so far been unable to capture the capital of Kyiv or crush the Ukrainian military. The most conservative U.S. estimates believe that more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in less than three weeks of fighting, and Ukraine's military claims to have killed at least three Russian generals.

According to half a dozen former intelligence officials who spoke to Yahoo News, the CIA's training is what has helped Ukrainian forces stymie the Russian advance.

After Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, the U.S. military operated a publicly acknowledged training program for Ukrainian troops in the western part of the country, far from the front lines of a civil war with pro-Russian separatists in the east. But at the same time, the CIA reportedly developed a covert training program on the eastern front in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces were directly fighting Russia-backed troops and possibly even Russian soldiers.



The covert CIA training program operated under existing authorities for the CIA and did not require new authorization, according to Yahoo News. CIA paramilitaries trained Ukrainian troops in sniper techniques; taught them how to operate Javelin anti-tank missiles and other equipment; showed them how to evade Russian surveillance; and gave them training to draw out Russian and insurgent forces from their positions, Yahoo News reported.

Former U.S. officials involved with the program believe the training was effective. “I think we’re seeing a big impact from snipers. Especially as Russian forces get bogged down from lack of supplies,” one former senior official said. “I think the training really paid off.”

Yahoo News previously reported in January that the CIA had conducted a secret U.S.-based training program for Ukrainian special operations. The outlet also said that CIA paramilitaries had traveled to eastern Ukraine to assist Kyiv's forces there, but the CIA had denied their programs were offensively oriented.

“The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence,” a senior intelligence official said in January.

That statement now appears to be false.

According to Yahoo News, the CIA paramilitaries sent to Ukraine were given a twofold mission. First, they were ordered to determine how best to train Ukrainian special operations forces to fight the Russian military and separatist forces in the Donbas region. Second, the CIA operatives were told to determine the ""backbone"" of the Ukrainians and assess their willingness and ability to fight.

Former officials acknowledged to Yahoo News that the program carried serious risks. ""Everything we did in Ukraine had a chance to be misinterpreted, and escalate the tensions,” one former official said. The CIA reportedly wanted to avoid a direct conflict with the Russians that could result in a war. Accordingly, the number of personnel initially sent to Ukraine was limited to the ""low single digits,"" Yahoo News reported. They were directed to advise and train, but were instructed not to take part in combat.

However, after President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017, the new administration raised concerns that the CIA's Ukraine mission ""might be too far-ranging,"" according to a former national security official.

“How far can you go with existing covert action authorities?” the official recalled asking. ""If, God forbid, they’ve shot some Russians, is that a problem? Do you need special authorities for that?”

Though the Trump White House was mindful of the risks, the program continued through his presidency and into the Biden administration. It wasn't until it became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin intended to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine that President Biden pulled all CIA personnel out of the country, Yahoo News reported.

Biden's administration was ""terrified of even clandestine folks being on the frontline"" of Ukraine's war with Russia, a former official said.

"Climate alarmist Greta Thunberg's 'arrest' at anti-labor protest exposed as media stunt, widely ridiculed","Images of climate alarmist Greta Thunberg's supposed arrest by German police circulated widely after the Tuesday incident, prompting some to contemplate her apparent bravery in the face of statist force.

Raw footage of the incident and additional scrutiny have together revealed that the 20-year-old Swedish activist, like her actor father, has a knack for the theatrical. Not only was Thunberg's arrest reportedly staged, it wasn't an arrest at all.

What's the background?

Climate alarmists flocked to a condemned western German village Tuesday for an anti-labor protest, denouncing a job-creating coal mine expansion.

Hamstrung by domestic anti-oil policies and unable to count on renewables, Europe ended up overly reliant on Russian energy. As Russia began to cut off the continent during its war on Ukraine, countries like Germany — which previously obtained roughly 30% of its supply from Russia — were forced to return to using coal.

While climate alarmism had a hand in driving Germany's desperate need for coal, Thunberg and others nevertheless voiced their opposition to the demolition of the abandoned village of Luetzerath, required for the expansion of the Garzweiler 2 mine.

Though condemned and owned by the mine, Luetzerath has recently become an ecosocialist squat for leftist militants and climate extremists.

Leftist extremists from the condemned village can be seen here attacking journalists:

Police, who had been trying to prevent protesters from getting injured in the open-pit mine, were reportedly pelted with incendiary devices. Over 70 officers were injured.

Climate alarmists and other anti-labor protesters also reportedly damaged police patrol cars.

Reuters initially reported that Greta Thunberg, who had trespassed to as far as the edge of the mine, had been arrested.

Police told Reuters that ""Greta Thunberg was part of a group of activists who rushed towards the ledge [of the mine]. However, she was then stopped and carried by us with this group out of the immediate danger area to establish their identity.""

After police rescued the dramatist's daughter, Thunberg was reportedly ""held by one arm at a spot further away from the edge of the mine where she was previously sat with the group.""

Thunberg, ostensibly wearing a jacket and bag made with petroleum products, told the Associated Press that ""what everyone does matters. ... And if one of the largest polluters, like Germany, and one of the biggest historical emitters of CO2 is doing something like this, then of course it affects more or less everyone — especially those most bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.""

Some of Thunberg's fans saw the initial images, apparently believing that she had been arrested doing something that mattered.

NASA climate scientist Peter Kalmus tweeted, ""Greta's first arrest. It's time for many more of us to stand up and risk arrest for the sake of a livable planet. It will turn the tide.""

Climate activist Mike Hudema tweeted with similar urgency, ""Greta Thunberg has been detained in Germany for protesting the expantion [sic] of a coal mine despite the government claiming it will exit coal by 2030. The coal expansion betrays 'present and future generations.' There is no time to wait.""

Frown for the cameras



The Guardian reported that, contrary to previous claims, Thunberg was briefly detained, not arrested.

The Hill noted that Thunberg, who had been trespassing, was simply escorted along with other climate alarmists away from the coal mine site on private property.

Snopes all but conceded it was nothing more than a photo op, writing that ""activists often plan such sit-ins and protests as media events to publicize their cause, in full knowledge that police and media will be present — which is to say that they are, in a sense, 'staged.'""

A video has emerged of Thunberg chuckling away with her supposed captors.

The footage shows Thunberg and her police escorts striking different poses for the cameramen and videographers in their orbit, laughing sporadically.

After the photo op, the police escorted the Swedish trespasser off the private property.

Sky News host Chris Kenny said the photo op was ""Just farcical, isn’t it? Deceptive too – it’s theatre, climate theatre, and most media just goes along with the charade.""



Townhall editor Guy Benson noted that Thunberg's photo op with German police had the ""Same energy"" as when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) pretended to be handcuffed when being escorted from a pro-abortion protest at the U.S. Capitol.

At the time of the incident, Thunberg said, ""Germany is really embarrassing itself right now. ... I think it’s absolutely absurd that this is happening the year 2023.""

Rep. Jamaal Bowman claims 'A Global Green New Deal ... would really address this oil crisis with Russia'; former California Gov. Jerry Brown says 'climate is like war',"As Russia invades Ukraine and Americans are hammered with high gas prices, Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York is pushing for a ""Global Green New Deal"" and former California governor Jerry Brown is claiming that people will die if climate change goes unaddressed.

""A Global Green New Deal is what would really address this oil crisis with Russia - and prevent future ones. It’s time we mobilize for real energy security, climate safety, and peace,"" Bowman tweeted.



The website bowmanforcongress.com indicates that this agenda would entail slashing U.S. military spending.

""Global Green New Deal: We must promote trade that grows and empowers labor and foreign policy and moves us toward 100% clean and renewable energy abroad,"" the website declares. ""The US military is the biggest polluter on the planet so decreasing our military spending will go a long way toward saving the planet. I believe the climate crisis is an opportunity to finally discard our weapons and fear of each other to come together and save the planet.""

In an effort to squeeze Russia, President Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday which prohibits importing Russian oil and other products into the U.S. — the list of banned products includes, ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products,"" according to the order.

The move, which comes as Ukrainians strive to defend their country against a Russian invasion, will likely lead to even higher gas prices for Americans.

But while Ukrainians bravely fight an actual war, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who served four terms in office — including from 1975 to 1983 and from 2011 to 2019 — told the Associated Press last week that ""climate is like war.""

""It's true that the Russians are earning money from oil and gas, but to compound that problem by accelerating oil and gas in America would go against the climate goals, and climate is like war: If we don’t handle it, people are going to die and they’re going to be suffering. Not immediately, but over time,"" Brown said, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-change-oil-russia-ukraine-green-new-deal,2022-03-08
"Climate protesters throw tomato soup at famous van Gogh painting, glue themselves to wall","Two climate activists were arrested Friday after throwing tomato soup at a famous Vincent van Gogh painting and gluing themselves to the wall at the National Gallery in London.

The female protesters belong to a group called Just Stop Oil, a coalition of climate alarmists demanding that the U.K. government halt all new oil and gas projects. They entered room 43 in the National Gallery, in which van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" is displayed, at approximately 11 a.m. local time and threw the contents of two cans of Heinz tomato soup over the painting.

""What is worth more, art or life? Is it worth more than food? Worth more than justice? Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people? The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis. Fuel is unaffordable to millions of cold, hungry families. They can't even afford to heat a tin of soup,"" one of the activists said, according to video of the protest filmed by Just Stop Oil activists.

London Metropolitan Police said the protesters were arrested for criminal damage and aggravated trespass. Specialist officers were sent to the scene to unglue them, and they were taken into custody to a central London police station.

There was some minor damage to the frame, but the $80 million painting was unharmed, police said.

Van Gogh paintings that are displayed in museums are kept behind protective glass to shield them from light, touching, or vandalism.

Just Stop Oil said that the National Gallery protest followed ""two weeks of continued civil resistance"" by the group ""in response to the government's inaction on both the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis.""

Earlier this month, the U.K. North Sea Transition Authority, an agency in charge of oil and gas reserves in the North Sea, began awarding new licenses for companies conducting underwater fossil fuel exploration, CNBC News reported.

The government had paused the issuance of new licenses in 2020 for a ""climate compatibility check,"" but Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss recently announced the process would resume.



""This is not a one day event. This is an act of resistance against a criminal government and their genocidal death project,"" Just Stop Oil said. ""Our supporters will be returning – today, tomorrow and the next day – and the next day after that – and every day until our demand is met: no new oil and gas in the U.K.""

The group in recent weeks has disrupted traffic at various locations in London, infuriating drivers. Videos from an Oct. 9 protest show frustrated motorists exiting their vehicles and dragging the protesters off the street to clear the roads.



""I have to go to hospital for an appointment, I'm deaf, let me get on with my life and stop interfering with us,"" one man says in the video.

Truss' government has also lifted a 2019 ban on hydraulic fracking in response to the energy crisis affecting all of Europe due partly to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Conservative members of Parliament have called for increases in domestic energy production, including use of fossil fuels, to reduce reliance on natural gas exports from Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-protesters-throw-tomato-soup-at-famous-van-gogh-painting-glue-themselves-to-wall,2022-10-14
CNN anchor asks Biden official: 'Why won't the US shoot down' Russian planes?,"A Biden administration official wouldn't give a straight answer when asked why the U.S. won't ""shoot down"" Russian planes that are bombing civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.

On Thursday, CNN anchor Jim Sciutto asked State Department spokesman Ned Price to explain why the U.S. won't take military action against Russia, given that the government considers Russian military strikes against civilian targets like hospitals to be war crimes.

The question came up after Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda Thursday, during which Harris called Russia's actions ""atrocities of unimaginable proportion.""

She also said that Russia ""absolutely"" should be investigated for war crimes.

Afterwards, Price joined ""CNN Newsroom with Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto"" to discuss the vice president's comments, and he was asked if Russia had committed ""war crimes.""

""Lamentably, that's an apt description,"" Price said, adding that ""we’re working with the international community, each group to create new mechanisms to ensure that we are holding Russia and will hold Russia accountable for any potential war crimes.”

Sciutto then asked why the U.S. won't take military action and ""shoot down"" the Russian planes attacking civilians.



""OK, hold them accountable, but not stop them because they’re continuing here. Why won’t the U.S. shoot down the planes that are bombing hospitals?"" Sciutto asked.

""Well, Jim, we are providing our Ukrainian partners with what they need to engage in self-defense. And you have seen the effectiveness of that strategy. The Russian war effort really has been stalled,"" Price answered, deflecting the question. ""President Putin has severely miscalculated if he thought he would roll into Ukraine, not find any resistance. Clearly, he was wrong. We have seen convoys stuck. We’ve seen Russians engaged and stopped really in a morass of their own making.""

""And we’ve done that by providing over the course of the past year, as you heard from the vice president, more than $1 billion in defense of security assistance, more than $250 million in security assistance over the past week alone,"" he continued. ""And by working with Congress, we’re grateful for Congress’ cooperation. We’ll be able to provide more than $13 billion to our Ukrainian partners, about half of which will be in the form of security assistance.""

Sciutto followed up by asking if President Joe Biden is ""in effect giving the Kremlin a veto, veto power over U.S. military options here?""

“Jim, we’ve heard a lot of rhetoric from Moscow. I wouldn’t put stock in Moscow’s rhetoric,” Price said, without giving the obvious response that taking direct military action against Russia, like shooting down planes, would start World War III.

CNN contributor questions if Biden is better than Trump,"Political commentator Scott Jennings delivered a scathing rebuke of President Joe Biden during a recent appearance on CNN. The blistering takedown questioned whether Biden was any different or better on key issues than former President Donald Trump.

""I never imagined how quickly this would all unfold,"" Jennings said on Thursday's episode of ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""The person they sold on the campaign, the nice old, you know, moderate grandpa who just wanted to help everybody get along and compromise, is not what we got over the last year.""



""He has no mandate really to do much of anything."" Jennings continued. ""It's amazing that he got a couple of things done when the mandate was really pretty clear – 50/50 Senate, a near 50/50 House, and a pretty close presidential election.""

""The mandate was simply, 'Replace Donald Trump and don't do anything drastic or stupid,'"" said Jennings, who previously worked as a special assistant for former President George W. Bush and was a former campaign adviser Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).



""And everything about this agenda is extremely drastic, and he has been angrier than I think people expected,"" Jennings said.

Jennings added that Biden has also been ""more divisive"" and ""more partisan"" than what Americans anticipated.

""You look at the issues,"" the CNN contributor noted. ""We built five years of coverage on Trump out of Russia, COVID, and democracy.""

""The president at his press conference invites Russia to invade the Ukraine,"" he said.

During Biden's rare press conference on Wednesday, he suggested that ""minor incursion"" by Russia into Ukraine might not warrant a strong international response. The White House has since walked back Biden's comments.

Jennings pointed out that there have been more COVID-19 deaths under Biden than Trump.

According to Worldometer data, there were 430,803 COVID-19 deaths from the start of the pandemic until Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2020. As of Jan. 20, 2022, there were a total of 884,866 COVID-19 deaths, meaning that there were 454,063 COVID-19 deaths in Biden's first year as president — despite having the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies that Trump wasn't afforded.

During the presidential debate on Oct. 22, 2020, Biden told Trump, ""Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States."" At the time, there were approximately 220,000 U.S. COVID-19 deaths.

Days before the 2020 presidential election, then-candidate Joe Biden promised Americans, ""I'm going to shut down the virus.""

Jennings stated, ""And now, we have the president and vice president and leading Democrats questioning the legitimacy of the 2022 election.""

During Biden's press conference this week, he proclaimed that the 2022 midterm elections ""easily could be — be illegitimate."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki also walked back Biden's statement that the elections could be illegitimate. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris completely dodged questions about Biden hinting that the elections could be tainted and not conducted fairly.

Jennings — who had been critical of Trump as president while contributing to CNN — slammed Biden, ""Are we any better off on these three issues that we crucified Trump over?""

Jennings brought to light a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll that found just 28% of Americans want Biden to run for re-election in 2024, including only 48% of Democrats. The survey released on Thursday, said 43% of Americans approve of Biden's job performance versus 56% who disapprove.

""This is a disaster,"" Jennings declared.



Jennings accused Biden of not showing any interest in key issues such as ""schools, crime, your quality of life kind of stuff.""

Jennings also tore apart Biden's first year in office in an opinion piece published in the Courier Journal.

""After a year we see the reality: divisive, angry, out-of-touch and as dishonest as his predecessor,"" he wrote of Biden.

""If there’s a human embodiment of ambiguity, apprehension, and confusion, Biden is it,"" Jennings said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-contributor-biden-trump,2022-01-22
"CNN chief international correspondent stops during live shot, captures viral moment desperate Ukrainians kneel in prayer amid Russian invasion","Clarissa Ward, CNN's chief international correspondent, witnessed a moving demonstration of faith on live television Thursday morning as a group of Ukrainians kneeled on the ground in prayer as Russia continued its invasion into the war-torn country.

What are the details?

Talking with CNN anchor Don Lemon, Ward — who was on the ground in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Thursday morning — witnessed the group of people praying on what appeared to be a public street amid the danger.

“I think this ... really speaks to the sort of desperation of this moment,” Ward said of the group's faithfulness. “We just see a small group of people ... have gathered in the main square, and they are kneeling and praying because right now there is clearly a sense of having no idea what is coming down the pipeline, what is in store.”

Video footage showed the group of people as Ward pointed out that the scene — though dire and desperate — was ""very moving.""

“It’s freezing cold here, so to see these people kneeling on the cold stone in prayer is honestly very moving,” she continued. “And I think it speaks to the state of ordinary Ukrainians here who have done absolutely nothing to deserve this.”

Ward added that Ukrainians have every reason to fall to their knees as Russia continued its deadly advance into the country, ushering in violence and uncertainty in the hours and days ahead.

“I think that’s why you’re seeing those people ... getting to their knees and praying,” she said.

CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand shared the segment on social media, tweeting, ""What a moment captured by @clarissaward and her team in Kharkiv.

"CNN analyst declares that freedom of speech is 'nonsense,' claims Elon Musk's new Twitter empowers Vladimir Putin and is 'destructive to American national security'","A CNN analyst aspersed the freedom of speech as ""nonsense,"" and claimed that Vladimir Putin and Russia will be ""all over Twitter"" dispersing disinformation to the entire world.

Former CIA case officer and current CNN intelligence analyst Robert Baer appeared on the cable news network on Friday to discuss the opening up of Twitter by new CEO Elon Musk.

""CNN Newsroom"" host Boris Sanchez began by bringing up the news that Musk plans to grant mass amnesty to accounts that were previously suspended. Musk made the decision after running a Twitter poll, in which 72.4% approved of welcoming the previously banned accounts.

""The people have spoken. Amnesty begins next week,"" Musk tweeted on Thursday.

Sanchez asked Baer about his opinion regarding formerly banned accounts being reinstated.

Baer responded, ""Well, Boris, I can tell you one thing, Putin will be all over Twitter if there's no regulations on this. Fake accounts, spoofed accounts, the rest of it, this is a great opportunity for him.""



Without evidence, Baer added, ""And so when he's talking about the popular voice, Musk, he's really talking about Russian intelligence.""

Sanchez asked Baer to provide advice to the Tesla and SpaceX CEO on how to lead Twitter, and the CNN analyst somberly replied, ""I'd say this Libertarian nonsense is destructive to American national security.

CNN host calls out Biden for narrative on gas price crisis: 'Americans just don’t buy that',"CNN host Abby Phillip called out President Joe Biden on Sunday for repeatedly refusing to accept responsibility for the historic surge of gas prices.

On Friday, Biden celebrated the positive jobs report, which showed the economy added more than 400,000 jobs in March. However, the report is a misleading indicator of economic health because employment remains 1.6 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels, according to government data.

What happened?

During a panel discussion on CNN's ""Inside Politics Sunday,"" Axios reporter Hans Nichols described any positive news about the economy as ""largely irrelevant"" because of inflation and high gas prices, and Phillip agreed.

""There’s one number that they can’t really change right now. And that is what the placard says at the local gas station, and that number is high and that's the daily jobs report that voters, Americans, consumers see every day,"" Nichols said. ""And there's nothing the White House can do about it, other than bring down the price of gasoline.""

""And maybe blame Putin,"" Phillip quipped, before beginning to criticize Biden for calling the gas price surge the ""Putin price hike.""

""Look,"" Nichols interjected, ""when I’ve passed gas stations that say ‘blame Putin’ more than they say ‘Let’s go Brandon,’ I’ll know the White House has been successful in messaging.""

Phillip responded by calling Nichols' observation ""fascinating,"" and she brought attention to polling that proves Biden's messaging has failed.

""Take a look at this Quinnipiac poll. Americans just don’t buy that this is related to the war in Ukraine, and most of it, frankly, is not: 41% say it’s Biden’s policies, just 24% say the war in Ukraine, 24% also say the oil and gas companies are raising prices,"" Phillip explained

""But the White House is trying to do both — blame Putin, blame the oil and gas companies — but Americans just don’t agree,"" she observed.

The fact that Americans blame Biden for economic problems is electorally disastrous for Democrats.

Polling overwhelmingly shows that Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and thus they are looking to Republicans, as indicated by generic ballot polling for the 2022 midterm elections, for solutions.

In fact, NBC News anchor Chuck Todd predicted last week that Democrats will face a ""shellacking"" in the upcoming elections because of voter sentiment toward the state of the economy and direction of the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-host-calls-out-biden-for-narrative-on-gas-price-crisis-americans-just-dont-buy-that,2022-04-04
CNN host says world is entering 'post-American' era under Biden: 'You can see signs of this everywhere',"CNN host Fareed Zakaria observed Sunday that under the leadership of President Joe Biden, the era of global American dominance is over.

What is the background?

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates declined calls with Biden as Russia's war in Ukraine intensified.

According to the report, relations between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern kingdoms have strained under Biden. However, the White House denied the truth of the report.

""That report is inaccurate, so let me start there,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The president did speak with the Saudi king just a few weeks ago, several weeks ago, it’s all running together at this point in time. There were no rebuffed calls, period.""

What did Zakaria say?

According to Zakaria, Russia's war in Ukraine marks a new era of world history and in particular highlights evidence of America's diminishing influence on the global stage.

""One of the defining features of the new era is that it is post-American. By that I mean that the Pax Americana of the past three decades is over,"" Zakaria said. ""You can see signs of this everywhere.""

To prove his thesis, Zakaria cited the the Journal report and Biden's failure to lead a coalition of world powers against Russia.

""Consider that according to the Wall Street Journal the leaders of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, two countries that have depended on Washington for their security for decades, refuse to even take phone calls from the American president,"" Zakaria explained. ""Consider as well that Israel initially in the Security Council vote and India have refused to describe Putin's actions as an invasion and that all four countries have made it clear they will continue to do business with Russia.""

It is not all bad, according to Zakaria, who observed that America ""remains the world's leading power, still stronger than all the rest by far.""

Anything else?

Comedian Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show,"" made a similar argument last week. In fact, Noah said Saudi Arabia and the UAE would not have snubbed Donald Trump as they allegedly did Biden.

""That must have been really embarrassing for Biden. Can you imagine? He phones them and they don’t pick up?"" Noah said.

""Now, according to the White House, this story is totally untrue. They deny it, which I would, too. But either way, man, there is no denying that Saudi Arabia isn’t playing ball with Joe Biden,"" Noah added. ""And you know what? You can say what you want, but this would have never happened to Donald Trump. Never.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-host-says-world-is-entering-post-american-era-under-biden,2022-03-14
CNN ran two stories saying Trump opposes Russia sanctions as he was about to sign one into law,"CNN's nakedly partisan reporting may have sunk to new lows this week.

The news network ran, not just one, but two stories reporting that President Donald Trump is balking at sanctions targeting Russia for its 2016 election interference and annexation of Crimea. However, what CNN did not report is that the 45th president signed tough sanctions on Friday that target the Kremlin's expansion into European oil markets.

Even the UK's BBC covered Trump approving the measures targeting a major Russian pipeline while the so-called ""most trusted name in news"" in the United States ignored.

Why did the U.S. target a Russian pipeline?

According to the BBC, the sanctions that Trump signed were part of an annual defense spending bill and specifically target firms that support the construction of Nord Stream 2, an undersea pipeline that would allow Russia to increase energy exports to Germany and the European Union.

The US considers the project a security risk to Europe. Both Russia and the EU have strongly condemned the US sanctions. Congress voted through the measures as part of a [defense] bill last week and the legislation, which described the pipeline as a ""tool of coercion"", was signed off by Mr Trump on Friday.

The British network added that the Russian pipeline project has strong bipartisan opposition in the U.S. Congress. Sanctions targeting it were sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). BBC noted that the Trump administration is concerned the pipeline will allow Moscow to control Europe's energy supply and reduce America's share of the European natural gas market.

Russia is said to currently supply 40% of the European Union's liquified natural gas. The new pipeline would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine and Poland and deliver gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea to Germany, according to Reuters. In addition, lawmakers in Washington say that Nord Stream 2 would likely deprive Ukraine of billions of dollars in fees.

What was CNN talking about then?

The Russian sanctions that CNN was referring to is a separate set of sanctions known as the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act that would not even be up for a full vote until next year. DASKA would slap Russia with a wide range of sanctions in retaliation for its interference in American elections and aggression in eastern Europe.

While it is true that the State Department has balked at the measures, CNN's headline—claiming ""Trump administration opposes bill meant to deter Russia""—overstates the White House's opposition.

In a 22-page letter detailing its position on the matter, the State Department says it ""shares the goal of deterring and countering Russian subversion and aggression,"" but says it ""strongly opposes the bill in its current form"" for a variety of reasons. Among them is that the bill ""would divert resources from the ongoing aggressive targeting of Russian malign actors under existing authorities...as well as from efforts with respect to Iran, North Korea, ISIS, Venezuela, Hezbollah, counterterrorism, human rights and corruption and other (US government) priorities.""

Although CNN explained some of these nuances in its coverage, as of the writing of this article, it has not yet reported on Nord Stream 2 sanctions on its website.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-ignores_trump_russia_sanctions,2019-12-21
CNN report says Ukraine whistleblower is a registered Democrat,"The whistleblower whose complaint led to the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is reportedly a registered Democrat, according to a report by CNN on Thursday.

""The Lead"" anchor Jake Tapper announced the report was based on an anonymous source.

""A source familiar with the whistleblower investigation tells me that the political bias referred to by the intelligence community Inspector General is that the whistleblower is a registered Democrat,"" Tapper reported.

Allies of the president on social media responded to the report by concluding that the whistleblower was motivated by political animus against Republicans and the president's agenda.

The impeachment inquiry by House Democrats commenced on the basis of accusations stemming from the complaint by a whistleblower who claimed Trump acted inappropriately in a phone call with the Ukrainian president.

Trump and his supporters have accused Democrats of using the accusations in order to defend Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden from claims of corruption.

Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, has claimed that he is the true whistleblower, because he uncovered the alleged corruption committed by Biden to defend his son, Hunter Biden.

"After White House denial, CNN scrubs report on alarming leak from Biden's call with Ukrainian president","Chaos erupted online after CNN ran with a leaked report about alleged statements President Joe Biden made to the president of Ukraine in a phone call amidst rising tension from the possibility of a Russian invasion.

Biden spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday about the threat from Russia but a leaked report claimed that he told Zelensky an invasion was virtually certain and that the country should ""prepare for impact.""

Biden also told them that the capital of Kyiv could be ""sacked"" by the Russians, according to the disputed report.

That report was regurgitated by numerous CNN reporters, and covered by Jake Tapper on his show on the Cable News Network before the White House said the claims were false. He cited a Ukrainian official as a source for the story.

The official account for the ""The Lead"" tweeted the video of Tapper's report and then deleted it. Later, they reposted the video report and added that the White House had disputed the account.

A spokesperson for Zelensky released a statement backing the claims of the White House that the leaked report was untrue.

""Dear colleagues! Some reports regarding the content of the talks between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden have appeared on social media, citing the alleged 'senior Ukrainian official.' These messages are completely false,"" read the statement.

""Correct information can only be found in official releases from the Ukrainian and American sides. Everything else is suppositions and speculations,"" the statement continued. ""In this troubled time, we ask you to treat every piece of information as responsibly as possible and publish only carefully verified data.""

Here's the latest version of the story from CNN:

Christopher Miller of Buzzfeed News said that his source in Zelensky's office confirmed that the comments claimed by the leaked report were an accurate depiction of what Biden said on the call.



Some wondered if CNN had been forced by the White House to delete an accurate report.

""CNN either completely botched a report that could impact whether or not Russia invades Ukraine, Or they got it right and got bullied out of reporting truth by Biden admin. It was probably botched,"" tweeted Brent Scher of the Free Beacon. ""Under last admin they would have stood by their garbage, but now they back down.""

The confusion mirrored a previous statement that Biden made about the possibility of a Russian invasion that occasioned loud and frustrated push back from Ukrainian officials. White House press secretary Jen Psaki later walked back his comments.

CNN torpedoed after cuing ill-timed Applebee's commercial alongside wailing air raid sirens in Ukraine,"CNN took heavy criticism on Thursday morning after airing a poppy, upbeat Applebee's commercial alongside footage of air raid sirens blaring across Kyiv, Ukraine, amid the Russian invasion.

What are the details?

CNN bizarrely aired an Applebee's commercial on Thursday morning while myriad air raid sirens rang out across the smoky streets of Kyiv.

The upbeat commercial featured the Zac Brown Band's ""Chicken Fried"" and showed off a man dancing in skin-tight jeans to lyrics such as: ""A little bit of chicken fried/ Cold beer on a Friday night/ A pair of jeans that fit just right/ And the radio up.""

Air raid sirens could be heard on the newscast before the network superimposed the commercial over the dystopian footage in split screen fashion.

What was the response?

Much of social media could not fathom why CNN would air such devastating footage juxtaposed with a lighthearted commercial celebrating fried chicken and beer at a mid-range casual dining restaurant franchise.

Journalist Arash Markazi wrote, ""A friend once yelled the opening lyrics of Smash Mouth's 'All Star' in a movie theater during a silent moment in a dramatic movie as a dare. This is worse than that moment.""

Broadcaster Keith Olbermann added, ""Death from the skies...sponsored by @applebees[.]""

Research director Scott Whitlock wrote, ""Really, CNN? There's this thing called tone and tact. Look it up. Because your blending of commercials and all hell breaking out in Europe isn't working.""

Another user added, ""Cutting away from air raid sirens in Kyiv for an Applebee’s commercial with a guy in jeans shaking his ass is certainly a choice, @CNN. What sort of dystopian hell is this?""

""Applebees couldn’t get a Super Bowl commercial, so they took the WW3 CNN slot. Savage,"" another user wrote.

Yet another chimed in, ""Nothing like sliding on a pair of jeans that fit right while preparing for ww3.""

Another user quipped, ""Why is there Ukraine content in the middle of CNN's Applebees coverage?""

CNN flat-out refuses to air Trump ad about Biden-Ukraine ties — in part because it mocks CNN anchors,"CNN has refused to air an advertisement for President Donald Trump's 2020 presidential re-election campaign, which blasts CNN anchors and blasts Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden.

What are the details?

According to a Thursday report by The Daily Beast, the 30-second advertisement — titled ""Biden Corruption"" — zeroes in on Biden, as well as the media's apparent defense of the former vice president's past political activities in Ukraine.

The ad specifically features CNN hosts Chris Cuomo, Jim Acosta, and Don Lemon — all who have been vocally critical of the president.

A spokesperson for the news network told the outlet that the advertisement reportedly doesn't meet standards.

“CNN is rejecting the ad, as it does not meet our advertising standards,"" a spokesperson said. “Specifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.""

Tim Murtaugh, Trump's campaign communications director, told the outlet that CNN's move is par for the course.

“CNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it's not surprising that they're shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it,"" Murtaugh said. ""This isn't a cable news channel anymore, it's a Democrat public relations firm.""

The ad says, ""Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company. But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him. And their media lapdogs fall in line.""

CNN's own heavily Dem poll gave Biden lowest 'very positive' SOTU response in 15 years: 'The tide did not turn tonight',"President Joe Biden received the lowest marks in CNN's post-State of the Union poll in 15 years, despite the respondents being significantly more Democratic than the general public.

What are the details?

After Biden's speech, CNN political director David Chalian revealed the results from CNN's post-SOTU poll and explained why the poll signals bad news for Biden.

""This is a poll of people who watch the speech. And what’s important to note about that is that people who watch a president give a State of the Union tend to be more supportive of that president or in that president’s party,"" Chalian explained. ""And so our survey tonight of speech watchers is about 11 points more Democratic as a body of people here that were pulled than the overall population in America.""

Despite the overwhelming Democrat bias in the pool of respondents, just 41% of people polled said they had a ""very positive"" reaction to Biden's speech, while 29% said they had a ""somewhat positive"" reaction and 29% said they had a ""negative reaction.""

The ""very positive"" number is down 10 points from 2021, when CNN recorded a ""very positive"" reaction among 51% of respondents. The significant drop is a problem for Biden because, as Chalian explained, ""that 41% is the lowest very positive we’ve seen in about the last 15 years of instant polling after the State of the Union address.""

Even more troubling for Biden was that a majority of respondents told CNN that Biden failed to sufficiently address violent crime and historic inflation. According to CNN's poll, only 47% of respondents said Biden adequately addressed inflation and just 46% of respondents said he sufficiently addressed violent crime.

""Majorities for both inflation and violent crime said he did not do enough,"" Chalian observed. ""And again, I just want to remind you that is the majority of a speech-watching audience that is more Democratic than the American populace overall.""

Meanwhile, respondents gave Biden positive marks on Ukraine — 69% said he adequately addressed Russia's invasion of Ukraine — but the same respondents, when asked to choose the most important issue between the economy and Ukraine, overwhelmingly (64% to 36%) said the economy was more important than Ukraine.

Co-workers of alleged whistleblower say they heard him plotting Trump's removal in 2017: Report,"Former colleagues of alleged impeachment whistleblower Eric Ciaramella say they heard him discussing ways to get President Donald Trump out of office within days of his inauguration in January 2017, according to RealClearInvestigations.

The sources, who spoke to RCI under the condition of anonymity, said Ciaramella talked about ousting Trump with Sean Misko. Ciaramella and Misko were holdovers from the Obama Administration's national security team.

According to the sources, Ciaramella and Misko, who are reportedly friends, were upset about Trump's policy changes from the Obama administration.

""They were popping off about how they were going to remove Trump from office. No joke,"" one ex-colleague told RCI.

From RCI:

And both expressed anger over Trump's new ""America First"" foreign policy, a sea change from President Obama's approach to international affairs.



""Just days after he was sworn in they were already talking about trying to get rid of him,"" said a White House colleague who overheard their conversation.



""They weren't just bent on subverting his agenda,"" the former official added. ""They were plotting to actually have him removed from office.""

Misko joined House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's staff last July, one day after President Trump's infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky. Misko allegedly advised the whistleblower during the process of filing the complaint and helped run the impeachment investigation.

The whistleblower complaint was filed in August and made public in September, alleging that the whistleblower ""received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President's main domestic political rivals.""

The whistleblower failed to disclose his communications with Schiff's staff when interviewed by the Intelligence Community Inspector General, and Schiff himself was misleading about what communication he or his staff may have had with the whistleblower.

Although Ciaramella is widely believed to be the whistleblower, the whistleblower's identity has not been officially revealed. He is currently identified only as an unnamed CIA analyst.

Some Republicans want the whistleblower to be called as a witness during the impeachment trial, but Democrats have fiercely refused any attempts to publicly disclose his identity.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/co-workers-of-alleged-whistleblower-say-they-heard-him-plotting-trumps-removal,2020-01-22
Commentary: 5 reasons impeachment 2.0 may be more likely than you think,"Even before President Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, numerous Democrats and liberal activist groups had floated the idea of another impeachment as a possible means to stall the Senate's confirmation of a new justice for the high court.

As I note in my book, ""Abuse of Power: Inside the Three-Year Campaign to Impeach Donald Trump,"" the previous impeachment push also seemed improbable and something House Democratic leadership wasn't on board with — until they were.

Impeachment 2.0 would mean either re-impeaching Trump or bringing impeachment charges against Attorney General William Barr, according to reports. The endgame of course would not be removal of either — but rather stalling a confirmation.

To be sure, another impeachment is still unlikely. But it's not as improbable as you might think. Here are five reasons you might see Democrats pull the trigger again.

No. 1: The Senate is obliged to start a trial, which could delay the SCOTUS confirmation

The point of an impeachment now would be to force a Senate trial in order to gum up the works and at least delay the Barrett confirmation process. If the confirmation process extends past Election Day and Joe Biden wins the election (and Democrats even perhaps win a majority in the Senate), a vote for Barrett becomes politically more difficult to hold, even for a lame-duck Republican majority.

If the House passed an impeachment — no matter how meritless — under the ""Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials,"" the Senate would be required to begin the trial by 1 p.m. on the day following the day that the House sends its impeachment ""managers"" to the Senate to present the articles of impeachment.

The rules also state the Senate shall ""continue in session from day to day (Sundays excepted) after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be rendered."" Moreover, all other ""legislative and executive business"" before the Senate is suspended during the conduct of the trial. Other business would include confirmations — even for a Supreme Court justice.

Of course, Senate Republicans could choose to make it a one- or two-day trial. But that would still delay things for the high court confirmation.

No. 2: Numbers would be there

Democratic leaders worked hard to whip their troops into line for the impeachment vote against Trump held in December. Sources interviewed in ""Abuse of Power"" said that as many as 10 to 15 moderate Democrats might have defected if the majority followed the original plan of an impeachment vote in October or November. That would have been an embarrassment for Democrats — but the bottom line is that the House majority would still have had the numbers.

If Democrats tried again to impeach — this time for the sole purpose of obstructing a Supreme Court confirmation — they would inevitably have a divided caucus. But there is almost nothing Democratic politicians and progressive activists take more seriously than stopping a Trump Supreme Court pick. Even if there are significantly more Democrats defecting than before, the majority party likely has the votes.

No. 3: Pelosi already caved once on impeachment

After suggesting she was open to re-impeaching President Donald Trump as an ""arrow in our quiver"" during an interview on ABC News, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backtracked with familiar words.

""I don't think he's worth the trouble at this point,"" she told reporters.

Some of us are old enough to remember that in March 2019, Pelosi asserted: ""Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.""

That, incidentally, was before special counsel Robert Mueller's report that cleared Trump of conspiracy with Russians. But Pelosi didn't know at the time what the Mueller report would say. So it was rather astonishing that by September of the same year, she was gung-ho for impeachment over an improper phone call. The difference came when the far-left base — led by ""The Squad"" — as well as activist groups finally got to her. She lost control of her caucus and knew she had to move forward on impeachment for something — anything — to maintain her leadership.

Already, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who played an outsized role in pressuring Pelosi to move left, declared ""all of the tools available to our disposal ... all of these options should be entertained and on the table.""

No. 4: House impeachment manager on board

Moreover, one of the House impeachment managers is even on board with impeachment — and court-packing, for that matter. This could give the issue a little more gravity among Democrats.

During an interview on PBS, Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) one of the impeachment managers who also previously served as the Orlando police chief, seemed ready to go all in.

""The ability to move forward with whatever strategy, whether that's impeachment, whether it's after Vice President [Joe] Biden and Senator [Kamala] Harris win, they look at expanding the number of justices on the court, those are decisions that will be made by leadership,"" Demings said.

No. 5: Who needs a crime?

The Constitution is indeed broad about the House's power to impeach. Treason and bribery are clear enough, but the phrase ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" leaves plenty to the imagination. Still, by tradition, both Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached for alleged violations of the law. Richard Nixon would have been impeached for alleged violations of the law. Further, all eight federal judges removed by the Senate were impeached by the House for alleged violations of the law.

Using the tool of impeachment to stall a judicial confirmation in the Senate would be unprecedented. However, the 2019 Trump impeachment already burst through the long-established tradition of impeachment only for a defined statutory violation of the law.

Recall, Democrats pushing Trump's impeachment over the Ukraine phone call first tried to sell it as a ""quid pro quo"" until focus groups were unimpressed. So Democrats tried for a time to push bribery or extortion — both were tough sells. Finally, House Democrats settled on ""abuse of power"" and ""obstruction of Congress,"" neither of which are crimes but sound really bad. The charges were broad enough not to have to define but easy enough to understand.

If Democrats impeached Trump — or someone else — the charge wouldn't be for nominating a Supreme Court justice. They would find another reason, legal or not. The precedent was already set in the House that a violation of the law isn't required to impeach someone.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/commentary-5-reasons-impeachment-could-happen,2020-09-30
"Computer repairman at center of 'Biden laptop' scandal closes shop, disappears amid purported death threats","John Paul Mac Isaac, the computer repairman at the center of a reported Biden family scandal, has closed his Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair shop amid purported death threats.

Mac Isaac previously claimed he had a laptop computer and hard drive containing information about former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and his international business dealings with Ukraine.

For his part, the elder Biden said the allegations were a ""desperate campaign to smear me and my family,"" but did not confirm whether the laptop belonged to his son.

What are the details?

According to the Delaware News Journal, a ""closed"" sign now appears in the window of Mac Isaac's shop.

His attorney, Brian Della Rocca, told the outlet that his client closed up shop after he received several death threats. He has not elaborated on Mac Isaac's whereabouts at the time of this reporting, though a neighbor told the outlet that Mac Isaac left town.

In October, Mac Isaac said that he retained a copy of the hard drive's contents because he ""feared he would be killed by people who 'work for [Joe] Biden' and having it was 'protection.'""

Della Rocca told the outlet that he did not believe his client would be involved in any potential lawsuits or investigations related to the laptop.

The outlet noted that Della Rocca ""said his office has spoken in recent weeks with Wilmington FBI agents and with Delaware's Assistant United States Attorney Leslie Wolf"" but that he ""declined to describe the nature of the conversations.""

""I've been in touch with federal law enforcement, yes,"" he told the outlet.

Neither the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation commented when approached by the outlet for remarks on the allegations.

In October, the New York Post reported that Mac Isaac was asked to repair a computer that reportedly contained a variety of nefarious and possibly incriminating emails and photos appearing to confirm that a secret meeting between the former vice president and a top Burisma executive had taken place.

He later told Fox News, ""I just don't know what to say, or what I'm allowed to say. I know that I saw, I saw stuff — and I was concerned. I was concerned that somebody might want to come looking for this stuff eventually — and I wanted it out of my shop.""

Couple charged with felony child neglect claims the 'abandoned child' is actually a murderous adult scam artist with dwarfism,"An Indiana couple accused of abandoning their child is speaking out and insisting that the child is not a child at all — but a 22-year-old scam artist from Ukraine.

What are the details?

Michael and Kristine Barnett, who are now divorced, adopted the girl, Natalia, in 2010. A court document revealed that Natalia suffers from dwarfism.

Just two years later in 2012, the couple changed their adopted daughter's age to 22 in a probate court prior to leaving the United States to relocate to Canada.

When the Barnetts left the U.S. with their two sons, they left Natalia behind in Indiana. The couple also reportedly paid rent for the apartment in which they left Natalia, but said that they ""did not financially support"" their adopted daughter.

Last week, officials charged the Barnetts with two counts of felony neglect of a dependent. A Tippecanoe County judge issued warrants for Michael and Kristine on Tuesday. Natalia told investigators during a 2014 interview that she is from Ukraine and was adopted through an agency in 2008. She also said she has not seen the Barnetts since they moved to Canada.

According to an affidavit, ""Michael Barnett admitted Kristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looked young but was actually 22."" The New York Post reported that Michael also admitted to detectives that he knew Natalia was a minor when he and Kristine left the U.S.

However, an attorney for Michael told NBC News that his client, who plans to surrender Wednesday, insists that he and his ex-wife were victims of fraud during the adoption process and were led to believe that Natalia was a child.

Kristine told WISH-TV that Natalia was diagnosed as a sociopath and a psychopath, and also claimed that Natalia is an adult who was between the ages of 18 and 22 at the time of adoption and presented herself as a minor. In a Facebook post, Kristine insisted that the allegations are ""false charges.""



The couple's story is eerily similar to the plot of 2009 movie, ""The Orphan,"" in which a family adopts a child who turns out to be a murderous adult who suffers from dwarfism.

What else?

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Kristine said that Natalia was dangerous and tried to kill her adopted family.

Things were immediately amiss when the couple brought Natalia home, Krisine told the outlet, claiming that Natalia had an expansive vocabulary for a girl her age and an active menstrual cycle.

Conflicting doctors' reports regarding Natalia's have also added to the confusion. Upon adoption, a doctor estimated her age at approximately 8 years old. Two years later, however, another doctor estimated that Natalia was approximately 11 years old.

Kristine also said that Natalia began threatening her new family after the adoption and tried to poison Kristine and push her into an electric fence. She added that the family took Natalia to a psychiatric hospital for help, where doctors diagnosed her with significant mental illness. During treatment, Natalia reportedly admitted her real age.

A doctor's report later found that Natalia is actually an adult. The report stats that she has reportedly ""made a career of perpetuating her age façade"" and has been successful in deceiving others about her real age.

Kristine told the Daily Mail that after Natalia received treatment, she helped the girl get on her feet with a social security number and sources of state assistance. The girl was reportedly evicted from an apartment in 2014 and went on to pose as a child for another family, Kristine said.

In 2016, an unnamed couple reportedly attempted to adopt Kristine, but the Barnetts filed an objection, saying that the adoption was a farce because Natalia is an adult — not a child. The unnamed couple reportedly dropped the guardianship petition, Kristine told the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/couple-charged-with-felony-child-neglect-claims-the-abandoned-child-is-actually-a-murderous-adult-scam-artist-with-dwarfism,2019-09-25
Video: Ukraine truck bomb explosion on Crimea bridge to Russia,"A surveillance camera captured video of the moment that a bomb detonated and blew up a large portion of a key bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. A Ukraine official vowed that the huge explosion is only ""the beginning.""

At sunrise on Saturday, a massive explosion destroyed part of the Kerch Bridge – a 12-mile road and rail bridge that links Crimea and Russia. Part of the bridge collapsed into the Kerch Strait. Russian authorities said three people were killed in the blast.









Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee stated, ""At 06:07 Moscow time today, an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed.""

Sergey Aksenov – the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea – confirmed that “two spans of the roadbed of the part [of the bridge] from Krasnodar to Kerch, collapsed.""

""Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said that a truck bomb caused seven railway cars carrying fuel to catch fire, resulting in a 'partial collapse of two sections of the bridge,'"" the Associated Press reported.

Vladimir Putin ordered a “government commission” to investigate the Kerch Bridge “emergency,"" according to Russian state media TASS.



Mykhailo Podolyak – an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky – did not directly take responsibility for the explosion, but said it was just ""the beginning.""

""Crimea, the bridge, the beginning. Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,"" Podolyak said on Saturday.

The official Twitter account for the government of Ukraine simply wrote, ""Sick burn.""

David Arakhamia – leader of the Servant of the People party in Ukraine – wrote on Telegram, ""Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode. And this is just the beginning. Of all things, reliable construction is not something Russia is particularly famous for.""

Oleksiy Danilov – the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council – posted a video of the Crimea Bridge on fire next to the 1962 video of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday Mr. President."" Vladimir Putin turned 70 years old on Friday.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declared, ""The reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure shows its terrorist nature.""

The Kerch Bridge – also known as the Kerch Strait Bridge and the Crimean Bridge – is the longest in Europe and was opened by Vladimir Putin in 2018. The $3.7 billion bridge crosses over the Kerch Strait – which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The Kerch Bridge links Russia's Krasnodar region with the Crimean Peninsula – which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.

The Crimean Bridge can reportedly handle 40,000 cars a day and 14 million passengers, plus 13 million tons of cargo per year. The bridge gives Russia access to important Ukrainian ports such as Sevastopol, and is a critical supply route to transport fuel, goods, and military weapons into Crimea. At the time of completion, Russian media hailed the bridge as ""the construction of the century.""

In 2021, Russian National Guard Chief Viktor Zolotov said, ""The facilities of the Kerch transport link are today comprehensively protected on the ground, from the air and from the water and under the water.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crimea-bridge-explosion-bomb-russia-ukraine-war,2022-10-08
"There is 'strong evidence of criminal misconduct' by Hunter Biden, says top government watchdog","The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump may be over, but federal officials are examining the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. At least one major government watchdog believes the younger Biden may find himself in serious trouble.

Hunter Biden's business dealings were at the center of Trump's impeachment case, following the revelation that he was being paid up to $50,000 per month to sit on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas producer, an amount well above the average paid to top executives who sit on major corporate boards.

Moreover, the younger Biden had no experience on energy matters or in Ukraine, further raising suspicions that he was inappropriately leveraging his relationship with his father, who was serving as the U.S. vice president, for his personal financial gain.

'Strong evidence of criminal misconduct'

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton says that Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine could land him in hot water with prosecutors at the Justice Department.

In an interview with One America News, Fitton said there is ""strong evidence of criminal misconduct"" by the younger Biden, as the U.S. Treasury Department has begun turning over confidential bank records related to Biden in response to a request from Senate investigative committees that are scrutinizing his activities.

The Washington Examiner reported the documents requested by Senate investigators are known as ""suspicious activity reports,"" or ""banking alerts involving money laundering or fraud, related to Biden and his associates.""

Senate investigators have also asked the Secret Service to turn over Hunter Biden's travel records, which Fitton explained could be the beginning of a broader criminal probe.

""This would be the basic investigative work one would do if you were trying to figure out where Hunter Biden was and who he was traveling with during the Obama presidency,"" Fitton, who recommended that federal investigators also look into Joe Biden's travels to China, another country where his son was working, said.

'No evidence it was a legitimate business relationship'



Fitton also raised questions about Hunter Biden's role with Burisma.

""There's no evidence that it was a legitimate business relationship or that Biden had the background or capability to serve on the board,"" he said.

Additionally, Fitton explained that ""the payments were out of the ordinary and extraordinary, suggesting some other improprieties. Now we have Rudy Giuliani with documents, some of them from court cases here in the United States, suggesting that money he was receiving was, in part, laundered.""

""This Biden scandal ain't going away,"" he said.

A recent poll shows that most Americans seem to agree with Fitton. According to a Politico/Morning Consult survey, 52 percent of voters believe it was inappropriate for Hunter Biden to take the job with Burisma, while only 18 percent said it was appropriate. Fifty-seven percent of respondents also said Biden's relationship with the Ukrainian firm was a scandal, while 19 percent said it was not.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/criminal_misconduct_hunter_biden_burisma,2020-02-16
"Exclusive: Sen. Ted Cruz confirms the Senate will hold a 'fair' impeachment trial to expose the Ukrainian scandal, says Trump should be allowed to call any witnesses he wants","Speaking with BlazeTV host Glenn Beck on his radio show Tuesday morning, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) confirmed that the U.S. Senate will hold an impeachment trial aimed at exposing the Ukrainian scandal, and said that the Senate trial would be ""fair"" to the president unlike the impeachment probe in the House.

Earlier in the interview, Cruz had described the House impeachment inquiry as a ""partisan show trial"" that would ultimately be ""thrown out"" in the Senate.

Beck later pressed Cruz on the Senate's intentions: ""Please tell me that you are going to hold an impeachment trial and expose all of this stuff in the Senate, won't you?""

""We will have a trial in the Senate unlike the House where there was no due process and no fairness,"" Cruz confirmed to Beck during the on-air interview. ""I believe [the trial in] the Senate will be much more fair.""

Cruz also said he believed that President Trump and his legal team should be allowed to call any witnesses that support his case, including Hunter Biden and the alleged whistleblower Eric Ciaramella.

""We're going to allow the White House and the president to present their defense,"" Cruz told Beck. ""I believe that means if the president wants to call witnesses, the president should be able to call witnesses.""

""If the president wants to call Hunter Biden or the whistleblower — whomever the president wants to call,"" Cruz said.

Beck has been outspoken about what he considers the real Ukrainian scandal, which is the State Department-funded, George Soros-led ""shadow government"" effort in Ukraine.

During the interview, Beck and Cruz also agreed that allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election in collusion with the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign were, in fact, founded, and that further investigation is justified.

Investigation into 2016 election interference was one of two requests from Trump to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the alleged quid pro quo, the other being an investigation into Hunter Biden's suspicious involvement with the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.

In a lengthy exposé on BlazeTV last month, Beck suggested that the impeachment probe against President Trump must go to trial so that the details of the underlying scandals in Ukraine could be brought to light.

Curious Americans will have to wait, however, because according to a Politico report, the Senate impeachment trial will likely be postponed until January.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cruz-confirms-senate-impeachment-trial,2019-12-10
Cryptocurrency catastrophe: $130 billion disappears as global tensions rise,"In the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market lost around $130 billion.

The two most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, continued their multi-day sell-off, dropping prices to levels not seen since July 2021. Currently selling for $34,300, Bitcoin was listed for nearly $70,000 in early November 2021. Similarly, Ethereum is currently listed at just over $2,200 per unit, when it sold for more than double that early last November.

The cryptocurrency market is believed to be moving in tandem with stocks that have been falling since the beginning of 2022. In fact, last week, the Nasdaq had its worst week since March 2020, which marked the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Nasdaq and cryptocurrency markets are hemorrhaging money, as tech stocks continue to slide downward and investors prepare for tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, CNBC reported.

Investors in cryptocurrency are also taking a hit as the Russian central bank proposed an outright ban on the use and mining of cryptocurrencies in all Russian territories. And Russia isn’t the only country in recent weeks to consider cracking down on crypto. Many American crypto-enthusiasts are anticipating incoming regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Rapidly increasing global tensions and the ongoing spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 dampen market prospects. As Russian President Vladmir Putin continues to send troops to the border of the Ukraine, European markets prepare for the worst.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC markets, told CNN Business that the “tipping point” occurred when the United States and United Kingdom announced they would be withdrawing staff from their Ukrainian embassies.

Hewson continued to say that this diplomatic withdrawal gave the “European markets a nudge lower” despite the U.S. State Department claiming it was done out of an “abundance of caution.”

While people may feel uncomfortable at the prospect of their diminishing returns, CNBC’s Jim Cramer instructed U.S. investors not to panic as he urged people to “do some buying.”

And, as the Omicron variant continues to spread during the winter months, more and more people continue to miss work. Further disruptions in supply chains can also be attributed to the perpetually mutating virus. However, an abundance of mild Omicron cases now means there is potential for widespread immunity in the near future.

Investors in cryptocurrency may be hemorrhaging money as the global marketplace reacts to a potential war, but they may find solace in the fact that their volatile investments often recover and strengthen with time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cryptocurrency-catastrophe-130-billion-disappears-as-global-tensions-rise,2022-01-24
'There is indisputable evidence of Putin’s war crimes everywhere': Two Republican lawmakers become the first US officials known to visit Ukraine since beginning of Russian invasion,"Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana and Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana have become the first American officials known to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion started in late February.

For well over a month, Ukraine has been facing a brutal onslaught as Russia has wreaked death and destruction. But Ukraine has been striving to defend itself.



Daines noted that proof of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war crimes abound.

""There is indisputable evidence of Putin’s war crimes everywhere—the images of shallow mass graves filled with civilians, women and children are heart wrenching,"" Daines noted in a statement, according to NBC News. ""America and the world need to know about Putin’s atrocities against the innocent people of Ukraine now, not after time has passed and the aftermath of evil and bloodshed have been cleaned up.""



Spartz, who entered office last year, became the first Ukrainian-born legislator to serve in the U.S. Congress, according to the New York Times.



""Nothing can substitute for actually being here, seeing it first-hand, spending time with the people and leaders here in Ukraine who have been horribly affected by this war,"" Daines said during an interview, according to the Times.

""I hope that our visit will encourage more American officials and leaders to come, to stand with the people of Ukraine,” Daines said, according to the outlet.

Spartz remarked that it was ""important to show our support, to show we care,"" the Times noted.



""We’ve been driving for miles and miles and miles, seeing death and destruction caused by Vladimir Putin in this evil invasion,"" Daines said. ""I think we should be providing the lethal aid that they need to win this war,"" the senator said, according to the Times. ""The humanitarian crisis will not end until the war ends. And the war will not end until the Ukrainians win.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/daines-and-sdaines-and-spartz-visit-ukrainepartz-visit-ukraine,2022-04-15
Dan Crenshaw issues warning to President Donald Trump about Russia during appearance on ‘The View’,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) appeared on Monday's broadcast of ""The View,"" and offered up a rebuke of President Donald Trump for sounding like he is emulating Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Crenshaw appeared on the popular daytime show for the first time since winning in the 2018 midterm elections.

What did he say?

Crenshaw told the ABC show's co-hosts that Trump should better vet remarks he makes when it comes to paraphrasing or quoting Putin.

Co-host Joy Behar questioned the freshman lawmaker and said, ""How is it that the Republican Party, your colleagues, can stand by this man when he is involved in this way with Russia? I said last week, I don't want to see any of those flag pins anymore on Republicans who don't stand up against this guy for Russian meddling and other things that he's done.

""It seems as though he's unpatriotic,"" she insisted. ""What do you say to that?""



Crenshaw responded by pointing out that he believed Behar was overstating her case, but admitted that he also felt that the U.S. president could be too close to the Russian president.

""The president has a bad habit of repeating what Putin says to the public,"" Crenshaw admitted. ""And he shouldn't do that.""

Crenshaw went on to point out that the president does, however, have a good record of countering Russia where he can.

""He also has a pretty good habit of taking actions and putting policies in place that vehemently counter Russia,"" he added.

What else?

The congressmen then went on to point out what he believes to be Trump's Russia-related successes.

""Putting lethal aids in Ukraine. Actually killing Russian militants in Syria. Bombing Syria chemical weapons by Assad — this is Russia's ally. Pressuring the Europeans to spend more on their defense to use our natural gas instead of Russian natural gas; none of these things are good for Russia,"" he explained.

"DC appeals court sides with House Democrats, says DOJ must hand over sealed Mueller grand jury info","A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Department of Justice has to turn sealed grand jury information from the Mueller probe over to congressional Democrats.

In a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the House Judiciary Committee, which requested a court order unsealing the materials in late July and was granted in October.

Judge Judith Rogers, a Clinton appointee, argued in the majority opinion that the committee's needs in its impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump outweighed the Justice Department's desire to keep the information sealed.

""In short, it is the district court, not the Executive or the Department, that controls access to the grand jury materials at issue here,"" Rogers argued. ""The Department has objected to disclosure of the redacted grand jury materials, but the Department has no interest in objecting to the release of these materials outside of the general purposes and policies of grand jury secrecy, which as discussed, do not outweigh the Committee's compelling need for disclosure.""

And while the House may have wrapped up its Ukraine investigation before the end of last year, the committee still has impeachment-related investigative work on its agenda, according to the ruling. Rogers cited the House Judiciary Committee's December impeachment report, which, she said, ""makes clear that although two Articles of Impeachment have been approved, the Committee's impeachment investigation related to the Mueller Report is ongoing.""



In its efforts to continue where the Mueller probe left off, the Democrat-led Judiciary Committee asked a federal judge to release the sealed grand jury materials from the special counsel's investigation in July. The move came after a months-longstandoff between committee Democrats and the DOJ over the secret information. In October, a federal district court sided with the committee in a decision that was upheld by Tuesday's ruling.



In her opinion, Rogers added that the ""Committee has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the Committee may recommend new articles of impeachment.""

The lone dissenter in the decision was Judge Neomi Rao — a Trump appointee who was confirmed to the bench last March. Rao argued that the committee lacked the necessary legal standing to force the release of the materials in the first place and that the issue should have been moot after the Senate concluded its impeachment trial.

""A reasonable observer might wonder why we are deciding this case at this time,"" Rao wrote. ""After all, the Committee sought these materials preliminary to an impeachment proceeding and the Senate impeachment trial has concluded. Why is this controversy not moot?"" The judge went on to criticize her two colleagues in the dissent, writing that they had ""simply turn[ed] a blind eye to these very public events.""

A DOJ spokesperson did not immediately respond to Blaze Media's request for comment on the ruling.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-appeals-court-sides-with-house-democrats-says-doj-must-hand-over-sealed-mueller-grand-jury-info,2020-03-10
Dean Norris tells capitalists to 'stfu' about high gas prices,"Actor Dean Norris has a message for capitalism supporters who are displeased about the sky-high gas prices they have been facing lately: They can just ""stfu,"" Norris said, using an abbreviation for the profane expression shut the f*** up.

""Youre not getting 'robbed' at the pump. You're paying fair market price for a commodity. If you love Capitalism so much then stfu,"" Norris tweeted on Wednesday.

The actor, who has played roles in television shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" and ""United States of Al,"" made the comment as Americans continue to face soaring gas prices. As of Thursday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $5.009.

""This comment is evidence that Dean knows nothing about fair or free markets or economics,"" RedState managing editor Jennifer Van Laar tweeted in response to the actor's remarks.

""It's not a fair-market price if government purposely creates scarcity to drive up the price,"" tweeted David Harsanyi, a senior editor at the Federalist.

Someone else responded to Norris's post by tweeting, ""yeah those gas prices determined by the market that's totally free and not at all distorted by government.""

""Another dimwit leftist rich actor spouting stupidity,"" someone else declared.

The Biden administration has been largely blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine for high fuel prices. The president recently issued a letter putting pressure on the leaders of major oil companies — according to Axios, the letter was directed to the leaders of ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP America, Shell USA, Phillips 66, Marathon, and Valero.

""Your companies and others have an opportunity to take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel, and other refined product you are producing and supplying to the United States market,"" Biden said in a the letter. ""The lack of refining capacity — and resulting unprecedented refinery profit margins — are blunting the impact of the historic actions my Administration has taken to address Vladimir Putin's Price Hike and are driving up costs for consumers.""

In a statement supplied to TheBlaze, a Chevron spokesperson said that ""what we have seen since January 2021 are policies that send a message that the Administration aims to impose obstacles to our industry delivering energy resources the world needs.""

Exxon issued a statement that noted, ""government can promote investment through clear and consistent policy that supports U.S. resource development, such as regular and predictable lease sales, as well as streamlined regulatory approval and support for infrastructure such as pipelines.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dean-norris-gas-prices-capitalism,2022-06-16
"Defiant Ukrainian soldiers who told Russia, 'Go f*** yourself,' and refused to surrender may still be alive","The brave Ukrainian soldiers who told invading Russian forces to ""go f*** yourself"" may still be alive, according to a report from the Jerusalem Post.

The group of 13 soldiers made headlines last week after refusing to surrender to a Russian warship as it stormed 42-acre Snake Island.

What are the details?

Ukraine's navy on Monday announced that the soldiers on Snake Island — who were initially believed to have died during the violent Russian incursion — may well be alive and in Russian custody.

Initial reports of the incident indicated that the band of soldiers sacrificed themselves after keeping at bay two Russian warships for a period of several hours.

The report from the Jerusalem Post noted, however, that the navy announced the soldiers may not have been killed during the attack.

“We [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive,” the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in Saturday statement. “Preliminary information that border guards may be dead came before the defenders lost contact.”

The New York Post added that Russian media reported that the soldiers ""had been captured after they laid down their arms and were transported to Sevastopol on the Russian-controlled Crimea Peninsula.""

The State Border Guard Service added that the information had not been confirmed.

A roughly translated Facebook post from the Naval Forces Commandments Armed Forces of Ukraine also said:

Regarding the actions of the Russian Federation near the island of Zmí їnij February 26th, receiving the information that on the o [sic]. A snake among our defenders may be killed and wounded, a Sapphire civilian ship was sent to the island to carry out a humanitarian mission to help the victims. Together with the crew agreed to leave father Vasily Virozub, Alexander Chokov and their assistants. But they were illegally captured by the Russians. Illegal capture of a civilian ship - a non-combatant without performing any military mission, is a violation of the rules and customs of war, international humanitarian law.



We demand from Russia the immediate release of illegally occupied citizens of Ukraine. We address the world community, to the believers of all churches requesting to take all possible measures to influence the Russian Federation for the return of our citizens. Regarding the Marines and border guards, who were taken captive by Russian occupiers on the island of Snake.



We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well with them! But Russian propaganda tries to twist the ""news"" about the fact that the Ukrainian authorities ""forgotten"", ""buried"" their fellows.



At the same time, the sailors bravely rebuked twice the attacks of the Russian invaders. Because of BC's marriage, they could not continue the protection of the island. In turn, the invaders ""forgot"" to report that they had completely destroyed the island's infrastructure: lighthouse, carnations, antennas, etc. Accordingly, the connection with the snake was interrupted. Repeated attempts to contact the personal team and learn about its fate were futile. And the permanent shelling on the side of warships and aviation of the Russian Federation did not allow to help the Marines.



In summary, we want to add, the enemy once demonstrated his essence. He proved again that there is no faith and truth in his actions and words.

And we are looking forward to our brothers and with all our soul.

What else?

Previous reporting stated that the soldiers' message went viral — and audio footage captured the moment Ukrainian soldiers told the Russian warship where to go.

""This is a Russian military ship,"" a portion of the communication said. ""I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary victims. Otherwise we will open fire on you.""

One of the soldiers took to the radio and responded, ""Russian warship, go f*** yourself!""

Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the time said that all 13 soldiers died as a result of the incursion, ""but did not surrender.""

""All of them will be named Heroes of Ukraine,"" he said. ""May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever,"" said Zelenskyy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defiant-ukrainian-soldiers-who-told-russia-go-f-yourself-and-refused-to-surrender-may-still-be-alive,2022-02-28
Dem strategist threatens 'scorched-earth' crusade against Trump's family over Hunter Biden pressure,"A Democratic strategist who served as an adviser to Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has promised to go after President Donald Trump's family if Republicans continue pressuring Hunter Biden over his Ukraine business dealings.

Timothy O'Brien said on MSNBC over the weekend that there will be a ""scorched-earth"" crusade against Trump's children if Republicans ""make an issue out of Hunter Biden.""

""If the Republicans really want to make an issue out of Hunter Biden, which is very low-hanging fruit that I don't think most Democratic voters care about anyway, there is going to be a scorched-earth response aimed at all of the Trump children that is unlike anything they've experienced thus far in the media,"" O'Brien said.

O'Brien, who is an executive editor at Bloomberg's news conglomerate, also claimed that the entire Trump family are ""grifters,"" a suggestion that their wealth is illegitimate.

""The Trump family are epic grifters, and this goes back generations,"" O'Brien said. ""Fred Trump made his money by intersecting with both the federal government and state government in New York. Donald came up through New York, intersecting with local government and in Atlantic City.""

""Now they are now in the White House, and all of them are dipping their faces into the till,"" he claimed.

When show host Joe Reid asked if his boss — former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg — would be funding the ""scorched-earth"" campaign, O'Brien said it is ""important"" for voters to see how the Trump family has earned its billions.

""I think it's an important moment for the American people to be woke about how rampant the financial conflicts of interest are among Trump's children and the president himself,"" O'Brien said.

After ending his presidential campaign last month, Bloomberg endorsed Joe Biden for president and has indicated that he will continue to use his vast fortune to ensure Trump loses re-election in November.

Democracy doomsdayism: Rep. Clyburn repeats his usual election-cycle claim that the Democratic Party's failure means the end of democracy,"Every election cycle, House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) becomes acutely aware that Democrats' failure to hold on to power might mean the end of democracy. On schedule, Clyburn has announced that ""democracy will be ended"" if Democrats do not secure a resounding victory on Tuesday.

A very German doomsday

Clyburn, the third highest-ranked Democrat in the House, previously stated that a Republican victory would be tantamount to the ""end of the world.""

Over the weekend, Clyburn told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he didn't mean to suggest a world-ending apocalypse was imminent, but rather that ""Democracy will be ending. The world would continue to exist.""

Democrat Rep Jim Clyburn Confronted Over Saying Republican Wins Mean ""End Of The World"" youtu.be

""The world was here before Hitler, the world was here after Hitler,"" Clyburn said, convinced there are parallels between the present political climate and German democracy ahead of the Hitlerian state socialists' rise to power.

Clyburn, on the ballot in South Carolina on November 8, added, ""The country is on track to repeat what happened in Germany, when it was the greatest democracy going, when it elected a chancellor that then co-opted the media.""

Clyburn favors the German parallels when denigrating his political rivals.

In July 2020, Clyburn accused the Trump administration of imposing ""Gestapo activities"" via federal police in Portland, Oregon, when cracking down on leftist terrorists. Clyburn suggested that the restoration of law and order sought by Trump was ""the beginning of the ending of this democracy.""

In 2019, Clyburn compared Trump to Hitler, claiming the former was one of ""the greatest threats to democracy in my lifetime.""

Although Democrats have long suggested their political misfortunes could only mean democracy is either broken or on its way out, the hyperbolic claim has been used extensively in recent weeks.

The Democrats' go-to conspiracy theory

Sky News host Rita Panahi noted over the weekend that while Democrats castigate Republicans and conservatives for advancing so-called (and often confirmed) ""conspiracy theories,"" they themselves peddle an incredibly destructive notion: that voters have but one choice, lest they intend to destroy American democracy.

Panahi said, ""It's clear that the Democrats from the president down are not interested in campaigning on consequential issues. ... No, they want to pretend that it's democracy itself that is on the ballot this election.""

'Democrats' propaganda arm' mimicking 'absurd narrative' that democracy is at stake youtu.be

Even Democrats find this rhetoric hollow.

Longtime Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen told CNN, ""We did not listen to voters in this election. And I think we're going to have a bad night. ... When voters tell you over and over and over again that they care mostly about the economy, listen to them. Stop talking about democracy being at stake.""

This round of democracy doomsayers



On Oct. 30 in Milwaukee, former President Barack Obama said that ""democracy is at stake in this election"" and threatened that if Republicans win on Nov. 8, ""there's no telling what might happen.""

Obama repeated this claim in Cleveland (""Democracy itself is on the ballot right now"") and in Laveen, Arizona.



Accordingly, it's not enough to vote on the issues or on the basis of individual candidates' platforms, but strictly on the basis of party affiliation.

Katie Dobbs, the Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate who refused to debate Kari Lake, made sure to clarify what the former president and other Democrats meant by democracy: ""Democracy is the system that sent Barack Obama to the White House, and democracy is the system that will send Kari Lake back to whatever dark corner of the internet she came from.""

Democracy, according to Hobbs, is that system by which Democrats attain and retain power.

On Nov. 1, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton appeared on MSNBC's ""The ReidOut"" with Joy Reid. Clinton did not use her air time to continue denying election results, but instead to suggest that entrusting power to Republicans ""is a real threat to the heart of democracy.""

According to Clinton, the way to surmount the nation's problems and to protect democracy is one-party control.

President Joe Biden similarly urged voters to ""preserve democracy [by voting Democrat] or put it at risk.""

Biden, who previously called Republicans a ""threat"" to the nation, claimed, ""American democracy is under attack ... We must vote knowing who we have been and what we're at risk of becoming. We must vote knowing what's at stake and not just the policy of the moment — but institutions that have held us together, as we've sought a more perfect union, are also at stake.""

On Sunday, the borderline octogenarian told an audience at St. Lawrence University that ""this is your generation's moment to defend [democracy]. To preserve it. To choose it.""

Washington Post columnist and Council on Foreign Relations fellow Max Boot wrote on Oct. 24 that the midterm elections ""are actually a referendum on whether you favor the continuation of democracy in America.""



Boot decried anyone who questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election while suggesting that there is only one morally legitimate outcome of the 2022 elections.

In an October interview with NBC News' Andrea Mitchell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated, ""Our democracy is at stake when you define democracy as integrity of the vote."" Pelosi used this line before.

When seeking to impeach former President Donald Trump, Pelosi said, ""Our democracy is what is at stake. The president leaves us no choice but to act.""

Previous rounds of democracy alarmism

The Hill reported that ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, former GOP mega-donor Seth Klarman told voters that they had to vote Democrat, stressing that ""democracy is at stake.""

According to Klarman, a failure to ""turn the House and Senate as a check on Donald Trump and his runaway presidency"" might amount to the end of democracy. The Republicans held the Senate, yet American democracy survived.

In August 2020, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stressed that a failure to vote out former President Donald Trump could prove to be world-ending: ""The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake.""

That same month, Obama suggested that America couldn't withstand another four years of Trump, saying, ""Embrace your own responsibility as citizens – to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in 2019 that Trump's rally jokes at Democrats' expense made it ""very clearer than ever that, literally, our democracy is at stake, our democracy at stake.""

When it came to Trump nominating a replacement for former Justice Anthony Kennedy, Pelosi said that Kennedy's successor ""could radically alter the course of American justice for decades. ... The future of our democracy is at stake.""

It's not just elections, judicial appointments, and jokes that Democrats claim put democracy at risk. Other perceived challenges to Democrats' hold on power are similarly democratic risks, such as a failure to regulate speech on social media.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democracy-doomsdayism-rep-clyburn-the-latest-democrat-to-suggest-that-his-partys-failure-means-the-end-of-democracy,2022-11-07
"'Look, I've had a bad month': Democrat megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried says he didn't 'try to commit fraud' and isn't losing too much sleep over FTX collapse","Disgraced Democrat megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO who ran his company into the ground and has been accused of substantial wrongdoing, testified on Wednesday night — not before a jury of his peers in court, but in a paid appearance at the New York Times' DealBook Summit.

The event — where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shot down a peace proposal, script-reader Ben Affleck humble-bragged about his fame, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's forays into the so-called metaverse — provided Bankman-Fried with an opportunity to complain about his recent misfortune and to displace blame about the role he played in the scandalous collapse of his crypto exchange, FTX.

What are the details?

Bankman-Fried telecommuted from the Bahamas, where he, his parents, and other FTX executives reportedly own at least $121 million in real estate, to field questions posed by New York Times columnist Andrew Sorkin.

Throughout the interview, SBF alternated between assuming and shunting responsibility for FTX's downfall.

In one instance, SBF indicated that FTX's implosion was resultant of ""a massive failure of oversight on my part.""

""Whatever happened, why it happened, I had a duty to our stakeholders, our customers, our investors, the regulators of the world, to do right by them,"" said SBF. ""Clearly I didn’t do a good job of that.""

Despite this admission, SBF went onto distance himself from his trading firm, Alameda Research, linked to FTX and its demise.

SBF said regarding the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research that he ""wasn't running Alameda, I don't know exactly what was going on.""

“I didn’t knowingly commingle funds,” SBF added.

Some, including Alex Berenson, find that hard to believe, particularly since SBF owned the lion's share of Alameda.

Decrypt reported that the blockchain data suggests the funds were commingled. Billions of dollars' worth of customer funds had reportedly been loaned out to Alameda to pay down the firm's trading losses while SBF was running the show.



SBF also claimed that he ""didn’t ever try to commit fraud on anyone.""

Bloomberg noted that, notwithstanding SBF's claims on Wednesday, there are outstanding questions about how FTX ended up with an $8 billion gap in its balance sheets.

When Sorkin asked about criminal liability, SBF squirmed uncontrollably and said, ""There’s a time and a place for me to think about myself and my own future. ... I don't think this is it.""

Without admitting to a crime, SBF did however underscore that he ""screwed up.""

The New York Times suggested that throughout the discussion, SBF sought to characterize the situation as an unintentional mistake, ""perhaps hoping to set up lack of intent for (criminal) liability purposes.""

Tough luck and good sleep for the 'next Warren Buffett'

In an apparent effort to drum up sympathy, SBF — who managed to lose approximately 94% of his estimated $15.6 billion on Election Day — told Sorkin, ""Look, I've had a bad month.""



SBF, once touted as the ""next Warren Buffett,"" told Sorkin that he now has ""close to nothing"" and had been reduced to only having one working credit card.

Despite his bad month, SBF said, ""You would’ve thought that I’d be getting no sleep right now, and instead I’m getting some.""

An alleged FTX user who likely isn't getting much sleep had his message relayed to SBF by Sorkin.

In an email with ""Sam Bankman-Fried stole $2 million from me"" in the subject line, the user wrote, ""Andrew, can you please ask SBF why he decided to steal my life savings and the $10 billion more from customers to give to his hedge fund, Alameda?""

Noting that several other letters like this had been sent in, Sorkin asked SBF, ""What do you tell this man?""

SBF, down to only one credit card, said that he was ""deeply sorry about what happened.""

The New York Times reported that among the demonstrators gathered outside the event to protest SBF's appearance was a man who identified himself as Anthony Canelo of New York, who claimed to have lost over $10,000 investing in FTX's token, FTT.

While the bankruptcy filing drawn up by FTX indicated that the company has over 100,000 creditors, CNBC reported that there could be more than one million creditors.

Backlash

Although some critical of SBF's appearance appeared to protest outside the venue, many instead took to social media to express their disdain.

American Fox Business Network financial journalist Charles Payne found it troubling that SBF should be applauded in and out of a high-profile paid speaking gig after his company's collapse left creditors facing losses exceeding billions of dollars. Payne tweeted, ""The 'elites' protect their own even under a microscope.""

Republican Rep. Lance Gooden (Texas) suggested that the left appears more outraged by Elon Musk spending billions to restore free speech on Twitter than by SBF's erasure of billions.

Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk noted that had SBF been ""the 2nd biggest donor to conservative candidates in the midterms he would be indicted by now.""

Democrat who feared Guam could 'tip over and capsize' says President Trump's height caused 'imbalance of power' with Ukraine's president,"The gems that proceed from the mouth of Democratic U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson are priceless, indeed.

Known far and wide for his outlandish statements — his doozy of all time coming in 2010 when he feared the island of Guam might ""tip over and capsize"" due to overpopulation — the Georgia congressman reloaded during Thursday's impeachment hearing and claimed that President Donald Trump's height advantage over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky created an ""imbalance of power.""

Say what?

Recalling a September United Nations meeting between the pair, Johnson said he took note of Trump ""holding court"" with his ""big chair"" compared to Zelensky's ""little chair"" — and that the Ukrainian president was ""shaking his head as if his daughter was downstairs in the basement duct-taped.""

His latter statement at least drew some laughter.

""I mean, there's [an] imbalance of power in that relationship. It always has been,"" Johnson added. ""And there's no way that the nation of Ukraine can stand up ... to the power of the United States of America. And President Trump used that unequal bargaining position.""

Hank ""Guam might tip over"" Johnson wants to impeach Trump because he is tall youtu.be

How did the White House react?

Upon hearing about Johnson's statements, the White House sarcastically tweeted, ""JUST IN: Democrats want to impeach the President for [checks notes] being too tall.""

Oh, and check out the photo of Trump and Zelensky meeting at the UN and the obvious, er, disparity between their chair sizes:

What else has Johnson uttered?



Johnson, as we've noted, is known for other oddball — and some rather disturbing — declarations:

"Michigan Democrat who spoke out against impeachment quickly flips back, now supports impeachment again","Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) made headlines when she publicly opposed impeaching President Donald Trump, even though she had voted in support of the impeachment inquiry.

Lawrence's opposition to impeachment appeared to be evidence that two weeks of public hearings in the House Intelligence Committee actually caused support for impeachment to drop among Democrats, amid reports that some are getting cold feet as a potential House vote approaches.

Well, Lawrence has now come back to the Democrats' team once again, issuing a ""clarification"" that despite her saying just two days ago that she didn't want to impeach, she actually now wants to impeach and in fact always wanted to impeach, even two years before any Ukraine issues came up.

""I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,"" Lawrence said in a statement. ""The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.""

Although she calls it a clarification, it is actually a direct contradiction to what she said Sunday on a podcast.

""We are so close to an election,"" Lawrence said Sunday. ""I will tell you, sitting here knowing how divided this country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office. I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.""

It's possible that Lawrence, who represents a heavily blue district, received a phone call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office over the past day or so, strongly encouraging her to reconsider stepping out of line and undermining an already potentially tenuous impeachment coalition in the House.

Democrats need only 218 votes in order to pass impeachment articles and send the case to the Senate for a trial, but if there are fewer than the 231 Democratic members who voted for the inquiry supporting impeachment, it will not be a strong look for the case Democrats have made that Trump should be removed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-who-spoke-out-against-impeachment-flips-back,2019-11-26
Democratic candidate with 'professional' link to CIA whistleblower is reportedly Joe Biden,"The whistleblower whose complaint became the catalyst for the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump had a ""professional"" link to a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful — and a bombshell report from The Washington Examiner says that candidate is Joe Biden.

What are the details?

Details about the original whistleblower have been revealed in piecemeal fashion, with The New York Times reporting that the person is a CIA officer, CNN revealing that the individual is a registered Democrat, and The Examiner exposing Tuesday that the whistleblower had ""professional"" ties to one of the Democratic candidates (citing sources familiar with a statement from Intelligence Community inspector general Michael Atkinson).

In a new report published Wednesday evening, The Examiner detailed how the whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, revealed on Twitter that his client ""spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the executive branch,"" and ""has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials — not as candidates.""



""From everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch then,"" a retired CIA officer told the outlet, ""there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president.""

A former Trump administration official speaking on condition of anonymity told The Examiner that the whistleblower — known to have deep knowledge of Ukraine — could have worked with Biden either at the CIA or when the individual was detailed to the National Security Council at the White House during the Obama administration.

""This person, after working with Biden, may feel defensive towards him because he feels [Biden] is being falsely attacked. Maybe he is even talking to Biden's staff,"" the former official asserted. ""Maybe it is innocent, maybe not.""

Anything else?

The revelation that the whistleblower is linked to Biden is sure to further deepen speculation that the complaint was politically motivated.

While Democrats accuse President Trump of using his office to ""dig up dirt"" on a political opponent — meaning Biden — further details continue to emerge about deals made during Biden's tenure as vice president, and over allegations that his son, Hunter Biden, secured lucrative contracts from foreign firms in countries where Joe Biden was President Barack Obama's ""front man.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-candidate-with-professional-link-to-cia-whistleblower-is-reportedly-joe-biden,2019-10-11
Democratic congressman claims Bolton tipped him off about looking into ousted Ukraine ambassador after leaving WH,"A top House Democrat said Wednesday that former national security adviser John Bolton tipped him off months ago about the ouster of a former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine.

In a statement sent out shortly before the Senate's impeachment trial resumed on Wednesday, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) issued a statement saying that Bolton got in touch with him in September and said to look into the removal of Marie Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

""President Trump is wrong that John Bolton didn't say anything about the Trump-Ukraine Scandal at the time the President fired him,"" Engel's statement revealed. ""He said something to me.""

Engel explained that his staff reached out to Bolton on Sept. 19, shortly after he departed his job at the White House, at Engel's request, explaining that the two ""have a cordial and respectful relationship and I wanted to thank him for his service."" At the time, Engel said that Bolton's ouster was proof that the administration's foreign policy was ""in complete disarray.""

When Bolton returned Engel's call on Sept. 23, the statement said, ""Ambassador Bolton suggested to me — unprompted — that the committee look into the recall of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal as our top diplomat in Kyiv.""

Engel's statement added that he didn't say anything publicly about it because it was a private conversation, ""but because this detail was relevant to the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight Committees' investigation into this matter, I informed my investigative colleagues. It was one of the reasons we wished to hear from Ambassador Bolton, under oath, in a formal setting.""

The question of President Trump's motives for recalling Yovanovitch from her post in Ukraine became one of the many focal points of the House's impeachment investigation last year, with Democrats contending it was a part of an administration pressure campaign to get Ukrainian officials to look into allegations of corruption involving the Bidens. Yovanovitch herself appeared as a witness both during the closed-door and public hearing portions of the House's probe.

A Sept. 23 phone call between Bolton and Engel would have put their conversation just a day ahead of the announcement of ""an official impeachment inquiry"" by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

""Ambassador Bolton has made clear over the last few months that he has more to say on this issue,"" Engel said. ""And now that the President has called his credibility into question, it's important to set the record straight.""

Engel's statement came as allegations about the withholding of Ukraine aid contained in Bolton's forthcoming book have sparked a re-intensified debate about whether or not to call Bolton as an impeachment trial witness. While things still remain in flux on the testimony question, multiple Hill Republicans have dismissed the impact that Bolton's testimony might have on the overall case.

But whether Engel's statement will have any bearing on Senate Republicans' overall willingness to draw out the length of the trial with more testimony remains to be seen.



""This is hardly groundbreaking or relevant,"" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) — one of the House Republicans on President Trump's impeachment team — tweeted in the wake of Engel's statement. ""The more noteworthy item is that this is magically coming out 127 days into this impeachment process —on the eve of President Trump being acquitted, as Democrats rapidly lose momentum. You can smell their desperation.""

When asked whether he was concerned about whether the new information would motivate his GOP colleagues to call for Bolton's testimony, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told reporters ""I don't think so. That particularly? I doubt it."" He added that ""I think if they want to, they will.""

Democratic congressman wants answers on Joe Biden’s discussions about son’s business dealings,"A Democratic House member said Monday that he wants ""an explanation"" on former Vice President Joe Biden's dubious claim that he never discussed his son Hunter BIden's business dealings in the Ukraine.

Hunter Biden's ties to Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma — which employed him as a board member — is at the center of a recent media firestorm over a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump reportedly urged Zelensky to look into a probe of the company and Hunter Biden.

At a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations event, Biden said that he — while still vice president — pressured then-Ukranain president Petro Poroshenko to fire then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was leading an investigation into the company by threatening to withhold $1billion in U.S. loan guarantees.

Over the weekend, the former vice president told Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" However, in a July article from The New Yorker titled ""Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father's Campaign?"" the younger Biden says that he discussed his relationship with Burisma ""just once."" In December 2015, the article said, an Obama administration official raised the issue with then Vice President Biden. Hunter told the magazine that, ""Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.'""

When asked about the disparities about the Bidens' different stories Monday morning on CNN, Rep. Vicente Gonzales (D-Texas) told host Poppy Harlow that ""clearly something needs to be cleared up at this point. So yes, of course I would want an explanation on that.""

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin calls for censure of President Trump,"Moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) on Monday called for the upper chamber to censure President Donald Trump over the allegations House Democrats made against the president in the impeachment trial, saying he believes a partisan impeachment would further divide the country and arguing that the condemnation of President Trump's alleged actions (without removal from office) would have bipartisan support.

Manchin has not disclosed how he plans to vote on the articles of impeachment, slated for Wednesday.

What are the details?

""The purpose of impeachment is not to punish the president, but to protect the public,"" Manchin argued from the Senate floor. ""The ultimate question is not whether the president's conduct warrants his removal from office, but whether our nation is better served by his removal by the Senate now — with impeachment — or by the decision the voters will make in November.""



""Never before in the history of our Republic has there been a purely partisan impeachment vote of a president,"" the West Virginia Democrat continued. ""Removing this president at this time would not only further divide our deeply divided nation, but also further poison our toxic political atmosphere.""

Sen. Manchin explained, ""I see no path to the 67 votes required to impeach President Trump, and haven't since this trial started. However, I do believe a bipartisan majority of this body would vote to censure President Trump for his actions.""

He reasoned, ""Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines, and as an equal branch of government, to formally denounce the president's actions and hold him accountable.""

""His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate, and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behavior in the strongest terms,"" Manchin added. ""History will judge the Senate for how we have handled this solemn constitutional duty, and without bipartisan action



The resolution proposed by Sen. Manchin states that President Trump used his office ""to attempt to compel a foreign nation to interfere with domestic political affairs for his own personal benefit,"" and ""wrongfully enlisted his personal lawyers to investigate a domestic political rival by meddling in formal diplomatic relations in a manner that is inconsistent with our established National Security Strategy.""

It further states that the president ""hindered the thorough investigation of related documents and prohibited Congress and the American people from hearing testimony by first-hand witnesses with direct knowledge of his conduct.""



Anything else?

There appears to be little appetite from Senate Republicans or Democrats for Manchin's motion to censure President Trump.

The Hill reported that ""Manchin's proposal has received little traction among Senate Republicans who control the schedule, but it could gain the support of a handful of Republicans who have expressed concerns over Trump's actions,"" namely Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Mitt Romney (Utah).

According to The Washington Post, ""several Democrats also said they were unsold on censure, calling it a punishment well short of what Trump deserves.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-sen-joe-manchin-calls-for-censure-of-president-trump,2020-02-04
Democratic senator asks DOJ and FBI to not cooperate with colleagues' Ukraine-Chalupa probe,"The top Democrat on an important Senate committee is asking that the Trump administration not cooperate with an investigation into a Ukraine-related investigation being conducted by two of his Republican colleagues.



In a letter first reported by The Daily Beast on Thursday, Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) urged Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray not to comply with a November request from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) for information about Alexandra Chalupa, the former Democratic National Committee contractor who has been accused of working with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on the 2016 Trump campaign.

The request that Wyden is referring to was sent to the DOJ and FBI in November and was part of Grassley's and Johnson's committees' ""ongoing investigation into collusive actions Chalupa and the DNC took to use foreign government sources to undermine the Trump campaign during the 2016 election."" Grassley chairs the Senate Finance Committee while Johnson heads up the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.

In the November letter, the two chairmen cited a Russian cyberattack that Chalupa reportedly experienced while working for the DNC during the 2016 campaign and subsequently reported to the feds. The letter contends that the attack happened while Chalupa was ""reportedly trying to find dirt"" on then-candidate Donald Trump and former campaign manager Paul Manafort ""in order to undermine his presidential campaign"" and in turn, asks for ""all records relating to the DOJ's or FBI's interview of Chalupa"" as well as ""all records relating to the imaging of Chalupa's laptop and smartphone.""

But Wyden wrote Thursday that the request was ""outrageous"" and warned that it would have negative consequences for national security and civil liberties, if fulfilled.

""The Senators' request will have a chilling effect on the victims of nation-state cyber-attacks and would discourage them from seeking law enforcement assistance, thereby jeopardizing our national security, limiting our ability to respond to sophisticated cyber-attacks, and undermining the civil liberties of American citizens,"" Wyden wrote.

Wyden also accused his two Republican colleagues of trying to ""enlist the FBI and Department of Justice in their efforts to legitimize Russian propaganda"" via their Ukraine probe.

""The FBI is not a political weapon and should be pressured into violating a citizen's civil liberties for political gain,"" he added.

In a statement to The Daily Beast, a Grassley staffer said, ""Wyden's letter conflates Russian propaganda efforts with unrelated reports of potential election interference that have yet to be fully investigated. ... It's disappointing that Sen. Wyden has decided to ignore legitimate questions about election security and instead regurgitate misleading liberal talking points to quash scrutiny of reported election tampering by a Democratic political operative.""

In addition to the Chalupa-Ukraine issue, Grassley and Johnson have also started looking into questions regarding Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, its former board member Hunter Biden, and the Obama administration's State Department. In November, the pair sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting information in an effort ""to better understand what actions, if any, the Obama administration took to ensure that policy decisions relating to Ukraine and Burisma were not improperly influenced by the employment and financial interests of family members.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-senator-asks-doj-and-fbi-to-not-cooperate-with-colleagues-ukraine-chalupa-probe,2020-01-17
"Democratic senator calls out House for not fighting to get Bolton, Mulvaney to testify: 'makes it very difficult'","A Democratic senator questioned why the House of Representatives, in its monthslong impeachment inquiry, didn't fight harder to have key witnesses testify before voting to adopt articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, according to Roll Call.

As impeachment hits a stalemate over Senate trial rules and potential witnesses, West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said the House made things more difficult by not going to court in order to force people like White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton to testify.

""I don't know why the House ... didn't go to court. You know, why they didn't go after these witnesses that are so pertinent to the whole accusation. That makes it very difficult,"" Manchin said. ""Hindsight's 20/20. I can't tell you what was in their mind, why they did what they did, but they had the ability to go to court, subpoena these witnesses and make sure they testify, either in closed — in a closed deposition or whatever. Bolton had firsthand information. Mulvaney has firsthand information, and there's a lot of people on the front lines.""

House Democrats made the decision to proceed with a quicker impeachment inquiry process instead of engaging in the potentially lengthy legal battle that would've been required to force Mulvaney and Bolton to comply with subpoenas to testify. As a result, most witnesses did not have direct conversations with Trump about his Ukraine dealings.

The one witness who had spoken directly to Trump, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was a relatively unreliable witness due to his spotty memory and lack of contemporaneous documentation of conversations and events.

Mulvaney would be able to speak directly to the details behind the delay in military aid to Ukraine, as he is also the head of the Office of Management and Budget, in addition to his role as acting chief of staff. His comments at a news conference that linked the aid to investigations Trump requested of Ukraine into the 2016 election and the Bidens have been used against Trump.

Bolton's knowledge and perspective on the Ukraine saga is somewhat unclear, but his close involvement is undeniable, as many of the witnesses who did testify spoke about Bolton's apparent discomfort with the situation. Bolton himself has hinted at key knowledge, but did not volunteer testimony.

Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is threatening to withhold articles of impeachment from the Senate until the two sides reach an agreement on how the trial will go — including Democrats' ability to call Mulvaney and Bolton as witnesses.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-senator-calls-out-house-for-not-fighting-to-get-bolton-mulvaney,2019-12-19
Democrats are outraged at Giuliani's 'stomach-turning' mission to hurt Biden's campaign,"Democratic politicians are expressing their outrage over the declared mission from Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney of President Donald Trump, to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.

Giuliani said that he is going to investigate reports that Biden might have corrupt dealings that benefitted his son when he connected to a company in Ukraine.

But Democrats saw this as another example of Trump officials seeking foreign interference in a U.S. election. Biden is currently the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called the investigation ""highly unethical"" and said Giuliani needs to ""just back off!""

""I just think it is highly unethical for the president's personal lawyer to go meet with officials from foreign government to see if they can influence somehow the upcoming presidential election,"" said Warren. ""We've had enough of that and Rudy Giuliani should just back off!""



Sen. Dick Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called Giuliani's mission ""stomach-turning,"" and said it might even be criminal.

"Democrats block bill that would restart Keystone pipeline, boost US energy production","House Democrats this week blocked a motion to consider a Republican bill that would reauthorize construction of the TransCanada Keystone pipeline and restart the federal oil leasing program, among other things, in an effort to boost domestic energy production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Daily Caller reported.

The legislation — called the American Energy Independence from Russia Act — was introduced in the House by Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Natural Resources Committee ranking member Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) on Feb. 28. The bicameral bill was also introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) on March 3.

It comes at a time when gas prices are skyrocketing in the U.S. due to private-sector boycotts and a public-sector embargo on imports of Russian oil in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The global energy supply disruption has exposed the West's reliance on Russian energy sources and thus renewed calls to bolster American energy independence.

Republicans have argued for years that the U.S. should seek energy independence as a matter of national security, and the current conflict with Russia has undoubtedly served to strengthen the argument.

Yet, according to the Daily Caller, on Wednesday evening, 219 Democrats in the House voted down a motion to consider the legislation. The Epoch Times reported that a motion to consider the bill was also shot down by Democrats on March 1.

The legislation would immediately reauthorize the construction of the Keystone pipeline from Canada to Montana and restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, both of which were suspended by the Biden administration last year.

It would also require the Biden administration to submit an energy security plan to Congress within 30 days that would grow America’s oil and natural gas production to offset Russian imports.

In a joint statement to introduce the legislation, Reps. McMorris Rodgers and Westerman said, ""Putin and Russia’s economy are dependent upon dominating energy production and exporting to other nations. He gains power by doing so, and it’s what funds his military and aggressive behavior. To counter Putin, our bill flips the switch to promote American energy jobs, production, and exports.""

The president was torched on social media this week after he begged foreign despots and dictators to increase their oil production in response to the global energy crisis rather than unleashing America's energy resources.

In a floor speech in support of the bill Wednesday, Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw (Texas) slammed President Joe Biden for his energy policies.

""This week our president — our American president — asked Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, asked them to boost their output so that American consumers wouldn’t see a spike in gas prices,"" Crenshaw said.

He added, ""Surely, [Biden] knows we can also boost domestic production right here at home. Surely he knows that domestic production supports American jobs, and surely he knows that domestic production is cleaner, by far, than foreign production.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-block-bill-that-would-restart-keystone-pipeline-boost-us-energy-production,2022-03-11
"Democrats filibuster Nord Stream 2 sanctions bill, invoking tool 'overwhelmingly used by racists'","Senate Democrats on Thursday defeated an attempted by Republicans to impose sanctions on businesses tied to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry natural gas from Russia to the German coast. They invoked a tool ""overwhelmingly used by racists"" to do so, according to academics.



The Senate voted 55-44 on legislation introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that would have ended the pipeline project, which is supported by Russian President Vladimir Putin and opposed by American allies in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has called the pipeline ""an existential treat to our security,"" as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on its border with Ukraine and is believed to be preparing to invade. The pipeline would allow Russia to directly export natural gas to Western Europe, allowing energy to flow uninterrupted in the event of war.



His sanctions bill had majority support. Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wisc.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Jacky Rosen (Nev.), and Raphael Warnock (Ga.), along with almost every Republican — Sen. Rand Paul (R-K.y.) being the lone GOP “no” vote — voted in support of Cruz’s bill. But a majority in the United States Senate is not enough to pass bills, thanks to what former President Barack Obama has called a ""Jim Crow relic.""

Yes indeed, Senate Democrats invoked the legislative filibuster to block Cruz's bill from passing. Their use of a filibuster created a 60-vote threshold to pass the Nord Stream 2 sanctions, and the bipartisan majority of senators came up five votes short of passing the bill.

The Biden White House opposed the sanctions bill, arguing it would hurt U.S. relations with Germany. The president's team lobbied lawmakers to withhold support from the bill, setting up meetings to brief senators on Ukraine, The Hill reports.



Cruz has for months argued that sanctions are needed to prevent the pipeline from becoming operational and to deter Russian aggression.

“The eyes of history are upon us today. Each of us will be faced with a momentous question: Can we put petty differences aside and can we come together to defend our friend and our ally Ukraine against imminent Russian aggression?” Cruz asked on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.

But Democrats used the filibuster to block the sanctions from passing.



Some may call this action by Democrats to stop Cruz's bill flagrantly hypocritical. After all, President Joe Biden as recently as Tuesday called on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster, claiming it has been ""weaponized and abused"" by Republicans to obstruct his agenda.

But others might say Democrats are being consistent, as in the past Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have defended the filibuster as ""an important check and balance"" that must be ""preserved, not vaporized."" Biden, once a senator himself, said the filibuster is ""about compromise and moderation"" in a 2005 speech he described as ""one of the most important speeches for historical purposes that I will have given in the 32 years since I have been in the Senate.""

Either way, Senate observers would do well to remember that the Democrats in charge are still politicians — they will use what tools they have to exercise power when it favors them and throw a temper tantrum when the other side does the same thing. This episode with the Nord Stream 2 sanctions bill is case in point.

Democrats plan to fight potential Roe overturning — by sending out Kamala Harris. What could go wrong?,"Pro-abortion Democrats outraged over news that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn its landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade are looking to Vice President Kamala Harris to be their champion. But Democrats should be warned; that strategy has been tried before, and failed.

What are the details?

The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that the embattled vice president ""is likely to play an expanded role in pushing the Democrats’ political case on protecting abortion rights"" ahead of a formal ruling on the matter, expected sometime this summer.

In a statement issued Tuesday in response to a leaked draft memo of the forthcoming decision, Harris took hold of her vaunted position and proclaimed, ""This is the time to fight for women.""

""Opponents of Roe want to punish women and take away their rights to make decisions about their own bodies. Republican legislators in states across the country are weaponizing the use of the law against women,"" the vice president argued.

She added: ""The rights of all Americans are at risk. If the right to privacy is weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your life. This is the time to fight for women and for our country with everything we have.""

Harris's combative statement was met with a positive response from abortion advocates on social media, many of whom are enraged over the notion that the right to an abortion — which was invented out of thin air in Roe — could soon be sent back to the states for deliberation.

They want to see national Democrats step up and do something. The current idea being postulated is to eliminate the filibuster and codify abortion rights in federal law.

""This is a moment that @VP should step up, must step up and lead,"" tweeted author David Rothkopf.

Daily Beast columnist Wajahat Ali added, ""Kamala Harris can emerge and own this moment ... She is the first Black female VP. She can marshall this energy and try to galvanize it.""

Others on social media concurred with the opinion.

The Los Angeles Times even added that Harris ""would be a natural point person for the administration to vocally raise the issue on the midterm campaign trail"" thanks to her gender and her longstanding support for abortion.



""She’s been a champion of the pro-choice movement for a long time,"" noted Karen Finney, a NARAL Pro-Choice America board member and Harris ally. ""She is a very important messenger to talk about the impact that this is going to have on women — from a health perspective, from the perspective of our bodily autonomy, from the perspective of rights, as a former attorney general.""

What's the problem?

The problem for Democrats is this: Harris is historically unpopular and has failed remarkably at every initiative she's been tasked with leading as vice president — be that the border crisis, Russia-Ukraine diplomacy, or management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In fact, Republicans will likely welcome the news that Harris may be tapped to lead on the abortion issue.

Early in President Biden's term, Harris was named point person on the unprecedented immigration crisis on the southern border. She responded by never so much as making a trip to the border and ultimately unveiling a vague, ""root causes"" strategy with no ""detailed timeline or specific policy actions to be taken."" She has since moved on from that task, yet the border assault still rages.

Late last year, she created a significant snafu for the Biden administration when she confusingly stated that the administration ""didn't see"" waves of virus variants ""coming.""

Most recently, Harris embarrassed herself after being dispatched to Germany to meet with top European leaders in hopes of deescalating the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and decreasing the chances of war. During the meeting, she declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""made his decision"" to invade Ukraine while also promising that the U.S. would ""absolutely"" deter Putin from invading Ukraine.

Harris's failures have resulted in her earning a historically low 28% approval rating and caused many of her senior staff to resign in attempt to save their own careers.

But now, she apparently hopes to turn the tides on her disappointing vice presidency by saving the day on one of the most consequential issues in modern American history.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-look-to-vp-harris-in-abortion-fight,2022-05-03
"Top Biden pollster issues dire warning that 'pissed' Americans 'don't feel Democrats can get their s**t together,' says Dems are facing bloodbath in midterm elections","John Anzalone served as chief pollster for Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign, as well as for the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Anzalone has done polling for numerous other Democrats, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona. However, Anzalone was critical of Democrats in a recent podcast, where he voiced his fears that Democrats could get wiped out in the 2022 midterm elections.

In the recent episode of Politico's ""Playbook Deep Dive"" that was released on Friday, Anzalone warned that Americans are ""pissed."" The political strategist is extremely concerned that Democrats could get obliterated in the midterms – where they'll need to ""compete"" just to not get their ""a**es kicked.""

Host Ryan Lizza asked Anzalone, ""Let's just start off with how bad are things for Democrats this year and what can they do about it?""

Anzalone noted that American voters are always asking politicians, ""What have you done for me lately?” He adds, ""And they don’t feel Democrats can get their s**t together and get things done.""

""No one's going to sit there as a Democratic consultant and try to bulls**t you that this is anything but a really sour environment for Democrats,"" Anzalone admitted. ""So we better look at the strategic ways that we can compete, right? Just compete to not get our asses kicked.""



""Most Americans are pissed at the fact that they pay their fair share in taxes as middle-class people,"" the top Biden pollster expressed. ""They work hard. They want to see the benefits of the economy.""

He said that workers are getting pay increases; however, he acknowledged that the record inflation is ""eating it up.""

Anzalone asserted that voters are also ""pissed"" about ""big companies not paying any taxes."" He then commended President Biden's proposed tax hike on Americans making more than $400,000.

As a solution for Democrats to try to not get totally destroyed in the midterm elections, Anzalone proposed that Democrats should focus on doing something about health insurance costs, prescription drug costs, elderly care, and childcare. He speculates that if Democrats can show that they're helping working families that it will enable them to contend with several issues that are dragging down President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party – such as inflation, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the border crisis, and the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal.

Anzalone recommended that Democrats push a pro-union approach in areas that have a ""union culture.""

He said that the party needs to do better with male voters of all races, as well as college-educated men. The pollster said he is deeply concerned about male Latinos leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Republicans.

He advised Democrats to stop talking to Latinos about immigration, and to focus their message on the economy, inflation, healthcare, or schools. Anzalone suggested that Dems zero in on ""things like housing and crime"" when trying to woo Latino and black voters.

MSNBC opinion columnist Michael Cohen is also warning Democrats that they are facing a ""bloodbath"" in the midterm elections.

Citing record inflation, Cohen stated, ""It's precisely the kind of news that will compound the Democrats' political woes in November, which already looked dire.""

Cohen felt there was little the Democrats could do to prevent a demoralizing defeat in November.

""Rather than fight the prevailing political winds, Democrats would be better off acknowledging the reality that the midterm elections are going to be a bloodbath and focus instead on accomplishing as much as possible before then — the politics be damned,"" Cohen advocated. ""With the political situation looking increasingly bleak, Democrats have only one real option: pass their agenda.""

"Top Democrats are now trying to de-legitimize the 2020 election, say it has already been 'corrupted'","Not a single vote has been cast in the 2020 election, but top House Democrats are already beginning to de-legitimize its outcome.

In a joint Sunday morning television show appearance on ABC's ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) implied that next year's election may have already been ""corrupted"" by President Donald Trump and his campaign.

Stephanopoulos asked Schiff to react to the news that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Guiliani, was in Ukraine as recently as early December to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country. It is common and legal for political campaigns to conduct opposition research of their opponents.

Schiff and Nadler question the 'election's integrity'

""This misconduct goes on,"" Schiff, who described Guiliani's trip as a ""threat to our election's integrity,"" said.



The House Democrat added that the Trump campaign's opposition research effort represents ""a clear and present danger, I think, to our democracy and not something we can turn away from simply because the Republicans in the House refuse to do their duty and continue to put the person of the president above their constitutional obligation."" Schiff also accused Trump and Giuliani of conducting a ""sham investigation"" and trying to ""cheat in the next election.""

Nadler agreed with his colleague's characterization, telling Stephanopoulos that the Trump campaign's research into Biden represents ""a total threat"" to the 2020 election.

""This is a crime in progress against the Constitution and against American democracy,"" he said. ""We cannot take the risk that the next election will be corrupted through foreign interference solicited by the president, which he's clearly trying to do.""

Impeachment efforts are backfiring

The congressmen's comments come as recent polls show the favorability ratings of 2020 Democratic candidates are in decline and that Democrats are failing to persuade voters, particularly in swing states, that the president's dealings with Ukraine merit his removal from office.

At a media briefing on Thursday, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale told reporters that the Democrats' impeachment efforts are bolstering the president's re-election efforts.

""They have ignited a flame underneath that, with 300-some days to go, actually makes our job easier in some ways,"" Parscale said. ""This lit up our base. Turnout for our rallies has increased since the impeachment process started. I think it's a huge miscalculation by [Democrats].""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats_delegitimize_election,2019-12-15
Democratic leader admits they expect to 'lose some' members in 'divisive' impeachment vote,"House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said on a TV appearance on Friday that he expects to lose Democratic members when the House votes on whether to impeach President Donald Trump.

CNN anchor John Berman asked Clyburn how many House Democrats he expects to lose while noting that he knows of at least two Democratic representatives who will not be voting to impeach the president.

""Well, we do expect to lose some, and that's why I said it's a conscience vote and it's with their constituents. We have a very diverse caucus,"" the veteran lawmaker responded.



Not whipping 'divisive' impeachment votes

Clyburn added that his office does not plan to whip up impeachment votes and acknowledged the issue is dividing House members and Americans.

""I think that when it comes to something so divisive as impeachment, we have to leave members up to their own consciences, their own constituents, and what they think is in the best interest of their love for country,"" he said.

He added, ""So, I think it would be a bit unseemly for us to go out whipping up a vote on something like this. This is too serious, this is too much about preserving this great Republic.""

Bragged about having the votes to impeach Trump in June

As Townhall noted, Clyburn's tone was significantly different this week when compared to his previous comments during an interview with CNN host Jake Tapper in June where he boasted—before the Ukraine scandal broke—that Democrats had the votes to impeach Trump and could do so when needed.

""All it takes is 218 votes to effectively impeach the president,"" Clyburn told Tapper at the time. ""What Nancy Pelosi is trying to do and the rest of us in the House of Representatives is to develop a process by which we can efficiently move on this issue so that when we get to a vote it would be something that she calls 'iron clad,' I call 'effective.' And that's why we're trying to take our time and do this right.""

Clyburn's acknowledgment this week that Democratic leaders will likely lose members of their caucus in an impeachment vote comes as several surveys have shown that swing state voters are unimpressed by the case that Democrats made against Trump. TheBlaze reported on Tuesday that the Washington Post's polling experts analyzed a dozen polls conducted in eight battleground states and found that 51 percent of voters are opposed to impeachment and 44 percent support the effort.

""Battleground state polls show a more negative reaction to the impeachment inquiry, signaling more risk to Democrats and potential benefit for Trump,"" the researchers noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats_expect_to_lose_votes_impeachment_clyburn,2019-12-07
"Leaked focus group results reveal Democrats' impeachment messaging plans, weak legal case","What happened to quid pro quo?

As political observers noticed this week, the Democrats have a new messaging strategy in their impeachment inquiry of President Trump: accuse him of ""bribery"" in his dealings with Ukraine.

The shift came after focus groups in battleground states by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed that voters were less receptive to the Latin legal term ""quid pro quo"" (which means this for that) than to charges of ""bribery."" The latter, according to sources familiar with the focus group results, is likelier to persuade swing voters, said National Review.

""It's probably best not to use Latin words""

As the Washington Post points out, House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) was the first to announce Democrats' intentions to retire ""quid pro quo"" during an appearance on ""Meet the Press"" last week where he said ""it's probably best not to use Latin words"" when describing the administration's negotiations with Ukrainian officials.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi subsequently began accusing Trump of ""bribery"" during a press conference on Thursday. ""Talking Latin around here: E pluribus unum — from many, one. Quid pro quo — bribery. And that is in the Constitution, attached to the impeachment proceedings,"" she said.

As Pelosi noted, a likely reason why Democrats have replaced quid pro quo with ""bribery"" is that the latter is one of only two crimes cited in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. Article II of the Constitution states that the president ""shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

It's imprecise

However, the Post also noted that even Hines recognizes that while ""bribery"" may be a politically useful term for Democrats, it may be imprecise to describe the allegations.

""Abuse of power is not necessarily a concept that most Americans run around thinking about,"" he said. ""In this case, the abuse of power was some combination of bribery and extortion.""

It is also unclear what Democrats argue is the alleged bribe in question since Democrats do not have any witnesses with direct knowledge of Trump's state of mind during his dealings with Ukraine and foreign aid is regularly conditioned upon specific actions by other countries, including combatting corruption.

They're trying to see what sticks

Republicans were quick to point out that the change in messaging underscores that Democrats do not have a compelling legal case against President Trump and are, instead, relying on emotional appeals.

""They're trying a different narrative to see if that works,"" said House Intelligence Republican Brad Wenstrup (Ohio). ""'Quid pro quo' was squashed. If it wasn't, they would still be saying it, right? And, so, now they'll try a different term.""

Further bolstering the argument that Democrats do not intend on making a serious legal argument, as former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has argued, is the fact that Democrats can accuse the president of bribery without having to prove he actually broke the law.

""This is not a bribery prosecution in a judicial court. This is impeachment, in which there is no burden to prove a quid pro quo beyond a reasonable doubt. The House is not required to establish a felony offense, such as extortion or bribery.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats_focus_group_memo_impeachment_bribery,2019-11-17
Former federal prosecutor identifies major 'hole' in the impeachment case against President Trump,"Former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy says there is a major ""hole"" in the Democrats' impeachment case against President Donald Trump.

McCarthy wrote in National Review that it's obvious that the Democrats obviously ""do not have an offense sufficiently grave for invocation of the Constitution's nuclear option."" If they had one, McCarthy said, their ""machinations and the posturing would be unnecessary — even ridiculous.""

The former Assistant United Stated Attorney for the Southern District of New York then asked, ""Why are we talking about how Chairman Schiff, Speaker Pelosi, and House Democrats rushed through the impeachment inquiry without making a real effort to interview key witnesses?""

Tough questions for Democrats

McCarthy, who led the prosecution of 12 terrorists involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other plots against New York City, laid out a series of questions that demonstrate the tenuous nature of the Democrats' impeachment case against President Trump.

Why was the Democrats' impeachment gambit driven by the election calendar rather than the nature of the president's offense? Why were the timing of hearings and the unreasonable limits imposed on Republicans' ability to call witnesses dictated by the frantic rush to get done before Christmas recess — to the point that Democrats cynically vacated a subpoena they'd served on a relevant administration witness, fearing a few weeks of court battles that they might lose?



Why did Democrats grope from week to week in a struggle over what to call the misconduct they accused the president of committing – campaign finance, extortion, quid pro quo, bribery? How did they end up with an amorphous ""abuse of power"" case? How did they conclude that an administration that goes to court rather than instantly surrendering potentially privileged information commits obstruction?



Why such tedious recriminations over adoption of Senate procedures that were approved by a 100–0 vote the last time there was an impeachment trial? Why all the kvetching over whether witnesses will be called when those procedures provide for the calling of witnesses in the likely event that 51 senators — after hearing nearly two weeks of presentation and argument from both sides — want to hear from one or two of them?

""None of this would have happened,"" he added, ""if there had been a truly impeachable offense.""

The founders reserved impeachment for 'extraordinary wrongs'

McCarthy argued that if the Democrats suspected Trump of committing truly impeachable offenses, they would have allowed his lawyers to be present during the House hearings.

""Democratic leaders would have worked cooperatively with their GOP counterparts, as was done in prior impeachments,"" he wrote. ""They would have told the president: 'Sure, you can have your lawyers here, and call whatever witnesses you want.'""

The former prosecutor also noted that the framers of the Constitution expected presidents and federal officials to occasionally abuse their powers, but that impeachment and removal from federal offices was only intended to be used for ""extraordinary"" crimes.

""We don't leap from abuse to expulsion. We don't expect routinely to expel members of Congress or impeach presidents and judges. That is reserved for historically extraordinary wrongs."" Instead, McCarthy argued, that lesser abuses of power are to be checked by other branches and elections, not impeachment.

McCarthy concluded by arguing that although Trump's dealings with Ukraine are a legitimate 2020 issue, by exaggerating their severity, the Democrats have underscored that they do not amount to the kinds of ""extraordinary wrongs"" that merit impeachment.

""If there were real impeachable misconduct, there would be no time or place for games,"" he wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats_weak_impeach_mccarthy,2020-01-18
Dems introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,"House Democrats have unveiled their articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, accusing him of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress' attempts to investigate him.

""Today, in service to our duty to the Constitution and to our country, the House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment, charging the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, with committing high crimes and misdemeanors,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said. ""The first article is for abuse of power. It is an impeachable offense for the president to exercise the powers of his public office to obtain an improper personal benefit while ignoring or injuring the national interest. That is exactly what President Trump did when he solicited and pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 presidential election.""

Furthermore, ""when he was caught,"" Nadler said, ""when the House investigated and opened an impeachment inquiry, President Trump engaged in unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of the impeachment inquiry. This gives rise to the second article of impeachment for obstruction of Congress.

""Our president holds the ultimate public trust,"" Nadler said. ""When he betrays that trust and puts himself before country, he endangers the Constitution, he endangers our democracy, and he endangers our national security.""

The articles were announced at a news conference in the Capitol on Tuesday morning, just one day after the House Judiciary Committee held its second public hearing of the impeachment process — where lawmakers heard presentations from staff lawyers — and less than a week after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Democrats to move forward with impeachment articles.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) called impeachment ""an extraordinary remedy"" for presidential behavior ""and one that I've been reluctant to recommend until the actions of President Trump gave Congress no alternative.""

Schiff also addressed questions about why congressional investigators wouldn't wait and go through the courts to get witnesses and testimony that the White House refused to provide during the the House's investigation. The California Democrat explained that doing so could take several months and would amount to letting Trump ""cheat in one more election.""

Notably absent from the proposed articles are charges of bribery, an impeachable offense listed in the Constitution, that Democrats reportedly started accusing the president of as the result of focus group testing in battleground states after the term ""quid pro quo"" didn't seem to resonate with voters.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) slammed the articles as ""baseless"" and ""partisan"" in a tweet. ""The facts aren't on their side. This is a pathetic political mission to try to rig 2020 against [President Trump].""

The Trump campaign fired back at the announcement with a statement accusing the Democrats of using impeachment to compensate for weak election prospects.

""For months, Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn't move forward on impeachment because it was too divisive and it needed bipartisan support,"" the statement from campaign manager Brad Parscale said. ""Well, it is divisive and only the Democrats are pushing it, but she's doing it anyway. Americans don't agree with this rank partisanship, but Democrats are putting on this political theater because they don't have a viable candidate for 2020 and they know it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dems-articles-of-impeachment-abuse-of-power-obstruction-of-congress,2019-12-10
Three Democratic House committees issue subpoena to Rudy Giuliani,"Three Democratically controlled House committees sent a subpoena to Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, for documents related to the controversial phone call between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president.

The letter to Giuliani was published Monday from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

""Pursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule,"" read the letter.

Democrats gave Giuliani an Oct. 15 deadline for the documents.

""The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,"" the letter explained, ""as well as any efforts to cover up these matters.""

Democrats went on to cite statements Giuliani made on CNN where he admitted to asking the Ukrainian government to look into corruption related to Joe Biden's son.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has cited the call as the rationale behind the commencement of an impeachment inquiry by the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives.

Giuliani has said that if he were subpoenaed that he might fight it, and he called Democrats a ""sad joke"" over the accusations in the Ukrainian controversy.

Dems contend Trump committed ‘multiple federal crimes’ worth at least 20 years in prison in Judiciary Committee summary report,"In a House Judiciary Committee report set to accompany articles of impeachment this week, Democratic lawmakers contend that President Donald Trump committed ""multiple federal crimes"" worth at least 20 years in prison.

According to Politico, in the 169-page report, Democrats allege that Trump committed the criminal acts of bribery and wire fraud, which are addressed under the remarkably vague first article of impeachment, ""abuse of power."" The latter crime, they note, carries a 20-year prison sentence.

""Although President Trump's actions need not rise to the level of a criminal violation to justify impeachment, his conduct here was criminal,"" Democrats on the committee argue.

""The Framers were not fools. They authorized impeachment for a reason, and that reason would have been gutted if impeachment were limited to crimes,"" they continue, specifically justifying their decision to not name specific crimes in the articles of impeachment.

Trump's behavior, they add, ""betrayed the people of this nation"" and was indeed ""both constitutional and criminal in character.""

What are the details?

The report alleges that Trump's most egregious ""abuse of power"" came during his infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Trump requested that Zelensky announce investigations into 2016 election interference and then-Vice President Joe Biden and son, Hunter Biden's, involvement with Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.

The request became criminal, the report alleges, when Trump subsequently froze $391 million in military aid to Ukraine until the request was met. This action, they say, along with other pressures, constituted criminal bribery under federal law.

Democrats also argue that Trump violated the honest services wire fraud statute during the July 25 phone call. The report claims that those ""foreign wire communications"" were done ""in furtherance of an ongoing bribery scheme.""

In the 18-page dissent, Republicans, led by Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) slam the Democrats' articles of impeachment as ""vague,"" ""hyperbolic"" and ""misleading,"" Politico reports.

Republicans also slammed Democrats for not offering any articles of impeachment that allege specific crimes.

""While individual articles of impeachment have been passed against prior presidents that do not allege criminality, no president has been impeached solely on non-criminal accusations,"" Collins writes.

What's the background?

Since filing articles of impeachment last Tuesday, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have been sharply criticized for not naming specific crimes, failing to match the constitutional standard of ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Instead, after months of public criminal accusation, Democrats decided to file two vague articles of impeachment — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

The ""abuse of power"" article, they have maintained, constitutes the highest crime and can include specific crimes such as bribery, but that argument has not been particularly convincing to Republicans.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) later struggled to answer why ""bribery"" is missing from impeachment articles.

""Where is the crime? That's what we've been asking the whole time,"" House Judiciary member Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) said, according to Roll Call. ""I think it's an indication that they've committed political malpractice.""

What else?

BlazeTV host Glenn Beck ridiculed the Democrats' seemingly ever-changing impeachment accusation against Trump after they moved from quid pro quo to bribery last month in lieu of focus group results.

""They're throwing spaghetti up into the wall to see what sticks,"" Beck quipped.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, announced late Friday that he will file lawsuits against CNN and the Daily Beast for ""demonstrably false and scandalous stories.""

CNN published a story Friday alleging that Nunes privately met with former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin in Vienna last December to discuss digging up dirt on Joe Biden. The news outlet published the story after the lawyer for Lev Parnas — a Rudy Giuliani associate who was indicted on unrelated federal charges last month — told CNN that his client wants to tell Congress what he knows about the alleged meeting.

Earlier in the week, the Daily Beast published a story claiming Parnas aided Nunes in his European affairs, including setting up meetings and calls involving Ukraine.

Nunes told Breitbart News in a statement that the stories are the ""perfect example of defamation.""

These demonstrably false and scandalous stories published by the Daily Beast and CNN are the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth.



Some political operative offered these fake stories to at least five different media outlets before finding someone irresponsible enough to publish them. I look forward to prosecuting these cases, including the media outlets, as well as the sources of their fake stories, to the fullest extent of the law. I intend to hold the Daily Beast and CNN accountable for their actions.

Nunes said the news outlets ""will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving.""

Interestingly, Parnes' lawyer gave CNN the story the same day that the New York Daily News reported that Parnas has attempted to curry favor with House impeachment investigators, offering up what his lawyer called ""hard evidence"" and voicing his willingness to testify.

However, the Daily News reported that House impeachment investigators, led by the Democrats, ""have yet to take up Parnas' offer.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/devin-nunes-announces-swift-legal-action-against-cnn-daily-beast-for-demonstrably-false-stories,2019-11-23
Devin Nunes predicts Ukraine controversy will 'backfire' on Joe Biden over past improprieties,"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said the newest controversy to envelop President Donald Trump involving Ukraine will ultimately backfire on Democrats and sink Joe Biden's presidential campaign.

Nunes told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" he believes the new controversy involving Ukraine and the president was contrived to deflect from Biden's past improprieties.

""Whoever came up with this scheme, because it looks like it was somebody trying to deflect what Biden did back in 2015,"" Nunes said. ""What was he doing talking to the Ukrainian leadership at the time when his son has a contract?

""Look, the left knows that Biden's son is a problem for him. This is why ... these stories first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure that Biden didn't get in the race,"" he explained. ""So, now that these have been resurrected, I don't know who came up with the scheme. Maybe this whistleblower is not a partisan.

""But it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And, like I said, I think this is probably the end of Biden's campaign,"" Nunes predicted.

What is the background?



Trump faced new scrutiny last week over a conversation he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July during which he reportedly pressured Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, who had a key role in a natural gas company that was previously investigated by Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, for possible corruption. Shokin was mysteriously fired in 2016.

Two years after leaving office, Biden admitted on camera to pressuring then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to dismiss Shokin. Biden said he threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Shokin was not fired.

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden recounted telling Poroshenko. ""I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b***h, he got fired,"" Biden bragged. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

It is not directly clear if Shokin's dismissal was directly related to his investigation involving Biden's son.

However, there are mounting questions surrounding the Obama administration, Democrats, and Ukraine.

The Hill reported earlier this year that Ukrainian law enforcement has attempted to share evidence of wrongdoing by Democrats, ""ranging from 2016 election interference to obstructing criminal probes,"" with the Trump administration. There is also evidence suggesting U.S. officials pressured Ukrainian authorities to drop a probe involving George Soros during the 2016 election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/devin-nunes-predicts-ukraine-controversy-will-backfire-on-joe-biden-over-past-improprieties,2019-09-23
"DHS creates 'disinformation governance board,' appoints leader who peddled disinformation about Hunter Biden laptop, Trump dossier","The Department of Homeland Security was criticized Thursday over the creation of a new department whose mission is to combat the spread of ""disinformation.""

What are the details?

According to Politico, the DHS has established the Disinformation Governance Board, which will ""coordinate countering misinformation related to homeland security, focused specifically on irregular migration and Russia.""

The agency appointed Nina Jankowicz as executive director of the board.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed the board's creation on Wednesday after Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) asked him what steps the DHS is taking to combat the manipulation of black Americans and Hispanics, including migrants, through ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation.""

Making matters worse, Jankowicz is by no measure an objective leader.

In fact, the Washington Examiner reported that Jankowicz disseminated information contained in the debunked Christopher Steele dossier and repeatedly downplayed the Hunter Biden laptop story with claims that it was part of a foreign interference campaign. She even described the laptop hard drive — which has been repeatedly authenticated — as a ""Trump campaign product.""

Jankowicz even appears to oppose free speech. Last week, she told NPR that she ""shudder[s] to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms.""

What was the reaction?

The announcement generated a wave of backlash, both against the creation of the board itself and against Jankowicz as its leader.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has already sent Mayorkas a letter demanding that the board be dissolved immediately.

""I confess, I at first thought this announcement was satire. Surely no American Administration would ever use the power of Government to sit in judgement on the First Amendment speech of its own citizens,"" Hawley said. ""Sadly, I was mistaken. Rather than protecting our border or the American homeland, you have chosen to make policing Americans' speech your priority. This new board is almost certainly unconstitutional and should be dissolved immediately.""

Meanwhile, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) described the board as the ""ministry of truth,"" aka the government's own propaganda office.

""I’m also going to let a cat out of the bag — you’re about to get a lesson in federalism because the free state of Missouri will NEVER let you administer a federal Ministry of Truth. Buckle up!"" Schmitt said.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said, ""During the worst border crisis in history, Biden's DHS is creating an Orwellian 'disinformation governance board' led by a partisan Democrat who herself spread disinformation. What a disgrace. When Republicans take control, we will fix this.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dhs-creates-disinformation-governance-board,2022-04-28
"Diplomat: I tried to warn the Obama administration about Hunter Biden and Ukraine in 2015, but no one would listen","A diplomat who served in the State Department under former President Barack Obama testified Tuesday that he sounded the alarm about Hunter Biden's appointment to Ukrainian energy company Burisma in early 2015, but no one seemed to care, according to the Washington Post.

George Kent, who still works in the State Department as deputy assistant secretary of state, testified as a part of the House impeachment inquiry that he was concerned about the conflict of interest with Hunter Biden joining the company at the same time that then-Vice President Joe Biden was heavily involved in the administration's Ukraine policy. From the Post:

Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden's office, he was told the then-vice president didn't have the ""bandwidth"" to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.

Kent's testimony is an example of how Biden could become collateral damage in the push to impeach President Donald Trump. It's going to be nearly impossible to keep digging into President Donald Trump and Ukraine without constantly running into the apparent conflict of interest the Bidens were involved in.

It's possible that Democrats will have to sacrifice Biden, their most electable candidate, if they want to keep holding on to impeachment hopes as November 2020 draws nearer. And, it's possible that they're willing to do so — as the recent elevation and coverage of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as the Democratic front-runner seems to indicate.

Biden has tried to distinguish himself from Trump regarding Ukraine, saying that if he is elected president, he will not have any family members working in the White House or having business relationships with foreign corporations — not because he believes it is inherently wrong, but because of Trump and his family.

""In my White House, none of my children or family have offices at the White House,"" Biden said. ""They will not be invited to sit in significant meetings of a Cabinet-level post and they will have no foreign investment, and the reason to do that is not because of anything that went on in our administration. It is because of what Donald Trump has done. He has so debased the standard of what constitutes ethical behavior that the next president has to make it absolutely clear — absolutely clear — this will not happen again.""

That's the ethical tightrope that Biden will attempt to walk between now and the Democratic primary elections, and potentially the general election. It remains to be seen whether it will work, or whether his own party will decide that the best path to the White House is to damage Trump at all costs rather than trust Biden to get the job done in 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/diplomat-tried-to-warn-obama-administration-about-hunter-biden-in-2015,2019-10-18
"American diplomats meet with Zelenskyy, agree to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine","The U.S. agreed to provide the Ukrainian government with millions of dollars in military aid following a secretive meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top U.S. diplomats on Sunday.

The New York Post reported that the diplomats announced President Joe Biden’s plans to nominate Bridget Brink as the American ambassador to Ukraine and that American diplomats will return to Ukraine this week after evacuating the country before the Russian invasion began.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy and told him that the U.S. would provide his country with more than $300 million in military financing. The American diplomats also approved a $165 million sale of ammunition not made in the U.S. that will be compatible with Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons.

The U.S. will be providing a total of $713 million for foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries. Of this money, $322 million will go to Ukraine.

The rest of the money will be split between NATO member nations and other countries that have provided military supplies to Ukraine during the Russian invasion.

With this latest aid package, the U.S. government has provided Ukraine with $3.7 billion in assistance since the beginning of the war.

This past Thursday, Biden pledged to give an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, including heavy artillery and drones.

As part of the $13.6 billion spending package approved by Congress last month to provide aid and relief to Ukraine and the country’s allies, the American legislative branch committed to spending a total of $6.5 billion in military assistance to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy has made repeated pleas for military assistance from the U.S. since the Russian invasion began.

Before meeting with Blinken and Austin, Zelenskyy said, “We will talk about the list of weapons that we need and the pace of its supply. In recent weeks, the pace, the number has all improved. I’m grateful for that.”

Sunday’s meeting was kept very secret, as American officials refused to confirm that Zelenskyy and the American diplomats would be meeting even after the Ukrainian president announced the summit the day before.

Journalists who traveled with the American diplomatic contingent were not permitted to cross the border into Ukraine or disclose the location of the meeting. They were also barred from reporting on the trip until after it had concluded.

Blinken currently plans to return to Washington from Poland, while Austin is planning to meet with NATO leaders in Germany.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/diplomats-blinken-military-aid,2022-04-25
Diplomats stage walkout during Russian foreign minister's video address to UN Human Rights Council in protest of Ukraine invasion,"More than 100 diplomats staged a walkout Tuesday during Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's video address to the United Nations Human Rights Council in protest over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

What are the details?

Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Japan, the European Union, and others exited the room while diplomats from Syria, China, and Venezuela — as well as Russia's ambassador to the U.N., Gennady Gatilov, a former Lavrov deputy — remained, the outlet said.

Lavrov addressed the U.N. remotely after canceling his visit over Russian claims that EU states blocked his flight path, Reuters said, adding that in his speech Lavrov accused the EU of ""Russophobic frenzy"" in giving weapons to Ukraine amid his country's invasion. The outlet added that Russia said its ""special military operation"" that began last week is aimed at removing ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine.

What did the diplomats have to say?

""This Russian war of aggression will have profound implications for human rights in Ukraine and Russia, and the leaders of Russia will be held accountable,"" Michele Taylor, the U.S. envoy to the Human Rights Council, said in a statement, Reuters reported.

Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod — both of whom walked out — joined Ukraine's ambassador, Yevheniia Filipenko, behind a large Ukrainian blue and yellow flag, the outlet said.

""It is a remarkable show of support for Ukrainians who are fighting for their independence,"" Filipenko told reporters, Reuters said. She added that Kharkiv — Ukraine's second-largest city — suffered ""massive destruction to civilian infrastructure"" and that the ""maternity wards are being attacked, civilian residential buildings are being bombed,"" the outlet also noted.

Russia denies targeting any civilian sites, Reuters reported.

""Minister Lavrov was giving his version, which is false, about what is happening in Ukraine and so that's why we wanted to show a very strong stance together,"" Canada's Joly said, according to the outlet.

"Republicans vow to eradicate Biden's Disinformation Governance Board. Boebert says it is at a 'Stalin level,' DeSantis warns: 'You cannot have a ministry of truth in this country.'","Republicans have come out swinging against the Biden administration's newly announced Disinformation Governance Board.

The Department of Homeland Security announced that it had created a new government entity to tackle online disinformation – especially on key topics of elections, COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and the immigration crisis at the U.S. southern border.

However, Republicans fear that the new board will attempt to stifle free speech. Several GOP politicians immediately railed against President Joe Biden's Disinformation Governance Board, some have vowed to dismantle the entity.

Numerous Republicans labeled the new board as a ""ministry of truth,"" referencing the department of propaganda in George Orwell's dystopian book ""1984.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) proclaimed, ""The same party that spent years promoting the Russia collusion hoax, suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story, & equated parents to terrorists believes it has credibility to control your speech. Biden must immediately abandon his plan to create an Orwellian Ministry of Truth.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote on Twitter, ""Nothing else we are working on will matter if we don’t put an end to the Biden’s Ministry of Truth.""



Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) questioned, ""We’re supposed to trust the Department of Homeland Security to run a 'Ministry of Truth' when its current Secretary spent this week lying repeatedly to Congress that our border is secure?""

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) reacted by saying, ""Joe Biden wants to create a ‘ministry of truth’ to govern and police your thoughts and your free speech. This goes against everything our country stands for. Biden's DHS should focus more on the crisis at our southern border and less on their 'ministry of truth.'""

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) noted, ""The Biden administration just took one more step towards Communism. DHS' 'Ministry of Truth' is a crackdown on our Constitutional right to Free Speech.""

Rep. Steve Scalise wrote on Twitter, ""Biden's Orwellian Ministry of Truth should be disbanded immediately. Deep State liberals shouldn't be controlling what Americans are allowed to know and say.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) inquired, ""Now that the Biden regime has a Ministry of Truth, what’s next? Re-education camps?""



Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) exclaimed, ""DEFUND Biden’s Ministry of Truth! This isn’t North Korea, Cuba or Iran. This is the USA where we don’t need biased political hack bureaucrats gaslighting the rest of our country on whatever they want to declare to be true or false.""

Ohio congressional candidate J.D. Vancedeclared, ""When I get to the Senate I’ll defund the Biden Administration’s Ministry of Truth. This is downright scary.""



Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) pointed out, ""The first thing President Biden did in response to Elon Musk buying Twitter was to establish the 'Ministry of Truth!' Are we surprised? Free speech should not be censored. Congress did not create this new office and it should be dissolved. If it's not, it must be defunded.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted on Friday, ""The Federal Government has no business creating a Ministry of Truth. The Department of Homeland Security's ""Disinformation Board"" is unconstitutional and unamerican, and I'll be introducing a bill to defund it.""

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) warned, ""I don’t think people are fully understanding the severity of what a Ministry of Truth organized by DHS truly means. This is Stalin level. This is Mao level. This is the hill to die on.""

Boebert also penned legislation to defund the DHS' Disinformation Governance Board.

""This kind of stuff is terrifying. We in Congress have the power of the purse. It is our duty to shut down this department immediately,"" Boebert told Fox News. ""I'm calling on leadership in the Republican Party — Leader [Kevin] McCarthy, Whip [Steve] Scalise and others — to join me in calling for this department to be shut down and defunded.""



""No tax dollars should go to where Biden can use the power of the federal government to silence truthful stories like Big Tech did with the Hunter Biden story,"" Boebert added.

Boebert claimed that Democrats took Orwell's ""1984"" novel ""not as a warning, but as a guide.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proclaimed that he ""will be fighting back"" against Biden's Disinformation Governance Board – which he initially thought was a ""belated April Fool's joke.""

""They are actually going to create, and the Department of Homeland Security, a bureau of disinformation,"" DeSantis said during a press conference on Saturday. ""It's basically a ministry of truth.""

""And what they want to do is they want to be able to put out false narratives without people being able to speak out and fight back,"" the Republican governor of Florida said. ""They want to be able to say things like Russia collusion, and perpetuate hoaxes, and then have people like us be silenced. They want to be able to advocate for COVID lockdowns. They want to be able to be an advocate for school closures, things that are not supported by the evidence, but then when you speak out, they want to stifle dissent.""

""You cannot have a ministry of truth in this country,"" DeSantis continued. ""We believe it’s essential that individual Floridians and Americans are able to speak out against the false narratives trying to be jammed down our throats by this regime.""

""And so we reject this bureau in the state of Florida,"" DeSantis stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disinformation-governance-board-boebert-says-it-is-stalin-level-desantis-warns-you-cannot-have-a-ministry-of-truth-in-this-countryinformationgovernance-board-republicans-reaction,2022-04-30
Disney is halting theatrical releases in Russia,"Disney will pause its theatrical releases in Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

According to Fox Business, a spokesperson for Disney issued a statement that said, “Given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, including the upcoming ‘Turning Red’ from Pixar. We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.”

CNN Business said that Disney is reportedly working with its partner in non-governmental-organizations “to provided urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees” who were displaced by the ongoing Russian assault on Ukraine.

Netflix is also pushing back against Russia by refusing to domestically air Russian state TV channels. Russian law requires streaming platforms that have more than 100,000 subscribers in Russia to distribute state-owned Russian entertainment and news channels for free to subscription holders.

A Netflix spokesperson said, “Given the current situation, we have no plans to add these channels to our service.”

Disney’s decision to halt movie releases in Russia comes as the Western nations attempt to isolate Russia and cripple its economy with thoroughgoing sanctions.

On Saturday, several allied leaders of Western countries stated their commitment to restricting Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT telecommunications network.

The European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to sanctioning Russian oligarchs and banks tied to the Russian government and who may be financially supporting the invasion of Ukraine.

In a joint statement, the Western leaders said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion. Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

These sanctions stand to cripple the Russian economy. They will prevent the Russian central bank from implementing monetary policy that enables the Russian economy to withstand the economic impact of sanctions and they make it virtually impossible for Russia to engage in international commerce.

Apple Pay and Google Pay, two of the world’s most used payment processors, have severed their relationships with Russian banks as a result of these sanctions. The Russian people may still use their bank cards and certain payment processors domestically, but many are unable to make digital purchases or payments with entities outside Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-is-halting-theatrical-releases-in-russia,2022-03-01
"DNA test shows Hunter Biden is father of Arkansas woman's baby, despite his previous denials","A DNA test has confirmed that Hunter Biden fathered a child with an Arkansas woman who is suing him for financial support, after months of Biden denying the allegations and asking that the suit be thrown out.

What are the details?

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette first reported Wednesday that ""DNA testing has established 'with scientific certainty'"" that Biden is the father of the baby, according to court documents filed by the child's mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts. According to the motion, Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

Biden has repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with Lunden, and demanded in August that the paternity suit against him be tossed out by the court, The Daily Mail reported. Biden eventually agreed to take a DNA test.

As Business Insider noted, ""Biden's relationship history is complicated.""

At the time of Biden's affair with Lunden, he was dating his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, who he moved in with after divorcing his wife of 22 years. Biden remarried in May to Melissa Cohen, who he reportedly had met just days before.

Anything else?

Biden is the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, and has spent a great deal of time in the headlines over the past year.

Ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Wednesday, not only had the news broke that Joe Biden was officially confirmed to be a grandfather again, but it was revealed that Hunter Biden and business his associates allegedly received millions in illegal funds in a Ukrainian business deal.

Hunter Biden's foreign business relationships have become a major focus of Republicans amid the impeaching probe into President Donald Trump, and — in turn — a major source of frustration for Joe Biden's presidential campaign.

The younger Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, until this year, receiving a lucrative salary during and well after his father was point-man to Ukraine during his time as vice president.

Both Bidens have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the apparent conflict of interest, while officials in the U.S. and Ukraine continue to press for investigations into corruption allegations surrounding Burisma.

DOJ fires back at John Bolton over accusations in his book,"The Department of Justice disputed the claims reportedly made in John Bolton's forthcoming book against President Donald Trump and personal favors he made for leaders of foreign governments.

According to a report based on numerous sources who read portions of the book, Bolton claims that he brought up his concerns about Trump's interactions with Turkey and China to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.

A spokesperson for the DOJ released a statement saying the claims were ""grossly"" mischaracterized.

""While the Department of Justice has not reviewed Mr. Bolton's manuscript, the New York Times' account of this conversation grossly mischaracterizes what Attorney General Barr and Mr. Bolton discussed,"" said Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec.

""There was no discussion of 'personal favors' or 'undue influence' on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr say that the President's conversations with foreign leaders was improper,"" the statement continued.

""If this is truly what Mr. Bolton has written,"" the statement concluded, ""then it seems he is attributing to Attorney General Barr his own current views — views with which Attorney General Barr does not agree.""

Bolton reportedly also said in his upcoming book that he believed the president was withholding military aid promised to Ukraine in order to secure a politically motivated investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Earlier on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Republicans in a closed-door meeting that he did not yet have enough votes to block Democrats from calling new witnesses. Democrats have been pressing to have John Bolton testify in the impeachment trial.

Report: DOJ won't bother having the FBI monitor Biden lawyers' 'search' for mishandled top-secret documents,"The Department of Justice has determined that President Joe Biden's lawyers can be trusted to search his homes for improperly stored classified documents without FBI supervision, insiders told the Wall Street Journal.

This soft and complaisant approach stands in stark contrast to the DOJ's treatment of former President Donald Trump, despite the similarity of the presidents' alleged improprieties.

The FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence with guns drawn. When tearing through the property of the former president, the FBI reportedly showed no deference, taking whatever they wanted, including Trump's passport. FBI agents then parsed through the documents seized from former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence for days after the their tactical raid on the premises.

In the case of Biden's potential mishandling of top-secret and classified documents, no guns have been unholstered. No raids have taken place.

According to the Wall Street Journal, sources familiar with the matter indicated that the DOJ has placed its confidence in the supposed honesty of Biden's lawyers because they had allegedly been cooperating and had turned over the first batch of unsecure top-secret documents in short order.

Biden's legal team reportedly discussed the possibility of having FBI agents present while they conducted subsequent searches, but ""the two sides agreed"" that the lawyers could dig around the president's Delaware properties in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, then notify the DOJ if anything turned up.

The New York Post reported that the agreement between Biden's legal team and the DOJ was sealed after the discovery of ""intelligence memos and briefing materials"" related to Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom in Biden's private office last fall.

CBS News' Weijia Jiang asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, ""You’ve repeatedly emphasized the need — just as you did today — for independence, for the integrity of the Department of Justice investigation, [which is] one reason why you continue to point us to the DOJ. So I wonder, why then did the White House counsel go to Wilmington to facilitate the handing-over of documents to the DOJ?""

Jean-Pierre noted she appreciated the question, but didn't provide an answer.

Jiang did not relent, however; noting how the White house has repeatedly suggested ""how much it is important to this White House to separate the White House from the DOJ’s investigation. ... But the White House counsel was the one to go and facilitate documents, to look for the documents.""

The White House press secretary added, ""Again, they’ve been working very closely with the Department of Justice.""

Biden has reportedly dodged ""more aggressive actions by law enforcement"" thanks to this ""cooperation"" between his lawyers and the DOJ.



Law enforcement officials told the Wall Street Journal that what may appear to be the DOJ's deference to the Biden White House may actually be a tactic enabling it to later ""take a tougher line, including executing a future search warrant, if negotiations ever turned hostile.""

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said, ""The outrageous double standard of the corrupt DOJ and FBI, which have been weaponized against Joe Biden’s political opponents, could not be more clear.""

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) similarly suggested that this amounts to a double standard:

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland last week, stating, ""The double standard here is astounding. The underlying behavior at issue—a President’s retention of old classified documents dating back to a past presidency—is materially the same in both cases.""

""But in President Trump’s case, that retention triggered an unprecedented raid on the home of a former president, rationalized with a thicket of partisan doublespeak. President Biden has not experienced anything remotely similar,"" he added. ""Your Department's apparent disparate treatment of these two cases thus far isn't especially surprising, because today's FBI leadership is growing more partisan by the day.""

While Biden appears to have the DOJ's cooperation, there are yet some with Democrat affinities who regard the president with disdain, such as Walter Shaub, ethics chief in the Obama administration.

TheBlaze reported that Shaub recently suggested that Biden's ""retention of classified records reflects an inexcusable neglect of the most basic security protocols.""

A handful of other Democrats including Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), have suggested that the president's handling of classified documents was shameful, with some calling it ""an embarrassment.""

Don Lemon defends himself over segment 'belittling' Trump supporters,"CNN host Don Lemon offered no apology Tuesday when he finally addressed the way he conducted himself during a segment over the weekend where he was brought to tears laughing while his guests portrayed supporters of President Donald Trump as illiterate hicks.

What are the details?

On Saturday night, Lemon hosted anti-Trump Republican Rick Wilson and liberal writer Wajahat Ali on his program, where the two pundits acted out accents and stereotypes in an effort to depict the ""demo"" of Trump supporters as being what Wilson referred to as uneducated ""boomer rubes.""

The clip went viral due to the audacity of the exchange, to the extent that all three individuals involved felt the need to respond and Christian satire site The Babylon Bee referred to the segment as a ""free commercial for [the] Trump campaign.""

Ali and Wilson were both quick to dismiss the outrage over their insulting behavior and reacted Monday night — hours after the video was well circulated. But Lemon waited until three days after his segment to address the matter, and even then he claimed he ""didn't catch everything that was said"" rather than taking responsibility for egging on insults targeting half the voters in the U.S.

At the end of his show Tuesday night, Lemon said:

""And one final note that I have for you, because this is personally important for me to address this, OK? Anyone, ask anyone who knows me, they'll tell you: I don't believe in belittling people — belittling anyone for who they are, what they believe, or where they're from.

""During an interview on Saturday night, one of my guests said something that made me laugh and while in the moment I found the joke humorous and I didn't catch everything that was said. Just to make this perfectly clear, I was laughing at the joke and not at any group of people.""



This writer's analysis

In fairness, Lemon — a consistent, fervent Trump critic — did not engage verbally with Wilson and Ali's mockery of Trump supporters. He appears in the clip to have found such hilarity in Wilson's initial joke about President Trump being incapable of finding Ukraine on a map that he did not recover until the two pundits were done with their banter.

Whether Lemon heard his guests' exchange while on air or not (and he surely did, given hosts' alertness to time constraints), he had ample opportunity to watch the clip afterward and accept responsibility for — or at least choose whether to condemn — the vitriol he claims to so despise.

It is to the detriment of both him and his network that he chose not to do so.

CNN's Don Lemon sings Biden's praises — literally — as gas prices drop a whole 4 cents ... and just days after the White House begged for better coverage,"CNN host Don Lemon took the the Biden White House's pleas to the media to sing the administration's praises quite seriously — and literally.

Just days ago, reports surfaced that the White House had been begging national media outlets to boost their coverage of President Job Biden as his approval numbers sink amid bad economic news, from inflation to supply chains; continuing COVID problems — remember, he vowed to end the pandemic; and foreign policy blunders and hurdles in Afghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, and more.

And Biden lackeys were not just shooting off emails and texts to so-called journalists urging positive coverage for the flailing administration; they were actually sitting down in media newsrooms to tout what they claimed was good economic news and urge, in a face-to-face setting, the outlets to report favorably on Biden and his agenda.

It appears that the cries of the administration fell on sympathetic ears — at least the ears connected to the talking head that hosts CNN's 10 p.m. time slot.

During Tuesday's episode of ""Don Lemon Tonight,"" which, according to CNN's website, ""brings in-depth analysis of the day's top news stories,"" Lemon took to singing the praises of the Biden administration over a four-cent drop in gas prices.

Not figuratively singing. Actually singing.

""Big economic relief for millions of Americans who have been dealing with soaring energy prices,"" Lemon giddily announced. ""The cost at the pump finally easing up.""

The average price of a gallon of gas had dropped to $3.35, down a whopping four pennies from the week before, the CNN host said, citing AAA's figures.

As a graphic highlighting that not-so-significant drop in prices ran on the screen, Lemon told his audience, ""Just look at that!"" and then offered an angelic choir-styled ""Aaaaaah!""

After genuflecting, Lemon then introduced his totally unbiased guest, Barack Obama's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Austan Goolsbee, to discuss the gloriousness of the petrol prices.

""Austan!"" Lemon shouted while clapping into his mic, adding, ""Can we just celebrate there's some good news, just for a minute? I'll take it where I can get it.""

But what Lemon didn't bother to point out is that, though AAA did report that gas was $3.35 per gallon as of Dec. 6, the organization also noted that it is up $1.19 per gallon from a year ago.

The group also pointed out that the reason for the gas price retreat was due to fears of a COVID resurgence and the Omicron variant pushing down oil prices.

""Consumers may be catching a break at the pump right now, but it’s not for a very good reason,” AAA spokesman Andrew Gross said. “A potential COVID-19 induced economic slowdown hurts everyone and could prompt OPEC to slash production if oil prices drop too low.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/don-lemon-sings-biden-praises-gas-prices,2021-12-10
Donald Trump Jr accuses Hunter Biden of 'dodging child support' as Biden blames coronavirus for skipping court,"Donald Trump Jr. accused Hunter Biden of ""dodging child support"" on Tuesday in reaction to news that the son of former Vice President Joe Biden blamed coronavirus fears for skipping out on an upcoming child support deposition.

What are the details?

The Daily Caller reported that Biden's attorneys wrote in a court filing, ""It is unsafe for the Defendant to travel, as travel restrictions have been implemented both domestically and internationally, particularly on airlines, due to the Coronavirus. Setting aside personal endangerment, Defendant reasonably believes that such travel unnecessarily exposes his wife and unborn child to this virus.""

But Biden — who is being sued in Arkansas for support by a former stripper with whom he shares a young child — has made several prior excuses for not showing up and at one point was even threatened with contempt by the judge in the case. Biden has also refused to hand over his financials to the court amid questions over his foreign business deals while his father, who is now running against President Donald Trump, was in office.

Donald Trump Jr. isn't buying the excuses, tweeting Tuesday, ""Yea coronavirus...That's it, that's why hes in hiding and refuses to show how much he made from his dad's office. #WheresHunter.""

The president's son then asked his 3.5 million Twitter followers, ""You guys think the media would let me get away with this bullsh*t if I was dodging child support like Hunter? #WheresHunter.""

Anything else?

The #WheresHunter hashtag is a reference to the fact that Hunter Biden has been absent from the campaign trail and the public eye despite Joe Biden claiming last year that his son would be a ""visible"" part of his campaign. But the younger Biden has fallen under intense scrutiny for serving on the board of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma, which has been the subject of multiple corruption probes.

President Trump has been a fervent critic of the Bidens' links to Ukrainian and Chinese firms, and House Democrats launched a failed impeachment probe against the president over allegations that he withheld aid from Ukraine in exchange for the reopening of an investigation into Hunter Biden's dealings.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/donald-trump-jr-accuses-hunter-biden-of-dodging-child-support-as-biden-blames-coronavirus-for-skipping-court,2020-03-11
Peter Doocy asks the questions we are all thinking about Brittney Griner prisoner swap: 'Why did Russia get such a better deal?',"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy interrogated White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday over President Joe Biden's decision to swap Brittney Griner for Viktor ""Merchant of Death"" Bout.

The decision is controversial because the swap left retired U.S. Marine Paul Whelan sitting in a Russian prison. Most people had believed that if the U.S. were to give up Bout, the swap would be for Whelan.

What did Doocy ask?

At the White House press briefing, Doocy wasted no time getting down to brass tacks.

""In this prisoner swap, why did Russia get such a better deal?"" he asked.

Jean-Pierre responded by repeating the Biden administration's narrative, that is, the claim that Moscow only gave the administration one choice. ""Our choices was: Brittney or no one at all. Bring home one American or no American at all,"" she said.

""They gave up a professional athlete,"" Doocy countered, referring to Griner. ""We gave up a prolific arms dealer who was convicted of trying to kill Americans.""

""The professional athlete is also an American citizen — so let’s not forget that — who deserved —"" Jean-Pierre responded before Doocy interjected.

""And Paul Whelan is an American citizen,"" he fired back. ""So we could do this all day.""

12/08/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

According to Jean-Pierre, the Russian government has treated the situation in a ""totally illegitimately"" way regarding Whelan, but Biden ultimately ""felt that this was an opportunity to bring Brittney home.""

""He is going to continue to do everything he can to bring Paul Whelan home,"" she said.

""How can you say that he’s going to do everything that he can if he said, just a few days ago, he’s not going to call up Vladimir Putin until further notice?"" Doocy followed up.



The Fox News reporter was referring to Biden saying last week that he will only speak to Vladimir Putin if the Russian dictator wants to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Jean-Pierre responded that U.S. diplomats are working ""through different channels"" to try to secure Whelan's release.

Anything else?

Whelan himself is frustrated that Biden is not doing more to secure his release.

""I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four-year anniversary of my arrest is coming up,"" Whelan told CNN on Thursday after Griner's release.

""I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,"" he exclaimed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doocy-griner-prisoner-swap-russia,2022-12-09
"'After many sleepless nights,' Democratic Sen. Doug Jones announces that he’ll vote to remove President Trump from office","A Democratic senator viewed as a possible swing vote in the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he will vote to remove the president from office.

""After many sleepless nights, I have reluctantly concluded that the evidence is sufficient to convict the President for both abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,"" Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said in a lengthy statement put out just hours ahead of the Senate's expected vote.

Jones went on to say that he was ""deeply troubled by the partisan nature"" of the impeachment proceedings over the past several months.

""Very early on I implored my colleagues in both houses of Congress to stay out of their partisan corners. Many did, but so many did not. The country deserves better. We must find a way to rise above the things that divide us and find the common good,"" the senator stated.

On the first article of impeachment alleging abuse of power over President Trump's dealings with the Ukrainian government last year, Jones concluded that Trump's ""actions placed his personal interests well above the national interests and threatened the security of the United States, our allies in Europe, and our ally Ukraine.""

Regarding the second article of impeachment regarding obstruction of Congress over the White House's response to the House's impeachment investigation, the senator said that Trump ""deliberately and unconstitutionally obstructed Congress by refusing to cooperate with the investigation in any way.""



""The gravity of this moment, the seriousness of the charges, and the implications for future presidencies and Congresses all contributed to the difficulty with which I have arrived at my decision,"" Jones added.

This news is merely the latest in a line of senators viewed as potential swing votes ultimately announcing that they will side with their party instead of breaking ranks on the matter. On Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced that she would vote to acquit Trump, as did Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) the day before. Retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) has also said that he will vote to acquit the president.

Jones was elected in a 2017 Alabama special Senate election that was thrown into chaos by sexual misconduct allegations against the Republican nominee, Roy Moore. He is now widely viewed as the upper chamber's most vulnerable incumbent in the upcoming general election. And if his re-election chances in Alabama were slim to begin with, they're undoubtedly going to get a lot slimmer after this.

'Had to be real': Intel official who signed infamous letter discrediting Hunter Biden laptop story makes stunning admission,"One of the former intelligence officials who signed the infamous letter used to exonerate Hunter Biden in the court of public perception admitted in a recent interview that he signed the letter despite believing the laptop was mostly authentic.



What is the background?

After the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Democrats and the media rushed to claim that the story and its timing were characteristic of a Russian disinformation campaign.

Specifically, the media pushed a letter signed by more more than 50 former intelligence officials to discredit the laptop story. The letter claimed the story had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""

""If we are right,"" the letter went on to say, ""this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.""

What is happening now?

Douglas Wise, a former senior CIA operations officer and former Defense Intelligence Agency deputy director, admitted that most of the letter's signatories believed a ""significant portion"" of the laptop story was authentic at the time they discredited it.

""All of us figured that a significant portion of that content had to be real to make any Russian disinformation credible,"" Wise told the Australian on Sunday.

Like other intel officials who signed the letter, Wise defended it by claiming it did not necessarily say what the media claimed.

""The letter said it had the earmarks of Russian deceit and we should consider that as a possibility,"" Wise said. ""It did not say Hunter Biden was a good guy, it didn’t say what he did was right and it wasn’t exculpatory, it was just a cautionary letter.""

In fact, Wise refused to display contrition for helping drive a narrative that was false. He told the news outlet, ""I don’t regret signing it"" and pointed to Rudy Giuliani allegedly visiting Ukraine to ""to dig up evidence on the Bidens."" He also said the ""chain of custody"" issues surrounding the laptop hard drive cast some doubt on its authenticity.

""Russians or even ill-intended conservative elements could have planted stuff in there,"" Wise claimed.

Hunter Biden remains under federal investigation for alleged tax crimes and for purportedly lying on a federal form when he purchased a firearm.

Team of 10 elite forces veterans — including 6 Americans — has stepped up and volunteered to fight for Ukraine,"At least six Americans have volunteered to fight the Russians alongside Ukraine, BuzzFeed News reported Sunday, and are staging in Poland for preparation to cross into Ukraine.

What's a brief history here?

Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on anyone willing to help to join his country's military in battle.

“Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals,” Zelensky said on Saturday. “A separate subdivision is being formed of foreigners entitled the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine. There is no greater contribution which you can make for the sake of peace.”

What are the details?

A team of 10 special forces veterans — made up of six Americans, three U.K. citizens, and a German — has stepped up and volunteered to join Ukraine's military to battle against Russia. All members of the group are said to have been NATO-trained and are experienced combat veterans with backgrounds in counterterrorism.

“They want to be among the first to officially join the new International Legion of the Territorial Defense of Ukraine that Zelensky announced Sunday,” text messages obtained by the outlet read.

The outlet added that two former American infantry officers ""are also making plans to come to Ukraine to provide 'leadership' for the group.""

Zelenskyy in his Saturday remarks said that any ""friend of Ukraine"" is invited to join the fight.

“Every friend of Ukraine who wants to join Ukraine in defending the country, please come over. We will give you weapons. It will be announced very shortly, how this can be done. Everyone who is defending Ukraine is a hero,” he said.

Zelenskyy added, “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules, and peaceful coexistence. Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe, and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.”

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba added, “Foreigners willing to defend Ukraine and world order as part of the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine, I invite you to contact foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine in your respective countries,”

What else is there to know about this?

On Sunday, Newsweek reported that many U.S. veterans have reached out in various ways to offer up their services to their Ukrainian brothers.

""Here are six things needed before veterans and everyday Americans can join the fight in Ukraine,"" the outlet reported.



Contact the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., to let them know your intentions to join the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine. If you can't visit the embassy in person, then you can call or email. Here is the contact information for the U.S. embassy. Here's the list of international embassies for Ukraine.



Gather important documents. These include an ID, passport to travel internationally, any military service records, work with law enforcement agencies, or combat history.



Bring documents to the interview. These are necessary for all in-person interviews.



Write an application for enlistment. This is for an enlistment in the Ukrainian campaign against Russia. This serves as an addendum to the first step.



Get your instructions on how to get to Ukraine and what to bring. Recommended items would include: Military clothing, helmet, body armor, vests, belts, and equipment like combat gloves, tactical glasses, and more.



Be organized. Ukrainian officials and consuls will help guide you into the country. Contacts for them would be provided at the embassy, whether it's in Washington or whatever country you're applying from.

Warren says Democrats could do poorly in elections,"Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is warning that Democrats will perform poorly during the upcoming midterm elections unless they accomplish more of their policy objectives in the months ahead.

""Democrats win elections when we show we understand the painful economic realities facing American families and convince voters we will deliver meaningful change. To put it bluntly: if we fail to use the months remaining before the elections to deliver on more of our agenda, Democrats are headed toward big losses in the midterms,"" Warren warned in an opinion piece.

""Time is running short. We need to finalize a budget reconciliation deal, making giant corporations pay their share to fund vital investments in combating climate change and lowering costs for families, which can advance with only 50 Senate votes,"" Warren wrote.

With Americans getting hammered by inflation and rising prices, the left could endure a drubbing during the 2022 election cycle. High fuel prices have been causing pain at the pump. President Joe Biden's chronically poor job approval ratings could also prove to be a liability for Democrats.

Warren wrote that ""to tackle the urgent challenges we face — climate change, income inequality, systemic injustice — we must root out corruption. To start cleaning up government, members of Congress and their spouses shouldn’t be allowed to own or trade individual stocks, which the vast majority of voters support banning, according to multiple polls.""

""We can also act quickly to rein in costs for middle-class families. In the very short term, that means stopping companies from jacking up prices to boost their profits. Price increases are driven by many factors, including pandemic disruptions to global supply chains and Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine,"" she declared.

""We can stand up to the armies of lobbyists and P.R. flacks and tackle tax loopholes for the rich and powerful,"" the lawmaker wrote.



Warren contended that President Joe Biden can take some actions without Congress — in the piece she continued pushing for Biden to cancel up to $50,000 of federal student loan debt per person.

""Decisive action on everything from lowering prescription drug prices to ensuring that more workers are eligible for overtime pay can be executed by the president alone, using the authority already given to him by existing laws, without rounding up 50 Senate votes,"" Warren wrote in her opinion piece.

The lawmaker said that, ""Democrats need to deliver more of the president’s agenda — or else we will not be in the majority much longer.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-warns-democrats-midterm-elections,2022-04-19
"Elon Musk diagnoses Netflix's big problem after platform sheds subscribers, stock tumbles: 'Woke mind virus'","Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has diagnosed the disease that he believes is causing Netflix's foreboding financial woes.

What is wrong with Netflix?

Netflix announced on Tuesday that it experienced its first net loss of subscribers in more than a decade during the first quarter of 2022. The streaming platform disclosed that 200,000 users dropped the service between January and March.

The news caused shares of Netflix stock to tumble more than 25%, CNBC reported. Netflix previously told shareholders the company would experience a net gain of 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2022.

To make matters worse, Netflix is now forecasting the loss of another 2 million subscribers in the second quarter of this year. Netflix's stock further cratered more than 30% as of Wednesday afternoon.

What did Musk say?

Musk pointed to woke ideology as the source of Netflix's subscriber and impending financial woes.

Responding to news of the significant stock tumble, Musk said, ""The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.""

In response to another Twitter user who said the ""woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization,"" Musk affirmed, ""Yes.""

Indeed, Netflix has platformed provocatively progressive content.

For example, Netflix hosts the show ""Dear White People,"" which is described as addressing the ""complexities of prejudice that take different forms — whether it’s white or light-skinned privilege, sexism, or homophobia.""

Netflix is also scheduled to release a new show on Thursday called ""He's Expecting."" As the title suggests, the show is centered on a pregnant male character. Netflix describes the show: ""When a successful ad executive who's got it all figured out becomes pregnant, he's forced to confront social inequities he'd never considered before.""

Netflix is also working with Ibram X. Kendi to adapt his anti-racist work into film projects, and the platform released a show about Colin Kaepernick last year.

What does Netflix blame?

The platform attributed its subscriber decline and bleak forecast to market factors outside the company's control, account sharing, competition (from Amazon, Disney, YouTube, Hulu, and others), and other ""macro factors"" including ""sluggish economic growth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-diagnoses-netflixs-big-problem-after-platform-sheds-subscribers-stock-tumbles-woke-mind-virus,2022-04-20
Elon Musk says he will 'eat locally grown food' at one of world's worst nuclear sites in order to demonstrate how important it is for Europe to begin nuclear power output,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says he will travel to a high-radiation location to ""eat locally grown food on TV"" after calling for a massive increase of nuclear energy production in Europe, Insider reported Monday.

What are the details?

Musk on Sunday called for European nations to increase their output of nuclear power in an effort to offset the possibility of a gas shortage.

He wrote, ""Hopefully, it is now extremely obvious that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones. This is *critical* to national and international security.""

Following backlash with many social media users stating a fear of radiation contamination in their food, Musk added, ""For those who (mistakenly) think this is a radiation risk, pick what you think is the worst location. I will travel there & eat locally grown food on TV. I did this in Japan many years ago, shortly after Fukushima. Radiation risk is much, much lower than most people believe.""

What else is there to know about this?

Over the weekend, Musk also called for the U.S. to increase its domestic oil and gas production and output amid sanctions imposed on Russia.

Insider reported that Russian oil exports have plummeted by approximately 33% amid the country's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

On Friday, Musk tweeted, ""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced support for the sentiment and responded, ""Couldn't agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!""

Cruz on Friday also issued a statement regarding his newly introduced Energy Freedom Act, which would help release the U.S. from its extreme reliance on foreign energy sources.

“I’m introducing the Energy Freedom Act to reverse Biden’s actions so we can restore American energy independence,"" he said in a statement on the proposed legislation. ""This bill won’t cost taxpayers a dime, but it will provide the United States billions in revenue in the coming years by expediting permitting, leasing, safe new pipelines, and exports, and providing much needed regulatory certainty. It would create new jobs, lower energy costs, and because modern energy production in the United States is far cleaner than in any other country’s by every measure, it would help the environment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-eat-locally-grown-food-at-nuclear-site-nuclear-power-output,2022-03-07
"Hillary Clinton blames Republicans for attack on Paul Pelosi, Elon Musk steps in and questions the narrative: 'Might be more to this story than meets the eye'","Following the alleged hammer attack on Paul Pelosi, several Democrats accused Republicans of inciting political violence. Some Democrats made the damning accusations despite the investigation in its infancy and there not being concrete proof that the suspect – David DePape – was motivated by politics to attack the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

On Saturday, Hillary Clinton blamed Republicans for political violence.

""The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories,"" Clinton wrote on Twitter. ""It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.""



Clinton's tweet linked to a Los Angeles Times article with the headline: ""Accused Pelosi attacker David DePape spread QAnon, other far-right, bigoted conspiracies.""

""In a personal blog that DePape maintained, posts include such topics as 'Manipulation of History,' 'Holohoax' and 'It’s OK to be white.' He mentioned 4chan, a favorite message board of the far right. He posted videos about conspiracies involving COVID-19 vaccines and the war in Ukraine being a ploy for Jewish people to buy land,"" the article read.

""DePape’s screeds included posts about QAnon, an unfounded theory that former President Trump is at war with a cabal of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring and control the world,"" the article added. ""In an Aug. 23 entry titled 'Q,' DePape wrote: 'Either Q is Trump himself or Q is the deepstate moles within Trumps inner circle.'""

However, the website that the Los Angeles Times links to was created on Sept. 8, 2022, according to WHOIS – a public database that provides information about who and when a domain name was registered by.

Google first indexed this site in September.

The Wayback Machine – a digital archive of internet websites – only began archiving the site on Oct. 28, 2022.

The website in question, frenlyfrens.com, was deactivated by the hosting company Wix after the attack on Pelosi.

Elon Musk responded to Clinton's tweet, and questioned the narrative.

The new CEO of Twitter replied to Clinton, ""There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.""

Musk linked his tweet to an article from the Santa Monica Observer titled: ""The Awful Truth: Paul Pelosi Was Drunk Again, And In a Dispute With a Male Prostitute Early Friday Morning.""

The Santa Monica Observer claimed – without evidence – that Paul Pelosi was with a male prostitute on the night of his attack. The writer admitted that the accusation is ""my humble opinion.""

The Santa Monica Observer has a factual reporting rating of ""low"" by Media Bias/Fact Check – a self-proclaimed ""independent website that has promoted awareness of media bias and misinformation by rating the bias, factual accuracy, and credibility of media sources, large and small.""

MBFC labeled the Santa Monica Observer as a ""questionable source,"" which the site defines as having ""extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of transparency and/or is fake news.""

However, there are many questions still to be answered about the alleged home invasion involving David DePape – a reported nudist hemp jewelry maker from Berkeley.

As TheBlaze previously reported, DePape allegedly infiltrated the home of the third person in line for the presidency only using a hammer.

Paul Pelosi purportedly was permitted to use the bathroom by hammer-wielding DePape in the middle of the home invasion. Pelosi allegedly had his cell phone charging in the bathroom, which he used to call 911.



Reports claim, ""The operator heard Mr. Pelosi asking: 'What’s going on? Why are you here? What are you doing to me?'""

However, there is audio of an alleged police dispatcher informing officers that a ""somewhat confused"" Pelosi told him that a ""friend"" by the name of ""David"" was in his home.

The dispatcher is heard saying, ""There is a male in the home and that he is going to wait for his wife. However, he stated that he doesn't know who the male is but that his name is 'David 'and that he is a friend.""

The dispatcher noted that the reporting person ""sounded somewhat confused.""

When police arrived at the Pelosi's home in San Francisco, they ""knocked on the front door and were let inside by an unknown person,"" according to Politico.

The report continued, ""They discovered DePape and Pelosi struggling for a hammer, and after they instructed them to drop the weapon.""

Police say that's when DePape ""violently attacked"" Pelosi with the hammer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-hillary-clinton-paul-pelosi-twitter,2022-10-30
Elon Musk may reveal what happened behind the scenes of Twitter's pre-election censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story,"Elon Musk suggested on Thanksgiving that he might soon reveal what had gone on behind the scenes at Twitter in 2020 when the company censored the New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story.

Extra to atoning for what has been called ""election interference,"" the insights Musk has teased may also show to what extent governmental and private forces colluded to affect the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

Hope of transparency

Turning Point USA ambassador Alex Lorusso tweeted on Wednesday, ""Raise your hand if you think @ElonMusk should make public all internal discussions about the decision to censor the @NYPost's story on Hunter Biden's laptop before the 2020 Election in the interest of Transparency.""

Musk replied, ""This is necessary to restore public trust.""

The Twitter CEO's response was retweeted nearly 16,000 times and received just under 200,000 likes.

Musk had previously indicated that he regarded Twitter's conduct ahead of the 2020 election as questionable.

On April 26, Saagar Enjeti, co-host of The Hill's web show ""Rising,"" tweeted, ""Vijaya Gadde, the top censorship advocate at Twitter who famously gaslit the world on Joe Rogan's podcast and censored the Hunter Biden laptop story, is very upset about the @elonmusk takeover.""

Musk responded, ""Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.""

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) told Fox news on Friday that she thinks it is ""great that Elon Musk is going to expose this. Probably nothing interfered more with the 2020 election than the suppression of the evidence that was in Hunter Biden's laptop.""

Tenney added that it is important that Musk ""reveals the conversations as to why we're suppressing evidence"" concerning the president, his son, and their connections with ""corrupt organizations.""

""It could have changed the election,"" said Tenney. ""The 2020 election was decided in the swing states by 42,000 votes. ... This is the difference in the election.""

Yoel Roth, the Twitter executive who had led the effort to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story, resigned on Nov. 10.

Roth had previously likened members of the Trump administration to ""actual Nazis"" and former Trump spokesman Kellyanne Conway to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.

The laptop

In April 2019, Hunter Biden, whom President Joe Biden claimed was the ""smartest guy"" he knows, dropped off at least one computer to Wilmington resident John Paul Mac Isaac's Mac Shop in Delaware. Biden reportedly failed both to pick up the device[s] and to pay for the repair costs — despite multiple attempts by the shop owner to get in touch with him.



One of the devices, a MacBook laptop, was full of what may ultimately prove to be incriminating evidence of various improprieties, including 459 alleged crimes.

Mac Isaac reportedly turned the laptop over to the FBI in December 2019 and then later to a lawyer for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Mac Isaac told reporters that, with certain theories about the fate of former DNC staffer Seth Rich in mind, he made a copy of the hard drive ""because I was pretty vocal about not wanting to get murdered.""

The computer store owner provided files from the device to the New York Post in October 2020.

The New York Post began reporting on the contents on Oct. 14, 2020.

The establishment censorship campaign

TheBlaze indicated that the Post took incredible heat from the Democratic Party, the left, and big tech for daring to hold the powerful to account.

CNN and MSNBC spent months dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop story, calling it ""Russian disinformation.""

CNN's Wolf Blitzer said on Oct. 16, 2020, ""Serious questions tonight about whether the Russians are using Rudy Giuliani to interfere in the U.S. presidential election … There are fears that what Giuliani is now pushing here in the United States could actually be part of Russia's latest and very massive disinformation campaign in the U.S. presidential election.""

Back when Brian Stelter still had a show on CNN, he claimed that the Post story was a ""classic example of the right-wing media machine.""

MSNBC's Joe Scarborough said the Post's article was ""false."" Joy Reid, also of the left-leaning network, downplayed critiques of Hunter Biden as ""nefarious conspiracy theories.""

NBC News, NPR, CBS News, and a host of print media publications were similarly guilty of downplaying the Post's reports about the Bidens, ostensibly working in lockstep with the intelligence community.

On Oct. 19, 2019, Leon Panetta, former head of the CIA; John Brennan, former head of the CIA; Michael Hayden, former head of the National Security Agency; Jim Clapper, former director of national intelligence; Nick Rasmussen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center; Mike Vickers, former under secretary of defense for intelligence; and dozens of others penned a letter entitled, ""Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails.""

The email declared that the Hunter Biden laptop story and the evidence it discussed was likely all an utter fabrication — that it had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""

Despite admitting in the letter to not knowing whether the Hunter Biden emails provided to the New York Post were ""genuine"" and having no ""evidence of Russian involvement,"" the intelligence community authors suggested a ""laptop op"" aimed ""designed to discredit Biden ... would be consistent with some of the key methods Russia has used in its now multi-year operation to interfere in our democracy.""

Twitter censorship

Twitter censored posts about the story and locked the Post — the very publication founded by Founding Father Alexander Hamilton — out of its Twitter account, demanding that the outlet remove its story.

Twitter claimed that ""hacked materials"" had been used in the Post's exposé about Hunter Biden's emails — despite the Bidens not having expressly claimed they had been hacked.

Twitter told the Post, ""In line with our Hacked Materials Policy, as well as our approach to blocking URLs, we are taking action to block any links to or images of the material in question on Twitter.""

Not only had the Post been prohibited from posting about a story relevant to the 2020 election, but users were similarly blocked from sharing links to the article about Hunter Biden's party with his father and a rep from the Ukrainian gas company paying his bills.

Users who had clicked on the link were hit with a warning that said, ""The link you are trying to access has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially spammy or unsafe.""

Only after the election took place did then-CEO Jack Dorsey admit to Congress that Twitter had made a ""total mistake"" by shutting down the Hunter Biden laptop story. Dorsey also claimed that the tech giant had locked the Post out of its account due to a ""process error.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-may-release-details-of-twitters-pre-election-censorship-of-hunter-biden-laptop-story,2022-11-25
Musk says oil and gas production needs to be ramped up,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a tweet on Friday declaring that oil and gas output should be ramped up, even though he acknowledged that such a move would have a negative impact on Tesla, which sells electric vehicles.

""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures,"" Musk tweeted. ""Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports.""

He also tweeted the message, ""Hold Strong Ukraine,"" along with Ukrainian flag emojis. He followed that up by tweeting, ""And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia, who do not want this.""

Musk's comments come as Russia wreaks death and destruction in the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Ukrainians are bravely fighting back against the Russian onslaught.

The billionaire business tycoon, who is also the SpaceX CEO, has sought to help ensure that Ukraine has internet access during the conflict.

""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,"" Musk tweeted last week in response to Mykhailo Fedorov, a Ukrainian official who had asked Musk for Starlink stations.

Fedorov later shared a photo of supplies and tweeted, ""Starlink — here. Thanks, @elonmusk.""

Musk has issued a warning regarding the use of the satellite internet service.

""Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution,"" Musk tweeted. ""Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible,"" he advised. ""Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-oil-calls-for-increased-oil-production,2022-03-05
Elon Musk promises to send more Starlink systems to Ukraine to maintain internet in 'destroyed cities',"In response to pleas from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has promised to send additional Starlink systems to provide internet coverage in war-torn areas of the country.

In a Saturday tweet, Zelenskyy announced that he had spoken to Musk, who had promised additional Starlink support. Zelenskyy thanked Musk for ""supporting Ukraine with words and deeds"" and indicated that he would like to work with Musk on space projects after the war is over.

Musk, who is believed to be the richest person in the world, has become an important figure in the Ukraine-Russia conflict after he agreed to use Starlink systems to provide internet to areas of Ukraine where internet service had been shut off by the invading Russian army.

Musk also made news by refusing to block Russian state-owned news sources like Russia Today from being broadcast on Starlink, which he says many governments asked him to do. ""We will not do so unless at gunpoint,"" Musk tweeted. ""Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.""

The Russian government has responded to Musk's action by attempting — apparently with some measure of success — to jam Starlink signals in the Ukraine conflict area. In a tweet last week, Musk noted that SpaceX had developed a software workaround to the Russian jamming attempts, and said that SpaceX would reprioritize its resources to promote cybersecurity to ensure that its signals could not be jammed by hostile powers in the future.





Control over the internet and the flow of information into and out of Ukraine has been a key priority for the governments of both Ukraine and Russia during this conflict. Russia seeks to avoid broadcasting to the world or to the Ukrainian people the widespread discontent with the war and courageous protests against it at home, while Ukraine has relied on the messaging of the telegenic Zelenskyy to encourage Western leaders to support their plight against Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-promises-to-send-more-starlink-systems-to-ukraine-to-maintain-internet-in-destroyed-cities,2022-03-06
"Report: 'Smoking gun' email shows Joe Biden met with top Burisma exec while he was VP, contradicting own claims","A newly obtained email purportedly reveals that Joe Biden met with a top executive at Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company, when he was vice president and during his son Hunter Biden's tenure on the company's board, the New York Post reported Wednesday.

The meeting allegedly happened less than a year before Biden admittedly pressured Ukrainian leaders to fire a top government prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

What are the details?

According to Post, the ""smoking gun"" email shows that Hunter Biden allegedly brokered a meeting between his father and Vadym Pozharskyi, whom the Post reported was Burisma's ""No. 3 exec,"" in April 2015.

From the Post:

The never-before-revealed meeting is mentioned in a message of appreciation that Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma, allegedly sent Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015, about a year after Hunter joined the Burisma board at a reported salary of up to $50,000 a month.



""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,"" the e-mail reads.

According to the Post, the meeting happened about one year after Pozharskyi asked Hunter Biden, in a May 2014 email, for ""advice on how you could use your influence"" to benefit Burisma.

Less than eight months after the alleged meeting, Biden pressured then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko into firing Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. Biden has since admitted he threatened to withhold U.S. money from Ukraine if Shokin was not fired.

Biden infamously recounted his threat to Poroshenko during a Council on Foreign Relations event in 2018.

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden explained. ""I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a bitch, he got fired,"" Biden bragged. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

Why is this significant?

Joe Biden maintains that he has ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.""

Pozharskyi's email directly contradicts Biden's claim. In fact, Hunter Biden even admitted last year that he discussed his overseas business dealings with his father at least ""once.""

Still, the former vice president has denied any wrongdoing.

How did the Post obtain the email?

According to the Post, the email was extracted from a laptop that was dropped off at a computer repair store in the Bidens' home state of Delaware in April 2019. The MacBook Pro computer was water-damaged, but its owner never returned to the store for the device, the store's owner told the Post.

The store's owner was not able to positively identify the owner of the computer, but said a Beau Biden Foundation sticker was on the outside of the device. Also located on the computer's hard drive were personal and explicit photographs of Hunter Biden, the paper said.

The store owner later alerted federal authorities to the laptop's existence. The FBI seized the laptop and a hard drive in December 2019, according federal court subpoena obtained by the Post.

However, prior to handing over the computer, the store owner made a copy of the computer's hard drive and gave it to the lawyer of Rudy Giuliani. The Post was alerted to the existence of the hard drive last month by Steve Bannon, and Giuliani gave the Post a copy of the hard drive over the weekend.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/email-joe-biden-met-with-burisma-exec,2020-10-14
Emails from Hunter Biden's laptop contain records the Secret Service did not hand over to lawmakers,"For years, Republican lawmakers have sought Hunter Biden's travel records as part of a larger review of Biden's use of Secret Service protection while his father was vice president. But the Secret Service claimed it was unable to identify any such communications for several years during which Biden received Secret Service protection, frustrating those efforts.



However, emails from Hunter Biden's laptop confirm that the Secret Service did coordinate Biden's travel during the years for which the Secret Service told Republican senators they could not find such communications.

On Jan. 18, 2022, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) wrote to the director of the Secret Service, requesting that the agency produce records ""involving Hunter Biden and his use of government-sponsored travel while he conducted private business."" Their letter complained that records previously provided to Congress contained inappropriate redactions and asked for unredacted copies of those documents. The lawmakers also demanded an explanation for why the Secret Service ""did not provide any communication records for the years of 2010, 2011, and 2013.""

Secret Service Director James M. Murray wrote back to the senators on Feb. 14: ""The Secret Service worked extensively with your committees, and agreed to search parameters provided by your office as to identify communications regarding Mr. Biden's travel.

""These search parameters did not yield communications for the years 2010, 2011, or 2013,"" Murray said.



But dozens of email records reported by Just the News appear to contradict what the Secret Service told Grassley and Johnson.

For example, Secret Service records show that between May 15 and May 17, 2011, Biden took a trip to Mexico with Secret Service protection. The plans for that trip were discussed ahead of time in communications between the then-vice president's son and Secret Service agents, Just the News reveals.



“Hunter, when you have some free time, I would like to discuss the Monterrey trip with you,” Secret Service agent Yvonne DiCristoforo wrote to Biden on April 28, 2011.

""I have some specific information to provide you that we received from our Mexico City office,” she added. “I know you are out of the office this evening, but if you could contact me at your convenience, I would appreciate it.""

The email was contained on a Hunter Biden laptop that is now in FBI custody, Just the News reported. It was one of five dozen emails reviewed by the outlet that show Biden communicating with his Secret Service handlers, including in the years for which the Secret Service did not hand over records.

Some of the emails Just the News reported included subject lines like ""upcoming trip"" or ""all checked in,"" that clearly identify them as emails related to Biden's travel.

The Secret Service did not respond when asked why these communications were not turned over to the senators.

In statements to Just the News, both Grassley and Johnson sharply criticized the Secret Service for failing to produce these emails.

""For years, Sen. Johnson and I have been trying to get a clear picture of Hunter Biden's communications with the Secret Service when he was under their protection,"" Grassley said. ""The Secret Service says they don’t have records for three years during Hunter Biden's time as a protectee, but I have reason to believe they do.

""In fact, I suspect there was also communication between Secret Service employees and Hunter Biden even after his protection ended. The Secret Service needs to come clean, and I intend to get to the bottom of this discrepancy.""

Johnson demanded that the agency ""immediately produce all records responsive to our October 2020 request or explain to us why the agency did not retain records it is required by law to retain.""

""The Secret Service’s inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to comply with my requests for records relating to Hunter Biden is unacceptable,"" he said. ""We now know that Hunter Biden's laptop contained records that the Secret Service claimed they did not possess and therefore failed to produce to me and Senator Grassley. I can think of only two explanations for their lack of compliance, either the Secret Service is incompetent or it is corrupt.""

Just the News obtained the emails from a laptop a Delaware repair shop owner said was abandoned by Hunter Biden in 2019. The New York Post was the first to report that this laptop had been seized by the FBI in December 2019. The content of some of the emails stored on it suggested that the Biden family, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, had been involved in corrupt business dealings with Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, which prompted Republican lawmakers to investigate the matter.

When the New York Post first broke the Hunter Biden laptop story, mainstream media outlets including the New York Times attempted to discredit the paper's reporting as Russian disinformation. Even though the Post's reporting was confirmed by the Daily Caller in October 2020, the Times did not recognize the authenticity of Biden's emails until Wednesday, March 17, 2022.

Energy Sec. Granholm begs for companies to increase oil production after Biden admin denied that it would help gas prices,"The Biden administration appeared to put out conflicting messages on gas prices when U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm begged oil companies to increase production in order to ease the price at the pump.

The statement came after several administration members denied that increasing domestic production was possible or that it would have any effect on gas prices.

“Right now, we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand,” Granholm told hundreds of energy executives at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston, Texas.

""That means you producing more right now, where and if you can,"" Granholm said to them. ""In this moment of crisis, we need more supply.""

She specifically tied the dire need to increase oil production in order to help American families struggling with the high price of gas.

""We have to responsibly increase short term supply where we can right now to stabilize the market and to minimize harm to American families,"" Granholm said.



That contrasted with a statement from President Joe Biden on Tuesday where he said gas prices were solely the fault of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""They're going to go up,"" he said to reporters about future gas prices. ""Can't do much right now. Russia is responsible.""

Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh made similar claims about Biden shutting down the Keystone Pipeline from Canada when he first entered office.



""Keystone has absolutely nothing to do with the current supply and demand in energy markets,"" Singh claimed on ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC Wednesday.

""Keystone is a pipeline, it’s not an oil field. It doesn’t produce additional oil,"" he added. ""Even if we drilled as much as we could, the price of oil is still set globally by the demand and supply conditions.""

The same sentiment was also expressed by White House Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese on CNBC.

""There is no amount of domestic production that we can do when we're dealing with a volatile global commodity where the price is set globally, there is no amount of domestic production we can do to reduce or eliminate our vulnerability as a country to that volatility,"" said Deese.

""The only way to do that is to the energy intensity of the economy overall, which means shifting to cleaner sources of energy,"" he added.

Granholm was previously criticized in November when she responded with laughter to a question about how she plans to increase oil production.

Here's Granholm's statement to the media:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/energy-sec-granholm-begs-for-companies-to-produce-more-oil-after-biden-admin-denied-that-it-would-help-gas-prices,2022-03-10
Energy Secretary Rick Perry reportedly plans to resign his post next month,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry is planning his departure from the Trump administration, according to a report from Politico, and the announcement is expected to be made before the end of November.

What are the details?

Politico reported that three sources confirmed the claims, two of whom denied Secretary Perry's planned exit has anything to do with him being pulled into the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Both the White House and the Department of Energy declined to comment on the matter.

On Tuesday, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) sent Perry a letter, asking the secretary to disclose the nature of his interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — who President Trump is accused of asking to assist in investigating Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. Perry has reportedly spoken with Zelensky at least three times.

Perry led the U.S. delegation to the inauguration of Zelensky in May, after Vice President Mike Pence bowed out. Now, Menendez — ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations — wants Perry to cough up details of the trip and to provide ""a detailed list"" of any records related to his and President Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government.

Menendez requested a response from Perry by Friday.

Perry's name has also been mentioned in a subpoena issued by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry, when they asked President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to disclose his interactions with Perry related to Ukraine.

During a department event on Wednesday, Perry said, ""I'll just briefly say we're going to work with Congress and answer all their questions,"" CNN reported.

Anything else?

Two of Politico's sources said the secretary has been planning his departure for months, and dismissed the possibility that the impeachment inquiry has anything to do with the timing of Perry's resignation.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held in-person discussions with Zelenskyy where he committed to providing Ukraine with military supplies,"The United Kingdom is going to send more than one hundred armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine as the Russian invasion drags on.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the arrangement on Saturday during an in-person visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

On Saturday, both Johnson and his Austrian counterpart, Chancellor Karl Nehammer, made in-person visits to Zelenskyy. The two leaders are the latest in a list of political figures who have made in-person visits to Ukraine in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian Embassy to the United Kingdom posted a picture of Johnson and Zelenskyy seated opposite one another at a table with the caption, “Surprise,” followed by a winking face emoji.

CNN reported that The Press Service of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said on its official Twitter account that Zelenskyy and Johnson engaged in diplomatic discussions in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.



On his Twitter account, Johnson said, “The Ukrainians have the courage of a lion. President [Zelenskyy] has given the roar of that lion. The UK stands unwaveringly with the people of Ukraine.”

At the time of writing, this tweet is pinned to top of Johnson’s Twitter page.



In an official statement as Prime Minister, Johnson said, “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.”

Johnson also praised his Ukrainian counterpart’s ""resolute leadership"" and the “invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people.” He said that the UK “stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight” and that “[the British] are in it for the long run.”

Acknowledging Johnson’s steadfast support of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, “Boris was among those who didn’t doubt for a minute whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of Great Britain in providing our country help in defense, and also leadership in sanctions policy, will always be in history.”

He added, “Ukraine will always be grateful for this to Boris and Britain.”

During a press conference, Johnson said that the United Kingdom will continue to leverage sanctions against Russia and that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has dealt a “crushing blow” to his reputation and to the global standing of the Russian government.

During a subsequent press conference, Johnson said, “We will influence Russia’s ability to use its energy sources. The war determines the vision of Ukraine’s future, so our partners and I will supply Ukraine with equipment, technology, intelligence so that Ukraine never faces the horrors of invasion and blackmail.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/england-s-prime-minister-boris-johnson-held-in-person-discussions-with-zelenskyy-agreed-to-provide-ukraine-with-military-supplies,2022-04-10
Biden's EPA set to run small Texas oil refinery out of business with big gov't regulations — even as energy prices skyrocket over Russia conflict,"The Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden is set to abruptly issue a sweeping denial of economic hardship exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program from small oil refineries around the U.S., likely forcing one Texas refinery to go out of business at a time when American energy independence is desperately needed.

In a forthcoming letter to the agency, obtained by TheBlaze, Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy urged the EPA to reconsider its proposed decision to deny more than 60 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions on behalf of The San Antonio Refinery LLC (TSAR), a small independent refinery in South Texas.

TSAR, which sources its oil from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, employs roughly 100 workers at its facility and primarily supplies gasoline and diesel to the San Antonio and Austin areas, operating at a production capacity of 21,000 barrels per day.

Since 2013, under the Clean Air Act, TSAR has been able to avoid burdensome costs associated with RFS ethanol blending mandates under a statutory guideline that allows refineries with a capacity of fewer than 75,000 barrels per day to request exemption — so long as they can demonstrate compliance would cause ""disproportionate economic hardship.""

But that all changed in December 2021 when the EPA proposed denying all pending SRE petitions, which for TSAR, included petitions from the 2019, 2020, and 2021 compliance years.

In his letter, Roy warned that imposing such a staggering regulatory burden would be catastrophic for small refineries like TSAR.

""Executing this proposal could lead to the closure of TSAR, an independent small refinery located in San Antonio, Texas, and would kill good-paying jobs, further increase the cost of refined products, and make the U.S. more dependent on hostile foreign nations like Russia for energy,"" Roy writes in a letter to EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan.

""TSAR estimates that the combined cost of denying SREs for these years could be up to six times greater than what it spends on payroll annually. This would likely put the refinery out of business,"" Roy continued, adding, ""If that is not 'disproportionate economic hardship,' I don’t know what is.""

The congressman argued that under the RFS's statutory rules, the EPA is obligated to consider each exemption request on its own merits, a provision the agency appears to have ignored with its sweeping proposal.

TheBlaze reached out to the EPA requesting a comment on the matter, but the agency has not yet issued a response.

The regulatory burden on small oil refineries also comes as America's need for energy independence is crystallized amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has inexplicably become more reliant on foreign energy in recent years — specifically doubling its imports of Russian oil in 2021. Now, the Biden administration appears hamstrung by its reliance, unable or unwilling to curtail purchases of Russian oil, thereby enriching Moscow as it carries out an unprovoked attack on its neighboring country.

Yet in the midst of all this, the EPA is set to make it even harder to obtain domestic energy at a time when it is most needed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/epa-regulations-may-run-texas-oil-refinery-out-of-business,2022-03-03
Eric Swalwell calls for Russian students to be kicked out of American universities,"On Thursday, Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) suggested that the United States deport Russian college students and shutter the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Post Millennial reported.

While on “CNN Newsroom,” Rep. Swalwell said, “Frankly, I think closing their embassy in the United States, kicking every Russian student out of the United States, those should be on the table.”

He continued, “Vladimir Putin needs to know every day that he is in Ukraine, there are more severe options that could come.”

“This is the largest invasion in Europe since World War II, and these are the harshest sanctions that any country has experienced since World War II,” the congressman added, “There will be more to come.”

On Saturday, Western allies agreed to ramp up the sanctions placed on Russia by blocking Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT network.

In a joint statement, leadership from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to amplifying financial sanctions by prohibiting Russian banks from using the telecommunications network to conduct international and domestic transactions.

By preventing Russia from utilizing the SWIFT network, Western leaders will effectively isolate them and make it incredibly difficult for the Russian economy from making either short- or long-term gains. These sanctions, notably, interfere with Russia’s ability to export natural gas and oil. Fuel exports compose more than half of Russia’s GDP.

Vodka — one of Russia’s most iconic exports — is also being affected by Western sanctions. The Canadian government is stopping the sale and importation of Russian-made products. And in the United States, several state governments have called for the removal of Russian vodka from liquor stores.

After invading Ukraine and even before Western nations issued sanctions, Russia’s economy began to crater. Currently, a Russian ruble is worth about 0.012 U.S. dollars. The Russian currency is less valuable than some in-game currencies for video games.

Rep. Swalwell currently serves on the House Intelligence Committee.

Previously, per federal investigators, Swalwell had a close personal relationship with a woman named Christine Fang. As it turns out, Ms. Fang was a spy for the Chinese government. Rep. Swalwell and Ms. Fang were involved while Swalwell served on the House Intelligence Committee.

Upon learning of Ms. Fang and Swalwell’s relationship, high-ranking members of the House Republican Caucus called for his removal from the House Intelligence Committee.

In mid-January, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that if the Republican Party wins a majority in the House of Representatives after the 2022 midterms, Rep. Swalwell will be stripped of his role on the House Intelligence Committee.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-swalwell-calls-for-russian-students-to-be-kicked-out-of-american-universities,2022-02-27
EU ambassador disputes quid pro quo claims made in Ukraine diplomat's bombshell impeachment inquiry testimony,"An attorney for U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland disputed some key claims made by William Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, during Taylor's testimony before House impeachment inquiry committees, according to the Washington Post.

Taylor's testimony has been portrayed by Democrats as the most damaging information against President Donald Trump to date, as Taylor explicitly claimed that there was a quid pro quo arrangement set up by President Trump tying security aid money to Ukraine to the Ukrainian government's cooperation and help with investigations into 2016 election interference and Burisma.

However, Sondland, who testified for the inquiry before Taylor did, has disputed some of the key claims Taylor made in his deposition, creating some doubt about the connections between aid money and investigations, and whether such alleged connections were made explicit to Ukraine.

In his testimony Taylor recalled a conversation he had with a Tim Morrison of the National Security Council on Sept. 1. Taylor said Morrison told him that Sondland told Andriy Yermak, a representative for Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, that the aid money to Ukraine would not be released until Zelensky committed to pursuing an investigation of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter Biden sat on the board.

Not true, Sondland's attorney said — or at least, he doesn't recall such a conversation.

""Sondland does not recall any conversation in Warsaw concerning the aid cutoff, although he understood that the Ukrainians were, by then, certainly aware of the cutoff and raised the issue directly with [Vice President Mike] Pence,"" Sondland attorney Robert Luskin wrote to the Post.

Taylor also testified that on Sept. 7 Morrison told him that President Trump told Sondland that he was insisting that Zelensky ""go to a microphone"" to say he is opening investigations into 2016 election interference and into Biden's Ukraine business dealings. The president allegedly said that although he wasn't asking for a ""quid pro quo,"" if Zelensky didn't go public with the investigations, then things would be at a ""stalemate.""

Sondland's lawyer denies such a call ever took place.

""[Sondland] was asked about all of his interactions with Trump on this subject matter,"" Luskin wrote. ""These did not include another call on the 7th.""

As House Democrats continue investigations that could lead to actual impeachment in the near future, Republicans are growing frustrated that access to the depositions is limited to members of certain committees. Although some Republicans are indeed allowed to attend, some Republicans are pushing for greater public transparency.

EU energy prices soar as Russia vows not to resume gas supplies until sanctions lifted,"Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe until the West lifts its sanctions, reports the Guardian.

Dmitry Peskov, Moscow’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” for Russia’s failure to deliver gas to Europe.

European gas prices increased by as much as 30% following Russia’s announcement. The European Union (EU) is now weighing new gas benchmarks and price caps to address the soaring prices.

Russian energy supplier Gazprom announced that a suspension of gas supplies to Europe would be extended indefinitely, citing “malfunctions” on a turbine along the major Nord Stream 1 pipeline, reports the Guardian. Gazprom has blamed sanctions for delaying its ability to repair the turbine.

Germany’s energy regulator said that “the defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the cessation of operations.” Germany, which had been planning to bolster its natural gas reserves in an effort to maintain sufficient power and ease energy inflation, is now unlikely to meet its targets.

Nord Stream 1 is the single biggest gas pipeline between Russia and Europe and has historically supplied about a third of the gas Russia exported to Europe; its supply is considered crucial to improving the European energy crisis.

""Supply is hard to come by, and it becomes harder and harder to replace every bit of gas that doesn't come from Russia,"" said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research. Norway, a major European gas producer, has been increasing its output to European markets in response.

France has been hit particularly hard by the energy crisis. The government has spent over $26 billion since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to reduce French citizens’ gas and electric bills. Companies in France will soon be required to cut their energy use “by 10 percent or face enforced rationing of electricity and gas,” reports the New York Times. Businesses will also have to appoint an “ambassador of energy sobriety” and send the government their plans for cutting electricity use.

Gazprom – the Russian government-owned energy behemoth – has shut down a critical natural gas pipeline to Europe. Last week, Gazprom switched off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to perform urgent maintenance work.

There are concerns that Russia may hold Europe hostage with the pipeline over the winter.

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied more than a third of Germany’s gas supplies.

Europe is already burdened with record-high energy prices

In August, Spain experienced its most expensive month for electricity since records have been kept.

France 24 reported, ""The year-ahead contract for German electricity reached 995 euros ($995) per megawatt hours while the French equivalent surged past 1,100 euros – a more than tenfold increase in both countries from last year. In Britain, energy regulator Ofgem said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from October 1 to an average £3,549 ($4,197) per year.""

Daniele Franco – Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance – warned that the country's net energy import costs will more than double this year to nearly 100 billion euros ($99.5 billion). Franco said the nation was helpless in the matter, ""To keep offsetting, at least in part, rising energy prices through public finances is very costly and we could never do enough.""

Germany faces a coal shortage

The lack of oil and gas has forced European nations to increase their dependency on coal.

In Germany, the water levels in the Rhine River have hit crisis levels amid summer heatwaves. The Rhine River – one of Europe's key waterways – has already been closed due to low water levels.

""Due to very reduced domestic shipping, accumulated coal stocks could quickly fall,"" Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said in a document obtained by Reuters.

Other major waterways have also prevented large vessels from bringing coal to European countries. That coal is now stuck in ports. Approximately 8 million tons of coal were stranded in ports at the end of July, Politico reported. If the supply chain woes continue, it will have dire effects on Germany, Poland, and Switzerland in the winter.

Scandinavian governments are bailing out energy companies

Finland and Sweden announced that they plan to offer billions of dollars to energy companies to prevent them from ending up in ""technical bankruptcy.""

""The rapid rise in electricity prices has resulted in paper losses on electricity futures contracts of energy firms, forcing them to find funds to post additional collateral with the exchanges,"" according to Reuters.

Finland will offer $9.95 billion, and Sweden will give $23.2 billion to energy companies.

Businesses face bankruptcy over energy costs

MakeUK – the lobbyist group for British factories – said nearly half of all manufacturers in the country have seen electricity bills skyrocket more than 100% in the past year.



Bloomberg reported, ""Soaring energy bills are threatening to put six in 10 British manufacturers out of business, according to a survey that lays bare the extent of the crisis facing the next prime minister.""

Sky-high energy prices are severely curtailing production

""Nordic Greens, one of the largest tomato growers in both Denmark and Sweden, has announced that they will not grow any tomatoes during winter in their Sweden-based cultivation because of the skyrocketing electricity prices, ""according to HortiDaily – a global greenhouse news website.

An estimated 500 tonnes of tomatoes will be lost because of the shutdown.

Multiple European aluminum smelters have drastically cut production or temporarily shut down because of spiking energy prices.

""Industry insiders say the escalating energy crisis is now threatening to create an extinction event across large swathes of the region’s aluminum production,"" Bloomberg reported.

Restrictions on electricity, heat, and water

Since July, some of Germany's biggest cities implemented restrictions on warm water, heat, and lighting.

U.S. Army bracing for energy shortages at a military base in Germany

Last month, the U.S. Army notified troops that there would likely be energy restrictions at the U.S. Army Garrison in Ansbach, Germany.



""USAG Ansbach installations rely solely on local German utility partners for power, heating, and water needs,"" the Army memo stated. ""In spite of all the solar panels and windmills in Germany, a large percentage of the energy used for heating within the EU is imported…much of it from Russia.""



DPW Energy manager Brad Jennings said, ""There is the potential that we will have to endure large cuts in available power and heating.""

The U.S. Army advised servicemembers to put on extra clothing, minimize long, hot showers by lowering the temperature, and use cold water instead of hot.

Civil unrest is on the rise across the globe

Verisk Maplecroft – a risk consultancy firm – released its latest Civil Unrest Index last week. The most recent report found that out of 198 countries, 101 experienced an increase in risk of civil unrest, versus only 42 which decreased.

""The data, covering seven years, shows that the last quarter saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the Index was released,"" the report stated.

The analysts noted that ""rising food and energy prices will make it more difficult for governments to manage popular discontent.""

""A cold autumn and winter in Europe would worsen an already serious energy and cost of living crisis,"" the report said.

On Friday, Italians burned their energy bills in front of the town hall in Naples.

On Saturday, an estimated 70,000 protesters staged a demonstration in Prague ""against soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine,"" according to the Guardian.

"European Commission and the International Energy Agency suggest that people cut energy usage by driving slower, adjusting their thermostats, working from home","The European Commission and the International Energy Agency have suggested that Europeans cut down on energy consumption by adopting practices such as adjusting the thermostat, driving slower on highways, using public transit, working from home, and walking or biking on short trips rather than driving a vehicle.

""Using less energy is a concrete way for Europeans to reduce their bills, cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels, demonstrate solidarity with the Ukrainian people, and support climate action,"" the report declares. Ukraine has been striving to defend itself amid a brutal invasion as Russia has been wreaking death and destruction, killing many, including civilians.

The energy saving proposal suggests setting the air conditioning on a warmer temperature and lowering the temperature target when heating. It also suggests that drivers reduce their speed in order to increase fuel efficiency.

""The average heating temperature within homes across the European Union is over 22 °C, but many could comfortably accommodate 19 °C or 20 °C. Turning down the thermostat in your home by just 1 °C would save around 7% of the energy you use for heating,"" the report states. ""Setting your air conditioner 1 °C warmer could reduce the amount of electricity used by almost 10% and save you EUR 20 a year.""

""Driving too fast is inefficient for the car engine and wastes fuel. The average car in the European Union clocks up around 13 000 kilometres a year. By reducing your average cruising speed on motorways by 10 kilometres an hour, you could cut your household fuel bill by around EUR 60 a year,"" the proposal states.



Many figures and institutions around the globe promote climate alarmism.

""When it comes to climate change, time really is running out. Earth Day is a reminder that if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, we can help preserve and protect our planet for future generations,"" former U.S. President Barack Obama tweeted on Friday.



BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey of ""Relatable,"" responded by tweeting, ""If you believed this, you wouldn’t have a mansion on the beach."" Obama has a mansion on Martha's Vineyard, a Massachusetts island.

European officials allege Russia's energy pipelines into Europe were sabotaged,"Two Russian natural gas pipelines into Europe, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, have both experienced leaks near Sweden and Denmark. The leaks, which Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen indicated were ""hard to imagine"" as coincidences, occurred within hours of one another.

The first leak is suspected to have occurred overnight and was detected early Monday in the NS2 between Russia and Denmark.

Reuters reported this to have occurred within a day of the Tuesday launch of the Baltic Pipe, which will carry gas from Norway to Poland — part of a European effort to wean off of Russian supply. At its inauguration, Frederiksen suggested that the Baltic Pipe would help ""remove energy as a Russian instrument of power.""

Two additional leaks were reported later on the NS1, northeast of the Danish island Bornholm, after the pipeline operator indicated a pressure drop. According to the Swedish Maritime Administration, one of the leaks was in the Swedish economic zone and the other in the Danish economic zone, close to one another.

Network operator Nord Stream AG stated that the ""destruction that occurred on the same day simultaneously on three strings of the offshore gas pipelines of the Nord Stream system is unprecedented,"" noting that it is not yet clear how long it will take to restore the infrastructure.

The pipelines were not in operation at the time of the leaks, although they nevertheless contained gas under pressure.

The Kremlin-controlled energy company Gazprom suspended gas flow to Europe via the NS1 in late August, citing technical difficulties allegedly caused by Western sanctions. In 2021, Europe imported an estimated 155 billion cubic meters of fuel from Russia, 35% of which came by way of the NS1.

The NS2, on the other hand, has yet to begin commercial operations. They were delayed indefinitely ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.



Upon learning of the leaks, Denmark restricted shipping in a five-nautical-mile radius around the area. A no-fly zone is also reportedly in effect.

An investigation into the cause is under way.

Below is footage of the gas leaks in the Baltic Sea shared by the Twitter account for Denmark's Armed Forces.

Although the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities suggested, ""It is too early to say anything about the causes of the incidents,"" suspicions of sabotage are mounting.



Sabotage?

Kristoffer Bottzauw, who heads the Danish energy agency, emphasized that ""breaches of gas pipelines happen extremely rarely.""



One European security source told Reuters, ""There are some indications that it is deliberate damage,"" begging the question, ""Who would profit?""

Russia, which has used the power it exports to maintain some political leverage over Europe, indicated the leak was cause for concern. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, suggested, ""No option can be ruled out right now.""

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki explicitly called the leaks the result of ""sabotage, related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine.""

According to Der Tagesspiegel, one German government source indicated he or she ""can't imagine a scenario that isn't a targeted attack. Everything speaks against a coincidence.""

Politico's Jakob Hanke Vela said other German officials suspect the leaks were intentional.

These pipelines and the energy they have up until recently supplied Europe with have been the subject of much debate during Russia's war on Ukraine.

Various activists have protested the pipelines' construction and maintenance over the years. For instance, in May 2019, activists occupied a Nord Stream building site in northern Germany, protesting the line's construction.



Political leaders, including former President Donald Trump, have similarly criticized the pipelines, in many cases calling for them to be sanctioned, citing the geopolitical leverage they provide to Russia.

Ukraine has vehemently opposed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, both before and after the Biden administration ended its opposition to its Russian completion.

This year, Biden pivoted, indicating in vague terms that he might ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2.

A cold winter

Europe finds itself in an energy crisis. People are stocking up on firewood in Eastern Europe. European governments are now considering introducing energy rationing this winter, with the EU having already asked member nations to reduce gas consumption by 15%.

Russian president Vladimir Putin suggested earlier this month that he may leave Europe to ""freeze,"" saying, ""We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. ... We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil — we will not supply anything.""

In light of the Nord Stream leaks, even if Russia were to reverse its tack and diplomacy were to prevail, it is unclear whether it will be a matter of days, weeks, or months to restore the pipelines and westward energy flow.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-officials-allege-russias-energy-pipelines-into-europe-were-sabotaged,2022-09-27
'You are a disgrace': European MPs trash Justin Trudeau to his face during Brussels visit over 'trampling' of Freedom Convoy protests,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was forced to sit and watch as members of the European Parliament out-and-out denounced the leader to his face on Wednesday over his dictatorial handling of the Freedom Convoy protests.

The progressive prime minister — who last month invoked the Emergencies Act to quell vaccine mandate protests in Canada's capital city — was in Brussels, Belgium, this week to urge European leaders to step up their opposition to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

But some MEPs were not so keen on taking instruction from someone they view as a dictator, the Toronto Sun reported.

What are the details?

German MEP Christine Anderson offered Trudeau what she called an appropriate ""welcome"" to the European Parliament by calling the leader a ""disgrace"" and condemning him for human rights violations.

""It would have been appropriate for Mr. Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, to address this house, according to article 144, an article, which was specifically designed to debate the violations of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law,"" Anderson began.

""A prime minister who openly admires the Chinese basic dictatorship, who tramples on fundamental rights by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens as terrorists just because they dared to stand up to his perverted concept of democracy should not be allowed to speak in this house at all,"" the lawmaker continued.

She then ended her short speech with a bang, declaring, ""You are a disgrace for any democracy. Please spare us your presence,"" as the prime minister looked on.

What else?

Another MEP, Mislav Kolakusic of Croatia, joined in on the harsh denunciation of the Canadian prime minister.

During his floor speech, Kolakusic made specific reference to Freedom Convoy protesters' controversial encounter with police horses near Parliament Hill when he called out Trudeau's ""tramp[ling] of fundamental values.""

The MEP said Canada was once a symbol of the modern world but has recently become a ""symbol of civil rights violation"" under Trudeau’s ""quasi-liberal boot.""

“We watched how you trample women with horses, how you block bank accounts of single parents so they can’t even pay their children’s education and medicine, that they can’t pay utilities, mortgages for their homes,"" he charged, adding, ""To you, these may be liberal methods, for many citizens of the world, it is a dictatorship of the worst kind.""

Following the invocation of the Emergencies Act, the Canadian government took unprecedented actions to halt protests, including freezing private and corporate bank accounts and threatening arrest for parents who brought children to demonstrations.

Kolakusic concluded with a shot at Trudeau's message to the body by saying united citizens of the world ""can stop a regime that wants to destroy the freedom of citizens, either by bombs or harmful pharmaceutical products.""

Anything else?

Still another MEP, Cristian Terhes of Romania, protested Trudeau's speech by refusing to attend the plenary session.

The MEP said in a Facebook post that Trudeau can’t come and ""teach democracy lessons to Putin from the European Parliament when you trample with horse hooves your own citizens who are demanding their fundamental rights be respected.""

""The difference between democracy and tyranny is not determined by the geographical location of political leaders, but by the values they promote,"" Teres added.

German MEP Bernhard Zimniok, too, blasted Trudeau, saying the prime minister should not have been invited to speak. By welcoming the prime minister, he argued the body had sent ""an invitation to someone who has been trampling on democratic rights.""

""Clearly the values of democracy are being despised by this individual,"" Zimniok added. ""Let us not give someone like this any speaking time in this house of democracy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-parliament-members-denounce-justin-trudeau,2022-03-24
European Union fails to implement Russian oil embargo despite overall unified opposition to Russia,"The European Union was unable to reach a consensus on banning the import of Russian oil into member nations.

The New York Times reported the member nations of the European Union were unable to reach a unanimous decision in Brussels to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin by cutting off imports of Russian oil.

Reportedly, the diplomatic envoy from Hungary put up the most resistance to the proposed ban on Russian oil imports.

In order for the European Union to implement sanctions, as an institution, all 27 of its member states must agree to enforce them in their respective nations. Historically, countries like Hungary and Germany have been hesitant to issue restrictions on oil imports from Russia due to their nations’ dependence on it. Currently, the European Union is the single largest consumer of crude oil and fuel from Russia. In 2019, almost two-thirds of the European Union’s crude oil imports came from Russia.

Despite the roadblock in banning the import of Russian oil, the European Union member states appear to be solidly unified against Russia as the war in Ukraine drags on.

The European Union has already approved five sanctions packages against Russia. This latest package and its subsequent failure to pass underscore what U.S. intelligence officials have warned that the leadership of Russia is counting on: weakening Western resolve as the conflict drags on. That said, this recent round of sanctions would have caused considerable economic distress for the people of the countries implementing the sanctions.

The U.S. director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines, said, “Putin most likely also judges that Russia has a greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries, and he is probably counting on U.S. and E.U. resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation, and energy prices get worse.”

Haines delivered these remarks as Russia appeared to be nearing the fulfillment of one its stated goals of the invasion: taking control of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. However, Haines suggested that taking control of Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine is likely neither to satisfy Putin nor bring the war to a close. Haines suggested that Putin likely wants to claim territory that stretches across Ukraine’s Black Sea coast but that this goal will take much longer to achieve.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to send Ukraine $40 billion in aid.

PBS reported that the massive spending package was passed 368-57 and splits the money evenly between defense spending for Ukraine and humanitarian programs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-union-oil-embargo,2022-05-11
The European Union plans to phase out Russian oil entirely by the end of 2022,"The European Union (EU) is moving forward to propose a ban on Russian oil by the end of 2022.

Until this ban is put into effect, the EU will continue to implement restrictions on imports of Russian oil.

The EU also plans to push for more thoroughgoing sanctions on Russia and its allies by advocating for more Russian and Belarusian banks to be cut off from the SWIFT telecommunications network. Bloomberg reported that this list of banks includes Sberbank PJSC, Russia’s largest financial institution, which has been providing a vital economic lifeline in recent months. Sberbank was previously sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K.

A decision on the new sanctions may come as soon as next week at a meeting of EU ambassadors. If the sanctions are to go into effect, this would be the sixth package of sanctions placed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine this past February.

In order for the EU to implement sanctions, all of its 27 member states must agree to enforce them in their nations. Reportedly, countries like Hungary and Germany are historically hesitant to issue restrictions on imports of Russian oil due to their nations’ dependence on it. Currently, the EU is the single largest consumer of crude oil and fuel from Russia. In 2019, almost two-thirds of crude oil imported by EU nations came from Russia.

Reportedly, an embargo on Russian oil would dramatically increase tensions between the EU and Russia as the EU tries to pressure Putin into ending his invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions are aimed at hitting Russia’s revenue from oil exports as much as possible without causing turmoil in the global marketplace. One concern is that increasing the costs of Russian oil by sanctioning it could lead to a boost in Russia’s income instead of punishing it.

An ongoing issue that the EU and Russia are experiencing is how to pay for gas that is being imported into EU member nations. With the majority of Russia’s banks being removed from the SWIFT telecommunications network, conducting business with Russian companies is harder than it once was. Making the process increasingly difficult is that Russian entities are demanding EU member states pay for their oil imports in Russian rubles, but doing so would breach sanctions currently in place.

If EU member states don’t comply and start paying for their oil imports in rubles, Russia will cease doing business with them. Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off by Russia for failing to meet the country’s standards.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-union-russian-oil,2022-05-01
'Examine your conscience': Biden gives condescending response to subpoena question from Des Moines Register,"Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden asked the Des Moines Register's editorial board to ""examine their conscience"" in an interview posted Friday, after the newspaper's executive editor pressed the former senator on his vow not to comply if he is called to testify before the upper chamber as part of the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

The Register's executive editor, Carol Hunter, asked Biden about his previous declaration that he would not show up if the Senate calls him to testify, asking the candidate, ""Do you stand by your earlier statements that you wouldn't comply if you were subpoenaed to testify in an impeachment trial before the Senate?""

""Correct,"" Biden responded. ""And the reason I wouldn't, is because it's all designed to deal with Trump doing what he's done his whole life. Trying to take the focus off him. The issue is not what I did. Not a single person, not one single person — even that thug [Rudy] Giuliania and his compatriots — have said I did anything other than my job.""

""This is all about a diversion,"" Biden continued, before claiming that ""every single person"" thought the Ukrainian prosecutor Biden bragged about getting fired should have been gone. The former vice president emphasized the ""people in the [Obama] administration"" were also in agreement.

Ms. Hunter pressed Biden, asking, ""Doesn't that position you as if you're defying a subpoena, putting yourself above the law?"" echoing what House Democrats have said against President Donald Trump for not testifying in their impeachment probe.



""Well, look, the grounds for them to call me would be overwhelmingly specious,"" Biden responded, adding, ""I don't anticipate that happening anyway.""

""Let's say I voluntarily just said let me go and make my case,"" Biden said. ""What are you going to cover? You guys are going to cover for three weeks anything that I said. And [Trump's] going to get away."" Leaning toward Ms. Hunter at the table, Biden continued, ""You guys buy into it all the time. Not a joke. Think about it.""

At that point, Biden looked around the room and said, ""As they say in my church, examine your conscience. Doesn't mean I shouldn't testify if you thought I should, but think what it's about. It's all about what he does all the time. His entire career. Take the focus off.""

Then, again leaning toward Ms. Hunter and staring at her, Biden started banging his index finger on the table while asserting, ""This guy violated the Constitution. He said it in the driveway of the White House. He acknowledged he asked for help.""

The reason Biden's name has been floated as a possible witness in the Senate is because President Trump is accused of asking the president of Ukraine to look into corruption probes involving a Ukrainian firm that employed the former vice president's son, Hunter Biden, beginning in the Obama administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/examine-your-conscience-biden-gives-condescending-response-to-subpoena-question-from-des-moines-register,2019-12-28
"Exclusive: Bill Barr rips Russiagate as 'seditious', explains origins of Durham probe","Bill Barr, former U.S. attorney general and author of the new book, ""One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General,"" says that the Russian collusion allegations leveled against former President Donald Trump by Democrats were a ""seditious"" attempt to undermine his presidency and a ""grave injustice.""

Barr made those comments on an upcoming episode of BlazeTV host Glenn Beck's podcast, where he explained why he joined the Trump administration and eventually appointed special prosecutor John Durham to investigate the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe.



""I thought we were heading into a constitutional crisis. I think whatever you think of Trump, the fact is that the whole Russiagate thing was a grave injustice. It appears to be a dirty political trick that was used first to hobble him and then potentially to drive him from office,"" Barr told Beck.

""I believe it is seditious,"" he added, clarifying that whether that could be proved in court as a crime is another issue.

""It was a gross injustice, and it hurt the United States in many ways, including what we're seeing in Ukraine these days. It distorted our foreign policy, and so forth,"" Barr said.

An FBI investigation into Trump's campaign over alleged ties to the Russian government during the 2016 election, known as Crossfire Hurricane, was the source of unceasing controversy for Trump throughout his presidency. Leaks from the investigation were used by the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign to accuse Trump of colluding with the Russians to interfere in the election, spawning conspiracy theories that his victory was illegitimate. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, congressional Democrats accused him of attempting to obstruct the Russia probe, demanding the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Trump's actions.

After a two-year, $32 million investigation, Robert Mueller released a report in March 2019 that showed evidence of Russian interference in the election, but said the ""investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" By this time, questions were raised about the origins of Crossfire Hurricane and whether the FBI had inappropriately sought a FISA court warrant to surveil members of Trump's 2016 campaign using opposition research from the Clinton campaign.

Revelations that the FBI had in fact used material from a political opposition research report paid for by the Clinton campaign that made false allegations against Trump — the infamous ""Steele dossier"" — spurred Attorney General Barr in 2019 to appoint U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the origins of the FBI's Russia probe. In December 2020, Barr disclosed that he had made Durham special counsel in October, ensuring that the investigation would continue after President Joe Biden assumed office.

Barr explained to Beck that he acted in secret to give Durham protection from the incoming administration.

""I was highly confident he would remain in office and they wouldn't touch him,"" he said.

""[The Biden] administration had no real interest in protecting either Hillary Clinton or Comey. And at the end of the day, for them to lose the capital and appear to be covering something up that would then never get resolved, I didn't think was in their interest. And I think institutionally that would've destroyed the new AG if he had tried that,"" he continued.



The former attorney general also took time to address complaints from the right that Durham was unable to wrap up his investigation before the Trump administration departed after the 2020 election.

Barr said that when Durham was first brought on board, inspector general Michael Horowitz had not yet finished his investigation of the FBI's use of FISA court warrants against the Trump campaign, and Durham wanted the IG report before diving in to his own investigation. When the IG finally released his report in December 2019, Durham had access to it for just three months before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, shutting down grand juries and delaying Durham's investigation through most of 2020, Barr said.

""If you don't have the threat of a grand jury, no one will come in and talk to you. You'll say, the usual thing is, 'Please come in for a voluntary interview.' And people come in because they know if they don't, they're subpoenaed. But if there is no grand jury, they say, 'No, I'm not coming in,' and there's nothing you can do. And people don't understand that that state of affairs lasted until the month before the election,"" Barr said. ""So his hands were very much tied as to how far he could push things and how much pressure he could bring on people through most of 2020.""

Now that the pandemic has wound down, Durham's probe brought an indictment against former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is accused of lying to the FBI in a meeting where he presented information connecting the Trump campaign to Alfa Bank, a financial institution with ties to Russia, but did not tell agents he was working for the Clinton campaign.

Clinton's 2016 campaign manager, Robby Mook, testified as a witness in Sussmann's trial last week, when he told jurors that Clinton had personally authorized her campaign to share information with a reporter — later discovered to be disinformation — that purportedly linked Trump to Russia.



Mook also acknowledged that the Clinton campaign had not verified the accuracy of the data before it went to the press.

The full episode of ""The Glenn Beck Podcast"" featuring Attorney General Barr will be released Saturday, May 28.

Experts say passenger-loaded Boeing 737 may have crashed and burst into flame due to 'human-induced event',"Some experts believe that this week's Chinese plane crash may have taken place as a result of a ""human-induced event.""

China Eastern Airlines flight 5735 crashed Monday with more than 130 people on board after it plummeted to the ground in just minutes from an altitude of nearly 30,000 feet.

Rescue crews have yet to locate any survivors at the time of this reporting.

What are the details?

Australian aviation expert Neil Hansford told news.com.au that he cannot fathom how the plane would have vertically crashed into the ground without some sort of human interference.

“Even with total loss of power, no aircraft plummets to the ground from 20,000 feet in two minutes with an event at 8,000 feet,” Hansford reasoned. “I think aircraft technical failure can be ruled out and it will be an external event ... I would get on a Boeing 737-800 in an instant with an Australian carrier, so my suggestion would be it won’t be Boeing or aircraft technical related.”

He added that he believes it is ""very unlikely"" that a pilot would have passed out during the trip, ""as the non-flying pilot would have been able to very safely take over the flying"" and safely land the aircraft in some kind of emergency.

“Likely scenarios include pilot suicide, aircraft mid-air collision with military aircraft (they don’t have transponders like civil aircraft), [the flight] was struck by a missile or an on-board explosion,"" Hansford continued. ""My tipping is a human-induced event or bought down by rogue missile. Debris looks like MH117 over Ukraine, and the Chinese are providing too much information this time which is uncharacteristic.”

Sally Gethin, a United Kingdom-based expert, added that she believed it was “really hard to ascertain at this point in time whether the aircraft was entirely intact"" when it ""dropped so suddenly.”

“I would tend to think that there had already been a catastrophic incident on board for it to be able to drop so dramatically in that way,” she explained. “But at the same time, it could also be a problem that the pilot was struggling with and finally lost control.”

She added, “[It] will be revealed in their communications with the radar control, with their traffic management side, and that will be revealed in the voice recorder. [The plane] was at nearly 30,000 feet – which is cruising altitude – and from the ground that would look like a dot up in the sky,” she said when asked about footage showing the crash. “It fell from that height – nearly 30,000 feet – suddenly perpendicular. It maintained some stability, it paused and then several seconds later it then dropped again suddenly. That footage captures it in that second phase, where it drops completely vertically to the ground.”

The International Business Times reported that ahead of its steep descent, FlightRadar24 showed the aircraft plummeting from 29,100 feet to just 9,075 feet in approximately two minutes. Just 20 seconds later, the aircraft's altitude was 3,225 feet and contact was lost.

The report noted that such a landing would typically take approximately 30 minutes.

A Tuesday Reuters report stated that extensive damage to the aircraft would ultimately make it quite difficult to pinpoint the precise cause of the crash.

Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters that ""investigations will face a very high level of difficulty"" due to the condition of the airliner.

""Given the information currently available, we still do not have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash,"" Tao added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/experts-say-passenger-loaded-boeing-737-may-have-crashed-and-burst-into-flame-due-to-human-induced-event,2022-03-22
Some fear a recession is 'inevitable' thanks to Biden's economic woes and the Fed's horrible track record for fixing inflation,"Financial experts warned this week that the U.S. economy is heading straight for a recession and has little to no hope of avoiding such an outcome.

What are the details?

With inflation at a four-decade high and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates amid cratering economic growth expectations, a recession is now ""inevitable,"" warned former Federal Reserve Bank of New York president Bill Dudley in an op-ed for Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

Throughout the pandemic, the Fed has employed an ultra-accommodative monetary policy — consisting of low interest rates and substantial quantitative easing — to stabilize the economy. The benefit was low unemployment, but the trade-off was skyrocketing inflation, according to Fortune.

But now in order to curb inflation, the central bank will need to push the unemployment rate higher. The end result, Dudley said, will be a recession.

""The Fed’s application of its framework has left it behind the curve in controlling inflation. This, in turn, has made a hard landing virtually inevitable,"" Dudley wrote.

History backs up his assertion. Politico reported on Tuesday that, according to data compiled by investment bank Piper Sandler, ""the Fed often stumbles in its efforts to save the day.""

In fact, the report noted, ""Nine times since 1961, the central bank has embarked on a series of interest rate increases to rein in inflation. Eight times a recession followed.""

""Not a sterling track record,"" Politico assessed. That's an understatement.

What else?

Adding to the grim economic warnings of an impending recession was news that the U.S. Treasury note yield curve had inverted.

While only a sign, an inverted yield curve is an important one, CNN Business reported, noting the ""warning sign"" has correctly predicted nearly every recession the U.S. has experienced in the last 60 years.

The outlet explained ""an inverted yield curve is often seen as a signal that investors are more nervous about the immediate future than the longer term, spurring interest rates on short-term bonds to move higher than those paid on long-term bonds.""

The unusual distortion is considered a harbinger of bad economic times to come.

""It doesn’t mean a recession is coming,"" J.P. Morgan's Stephanie Roth told CNBC this week. ""It just reflects concerns about the future economy.""

Anything else?

In its report on the Fed's inflation-fixing track record, Politico begrudgingly noted that worries surrounding a recession are ""more pronounced"" this time around due to ""extraordinary circumstances"" plaguing the U.S. economy under President Joe Biden.

Such circumstances include historically high inflation, major supply chain disruptions, widespread staffing shortages, and a war in Ukraine that has upended global energy markets.

"Facebook takes down the page of author David Harris Jr., and targets other conservatives","The Facebook page of conservative author David Harris Jr. was unpublished on Friday, according to an article in Reclaim the Net. The report says Harris' page was taken down after warnings of community standards violations. Facebook's decision coincides with its announcement on Friday that it would remove posts mentioning the name of the alleged whistleblower in the ongoing scandal involving President Trump's dealings with Ukraine.

Harris immediately took to Twitter to blast the social media giant and allege he was targeted for political reasons. ""This is solely because I support President @realDonaldTrump!"" said the author.

According to Reclaim the Net, the removal of Harris' page came after he was informed on Wednesday that his page received 14 community standards violations. Harris was also accused of publishing two false articles concerning climate change. However, Harris says he received no explanation of how his posts violated Facebook's rules.

Conservative Latina also targeted

In an unrelated case, another conservative targeted by Facebook on Friday was Erika Garcia, a young GOP leader in Central Florida. In an interview with TheBlaze, Garcia said she posted photos of the alleged whistleblower posing with Democrats Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on her personal Facebook page, and within an hour the post was gone. She then shared them again in a post on the Florida Republicans United Facebook group that also disappeared.

Garcia, who serves as the Orange County chairwoman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, says she appealed the decision and was told by Facebook the post did not comply with its Community Standards, presumably the same ones that Harris was accused of violating.

She provided The Blaze with a screenshot of the message she received from the social media company:

Courtesy of Erika Garcia

The Orlando-area activist says this is not the first time she has been censored by Facebook. ""They once removed a video I posted where I was being interviewed about why I love President Trump as a legal Mexican immigrant.""



She added, ""Facebook has now removed two of my posts without any notice or any sort of communication. I think we have a freedom of speech crisis in America.""

What else?

The decisions came after Facebook said in a statement yesterday, ""Any mention of the potential whistleblower's name violates our coordinating harm policy, which prohibits content 'outing of witness, informant, or activist. We are removing any and all mentions of the potential whistleblower's name and will revisit this decision should their name be widely published in the media or used by public figures in debate.""

YouTube then followed Facebook's lead and issued a similar statement to CNN:

A YouTube spokesperson said videos mentioning the potential whistleblower's name would also be removed. The spokesperson said the company would use a combination of machine learning and human review to scrub the content. The removals, the spokesperson added, would affect the titles and descriptions of videos as well as the video's actual content.

Facebook locks Ron Paul out of his account for violating 'community standards',"Former Republican Congressman and libertarian icon Ron Paul (Texas) was locked out of his Facebook account by the social media giant on Monday, after he shared a column blasting Big Tech for silencing Americans and accused platforms of a coordinated attack with government to stifle free speech.

What are the details?

""With no explanation other than ""repeatedly going against our community standards,"" @Facebook has blocked me from managing my page,"" Paul tweeted. ""Never have we received notice of violating community standards in the past and nowhere is the offending post identified.""

He explained, ""The only thing we posted to Facebook today was my weekly 'Texas Straight Talk' column, which I have published every week since 1976.""

The last post on the anti-war former congressman's Facebook account was from Monday morning, titled, ""The 'War on Terror' Comes Home.""

Within it, Paul began by arguing, ""Last week's massive social media purges – starting with President Trump's permanent ban from Twitter and other outlets – was shocking and chilling, particularly to those of us who value free expression and the free exchange of ideas.""

He goes on to write:

""Big Tech"" long ago partnered with the Obama/Biden/Clinton State Department to lend their tools to US 'soft power' goals overseas. Whether it was ongoing regime change attempts against Iran, the 2009 coup in Honduras, the disastrous US-led coup in Ukraine, 'Arab Spring,' the destruction of Syria and Libya, and so many more, the big US tech firms were happy to partner up with the State Department and US intelligence to provide the tools to empower those the US wanted to seize power and to silence those out of favor.

Paul concludes:

So what is to be done? Even pro-free speech alternative social media outlets are under attack from the Big Tech/government Leviathan. There are no easy solutions. But we must think back to the dissidents in the era of Soviet tyranny. They had no Internet. They had no social media. They had no ability to communicate with thousands and millions of like-minded, freedom lovers. Yet they used incredible creativity in the face of incredible adversity to continue pushing their ideas. Because no army – not even Big Tech partnered with Big Government - can stop an idea whose time has come. And Liberty is that idea. We must move forward with creativity and confidence!

Daniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity confirmed to The Washington Examiner that Paul had been locked out of his account, telling the outlet, ""They claim the lockout is temporary, but have provided no additional information as to the length of the suspension or the remedy.""

"Facebook pledges to censor 'any and all' content mentioning whistleblower's identity, YouTube follows suit","Facebook and YouTube announced Friday they would censor content that mentions the name of the government whistleblower who filed a complaint President Donald Trump, which sparked the impeachment inquiry against him.

Facebook said in a statement, ""Any mention of the potential whistleblower's name violates our coordinating harm policy, which prohibits content 'outing of witness, informant, or activist. We are removing any and all mentions of the potential whistleblower's name and will revisit this decision should their name be widely published in the media or used by public figures in debate.""

The spokesperson said the company would use a combination of machine learning and human review to scrub the content. The removals, the spokesperson added, would affect the titles and descriptions of videos as well as the video's actual content.

Twitter, however, said that mentioning the name of the person believed to be the whistleblower is not a violation of its rules and tweets doing so would not be scrubbed from the platform.

The whistleblower is purported to be a career CIA analyst who worked on the National Security Council during the Obama administration and the initial months of the Trump administration.

Facebook suppresses bombshell Hunter Biden story pending fact-check,"Facebook is limiting the distribution of the New York Post's bombshell story about a ""smoking gun"" email appearing to show that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden met with a top Ukrainian natural gas executive while he was vice president, contrary to Biden's prior claims.

According to the Post, a 2015 email between Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, an advisor to Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, shows Pozharskyi thanking the younger Biden for introducing him to his father, then the vice president. At the time, Hunter Biden served on the company's board.

The alleged meeting would have taken place less than a year before Vice President Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

The elder Biden has denied that he ever had any conversations with his son related to foreign business dealings. The email, if true, contradicts Biden's claims.



A spokesman for Facebook said Wednesday the social media platform would be reducing distribution of the Post's story and noted that the report is eligible to be fact-checked by Facebook's third-party partners.

""While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook's third-party fact checking partners,"" Facebook's Andy Stone tweeted Wednesday. ""In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform.""

""This is part of our standard process to reduce the spread of misinformation,"" he added in a follow-up tweet. ""We temporarily reduce distribution pending fact-checker review.""

Stone serves as the policy communications manager at Facebook. He previously worked as a press secretary for Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and the communications director for the Democratic House Majority PAC.



Facebook's policies on reducing misinformation state that the company will refer stories it thinks contain misinformation to third-party fact-checkers for review. While an article is under review, Facebook suppresses the story in people's news feeds so that fewer people see it. The intent of this policy is to prevent the spread of what Facebook deems as misinformation.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the New York Post on why it targeted the Post's report and whether the fact-checking process had begun.

The Trump campaign weighed in on Facebook's decision, accusing the big tech company of ""actively interfering in the election"" and ""rigging the election for Joe Biden.""



According to the Post, Twitter also added a warning label stating ""headlines don't tell the full story"" that is visible to some users who attempt to share the article. The warning ""is part of a test we're doing right now. It does not depend on the outlet of the article, or the contents of the article,"" Twitter spokesman Trenton Kennedy said.

Facebook temporarily allows violent posts like 'death to the Russian invaders',"The social media giant Meta will permit Facebook and Instagram users in certain nations to advocate violence toward Russian troops as it pertains to the invasion of Ukraine, according to internal emails, Reuters has reported.

Russia has been wreaking death and destruction in Ukraine since invading the sovereign nation last month.



""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,"" a Meta spokesperson noted in a statement, according to the outlet.



Reuters reported that emails to content moderators indicate that in nations including Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, the social media business is temporarily permitting some material that calls for the deaths of the presidents of Russia and Belarus.

According to the outlet, an email noted that calls for the demise of the leaders will be permitted unless those calls include additional targets or feature two elements denoting credibility like a location and method.



Citing an email, Reuters reported that the temporary policy shift regarding posts advocating violence against Russian troops pertains to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.



""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" Meta noted in an email to moderators, according to Reuters.



""We are doing this because we have observed that in this specific context, 'Russian soldiers' is being used as a proxy for the Russian military. The Hate Speech policy continues to prohibit attacks on Russians,"" the email noted.

"Fake social media accounts are posing as local environmental activists in US, Canada to thwart mining efforts that would hurt China","A flurry of fake social media accounts have attempted to forestall American and Canadian mining efforts that would undermine China's dominance in the rare earth market.

Rare earth materials are used in the production of many electronic devices and national defense necessities like missile guidance systems and aircraft engines. As the largest producer of rare earth materials, China has long kept Western countries at its mercy to sustain national supply chains and to maintain an effective military.

For this reason, China has a strong motive to undermine global competitors.

According to Mandiant, an American cyber security firm located in Virginia has made a concerted effort to disrupt the development of new rare earth mines in Texas, Oklahoma, and Saskatchewan just in the last two years through the use of a pro-China social media campaign dubbed ""Dragonbridge."" In most cases, Dragonbridge accounts pose as local residents concerned about the impact these new rare earth mines will have on the environment and on the health and safety of the surrounding community.

In 2021, for example, when the Department of Defense reached an agreement with Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. of Australia to build a mine on the Texas Gulf Coast, accounts associated with Dragonbridge claimed that the mine would release radioactive material into the environment, where it could ""poison"" children and pollute the landscape.

Mandiant also claims that Dragonbridge accounts have attempted to tarnish the global perception of Ukraine by ""echoing narratives promoted by Russian state media and influence campaigns"" about ""the existence of Pentagon-linked laboratories conducting biological weapons research in Ukraine."" Russia and China have forged a stronger alliance in recent months, so this anti-Ukraine social media campaign serves the interests of both Russia and China.

While social media mobs ginned up by fake accounts are nothing new, Mandiant claims that Dragonbridge has evolved and demonstrated more sophistication than previous social media sabotage efforts. For example, Dragonbridge accounts supposedly ""microtarget"" particular audiences of real people who might already be sympathetic to their cause and co-opt the messages of real persons — especially politicians and community leaders — to buttress their agenda.

Still, Mandiant says that these accounts often manifest the same telltale attributes of fake accounts. Their usernames are usually ""English-language names followed by seemingly random numeric strings,"" they have animals or cartoons as profile pictures, they have joined social media platforms between March and June of this year, and they often try to demonstrate authenticity by sharing inspirational quotes or discussing apolitical topics like sports.

Luckily, they have been rather ineffective at influencing social media conversations and inciting action. However, Mandiant warns that stoking social outrage is their goal and that ""DRAGONBRIDGE’s recent activity attempts to incite protests against the Lynas facility in Texas in particular shows a similar interest in influencing real-world activity to"" advance Chinese interests.

Fareed Zakaria shuts down argument that people only care about Ukraine because they're white and European,"Fareed Zakaria argued eloquently on CNN against those saying that the only reason the world cares about the invasion of Ukraine is that Ukrainians are white and European.

Zakaria appeared on Don Lemon's show Friday where he addressed why the Ukrainian war was unique in its importance to the global order.

""There are people who say why are we, why this conflict,"" asked Lemon, ""there are conflicts, there are skirmishes all over the world. Why is this one so different? Why are we involved with it, why should we upend our lives, the price of our gas, and so on and so forth, you understand what I'm saying.""

""I totally understand, and here's the simplest way to understand it,"" Zakaria replied.

""A skirmish that takes place between two small countries in Africa, the Middle East, in Latin America, they don't threaten to upend the international system. When you have a nuclear power, the largest nuclear power in the world, Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States, a great power with a veto in the security council, when it threatens its neighbor what you are reverting to, is a pattern of great power politics that is more reminiscent of the age of Hitler and Mussolini, more reminiscent of 19th century Europe, where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must,"" he explained.

""That is a very different world than what we've lived in for the last 70 years, and certainly, ever since the end of the Cold War, so its not, to put it directly to people who think about this and they say, why are Ukrainians, why do we pay so much attention, is it just because they are white?"" Zakaria continued.

""No, it is not because Ukrainians are white or European, it's because their aggressor, their invader, is a nuclear armed superpower, that's the danger. That if Russia can get away with this, it can get away with invading Poland. It can get away with invading the Baltic states. China can get away with invading Taiwan,"" he added.

""You essentially tear up the rule book on international relations,"" Zakaria concluded.

Many global analysts believe the timeline for the Russian invasion has been significantly stalled by the unexpected efforts of the Ukrainian military and civilians fighting back.

Fast-food giants McDonald's and PepsiCo face calls to end operations in Russia,"Fast food giants McDonald’s and PepsiCo are facing calls to cut business ties with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Insider reported that Thomas DiNapoli, the New York state comptroller, urged American companies to rethink their preexisting business relationships with Russia because they face “significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks.”

DiNapoli added that suspending or ending business in Russia “would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market” and will play a crucial role in “condemning Russia’s role in fundamentally undermining the international order.”

McDonald’s and PepsiCo are just the latest in a long line of Western companies with international operations to consider severing their business relationships with the Russian market.

Last week, Disney announced that it would be halting all theatrical film releases in Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Disney issued a statement that said, “Given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, including ‘Turning Red’ from Pixar. We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.”

Similarly, the British Petroleum Company (BP) announced that it would be liquidating its holdings and ending its relationship with the Russian state-owned energy company Rosneft.

Helge Lund, the chairman for BP, said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having a tragic consequence across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

Financial sector giants Visa and Mastercard are also cutting ties with Russia in accordance with Western sanctions.

The credit card companies are suspending operations in Russia and once its ban is in place, credit cards issued in Russia will not work abroad and cards issued to people outside of Russia will not work within Russia’s borders.

McDonald’s is known for its cosmopolitan franchising strategy. There are McDonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries. The company has been able to achieve success in Russia by using Russian grown ingredients and catering to the tastes and whims of the Russian people it served.

Former FBI agent who led Trump-Russia probe arrested for assisting Russian oligarch to evade sanctions and money laundering,"A former FBI agent and senior official for counterintelligence operations in New York was arrested and charged for his involvement with a sanctioned Russian oligarch, according to Fox News.

Charles McGonigal, special agent in charge of the counterintelligence division of the FBI's New York field office from 2016 to 2018, allegedly violated U.S. sanctions by agreeing to provide services to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian who was charged in 2022 for violating sanctions against him.

McGonigal was among top FBI officials who learned of claims from President Donald Trump's team that Russia had compromising knowledge about then-candidate Hillary Clinton, which subsequently resulted in the years-long investigation into Trump's alleged ties to Russia.

McGonigal was charged alongside Sergey Shestakov, a former diplomat for the Soviet Union and then Russian Federation who went on to become a U.S. citizen and a Russian interpreter for both courts and government offices.

Both are charged with one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. sanctions, one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and one count of conspiring to commit money laundering as well as one count of money laundering. Each of these charges has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.



Shestakov was additionally charged with one count of making false statements, which could carry an additional five years in prison, according to prosecutors via Fox News.

""Both previously worked with Deripaska to attempt to have his sanctions removed, and, as public servants, they should have known better,"" said Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""This Office will continue to prosecute those who violate U.S. sanctions enacted in response to Russian belligerence in Ukraine in order to line their own pockets,"" Williams' statement continued.

Deripaska was sanctioned in 2018 by the U.S. Treasury Department for allegedly acting ""for or on behalf of a senior Russian official.""

He was then charged in 2022 along with three others ""in a scheme to ensure his child was born in the United States.""

""Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska perform global malign influence on behalf of the Kremlin and are associated with acts of bribery, extortion, and violence,"" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Michael J. Driscoll.

The FBI official said the agency is committed to continuing to enforce such economic sanctions moving forward.

FBI arrest Army soldier for allegedly planning to be a domestic terrorist,"A U.S. soldier stationed out of Fort Riley, Kansas, reportedly planned to commit domestic terrorism.

What happened?

According to NBC News, when an undercover FBI agent suggested to 24-year-old Pfc. Jarrett William Smith that he wanted to bomb a ""liberal Texas mayor,"" Smith quipped back ""Outside of Beto?"" He did not try to discourage the agent from targeting a mayor, but instead said that he didn't ""know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.""

He also talked with the agent about building a ""large vehicle bomb"" to attack the headquarters of an unnamed American news outlet.

The BBC reported that Smith also wanted to go to Ukraine and join a far-right paramilitary group, or kill members of Antifa. He also talked about carrying out attacks in the United States and was telling multiple people online how to build bombs.

""Oh yeah, I got knowledge of IEDs for days,"" Smith reportedly said in a Facebook chat according to NBC News. ""We can make cell phone IEDs in the style of the Afghans. I can teach you that."" This chat was allegedly with Craig Lang, an American who had joined a nationalist paramilitary group in Ukraine.

He instructed the FBI agent through this process, and then warned him to ""be careful with the fully armed device.""

""There have been cases where Middle Eastern insurgents built these bombs only for them to detonate prematurely because telemarketers or people with wrong numbers who unwittingly called the devices,"" he warned, according to the BBC.

He was arrested on Sept. 21 and charged with distributing information relating to weapons of mass destruction. The penalty for this charge can be up to 20 years in prison, and a $250,000 fine.

FBI criminal investigation into Hunter Biden and 'his associates' remains active: reports,"A Department of Justice official has confirmed that an FBI criminal investigation into Hunter Biden remains active, according to multiple reports.

What are the details?

Sinclair' Broadcasting Group's James Rosen tweeted Thursday, ""A @TheJusticeDept official confirms that in 2019, the @FBI opened up a criminal investigation into ""Hunter Biden and his associates,"" focused on allegations of money-laundering, and that it remains open and active today.""

Rosen also interviewed former Hunter Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski, who claims Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was aware of and profited from foreign business deals involving his son.

According to the report relayed through Sinclair's 190 television stations nationwide:

Bobulinksi said he was first introduced to the former vice president in May 2017 by Hunter and Jim Biden in Beverly Hills, California.



He claimed they talked about the Biden family business plans with China, despite the Democratic nominee on several occasions denying he had any involvement, including the final presidential debate when Biden said, ""I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.""



In reaction to Rosen's report, an FBI spokesman told the Washington Examiner, ""We have no comment, in keeping with our standard practice of neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation.""

Fox News reported last week that the laptop connected to Hunter Biden was linked to an FBI money laundering probe launched in 2019, but the outlet noted, ""it is unclear, at this point, whether the investigation is ongoing or if it was directly related to Hunter Biden.""

As TheBlaze previously reported:

The laptop in question has been at the center of a firestorm of controversy after the New York Post ran a story alleging that a copy of the laptop's hard drive, which was provided to them by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, contained emails from Hunter Biden to his foreign business partners, in which he appeared to leverage his relationship with then-Vice President Joe Biden and in which his partners claimed to have successfully obtained a meeting with Joe Biden due to Hunter's efforts.



Former Fox News correspondent Adam Housley reported last week on Twitter that according to ""multiple FBI sources,"" the agency's ""investigation into the laptop has been ongoing since December of 2019.""

Housley added that according to the agents, ""They knew right away it wasn't a Russia operation. It went right to the top of the FBI because a Biden name was attached. That's normal with any well known name.

"FBI responds to Zuckerberg, says it ‘routinely notifies’ social media companies of potential threats","During a recent appearance on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, Meta CEO and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg told Rogan that Facebook’s restrictions around the New York Post’s 2020 article on Hunter Biden were based on FBI misinformation warnings.

The Post’s article alleged that data recovered from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, included emails that indicated Joe Biden used his position as vice president to help his son's business dealings in Ukraine.

Critics of Facebook's actions have taken Zuckerberg’s remarks to mean that Facebook censored news unfavorable to Joe Biden in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. In response to Zuckerberg, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted, “FBI & Facebook/Big Tech interfered in 2020 election Facebook acted as an arm of govt.”

The FBI has also responded to Zuckerberg’s statement, saying in a statement released Friday night that it “routinely notifies U.S. private sector entities, including social media providers, of potential threat information, so that they can decide how to better defend against threats,” reports NBC News.

According to The Hill, the FBI also stated that it has “provided companies with foreign threat indicators to help them protect their platforms and customers from abuse by foreign malign influence actors.”

The statement additionally noted that the FBI works with “federal, state, local and private sector partners to keep the public informed of potential threats, but it cannot request or order companies to take any action based on the information it provides,” per The Hill.

After the podcast episode aired, Meta tweeted that nothing Zuckerberg told Rogan was breaking news. Zuckerberg testified to Congress nearly two years ago that the FBI warned Facebook “about the threat of foreign hack and leak operations” in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Meta shared, along with an article detailing the testimony.

"Fed chairman says inflation is 'much too high,' is prepared to address it through continued rate hikes","On Monday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed to take tough action against inflation.

“The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,” Powell said when addressing the National Association for Business Economics, CNBC reported.

His comments come less than one week after the country’s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years as it struggles to battle 40-year-high rates of inflation.

Powell said that the Federal Reserve would continue to hike interest rates until inflation comes under control. He said that the rate hikes might need to be even higher than previously thought.

“We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” Powell said.

“In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” he continued, “And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

Federal Reserve officials noted that a “basis point is equal to 0.01%.”

The increased urgency for policy tightening comes as the consumer price index denotes inflation running at 7.9% on a 12-month basis, while gauges more favorable to the country’s central bank indicate that prices are up over 5.2%.

The Federal Reserve aims for an annual target of 2%.

Powell attributes much of the ongoing pressure the economy is suffering to the COVID-19 pandemic and factors stemming from it that disrupted the flow of goods and services.

Powell has previously suggested that during the pandemic, there was a disproportionate, escalated demand for goods over services that global supply chains could not account for.

He acknowledged that officials from the country’s central bank and many economists “widely underestimated” how long economic pressures stemming from the pandemic would last.

“It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,” Powell said.

“In the meantime,” he continued, “as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

Powell indicated that the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine is contributing to factors distressing the global economy as it continues to exasperate pre-existing issues with the supply chain.

Investigators with the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware are scrutinizing the money Biden made from his association with the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings Ltd. and how Biden spent that money to pay off debt, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

Prosecutors are reportedly also asking questions about Biden's drug and alcohol abuse, his spending habits, and his state of mind in 2018 to determine what kind of defense he will make in a potential criminal tax case.

The investigation into Biden's financial dealings began in 2018 and has expanded to include potential violations of foreign lobbying and money laundering laws. Prosecutors called on Biden's associates and other witnesses to testify before a grand jury in February on whether Biden broke the law through his business relationships in Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Between 2014 and 2019, Biden held a seat on Burisma's board and received payments of about $50,000 per month. Prosecutors are interested in those payments, which were funneled through a company called Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC before going to Biden and may not have been disclosed for tax purposes.

Hunter Biden's relationship with Burisma, and whether he used his father Joe Biden as leverage in business deals with foreign entities, became a public controversy after emails from Biden's laptop were reported by the New York Post in October 2020. The emails were an ""October surprise"" before the presidential election that raised questions about the extent of then-candidate Joe Biden's involvement with his son's business affairs after he had previously denied any involvement at all.

Documents obtained from Biden's laptop were initially dismissed as ""Russian disinformation"" during the election, only for the Post's reporting to be vindicated more than a year later in a New York Times report that verified the content of the laptop.



The Biden family's Burisma ties were the reason former President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate the Biden family during an infamous July 2019 phone call. House Democrats impeached Trump over that request, but the GOP-controlled Senate acquitted the president.

In December 2020, after his father won the White House, Hunter Biden revealed the existence of the federal probe into his tax matters by the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware. At the time, he said he was ""confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.""

Prosecutors are seeking to ascertain whether Biden laundered his foreign income to avoid paying taxes on it. The Wall Street Journal was unable to report how close investigators are to completing their investigation or whether they will ultimately bring charges against Biden.

Federal Reserve chairman undercuts White House's attempt to blame GOP for inflation problems,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell undercut the Biden administration's attempt to blame Republicans for soaring inflation on Wednesday.

What is the background?

Last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden believed ""that Republicans are AWOL on the fight against inflation at this pivotal moment in our economy.""

The problem, Psaki indicated, was that Biden's nominations were not advancing quickly in the Senate (even though Democrats control the chamber).

""Everyone understands we need a full Federal Reserve Board — the first one in nearly a decade — to tackle inflation and bring prices down for American families,"" Psaki went on to say. ""We believe Republicans need to do their jobs and show up to vote for these nominees.""

One day earlier on Feb. 15, Psaki advanced a similar argument, suggesting Republicans are to blame for ongoing inflation problems.

""So Republicans are out there saying, 'Inflation is a problem. It’s a huge issue.' We agree. And then they’re not even bothering to show up to even vote against these nominees to the Federal Reserve. What message is that sending to the American public?"" she said.

But what did Powell say?

During a press conference on Wednesday after the Fed raised interest rates, Powell was asked about Psaki's comments and the White House's attempt to deflect blame for inflation problems.

Fox Business reporter Ed Lawrence asked, ""The impact that given you're not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed's ability to handle inflation?""

Powell made it clear that Senate business, and the fact that key Fed officials remain unconfirmed, is not hindering the Fed.

""None whatsoever,"" Powell said.

Of course, the Biden administration has moved on from blaming supply chain issues, the COVID-19 pandemic, and politics for the ongoing inflation crisis.

Last week, the administration began blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a message that Psaki reiterated on Wednesday.

""We continue to believe that the United States economy is positioned well to deal with the challenges ahead, even as we continue to monitor,"" she said. ""Obviously there are events that impact the economy, including an invasion of a foreign country, and we're seeing that impact as well play out in the economic data.""

Federal Reserve chairman needs just one sentence to dismantle Biden's narrative on inflation crisis,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell contradicted President Joe Biden on Wednesday, explaining the ongoing inflation crisis is not being driven primarily by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

As recently as Monday, the Biden administration called the Ukraine war ""the biggest single driver of inflation.""

What did Powell say?

While Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) asked Powell whether Biden's narrative — that Putin and the Ukraine war are responsible for America's inflation crisis — is true.

""I realize there are a number of factors that play a role in the historic inflation that we’re experiencing: supply chain disruptions, regulations that constrain supply, we’ve got rising inflation expectations and excessive fiscal spending, But the problem hasn’t sprung out of nowhere,"" Hagerty said. ""In January of 2021, inflation was at 1.4%. By December of 2021, it had risen to 7% — a fivefold increase. Now, since the war in Ukraine began in late February, the rate of inflation has risen incrementally another 1.6% to a current level of 8.6%. So again, from 7% to 8.6%.

""Given how inflation has escalated over the past 18 months, would you say that the war in Ukraine is the primary driver of inflation in America?"" the senator then asked.

It took just one sentence for Powell to crush Biden's narrative.

""No, inflation was high before, certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out,"" Powell admitted.

Because of high inflation — which topped 8.6% in May — Powell told Congress on Wednesday that aggressive action taken by the Federal Reserve, which is necessary to combat inflation, could trigger a recession.

""It’s certainly a possibility,"" Powell said.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, on the other hand, believes a recession is all but guaranteed, precisely because of the Fed raising interest rates.

""Look, nothing is certain, and all economic forecasts have uncertainty,"" Summers said Sunday on NBC. ""My best guess is that a recession is ahead.

""I base that on the fact that we haven't had a situation like the present with inflation above 4% and unemployment beyond 4% without a recession following within a year or two,"" he explained. ""And so I think the likelihood is that in order to do what's necessary to stop inflation the Fed is going to raise interest rates enough that the economy will slip into a recession.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-reserve-chairman-uses-one-sentence-to-dismantle-biden-s-narrative-on-inflation,2022-06-22
Federal agents raid Rudy Giuliani's NYC apartment as part of Trump-involved probe,"Federal investigators executed a search warrant on the Manhattan apartment of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday as part of an investigation into his alleged overseas lobbying efforts as the personal attorney for former President Donald Trump, the New York Times reported.

Agents seized Giuliani's electronic devices, including his cellphone, during the raid, ABC News added, citing sources.

The Times characterized the raid as a ""major turning point"" in the investigation into whether Giuliani broke federal laws in his capacity as Trump's lawyer by lobbying the Trump administration in 2019 on behalf of officials and oligarchs in Ukraine. Giuliani's alleged lobbying efforts were a primary focus of the first impeachment case against Trump.

During that same time, Giuliani was admittedly in Ukraine attempting to dig up dirt on Trump's political rivals, including President Joe Biden, who was then a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden's son, Hunter, was facing intense scrutiny for his suspicious position on the board of a nefarious Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, despite having no relevant experience in the industry.

Both the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York have reportedly not commented to the media and have yet to issue a news release about the raid. The New York Post reported that ""a call to Giuliani's cellphone went straight to voicemail Wednesday afternoon.""

Giuliani's attorney, Bob Costello, reportedly told Fox News that the raid was ""totally unnecessary"" and was conducted only to give Giuliani ""bad publicity"" and ""make him look like he's some sort of criminal.""

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Costello confirmed that the raid took place at 6 a.m. Wednesday and that his client's electronic devices had been confiscated.

Paraphrasing Costello's words, the report went on to say that ""the warrant sought communications between Mr. Giuliani and individuals including John Solomon, a columnist who was in communication with Mr. Giuliani about his effort to push for investigations of Joe Biden in Ukraine.""

While the search warrant does not reflect that Giuliani is guilty of any crime, it shows that investigators have taken the probe to an ""aggressive new phase,"" the Times noted. In order for a search warrant to be issued, a judge needs to be convinced that a crime may have been committed and that a raid could turn up evidence.

According to the news outlet, federal agents have been investigating Giuliani's potential involvement in pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens as well as his role in pushing for the ouster of then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.

The report listed one possible charge as a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which, according to the Justice Department, requires individuals lobbying the U.S. government on behalf of foreign officials to periodically disclose their activities to authorities.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feds-raid-rudy-giuliani-apartment,2021-04-28
Reactions to FIFA punishing Russia soccer team over Ukraine invasion,"The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) took a stand against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. However, soccer fans say the punishment was not harsh enough.

On Sunday, FIFA announced that the Russian national soccer team could no longer compete under the name of ""Russia."" Instead, it could only use the name ""Football Union of Russia"" or the acronym ""RFU.""

In addition, Russia may not display the country's flag or play the Russian national anthem during matches. FIFA also declared that Russia is no longer permitted to play home games. Instead, the Russian soccer team may only play on neutral sites and without any fans in attendance.

""Violence is never a solution and FIFA expresses its deepest solidarity to all people affected by what is happening in Ukraine,"" the international soccer organization said in a statement titled ""Bureau of the FIFA Council takes initial measures with regard to war in Ukraine"" released on Sunday. ""FIFA calls again for the urgent restoration of peace and for constructive dialogue to commence immediately.""

""FIFA will continue its ongoing dialogue with the IOC, UEFA, and other sport organizations to determine any additional measures or sanctions, including a potential exclusion from competitions, that shall be applied in the near future should the situation not be improving rapidly,"" FIFA stated.

However, soccer fans and experts were expecting more severe penalties, such as FIFA expelling Russia from World Cup qualifying.

Soccer journalist Grant Wahl: ""Terrible from FIFA.""

Soccer writer Henry Winter: ""FIFA has blood on its hands. Infantino should stand up to Putin not appease him. Utterly spineless from FIFA to let Russia continue competing in World Cup qualifying just with a different name. While brave Ukrainians die.""

Many soccer enthusiasts pointed out the issue with allowing to continue to compete.

The national soccer teams from Poland, Sweden, and the Czech Republic declared they will boycott games against Russia in retaliation to the Ukraine invasion. However, there will be a major issue if teams forfeit their matches against Russia, including World Cup qualifiers.

President of the Polish Football Association (PZPN) Cezary Kulesza: ""Today’s FIFA decision is totally unacceptable. We are not interested in participating in this game of appearances. Our stance remains intact: Polish National Team will NOT PLAY with Russia, no matter what the name of the team is.""

Former pro soccer player Gary Lineker: ""With Poland, Sweden & Czech Republic refusing to play Russia, @FIFAcom has to support them. It’s hard to envisage a World Cup taking place if Russia are given a free pass to the finals. How many teams will refuse to play them or pull out? FIFA where are you?""



Soccer commentator Iain Dale: ""If FIFA kick Poland out of the World Cup for refusing to play Russia, and allow Russia through on a bye, all other nations should make clear they won't play in Qatar.""

Sportswriter Karolos Grohmann: ""FIFA really doesn't get it that there are national teams out there that will not play against Russia anywhere under any name and what ever FIFA says.""

ESPN noted that the teams forfeiting matches against Russia could be punished, ""A strict reading of FIFA's World Cup regulations would even make the Polish, Swedish, and Czech federations liable to disciplinary action and having to pay fines and compensation if they wouldn't play Russia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fifa-russia-ukraine-punishment-reactions,2022-02-28
"First trans Army officer, doctor wife indicted for attempting to give Russia compromising medical information about members of US military, spouses: Report","The first transgender officer in the U.S. Army and wife have both been indicted for allegedly attempting to communicate with Russian officials in the hopes of giving them kompromat on some members of the military and their spouses.

Over the summer, Major Jamie Lee Henry, 39, and wife Dr. Anna Gabrielian, 36, had reportedly made contact with someone whom they thought worked at the Russian embassy but who was actually an undercover FBI agent. Henry, an internist, is a medical doctor with security clearance at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the largest military installations in the entire world. Gabrielian, an anesthesiology and critical care instructor at Johns Hopkins, allegedly expressed hope to the FBI agent that they could use her husband's security clearance to obtain the private medical records of some strategic members of the military and/or their spouses and relatives that Russian officials could then ""exploit.""

According to the indictment, which was unsealed on Thursday, Gabrielian said she was motivated to help Russia because of her Russian patriotism, and her profile at Johns Hopkins does indicate that Gabrielian speaks fluent Russian. However, it is unclear whether she is a Russian national or somehow otherwise affiliated with the country.

Though Henry was not said to be motivated by Russian patriotism, the indictment does suggest the Army officer expressed some sympathy for Russian interests.

""My point of view is until the United States actually declares war against Russia,"" Henry allegedly told the agent, ""I'm able to help as much as I want.""

Henry also told the agent that Henry had attempted to enlist in the Russian army to fight against Ukraine but had been rejected for a lack of combat experience.

""The way I am viewing what is going on in Ukraine now, is that the United States is using Ukrainians as a proxy for their own hatred toward Russia,"" Henry allegedly said.

Gabrielian also allegedly called Henry a ""coward"" when the Army officer expressed misgivings about violating HIPAA regulations in service to Russia.

During a meeting with the agent at a hotel last month, Gabrielian reportedly gave the agent private medical information belonging to the spouse of a service member in the Office of Naval Intelligence, as well as the information of a relative from an Air Force veteran. Henry likewise handed the agent the medical records of five Fort Bragg patients, according to the filing. It is unclear whether Henry had treated those patients personally.

During that meeting, the couple also supposedly attempted to establish a contingency plan, in the event they were ever arrested.

Gabrielian allegedly requested that the Russian embassy help find her children ""a nice flight to Turkey to go on vacation"" so that they couldn't be used as ""hostages"" against her if she were ever incarcerated.

Both Henry and Gabrielian have been charged with conspiracy and wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information. They face up to 15 years in prison each, if convicted.

The couple were married in 2015, the same year Henry came out as transgender. At the time, Henry gave an interview with Brightest Young Things. ""My passion is service member health,"" Henry said in the interview. ""...The biggest part in supporting the health of service members is listening to them. Trauma has to be handled on an individual’s timeline and in a way that is unique to that individual.""

Florida Democratic Rep. Val Demings announces bid to unseat Sen. Marco Rubio,"Florida Democratic Rep. Val Demings announced Wednesday that she is running to challenge Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for his seat in the upper chamber.

What are the details?

""My father was a janitor and my mother was a maid,"" she continued, adding that her mother told her, ""Val, never grow tired of doing good. Never tire.""

NBC News reported that Demings went on to give her background in law enforcement. The Democrat served in the Orlando Police Department and eventually rose to become the department's first female chief.

""I'm running for the United States Senate, because of the two simple words, 'never tired,'"" Demings, a three-term House member said in the ad. ""Over the next few weeks, I hope to share more of my story with more of you. It's a simple question: Can my unlikely story of opportunity expand to more Americans and more Floridians?""

Following Demings' announcement, Rubio released a video of his own in reaction to her challenge.

""Look, I've always known that my opponent for the Senate was going to be a far-left liberal Democrat,"" the two-term Republican senator said in the clip. ""Today we just found out which one of them [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Shumer's (D-N.Y.) picked.""

""Congresswoman Val Demings is a do-nothing House member with not a single significant legislative achievement in her time in Congress,"" Rubio went on to say.

ABC News noted that Demings' announcement comes after months of speculation that she would run for Senate, and she is the first Democrat ""with national name recognition"" to throw her hat in the ring.

"'As the sun came up, we started rolling': US military veteran group conducting Florida rescue operations","Floodwaters continue to threaten survivors of Hurricane Ian. Fortunately, government agencies are not alone in the rescue efforts. A group of U.S. military veterans known as Project Dynamo has been hard at work off the coast of Fort Myers, Florida, rescuing people stranded on Sanibel Island.

Bryan Stern, a retired U.S. Navy lieutenant commander, is co-founder of the search-and-rescue team. He told the AP, ""As soon as the sun came up, we started rolling.""



With a small flotilla under its command, Project Dynamo — named after the British evacuation of Dunkirk, France, during the Second World War — has rescued over 20 people. Many of the rescuees are reportedly elderly residents whose escape from Sanibel Island was thwarted when Ian washed away the causeway to the mainland.

The training division chief for the Sanibel Fire Department, Tim Barrett, lauded the efforts of the group and like-minded bystanders who have leaped into action. ""It sort of restores your view of humanity,"" he said. ""You see people chipping in and they aren't getting paid for it.""

Barrett noted that among the rescuers were several whose own homes were obliterated. Nevertheless, ""They're still helping other people.""

Although presently operating domestically in Florida, Project Dynamo has performed rescue operations internationally and claims to have aided over 8,000 people.



The group rescued three Americans who were trapped in Afghanistan after the Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal. Stern said that the people the group brought home to Virginia and California would otherwise have faced ""very terrible"" fates.

When it came to rescuing Americans from Ukraine in the early days of the Russian invasion, the group took action when others seemed unwilling. James Judge, a spokesman for the group, told Fox News that ""when the Biden administration said they weren't going to do it, it was kind of like, 'Okay, here we go.'""

WFTS reported in June that Project Dynamo rescued nearly 500 people from Mariupol, Ukraine.

In it together

There are other groups buttressing official efforts. Matt Mengel and his friends took to Sanibel Island to help. ""We had gasoline. We had jet skis. We had water. We had food and snacks,"" Mengel told the AP. ""And our mission was just to go find them, dead or alive.""



There are reportedly at least 68 dead in Florida as a result of Hurricane Ian.

Mengel, whose own home was destroyed, began rescue operations with his compatriots on Friday after first investigating the well-being of a friend the group hadn't heard from. Upon finding that friend safe, they proceeded to look for others they could help and ferry back to the mainland.

In their efforts, Mengel's team aided an elderly couple in waving down a Coast Guard helicopter, reinforced in their effort by Project Dynamo. Mengel indicated his team has made seven rescues so far.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) noted on Sunday that the mobilization of search-and-rescue teams was the largest since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Extra to the eight Urban Search and Rescue Teams that have been performing search and rescue since last week, nearly 5,000 National Guard troops were also activated on Thursday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-search-and-rescue-veterans,2022-10-03
Food and fuel prices likely to remain high for the foreseeable future,"The high grocery bills that have hit American pocketbooks for over a year now are likely to continue, thanks to several anomalous circumstances related to corn yields, experts say.

Due to wet weather, the war in Ukraine, and issues still lingering from the pandemic and the government shutdown, corn will be grown and harvested at much lower levels than in previous years, affecting food and fuel supplies alike.

According to Reuters, unusual weather patterns in the northern plains and southern Canada have delayed planting routines and forced farmers to plant under less than ideal conditions that may lead to smaller crops.

""Overly wet conditions in North Dakota have led to one of the slowest starts to planting on record,"" Karen Braun of Reuters claimed in late May.

""We were pushing the envelope, working ground that was way too wet, just trying to get a crop in,"" Eric Broten, a North Dakotan farmer, said

As a result, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently lowered its projections for corn this year from 181 bushels per acre to 177, and Reuters says that cut the U.S. harvest potential by over 9 million ton — almost half of China's U.S. imports last year.

The continued war in Ukraine has also greatly affected corn output. In recent years, Ukraine had produced as much as 17% of the world's corn, but difficulties in harvesting and shipping as a result of Russian aggression make a similar yield in 2022 unlikely.

Domestic shipping also continues to be a problem. Disruptions to supply lines from 2020 have still not been entirely resolved, and lower corn production has limited fuel availability and caused gas prices to rise.

According to Corteva, an agriscience company, the ethanol produced by corn composes 10% of the American automotive fuel supply. Some of that fuel is also used in agricultural equipment, meaning that some of the corn produced by American farmers is then used to grow and produce more corn.

Corn is also used to feed some livestock, putting additional pressure on corn supplies and yields.

President Biden has attempted to address the issue of reduced corn levels by alleviating some federal planting restrictions and implementing policies that would encourage farmers to plant. However, the USDA still predicts a tough road ahead for corn farmers, drivers and businesses reliant on corn and ethanol, as well as consumers: ""U.S. corn exports are forecast to decline 4.0 percent in 2022/23 as lower supplies and robust domestic demand limit prospects.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/food-fuel-prices-to-remain-high,2022-06-28
Former CNN war correspondent mocks Fox News reporter injured in Ukraine war: 'A case of friendly fire?',"Former CNN correspondent Charles Jaco mocked a Fox News reporter who was injured in Ukraine on Monday, using the opportunity to score political points and push the liberal narrative that Fox News is a mouthpiece for the Kremlin.

What is the background?

Fox News announced Monday that correspondent Benjamin Hall was hospitalized after being injured ""outside of Kyiv in Ukraine.""

News of Hall's injury came one day after American journalist Brent Renaud — who formally worked for the New York Times, HBO, and NBC, among other outlets — was killed when Russian forces reportedly opened fire on a car he was traveling in with another journalist.

What did Jaco say?

Jaco — who served as a war correspondent for CNN during the Gulf War — bizarrely used news of Hall's hospitalization to mock his employer.

""A Fox News reporter has been injured in Kyiv. If he was shot by the Russians, is that a case of friendly fire?"" Jaco said. On the other hand, Jaco reacted to Renaud's tragic death by saying, ""RIP, brother.""

After generating outrage, Jaco deleted his tweet and apologized for being an ""asshole"" — but still peddled his theory about Fox News.

""My tweet about a Fox News journo was idiotic & stupid. I apologize. I wrote 'A Fox News journo was injured near Kyiv. If it was the Russians, was it friendly fire?' While Fox is neo-fascist propaganda, that's the hosts, not reporters. I was an asshole,"" Jaco said.

Critics of Fox News have repeatedly accused the network of pushing pro-Kremlin propaganda, but have provided little to no evidence to substantiate their claims. While it is true that Russian state media is using Fox News host Tucker Carlson in its propaganda, the substance of Carlson's rhetoric is not pro-Russia, but anti-American interventionism.

Anything else?

Iryna Venediktova, prosecutor general of Ukraine, said Monday that Hall being injured demonstrates yet again how Russian military forces are targeting civilians, CNN reported.

Under international law, journalists are protected in war zones and retain all rights of civilians.

""Journalists are protected only as long as they do not take a direct part in the hostilities.

Former cop tells Congress 'I will not comply' if assault weapons are banned,"A former police officer told Congress that she would not comply if a law was enacted banning assault weapons, and she implored Congress not to turn millions of legal gun owners into criminals, according to Fox News.

Dianna Muller, who served with the Tulsa Police Department in Oklahoma for 22 years before founding the gun advocacy group the DC Project, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday in opposition to legislation infringing on Second Amendment rights.

""Please don't legislate the 150 million people just like me into being criminals. It has happened. You've already done it,"" Muller said. ""I was a bump stock owner, and I had to make a decision: do I become a felon, or do I comply?""

Regarding any potential assault weapons ban, Muller drew the line: ""I will not comply.""

'I will not comply': Ex-cop tells House Judiciary Committee she will not obey assault weapon ban youtu.be

GOP Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (Wis.) highlighted the imprecise nature of the term ""assault weapons"" and the way the use of such a term bans certain weapons illogically.



Sensenbrenner asked a panel of witnesses whether a hunting rifle should be banned if it was a semiautomatic weapon.

Heritage Foundation senior legal policy analyst Amy Swearer replied by pointing out that there are no mechanical or functional differences between semiautomatic hunting rifles and so-called assault weapons that would be banned.

Swearer also used a personal anecdote to defend the use of AR-15s for home defense, saying her mother struggled to accurately fire a handgun and was able to be more effective at the gun range with an AR-15.

President Donald Trump has, on a somewhat inconsistent basis, signaled a willingness to discuss gun control legislation with Democrats, including red flag laws and expanded background checks.

However, those talks have taken a negative turn starting with Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke declared ""hell yes"" he wants to take AR-15s and AK-47s off the streets. Any prospect of legislative progress was further damaged by Democrats' most recent push to impeach President Trump for his conversations with Ukraine about investigating Joe and Hunter Biden.

"Former GOP Gov. Bill Weld, who is trying to primary Trump, suggests the president could be executed for treason","Former Gov. Bill Weld (R-Mass.), a long shot Republican candidate attempting to primary President Donald Trump, told the hosts of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that he thought Trump was guilty of treason and could be executed for it.

What did he say?

""Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn't be clearer,"" Weld said Monday morning. ""And that's not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It's treason, pure and simple. And the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That's the only penalty. The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he can work out a plea deal.""

Weld was referring to a whistleblower's recent accusation that Trump asked the president of Ukraine to work with former New York City Mayor (and current Trump lawyer) Rudy Giuliani on an investigation of Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. The elder Biden has admitted in the past to pressuring a former president of Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who happened to be disliked by a natural gas firm where Hunter Biden was a board member. The prosecutor had been investigating the company and Hunter Biden.

When he was asked by MSNBC political analyst Elise Jordan to confirm what the ""legal framework"" for executing a president for treason was, Weld responded:

Well, the legal framework is under the U.S. criminal code. The only penalty for treason is death, spelled out in the statute. Under the Constitution, you know, grounds for removal from office, impeachment, and removal from any federal office, are treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.



We don't have to worry about bribery anymore, although I think he's committed that, we don't have to worry about other high crimes and misdemeanors, although I think he committed many...we've got treason.



He also called Trump a ""lawless man"" who had to be ""carted off to save us all.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-gop-gov-bill-weld-suggests-the-president-could-be-executed-for-treason,2019-09-23
Former Israeli PM warns Americans that new Iran nuclear deal formed under Biden is 'even worse than its predecessor',"Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the United States on Sunday against entering into a new nuclear deal with Iran.

What is the background?

The Biden administration joined negotiations last year to re-establish the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the ""Iran nuclear deal,"" after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord in 2018.

Two weeks ago, the State Department said a new deal was imminent. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has complicated the negotiation process, and now the deal could fall through. Russia has been a lead negotiator on the new deal.

What did Netanyahu say?

As Israel's top leader at the time, Netanyahu vehemently opposed the Iran nuclear deal when it was first negotiated under the Obama administration. Iran, after all, refuses to recognize Israel's sovereignty and funds terrorist groups that attack Israel.

In a video published Sunday — the same day Iranian missiles struck an area around a U.S. consulate in northern Iraq — Netanyahu explained why the forthcoming deal is ""downright dangerous.""

""The desperate rush to sign this flawed nuclear agreement with Iran is not only absurd — it's downright dangerous,"" Netanyahu said.

""Yesterday, Iran fired missiles in the vicinity of the American consulate in Iraq, and the U.S. continues to charge ahead along with the other powers to sign a nuclear agreement that will give the Ayatollahs a nuclear arsenal,"" Netanyahu continued. ""It would also relieve sanctions and give them hundreds of billions of dollars in order to continue the terror that they waged yesterday and wage every day throughout the Middle East and the world.""

Netanyahu, a staunch supporter of the U.S., said the new deal negotiated under Biden ""is even worse than its predecessor because in three years' time, under this agreement, Iran will be a threshold nuclear state. It will have enough enriched uranium to create dozens and dozens of nuclear bombs and it will have the ICBMs to deliver them to any place in the United States,"" he warned.

""That is ... unbelievable. It's not merely unacceptable, it endangers not only my country, Israel, but your country, the United States, and the entire world,"" Netanyahu continued. ""We should not let an aggressive, rogue, terrorist regime like Iran have nuclear weapons.""

""Have we learned nothing?"" he asked.

Despite Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's lead negotiator on the revived JCPOA, boasting that Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran essentially took the U.S. to the cleaners, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman reiterated Sunday that moving forward with the Iran nuclear deal is the best way to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-israeli-pm-warns-americans-that-new-iran-nuclear-deal-formed-under-biden-is-even-worse-than-its-predecessor,2022-03-14
"Former Keystone pipeline worker says Biden, not Russia, is to blame for high fuel prices","A former Keystone XL pipeline worker says President Joe Biden's energy policies are the real cause of rising fuel prices and that the war in Ukraine ""has nothing to do with"" it.

Neal Crabtree, a welder who lost his job when Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, said that the energy industry ""tried to warn"" the Biden administration that opposing new oil and gas projects would jeopardize American energy independence and national security.

""We tried to warn this administration back when they canceled the Keystone pipeline"" that it was also ""canceling national security, foreign policy and energy,"" Crabtree told Fox News in an interview Tuesday.

The national average price for gasoline is now $4.25 per gallon, the highest ever recorded, according to the American Automobile Association. The White House has pointed to the ongoing war in Ukraine and sanctions against the Russian economy as causes for the surging fuel prices, noting that Russia is a major international exporter of energy. Biden on Tuesday announced that the U.S. would ban Russian oil and gas imports, a move he acknowledged would punish Russia's energy sector at the cost of even higher fuel prices for Americans.

The president called on U.S. energy companies to refrain from ""profiteering or price gouging"" and blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's war for causing the energy crisis.

""Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders – just since then – the price of gas at pumps in America went up 75 cents,"" he said Tuesday. ""And with this action it’s going to go up further.""

Crabtree disputed the president's claims. ""Even if we can fix the Ukrainian problem, the prices are still going up,"" he told Fox News, adding that Biden's ""policies have everything to do with the rising fuel prices in this country today.

""It has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine,"" he said.

Watch:



As one of his first acts as president, Biden issued a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leases and permits and ordered a review of existing permits for fossil fuel development to demonstrate his commitment to fighting global warming.

Republicans argue that Biden's executive actions on climate change have limited oil and gas production, contributing to rising prices.



White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday insisted that the administration is not opposed to oil and gas production and suggested that U.S. energy companies are at fault for not drilling.

""Federal policies are not limiting the supplies of oil and gas,"" she told reporters.

White House officials have pointed out that the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects American crude oil production to rise to an average of 12 million barrels per day in 2022, approaching the 2019 pre-pandemic high of 12.3 million barrels per day, and then hit a new record-high of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.

""There are 9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used, so the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate,"" Psaki also said. ""I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more.""

Energy companies responded Tuesday, accusing Psaki of misleading Americans with a ""red herring"" argument.

""That accusation is a complete red herring,"" said American Exploration & Production Council (AXPC) CEO Anne Bradbury in an interview with FOX Business. ""It's really a distraction from the fact that this administration has paused leasing on federal lands, something that we're concerned about and something that we think needs to continue right away.""

American Petroleum Institute (API) president and CEO Mike Sommers added that Psaki appears to misunderstand how the process works.

""Once you lease land there is a whole process that you have to go through. First you have to actually discover whether actually there is oil and gas in that land. Second of all, you have to get a permit to actually develop that land,"" he explained to Fox Business.

""Right now we actually are developing more leases than we have in two decades so the White House certainly doesn't have their facts straight on this,"" Sommers added.

Crabtree responded as well: ""There's no energy company [that's] gonna spend the money to develop a new lease if they can't build a pipeline to move the project,"" he told Fox News.

He also criticized the Biden administration's plans to approach Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to buy oil and potentially Iran as well, pending the renewed nuclear deal.

""When I’d first seen the reports of the president going to places like Iran and Venezuela to ask for more oil output, I said ‘this is fake news, he hasn’t gone this far off the rocker,’"" Crabtree said. ""But I guess that's the path they want to take.""

""Why not invite North Korea?"" he continued. ""Maybe they’ve got a few barrels of oil that they can spare?""

"Former NSC chief of staff suggests whistleblower aided by Democrats, lawyers","Fred Fleitz, who served as the National Security Council chief of staff last year, believes the whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Donald Trump was aided by congressional Democrats and lawyers.

Writing in the New York Post, Fleitz said the complaint suggests the whistleblower was ""pursuing a political agenda"" and pointed to the writing style of the complaint to back his claim.

""It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified,"" Fleitz said.

""From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of,"" he explained. ""This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff.""

In fact, Fleitz — who also boasts a nearly two decade career at the CIA — believes the well-polished complaint closely resembles a tweet from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

""Moreover, it looks like more than a coincidence that this complaint surfaced and was directed to the House Intelligence Committee just after Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), an outspoken opponent of President Trump, expressed numerous complaints in August 2019 accusing President Trump of abusing aid to Ukraine to hurt Joe Biden. This includes an August 28 tweet that closely resembled the whistleblowing complaint,"" Fleitz wrote.

In that tweet, from August 28, Schiff claimed Trump was withholding military aid from Ukraine while his personal lawyer — Rudy Giuliani — sought help from the ""Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent.""

Also of great concern is the fact the whistleblower admitted he did not have first-hand knowledge of Trump's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which Fleitz said proves ""intelligence officers have grossly violated the rules as well as the trust placed on them"" by disclosing Trump's classified conversations.

""I refuse to believe that the leaking, timing and presentation of this complaint is coincidence,"" Fleitz said. ""I don't think the American people will buy this either.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-nsc-chief-of-staff-suggests-whistleblower-aided-by-democrats-lawyers,2019-09-28
Former Obama defense official admitted under oath that she lied about having Trump-Russia evidence,"Evelyn Farkas, a former Obama administration defense official, admitted under oath that she lied during an MSNBC interview about having evidence that Trump campaign staff was colluding with the Russians, according to a newly released transcript of her testimony.

What's the background?

Farkas, who served as the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia from 2012-15, said during the MSNBC appearance in March 2017 that she had been urging colleagues and congressional lawmakers to gather up evidence of Trump-Russia collusion before Obama left office.

She said she feared that Trump administration officials might destroy the alleged evidence if they ""found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff's dealing with Russians.""

You can watch her make the claim toward the end of the following clip:

That's not what she told Congress



But documents show that Farkas sang a different tune during her sworn testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on June 26, 2017.



The chairman of the committee at that time, Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), was pressing her on her claims of collusion evidence during the MSNBC interview when Farkas told lawmakers that she actually ""didn't know anything.""

""Why don't we go back to that sentence that I just asked you about. It says 'the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their staff dealing with Russians,"" Gowdy said. ""Well, how would you know what the U.S. government knew at that point? You didn't work for it, did you?""

""I didn't [work for the government]"" Farkas acknowledged.

""Then how did you know?"" Gowdy responded.

""I didn't know anything,"" Farkas said.

Gowdy pressed even further.

""Did you have information connecting the Trump campaign to the hack of the DNC?"" Gowdy asked later in the hearing.

""No,"" Farkas admitted.

""So when you say, 'We knew,' the reality is you knew nothing,"" Gowdy asked later during the deposition.

""Correct,"" Farkas responded.

Farkas is now running for New York's 17th Congressional District as a Democrat.

"Former Polish president, who serves on Burisma board, reveals Hunter Biden was hired for his name","Hunter Biden was hired to Burisma Holding's advisory board because of his name, Aleksander Kwasniewski, Poland's former president who serves on the board of Burisma Holdings, admitted this week.

Kwasniewski, who served as Poland's president from 1995-2005, told the Associated Press that Burisma, a Ukrainian oil company, simply did what most other corporations do — seek well-known and well-connected individuals for advisory roles. For the younger Biden that meant a job that at times earned him more than $80,000 per month.

""I understand that if someone asks me to be part of some project it's not only because I'm so good, it's also because I am Kwasniewski and I am a former president of Poland,"" Kwasniewski told the AP.

""And this is all inter-connected. No-names are a nobody,"" he added. ""Being Biden is not bad. It's a good name.""

However, Kwasniewski denied that Burisma hired Biden to leverage his relationship with his father, Joe Biden, who at the time served as U.S. vice president. Kwasniewski also said that Biden was an active member of the board who greatly aided the company.

More from the Associated Press:

He said Hunter Biden carried out research and brought a unique American perspective to the company, including in the areas of corporate governance, capital markets and gas drilling equipment, where Americans are world leaders.



""He collected information,"" Kwasniewski said. ""He was useful for us because he knew something that we didn't know.""

The younger Biden and his role at Burisma have come under scrutiny in reason months after President Donald Trump allegedly asked Ukraine last summer to investigate the Biden's. The request resulted in a whistleblower complaint being filed against the president, which then triggered the House impeachment investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-polish-president-who-serves-on-burisma-board-admits-hunter-biden-hired-for-his-name,2019-11-30
"Former US ambassador to Ukraine testifies of 'concerted campaign' by Trump, Ukrainian officials to have her removed","Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified Friday that she was removed early from her position because President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to do so, according to NBC News.

Yovanovitch testified in a closed-door session before House impeachment investigators from the Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees.

Who is Marie Yovanovitch?

Yovanovitch is a longtime diplomat who was first appointed as ambassador to Ukraine in 2016 by former President Barack Obama. She previously served in diplomatic roles under Obama and former President George W. Bush in locations, including Russia and Somalia.

She was removed from her Ukraine post and returned to Washington, D.C., in May, even though her assignment was scheduled to run through July. She had found herself on the wrong side of powerful individuals such as President Trump and then-Ukraine Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko. Lutsenko has claimed Yovanovitch gave him a list of people he was not allowed to prosecute.

What does the State Department say about her removal?

The State Department denied that there was anything unusual about her removal, saying her assignment ended as normal and she was simply removed early to align the change with a new Ukrainian administration.

What does Yovanovitch say about it?

Yovanovitch said she was told by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan that she had lost the confidence of the president and that there was a ""concerted campaign"" against her, leading to pressure on the State Department from Trump to remove her from the post.

She also said the nature of her removal, which she claimed was based on ""false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,"" will cause long-term harm to the U.S.

""The harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,"" Yovanovitch testified. ""The harm will come when bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.""

What does this have to do with impeachment?

President Trump mentioned Yovanovitch in a July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky, referring to her as ""bad news"" and saying she was ""going to go through some things.""

That was the same call on which Trump requested Zelensky work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, for potential corruption. Democrats are focusing on that call as grounds for their impeachment inquiry

Two Giuliani associates, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, were indicted Thursday for allegedly trying to buy U.S. political influence with illegal campaign donations using foreign money.

The two men donated to former Texas GOP Rep. Pete Sessions in 2018. Sessions sent a letter to Pompeo asking for Yovanovitch to be removed, and also met with them. He denies that they influenced him to ask for Yovanovitch's removal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-us-ambassador-to-ukraine-testifies-of-concerted-campaign-by-trump-ukrainian-officials-to-have-her-removed,2019-10-11
Former US envoy to Ukraine tells Congress that Ukrainian officials wanted to prove to a 'very skeptical' Trump they were serious about cleaning up corruption,"A former top U.S. envoy to Ukraine gave on-the-record testimony to members of Congress that contradicts the narrative regarding President Donald Trump and Ukraine that is currently being used to push for his impeachment.

In his prepared testimony for House investigators on Thursday — a copy of which was obtained by Blaze Media on Friday — former top American envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said that efforts to get Ukrainian officials to look into corruption in the country were driven by a desire to make sure the president trusted the country and was willing to support it.



Instead of President Trump trying to leverage Russian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and their relationship with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, officials from both countries wanted to convince Trump that the former Soviet state was indeed serious about facing a long history of corruption, the prepared statement said.

""[I]n May of this year, I became concerned that a negative narrative about Ukraine, fueled by assertions made by Ukraine's departing Prosecutor General, was reaching the President of the United States, and impeding our ability to support the new Ukrainian government as robustly as I believed we should,"" Volker said.

Furthermore, Volker said the Ukrainians were the ones who wanted to get in touch with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer.

""After sharing my concerns with the Ukrainian leadership, an advisor to President Zelensky asked me to connect him to the President's personal lawyer, Mayor Rudy Giuliani,"" Volker told Congress. ""I did so. I did so solely because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine, that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support.""

Volker said he ""also made clear to the Ukrainians, on a number of occasions, that Mayor Giuliani is a private citizen and the President's personal lawyer, and that he does not represent the United States government.""

After traveling to Ukraine as part of an official delegation, Volker said he came away convinced that Zelensky ""was sincere about massive reform in Ukraine, would face significant internal opposition, and that he deserved strong U.S. support.""

Trump was ""very skeptical"" of the government's prospects of cleaning up corruption, according to Volker.

""Given Ukraine's history of corruption, that is understandable,"" he added.

Also during the testimony, Volker said, ""At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.""

Volker added, ""I was not on the July 25 phone call"" between Trump and Zelenksy at the root the current controversy. ""All said it was a good, congratulatory call, that they discussed the importance of fighting corruption and promoting reform in Ukraine,"" he said.

""The issue of a hold placed on security assistance to Ukraine also came up during this same time I was connecting [a Zelensky aide] and Mayor Giuliani,"" the former envoy said elsewhere in the statement. ""I did not perceive these issues to be linked in any way.""

One vignette described in between Volker's testimony and text messages released by House Democrats on Thursday night illustrates the kind of triangulation that went on among Giuliani, U.S. diplomats, and Ukrainian officials.

At one point in the statement, Volker described how Giuliani tried to get Zelensky to add a reference to Burisma and the 2016 election investigation into a planned statement on how the new Ukrainian government would fight corruption.



A Zelensky aide said that the statement ""would reference Burisma and 2016, in a wider context of rooting out corruption anyway,"" and that ""there was no mention of Vice President Biden.""

Indeed, according to the released texts, on Aug. 9, Volker texted U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland:

Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political process of the United States especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukraine politicians. I want to declare that this in unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 elections, which in turn will prevent a recurrence of this problem in the future.

Volker's testimony said he got a draft on Aug. 16 that he thought ""looked perfectly reasonable"" and did not mention either Burisma or 2016 and that he showed it to Sondland who agreed. Giuliani wanted the statement to reference them specifically, but, ""Again, there was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations.""

So, Volker testified, he edited the draft to include the discussed references and showed the draft to Zelensky's aide who said that they did not want to mention them for multiple reasons.

""I agreed — and further said that I believe it is essential that Ukraine do nothing that could be seen as interfering in 2020 elections,"" Volker told lawmakers. ""[The aide] agreed and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-us-envoy-to-ukraine-tells-congress-that-ukrainian-officials-wanted-to-prove-to-a-very-skeptical-trump-they-were-serious-about-cleaning-up-corruption,2019-10-04
"Former WH official: John Bolton wanted WH lawyer alerted about Ukraine efforts, once called Rudy Giuliani a 'hand grenade'","A former White House official testified to Congress on Monday that Rudy Giuliani's Ukraine intervention was so concerning that former national security adviser John Bolton told her to alert a White House lawyer.

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the White House, testified for about nine hours to three House panels. She told Congress about a July 10 meeting, which House investigators believed referred to an ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son,"" the Wall Street Journal reported.

At that meeting, which took place about two weeks before the infamous phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Bolton and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the E.U., got into a ""tense exchange"" over Sondland's work with Giuliani to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, according to the New York Times.

Hill told lawmakers that after that meeting Bolton instructed Hill to alert NSC lawyer John Eisenberg about the ""rouge operation"" by Giuliani, Sondland, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Hill recounted Bolton telling her.



Bolton had long took issue with Giuliani's activities. He earlier told Hill that, ""Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up,"" she testified.

In response to Bolton's alleged comments, Giuliani said he was ""disappointed"" and referred to Bolton as an ""atomic bomb.""

Giuliani told another reporter, New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi, that Bolton did not discuss the Ukraine issue with him prior to departing the White House.

The Times reported last week that federal prosecutors with the Southern District of New York are investigating Giuliani to determine if the former New York City mayor ""broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine.""

Formula One drivers boycotted Russian Grand Prix over Ukraine invasion. Now the race is canceled.,"Formula One officials announced Friday that the 2022 Russian Grand Prix has been canceled after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What is the background?

After Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, several F1 drivers announced opposition to the 2022 Russian Grand Prix, which was scheduled to take place in late September at the Sochi Autodrom is southwest Russia.

""For myself, my opinion is I should not go — I will not go,"" said four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel. ""I think it’s wrong to race in the country. I’m sorry for the innocent people who are losing their lives and getting killed for stupid reasons and very, very strange and mad leadership.""

Defending world champion Max Verstappen similarly said, ""When a country is at war, it is not right to race there.""

What did F1 say?

In a statement, F1 officials said holding the Russian Grand Prix would be ""impossible"" given the ""current circumstances.""

""The FIA Formula 1 World Championship visits countries all over the world with a positive vision to unite people, bringing nations together,"" the statement said. ""We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation.""

""On Thursday evening Formula 1, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances,"" the statement added.

The decision came after series officials held a meeting with team principals Thursday in Barcelona, the Athletic reported.

Anything else?

Perhaps the biggest motorsport conundrum related to the Russia-Ukraine war goes to Haas F1 Team.

On one hand, Uralkali, one of the world's leading potash fertilizer producers and exporters, is the team's title sponsor. On the other, Dimtry Mazepin — the father of Haas F1 driver Nikita Mazepin — is a Belarusian-Russian oligarch, key shareholder in Uralkali, and a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sports Illustrated noted.

On Thursday, Haas F1 removed Uralkali's branding from the team's transport trucks and car, which was painted with a red, white, and blue livery meant to resemble the Russian flag.

Haas F1 team principal Gunther Steiner said the team is reconsidering its Uralkali sponsorship and will announce more details next week. The sponsorship was intended to span multiple seasons for an undisclosed dollar amount. Multiyear sponsorships in F1 typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars because F1 is the most expensive form of motorsport in the world.

The team has said it can compete in the 2022 season even without Uralkali's funding.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/formula-1-drivers-boycott-russian-grand-prix-over-ukraine-invasion-now-the-race-is-canceled,2022-02-25
Four charged in the 2014 crash of Malaysian passenger jet in Ukraine,"An international group of investigators has announced that it is charging four men — three Russian nationals and one Ukrainian — with causing the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine in 2014.

What's the background?

On July 17, 2014, flight MH17 took off from Amsterdam, heading for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A few hours later, it crashed in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, 80 of whom were children.



A year after the plane was shot down, Dutch investigators concluded that it had been hit by a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile. The crash happened in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, which is largely controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

What happened now?

On Wednesday, investigators announced that they had enough evidence to bring murder charges against four suspects.

One of the Russians charged, Igor Girkin, is a former colonel with Russia's FSB, and was also commander of the pro-Russian movement in that region of Ukraine. The other two Russians, Sergey Dubinskey and Oleg Pulatov, worked with Russia's military intelligence agency GRU.

The Ukrainian, Leonid Kharchenko, is accused of leading a Russian-backed military combat unit in the area where the plane crashed.

The four are accused of bringing the Buk surface-to-air missile system from Russia into Ukraine, although they are not specifically charged with firing the missiles at the plane itself.

Arrest warrants have been issued for these four people, and the trial is scheduled for March 2020 in the Netherlands.

A group of more than four dozen detectives from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and the Ukraine were involved in this investigation. All these nations had citizens who died in the crash.

Russia has officially, and repeatedly, denied any involvement in the crash, and has claimed that the crash investigators are ""biased and politically motivated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/four-charged-in-the-2014-crash-of-malaysian-passenger-jet-in-ukraine,2019-06-19
Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski killed in Ukraine,"Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in Ukraine on Monday in the same attack that hospitalized correspondent Benjamin Hall, the cable news channel said Tuesday.

In an internal memo to Fox News staff, CEO Suzanne Scott wrote that ""our beloved cameraman"" was killed in Horenka, a village near the capital city of Kyiv, when the vehicle he was riding in was struck by incoming fire. The memo was reported by Deadline.

""Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us. His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched,"" Scott said.



""Based in London, Pierre had been working in Ukraine since February. His talents were vast and there wasn't a role that he didn't jump in to help with in the field — from photographer to engineer to editor to producer — and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill,"" Scott continued. ""He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet. He was wildly popular — everyone in the media industry who has covered a foreign story knew and respected Pierre.""

The memo went on to praise Zakrzewski for his role in getting Afghan freelance associates of Fox News and their families out of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal. He was given a Fox News ""Unsung Hero"" award in 2021 for his efforts.

Fox News President Jay Wallace said, ""Pierre was a constant in all of our international coverage. I, like countless others, always felt an extra sense of reassurance when arriving on the scene and seeing him with a camera in hand. The legacy of his positive spirit, boundless energy and eye for the story will carry on.""

Fox News fires Trey Gowdy amid reports that he has agreed to join President Trump's legal team,"Fox News announced that it has cut ties with former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), further bolstering reports that the attorney has joined President Donald Trump's legal team as outside counsel to fight the Democrats' impeachment probe.

What are the details?

""Trey Gowdy has been terminated and is no longer a contributor,"" a Fox News spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday.

The network's confirmation of Gowdy's departure follows multiple reports that the former prosecutor and conservative firebrand has agreed to assist in defending the president against what the commander in chief has repeatedly referred to as a ""witch hunt.""

The Hollywood Reporter noted, ""Television networks covet former politicians to provide on-air analysis as contributors, but generally cut ties with them if they re-enter the political fray.""

As of this writing, neither Gowdy nor President Trump have commented either way as to whether the South Carolina Republican has been hired to the join the president's legal team. Following several conflicting reports from an array of outlets, however, Washington Post White House reporter Josh Dawsey reported Tuesday evening that a senior White House official confirmed to him that ""Trey Gowdy is on the Trump team.""



Gowdy has already shared his views on the impeached inquiry in his capacity as a Fox News contributor, coming to the defense of multiple Trump administration officials while condemning the basis of the probe. The former congressman also hit out against Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who is spearheading the impeachment efforts — saying Schiff's bias and dishonesty since taking the lead could doom his party's investigation.

The Daily Caller reported that Gowdy left the House of Representatives ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, after serving eight years in the lower chamber.

Fox News' Greg Gutfeld thanks colleagues for helping rescue his mother-in-law from Ukraine,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, whose mother-in-law has been trapped in Ukraine during the conflict with Russia, thanked his colleagues on Friday for helping her to finally reach safety in Poland as she fled from the conflict with Russia.

Gutfeld shared an emotional video segment showing his mother-in-law being reunited with his wife Elena after she successfully made it to Poland. Gutfeld explained that his mother, who is from Ukraine, went back to visit family after her husband passed away from COVID.

""Her husband passed away from COVID last year, so she'd been spending time — she was born in Ukraine, she's a Ukranian Russian — so she was with her cousins or whatnot in this little tiny village when all this stuff happened. So we had to get her out of there and get her back, you know, thanks to Fox,"" Gutfeld said.

Gutfeld lamented the fact that, while his mother-in-law had been successfully evacuated, there were still millions of refugees still stuck in Ukraine who are attempting to flee the escalating violence in that country. ""She was fortunate enough to make it to safety, but there are still millions and millions in danger.""

Gutfeld had spoken about his mother-in-law's plight earlier in the week, and revealed on Thursday afternoon on air during ""The Five,"" ""“Just to let everybody know my mother-in-law crossed into … Poland about half an hour ago, so she's in a car on her way to Warsaw to see her daughter, Elena.""

"Fox News host accuses fellow host Marie Harf of Ukraine cover-up on air, to her face","It's not often that you see two co-hosts on the same news show getting into it, one accusing the other of covering up corruption, but that is exactly what happened Monday on Fox News channel's ""Outnumbered.""

Steve Hilton, host of Fox News' ""The Next Revolution"" and a regular guest on ""Outnumbered,"" was laying out his case that the only justified Ukraine corruption allegations are against former Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry when he was challenged by co-host Marie Harf, who worked at the State Department under the Obama administration.

That's when things got heated.

""Something that Ukraine should look into is John Kerry's corruption. He was secretary of state at the time. He was also involved in channelling money to Ukraine,"" Hilton argued.

""His former chief of staff was hired by Burisma soon after Hunter Biden went on the board,"" he continued. ""They hired John Kerry's former chief of staff while he was secretary of state, paid him money from Burisma, could've come from the U.S. taxpayer, that money is circled back to Democratic senators who then write to the administration calling for more money to be sent to Burisma.""

""There is no evidence to anything you've just given,"" Harf chimed in. ""I worked at the State Department then.""

""Then you're covering up the corruption, too!"" Hilton clapped back.

""Are you kidding me?!"" Harf exclaimed. ""I'm on this couch with you talking about the news, please don't accuse me of covering something up.""

""You are!"" Hilton insisted. ""Because you're saying there's no evidence.""



The exchange was brought to a close as the broadcast transitioned to a live feed of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff taking questions from reporters.

According to the Daily Beast:

Later on in the show, the two would continue their debate, with Hilton wondering how much Ukrainian aid during the Obama years ""ended up in the bank account of Burisma"" while Harf reiterated that there was no evidence of wrongdoing and he was just ""making insinuations.""

Harf worked as a senior adviser for strategic communications to Secretary of State John Kerry before joining Fox News as a political commentator in January 2017.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-host-accuses-fellow-host-marie-harf-of-ukraine-cover-up-on-air-to-her-face,2019-11-06
Fox News host says Trump added an article of impeachment with tweets during hearing,"President Donald Trump made his presence felt during Friday's impeachment inquiry hearing, tweeting about former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch while she was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee.

Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) took notice and accused the president of trying to intimidate a witness during the hearing. Fox News host Bret Baier said Trump might pay a price for his comments.

""That was a turning point in this hearing so far,"" Baier wrote on Twitter. ""She was already a sympathetic witness & the President's tweet ripping her allowed Schiff to point it out real time characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation — adding an article of impeachment real-time.""

Ill-advised as the tweets may have been in that moment, Baier's take on their potential impact on the case against the president is more in line with Democrats than Republicans and conservatives in media, who believe President Trump had the right to criticize Yovanovitch.

""As for Trump's tweet, to call it witness intimidation is laughable,"" Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for George W. Bush, tweeted. ""People can say whatever they want about Trump and he can't say what he thinks? The witness has every right to speak her mind and he can speak his. If witnesses are so intimidated, why do they keep showing up?""

Trump attacked Yovanovitch's record as a diplomat while she was testifying.



""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Trump wrote. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian president spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.""

Friday's hearing had little to do with alleged bribery by President Trump and more to do with whether or not his removal of Yovanovitch from her post was unfair or in service of corruption in Ukraine.



During a news conference Friday afternoon, Trump complained to the media that he was not being granted due process to defend himself, and that Republicans in the hearings were not being treated fairly in impeachment hearings. Both Democrats and Republicans were given equal time to question the witness.

Fox News host targets Republicans over Trump impeachment inquiry: 'Having trouble with the facts',"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace charged on Friday that Republicans are challenging the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump because they are unhappy with the facts against the president.

Republican opposition to the impeachment probe reached a fever pitch this week when dozens of House Republicans, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), stormed the secure room where impeachment inquiry proceedings were ongoing. Republicans contend that Democrats are not being transparent with the process.

According to Wallace, Republicans feel that way because the facts are not on their side.

""My feeling is that if you are having trouble with the facts, you argue process,"" Wallace said. ""That's what Republicans are doing right now.""

""The Democrats have gotten some very damaging information from people like William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; Fiona Hill, who used to be one of the top advisors of the national security council on Ukraine,"" he added. ""Evidence that seems to tie more of a quid pro quo.""

""That there is some evidence from these people working in the Trump administration that the president linked aid to Ukraine, a White House meeting with Ukrainian president, to getting oppo research on the Democrats,"" he continued. ""So, what the Republicans are doing is they're arguing that the process is unfair.""

Wallace was directly responding to comments from White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who earlier on Friday suggested there has been no due process for Trump.

However, Wallace noted that Republicans once held hearings in a similar fashion — during its Benghazi investigation.

""In the Benghazi investigation there were private hearings and then there were public hearings,"" Wallace recounted. ""That's what's going to happen here.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-host-targets-republicans-over-trump-impeachment-inquiry-having-trouble-with-the-facts,2019-10-26
Fox News anchor guts 'fallacy' narrative that Biden pushed for months over record-high gas prices: 'The war is still raging',"Fox News anchor John Roberts exposed the fallacy in President Joe Biden's narrative that blames Russian President Vladimir Putin for high gas prices.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden blamed record-high gas prices and even the inflation crisis on Putin, infamously dubbing the economic woes as ""Putin's price hike.""

Now that gas prices are dropping, however, the Biden administration is unashamedly taking credit for the drop, saying Biden is responsible for relief at the gas pump.

What happened on Fox News?

If Putin was responsible for gas prices skyrocketing, what does it mean, then, that gas prices are dropping despite the war in Ukraine still raging on? That was the question Roberts presented to senior Biden adviser Amos Hochstein.

""The war in Ukraine is still raging and prices are coming down. What about this idea that this was Putin’s price hike?"" Roberts asked. ""Many people say that's a fallacy because the war is still raging and the prices are coming down.""

Hochstein, however, claimed that ""it's not a fallacy.""



According to Hochstein, gas prices were going up because ""Putin started intervening in Europe,"" alleging the ""main increase in prices"" began when ""Putin started to intervene in the markets in the early fall of last year.""

""But they were going up before that,"" Roberts interjected.

""No, no, they actually weren't,"" Hochstein claimed. ""That's just factually not true.""

Gas prices were, in fact, increasing before last fall. When Biden took office in January 2021, the average price of gas was under $2.50 per gallon, steadily rising throughout Biden's presidency before spiking this spring.





When Hochstein finally addressed Roberts' main question, he of course attributed decreasing gas prices to actions taken by the Biden administration

""Now, 'Why are they going down if the war is still raging?' It's a great question,"" Hochstein said. ""The answer is because we’ve actually taken a lot of different actions in order to bring the prices down. Unfortunately, we live in an era where we want to have instant gratification that when you take an action you see the reaction immediately — sometimes it takes time in the market.""

Those actions, according to Hochstein, include Biden's decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and Saudi Arabia increasing its production by a meager figure.

However, GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick DeHann has explained that oil from the SPR is not ""actively pushing prices down,"" but rather ""preventing prices from escalating more substantially.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-john-roberts-biden-narrative-putin-price-hike,2022-08-04
Fox News reporter exposes critical flaw in Biden's plan to 'start blaming Putin for everything',"Fox News reporter Peter Doocy exposed on Thursday the emptiness of President Joe Biden's plan to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for his domestic problems.

This week, the Biden administration coalesced around messaging that blames Putin for sky-high gas pricesand historic inflation, despite both economic problems existing long before the Russia-Ukraine war.

What happened Thursday?

During the daily press briefing, Doocy asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki whether the Biden administration is ""just going to start blaming Putin for everything until the midterms?""

At first, Psaki defended the plan.

""Well, we’ve seen the price of gas go up at least 75 cents since President Putin lined up troops on the border of Ukraine,"" she said.

But Doocy quickly exposed the misleading blame game, noting that just last month the Biden administration blamed inflation and economic woes on the COVID-19 pandemic — not Putin.

""Why is that?"" Doocy pressed.

In response, Psaki claimed that ""all"" global economists agree the pandemic is responsible for inflation before she returned to blaming Putin.

""Well, Peter, the last two years, there was a global pandemic. Global economists have all agreed that that has been the biggest contributor to date of inflation because of the impact on the supply chain. Obviously, global events impact the global economy, as well as global inflation,"" Psaki said. ""And the price hikes, as a result, that have escalated over the course of time of President Putin’s further invasion of the impact on the global oil markets are of course having an impact.""

Earlier in the briefing, Doocy confronted Psaki over her repeated claims that inflation will be temporary.

""We just heard you say, again, that you think inflation is going to be temporary. We’ve heard you say that it was going to be temporary since last spring. So how long do you guys think 'temporary' is?"" Doocy asked.

Psaki, however, deflected blame for the incorrect predictions, saying the Biden administration relies on the Federal Reserve and ""outside economic analysts"" for assessments of the economy.

""The expectations and their assessment at this point continues to be that it will moderate by the end of the year,"" Psaki said. ""There’s also no question that when a foreign dictator invades a foreign country, and when that foreign dictator is the head of a country that is the third-largest supplier of oil in the in the world, that that is going to have an impact. And it is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-reporter-exposes-critical-flaw-in-bidens-plan-to-start-blaming-putin-for-everything,2022-03-11
Rev. Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse Easter message of hope t o all faiths and People of Ukraine,"Rev. Franklin Graham will deliver an Easter message of hope from war-torn Ukraine, where he has seen the resiliency of the Ukrainian people who are fighting back against an invasion by Russia.

""The people that you meet and talk to [in Ukraine] are strong,"" Rev. Graham told Fox News. ""There's no question there's despair and there's fear. But they are determined they are going to fight for their land. And I just admire the [Ukrainian] people for the stand that they're taking.""

Graham said the worst suffering has occurred in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where there is ""famine and great food shortage."" The faith leader revealed that four Ukrainian people distributing food through Graham's humanitarian aid charity Samaritan's Purse were recently killed. The victims died ""trying to help their own citizens, their own people,"" Graham said.

""This may be one of the hardest countries that we have worked in,"" he said of the crisis. ""It's a big country, the size of Texas. And transportation is an issue. They have trains, and trucks, and so forth, but fuel is a big issue. You can't always get fuel.""

Samaritan's Purse said their team of doctors and nurses has treated over 5,000 Ukrainian patients at six medical sites across Ukraine. The Christian charity has also airlifted more than 232 tons of emergency relief supplies to Ukraine, and utilized a network of over 3,200 churches to share medicine and food.

Graham said the Ukrainian ""people are living in the shadow of death,"" but still have the sense that God is with them.

""It's obvious that these people have a strong faith in God,"" Rev. Graham continued.

He pointed out that there are more than 5,000 churches in Ukraine, and they are ""full on Sunday.""

""They're packed. Catholic, Orthodox, Evangelical, Pentecostal, Baptist — they're packed. The people's faith is strong in Ukraine right now. Very strong,"" the CEO and president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said.

""In Ukraine, there are billboards that say, 'Our only hope is God.' We need some billboards like that here in this country,"" he added. ""I hope that our nation would wake up and see the problems we're facing and realize that the only hope is God.""

""The problem we have in the world today is a sin problem,"" Rev. Graham stressed. ""People have turned their back on God.""



""The only hope is God. That's the only hope. Only God can turn [our] nation around,"" he proclaimed. ""This Easter, I pray that people will look to God, pray to him and ask him for his help in all that we do — and that he'll bless the nation.""

Graham declared, ""But to do that, we've got to repent, turn from our sins and believe on the name of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ.""



""We [all] need to repent and turn from our sins. And maybe God will hear us from heaven,"" Graham advised. ""Pray for yourself. Just examine your heart. And if something's not right in your life, confess it to God and turn from it. We need to look at ourselves.""

“I will be sharing a message the whole world needs to hear: Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, conquered sin and death 2,000 years ago when He rose victoriously from the grave,"" Graham said of his Easter message. ""This good news changes everything – for individual hearts, for communities, and for entire nations.”



Previously, Graham wrote to Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requesting a ceasefire from April 15-24 in observance of the Easter holiday.



""It's a mess. It's going to get worse, I'm afraid,"" Graham said of the conflict in Ukraine. ""And what President Putin's end game is, I don't know. But I think we just need to pray that God can change his heart.""

""And I would recommend for people to pray for Putin. I don't want to be misunderstood,"" he clarified. ""I want people to pray that God would change his heart. And turn his heart around, and that he would see the sin that he's involved in. That he would repent and turn from it.""

He added, ""And if we pray, that could happen.""

""God loves us, and Easter is about God's love,"" Graham said.

"Sam Bankman-Fried FTX donations to Democrats, Ukrainian government","FTX had some eye-opening connections to powerful entities and individuals around the world before it all came crashing down.

The meteoric rise of FTX

FTX made waves with early endorsements by NFL legend Tom Brady, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and NBA superstar Stephen Curry. FTX spent big money on a Super Bowl commercial featuring ""Seinfeld"" creator Larry David.

""In 2021, FTX inked a reported $135 million, 19-year deal with the NBA’s Miami Heat to rename the American Airlines Arena as FTX Arena,"" CNN reported. ""Major League Baseball struck a five-year deal in 2021 to name FTX as its official cryptocurrency exchange, a partnership that includes putting FTX patches on umpires’ uniforms.""

The extraordinary collapse of FTX

Then the FTX collapse happened.

Within the span of a few days, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried – known in the industry as “SBF” – lost nearly all of his $16 billion fortune in what Bloomberg called ""one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.""

On Friday, the Bahamas-based FTX was forced to file for bankruptcy after $473 million of its funds were stolen in a hack of the cryptocurrency exchange. Customers rushed to withdraw their funds, but it was too late.

Reuters reported that between $1 billion and $2 billion in customer funds vanished from the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The outlet also claimed that FTX secretly funneled $10 billion of customer funds into his trading company – Alameda Research. The Daily Mail claimed that SBF's alleged girlfriend – Caroline Ellison – ran the sister trading company.

The New York Times noted, ""Despite raising $2 billion, he remained the majority owner of the company. No investors joined FTX’s board of directors, which was made up of Mr. Bankman-Fried, an FTX employee and a lawyer.""

Sam Bankman-Fried gives millions to the Democratic Party

Before his cryptocurrency exchange collapsed, Bankman-Fried was a major financier of the Democratic Party.

MarketWatch reported, ""SBF contributed more than $5 million to Joe Biden and groups supporting him during his 2020 presidential campaign. He said he was motivated by Biden’s 'generic stability and decision-making process.'""

Bankman-Fried gave Democrats nearly $37 million in the 2021-2022 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. SBF was the second-biggest individual donor to the Democrats, only to be surpassed by $128 million from George Soros.

In May, Bankman-Fried said he expected to donate ""north of $100 million"" to Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, but vowed to have a ""soft ceiling"" of political spending of $1 billion if former President Donald Trump ran again.



SBF goes to the White House

The 30-year-old billionaire was able to gain access to a top Biden advisor weeks before he offered vast political donations to the Democrats.

The Washington Free Beacon reported that Bankman-Fried met with top Biden adviser Steve Ricchetti on April 22 and May 12, according to White House visitor logs.

Gabe Bankman-Fried – SBF's brother who handles the billionaire's political operations – visited the White House on March 7, according to the outlet.

SBF largely funded the Democratic Protect Our Future PAC that only launched in May 2022. SBF's brother said the PAC was formed to ""stop the next pandemic.""

In May, Gabe Bankman-Fried said of the Protect Our Future PAC, ""If this is a weird crypto play, I certainly have not been informed about it. I want to stop the next pandemic. That is really my one and only goal here... I think over time, people will realize that.""

Bankman-Fried's mother is also a major fundraiser for Democrats

Bankman-Fried's mother, Barbara Fried, is a Stanford professor, and has ""written extensively on questions of distributive justice, in the areas of tax policy, property theory, and political theory."" She is also the co-founder of the Mind the Gap political action committee that was established in 2018 to help Democrats win elections.

Vox published a glowing article about Mind the Gap in January 2020 titled: ""Inside the secretive Silicon Valley group that has funneled over $20 million to Democrats.""

""What is also unusual is that Mind the Gap is led not by highly experienced political hands, but by academics with no professional backgrounds as fundraisers,"" the Vox article reads. ""The group’s leaders are a pair of Stanford law professors: Barbara Fried, who has no apparent campaign experience, and Paul Brest, the former president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Graham Gottlieb, a Stanford fellow who served in junior roles for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and in his White House, is its executive director.""



Vox notes, ""Backers include people like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, San Francisco power broker Ron Conway, and a coterie of major Democratic donors from across Silicon Valley, including fundraiser Amy Rao.""

The FTX connection to the Ukrainian government and WEF

Curiously, the Ukrainian government launched a cryptocurrency donation website in March that was backed by FTX.

CoinDesk reported in March, ""'Aid for Ukraine,' which has the backing of crypto exchange FTX, staking platform Everstake, and Ukraine’s Kuna exchange, will route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine, Everstake’s Head of Growth Vlad Likhuta told CoinDesk. Ukraine’s crypto-savvy Ministry of Digital Transformation is also involved.""

An Everstake press release stated, ""Aid For Ukraine is cooperating with the cryptocurrency exchange FTX which converts crypto funds received into fiat and sends the donations to the National Bank of Ukraine. This marks the first-ever instance of a cryptocurrency exchange directly cooperating with a public financial entity to provide a conduit for crypto donations. Earlier this month, FTX already converted $1 million worth of SOL and transferred it to the National Bank of Ukraine.""

Bankman-Fried said at the time:

At the onset of the conflict in Ukraine, FTX felt the need to provide assistance in any way it could. By working with the Ministry of Digital Transformation to set up payment rails and facilitate the conversion of crypto donations into fiat currency, we have given the National Bank of Ukraine the ability to deliver aid and resources to the people who need it most. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Sergey and the Everstake team as they continue to work tirelessly in helping Ukrainians as they suffer from this conflict.

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said he played woke Westerner game,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, revealed that the woke appearance that he and his company displayed was all a ""dumb game."" In a new interview, Bankman-Fried confessed that the fake window dressing of altruism was mostly a front and that the performance was done ""so everyone likes us.""

The collapse of FTX

FTX CEO Bankman-Fried saw his company collapse on Election Day. The 30-year-old also saw his net worth of nearly $16 billion wiped out in days.

Until last week, FTX was the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange and was valued at $32 billion in February. However, the digital coin exchange filed for bankruptcy last Friday after a failed takeover by rival Binance.

In addition, between $1 billion and $2 billion in customer funds reportedly vanished from the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.

Investigations into FTX have been launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.

Sam Bankman-Fried was a Democrat megadonor

Bankman-Fried was a Democrat megadonor. He reportedly contributed more than $5 million to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential campaign. He was the second-biggest individual donor to Democrats in the 2021-2022 election cycle – donating $37 million. In May, Bankman-Fried said he planned to donate ""north of $100 million"" to Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, but pledged to have a ""soft ceiling"" of $1 billion in donations to Democrats if former President Donald Trump ran again.

SBF became the biggest donor to the Democratic Protect Our Future PAC that only launched in May. Gabe Bankman-Fried, SBF's brother, who handles the billionaire's political operations, declared that the PAC was formed to ""stop the next pandemic.""

In February, the Bankman-Fried brothers gave a $5 million grant to ProPublica to financially ""support investigations into ongoing questions about the COVID-19 pandemic, biosecurity and public health preparedness.""

SBF ties to the WEF, Clinton Initiative, and New York Times

Until this week, FTX was promoted on the World Economic Forum's website.

In May, SBF was one of the featured speakers at World Economic Forum 2022 in Davos, Switzerland. Topics at the event included sustainability, diversity, equity, inclusion, cryptocurrency, and Web 3.0.

In September, Bankman-Fried was a featured speaker at the annual meeting for the Clinton Global Initiative. The event covered subjects such as vaccine development, the implications of climate change, and transforming philanthropy for ""equity, justice, and impact.""

SBF is slated to be a featured speaker at a summit hosted by the New York Times on Nov. 30, along with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D), and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Tickets for the event cost $2,499.

Bankman-Fried claimed he was an 'effective altruist,' and the media fawned over him

Bankman-Fried, a self-proclaimed “effective altruist,"" was hyped up by the media.

CNBC investment personality Jim Cramer championed SBF as ""the JP Morgan of his generation.""

""Shark Tank"" star investor Kevin O'Leary previously said of FTX, ""If there's ever a place I could be, that I'm not going to get in trouble, it's gonna be at FTX.""

CNBC reporter Kate Rooney lauded Bankman-Fried as the ""Michael Jordan of crypto.""

Bloomberg previously said of the FTX founder, ""Sam Bankman-Fried drives a Corolla, sleeps on a beanbag, and has a Robin Hood-like philosophy.""

SBF admitted masquerading as 'woke Westerner'

In a new interview, Bankman-Fried confessed that he used his virtuous stances as a front to win the game.

Vox reporter Kelsey Piper – who interviewed Bankman-Fried through direct messages on Twitter – said to the former FTX CEO, ""You were really good at talking about ethics for someone who kind of saw it all as a game with winners and losers.""

SBF responded, ""Ya, hehe. I had to be, it's what reputations are made of, to some extent. I feel bad for those who get f***ed by it. By this dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shiboleths [sic] so everyone likes us.""

When asked if his ""ethics stuff"" was ""mostly a front,"" SBF replied, ""Yeah. I mean that's not all of it but it's a lot.""

In the summer, SBF said that companies should not engage in unethical practices. However, when pressed by the Vox reporter, he admitted, ""Man all the dumb s**t I said.""

Speaking about investors focusing on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), he declared, ""ESG has been perverted beyond recognition.""

SBF exclaimed, ""F*** regulators. They make everything worse. They don't protect customers at all.""

Bankman-Fried said it was ""never the intention"" to squander away investors' money, but ""sometimes life creeps up on you.""

""I f**ed up big multiple times,"" he added.

SBF said his biggest regret was FTX filing for bankruptcy. He believes that ""everything would be 70% fixed right now"" if he hadn't declared bankruptcy. He calls the bankruptcy his ""biggest single f***up.""

Bankman-Fried said if he could do it all over again, he would have ""more careful accounting"" and separated his hedge fund Alameda Research from FTX.

The new CEO of FTX said he has never seen such 'complete failure'

John Jay Ray III – a bankruptcy expert with more than 40 years of restructuring experience who liquidated Enron – was appointed the CEO of FTX.

In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Ray said, ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.""

""In the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors,"" Ray wrote in a 30-page document. ""I understand that there does not appear to be documentation for certain of these transactions as loans, and that certain real estate was recorded in the personal name of these employees and advisors on the records of the Bahamas.""

Gas prices soar to new high,"As of Tuesday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas reached $4.374, a staggering figure that marks a new record high when inflation is not taken into account.

Gas Buddy also reported that the the national average price of gas had hit a new high, though it pegged the price at $4.36 per gallon.

While the prices mark fresh highs, reports indicate that when inflation is factored into the equation, the new record still does not eclipse high prices experienced in 2008.

High gas prices not only cost drivers dearly when they fill up their vehicles, but the fuel costs also drive up transportation expenses, which can lead to higher prices for various goods and services throughout the economy.

Americans have been getting hammered by soaring gas prices and high inflation, and if they keep experiencing pain at the pump and witnessing the purchasing power of their hard-earned savings erode each month, those economic issues could hurt Democrats during the 2022 midterm election cycle.



The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is slated to release April consumer price index data on Wednesday. The all-items index rose ""8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March,"" the agency reported last month.

President Joe Biden said in a speech on Tuesday that inflation is his ""top domestic priority."" He attributed inflation to the COVID-19 pandemic and to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. has prohibited the importation of oil and other products from Russia in response to that country's invasion of Ukraine.

""We have the biggest inflation spike in 4 decades, record high gas prices, a massive border crisis, incompetent foreign policy, endless attacks on liberty and personal safety, and now even a baby formula shortage. The Biden presidency has truly been a epic disaster from the start,"" tweeted GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York — the lawmaker is currently running for governor in the Empire State.

""Liquid fuels have turned into liquid gold, with prices for gasoline and diesel spiraling out of control with little power to harness them as the imbalance between supply and demand globally continues to widen with each passing day. Russia's oil increasingly remains out of the market, crimping supply while demand rebounds ahead of the summer driving season,"" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan said. ""There's little, if any, good news about fuel prices heading into summer, and the problem could become worse should we see an above average hurricane season, which could knock out refinery capacity at a time we badly need it as refined product inventories continue to plummet.""

What are the details?

According to AAA, the average cost per gallon was $4.065 as of Monday morning, a notch up from Sunday when reports over the soaring prices began to circulate widely in American media.

The figure is just shy of the all-time high of $4.103 and the highest since 2008

While most average prices are hovering just below $4, in certain states — such as California, Nevada, and New York — the cost is exorbitantly high. In California, the average cost is well over $5 a gallon.

The skyrocketing prices are driven by fears over crude oil supply as private companies continue to boycott Russian energy and the U.S. and other Western nations consider embargos on Russian oil as a penalty for their attack on neighboring Ukraine.

On Monday, Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was up 14%, trading at nearly $130 a barrel, double what it was trading for just a few months ago.

Even though many Western nations have so far largely kept their hands off Russia's energy sector as they advance crippling sanctions, the market is still responding to Moscow's war.

""The market is self-sanctioning — in other words, buyers are avoiding Russian products,"" CNBC reported. ""According to estimates from JPMorgan, 66% of Russian oil is struggling to find buyers. This is creating supply fears in what was an already tight market prior to Russia’s invasion.""

If the U.S. and other nations follow through with a formal embargo, it's expected that oil and gas prices will rise even more.

What else?

The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent rise in oil costs have renewed calls for curtailing America's reliance on foreign energy, specifically from adversaries like Russia. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has doubled its imports of Russian crude oil over the past year.

Many business leaders and lawmakers have responded to the crisis by once again urging the U.S. to produce its own energy, or become energy independent, something quite possible given the country's natural resources. Yet for years the initiative has been thwarted by Democrat-imposed restrictions over supposed environmental concerns.

Over the weekend, influential tech billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk begrudgingly called for an increase in domestic energy production.

""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports,""

Soon after, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz threw his support behind Musk, saying, ""Couldn’t agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!""

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, too, has voiced his support for energy independence while criticizing the current president for continuing to buy up Russian oil.

""We produce energy cleaner than anybody in the world,"" Manchin said last week. ""We’re buying 650,000 barrels a day from Russia. It’s ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.""

""To continue to ask other countries to do what we can do for ourselves in a cleaner way is hypocritical,"" he added in a statement. ""To continue to rely on Russian energy as they attack Ukraine is senseless.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gas-prices-top-4-dollars-gallon-russia-ukraine,2022-03-07
Gas theft is on the rise as prices keep climbing,"Gas prices in the U.S. are reaching record highs and are only set to keep rising after President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on energy imports from Russia. And now some people are reporting incidents of gasoline theft.

In Southern California, a viewer shared photographs with KTVU-TV showing what happened to one vehicle — how a thief had drilled a hole in the fuel tank and drained it of all the gas.







According to the American Automobile Association, gas siphoning and other crimes of theft are on the rise as prices at the pump keep skyrocketing.

""This is a sign of the times you know,"" AAA spokesman Doug Shupe told KTVU. ""It's thieves looking for ways that they can make money by stealing what is becoming an increasingly more expensive and valuable commodity, gasoline.""

The average price for a gallon of regular gas in California is currently $5.44, up from $3.75 last year. Price increases related to inflation have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, where Russia's full-scale invasion of the country has disrupted energy production. Additionally, U.S. economic sanctions and the Biden administration's action to ban oil and gas imports from Russia have restricted supply, further increasing prices.

""[It] used to be $60, then it went to $70, I think two weeks ago it was $90,"" California resident Mona Garcia told the local news station while filling up her car Monday night. When she had finished, the bill was $100.

Garcia said she uses a driveway camera and floodlight are meant to deter would-be thieves from stealing gas from her tank.

But for those who are victims of theft, the cost can be high. If thieves drill into your fuel tank, repairs can run more than $1,000, not including the stolen gas.

""Oftentimes vehicle owners who find themselves victims of this type of gasoline theft, they have to replace the entire gas tank,"" Shupe warned. ""So it is a costly repair and replacement that needs to be made.""

The risk isn't just to Californians. Last week, police in Atlanta, Georgia arrested a man suspected of drilling holes in multiple fuel tanks to steal thousands of dollars of gasoline, WAGA-TV reported.

AAA recommends that people take precautions against thieves while gas prices remain high, including parking the car in a locked garage if you have one. If you do not have access to a garage, it is recommended that you park in a well-lit area with high foot traffic or a fenced-in lot or parking garage, if available. When parking in a garage, vehicle owners should be mindful to park near the exit or elevator, areas with high visibility and foot traffic, AAA says.

Signs that your fuel tank may have been tampered with include the smell of gasoline, a puddle under your vehicle, or a lit check engine light. AAA recommends that anyone who suspects their gas was stolen file a police report and contact their vehicle insurance company to check if the repairs are covered.

George Conway publicly chides Kellyanne Conway while she defends President Trump — and Twitter freaks out,"George Conway took his frequent criticism of President Donald Trump to another level on Monday by publicly responding to his own wife, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, while she defended her boss — and Twitter was sent aflutter.

What are the details?

""Sleepy Joe is creepy Joe,"" Kellyanne tweeted along with a widely-circulated clip of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden telling a strange story during a stump speech. ""We need Ukraine's help to defeat THIS guy?"" she added, referencing the quid pro quo allegations at the heart of House Democrats' impeachment proceedings.

""Your boss apparently thought so,"" George responded on Twitter.



Kellyanne's name quickly began trending on the social media platform while George racked up tens of thousands of ""likes"" along with comments of rebuke for publicly shaming his own wife and mother of his children.



It is notable to mention this is the first time George has publicly addressed Kellyanne over her defense of President Trump.

The mayhem became newsworthy, with several major media outlets such as Fox News, CNN, The Hill, and The Washington Post reporting on the exchange.

Both Conways are highly-accomplished attorneys and well-known conservatives. George has also written numerous op-eds with the sole focus of criticizing the president, calling President Trump racist and narcissistic.

What's the background?

Kellyanne, as of this writing, did not react publicly to her husband's quote-tweet. In recent months, she has been defensive and combative toward reporters who have written about or asked her about George's outspokenness against her boss.

In October, The Washington Examiner released a phone call between Kellyanne and one of their reporters where the White House adviser berated the journalist and said of George, ""He gets his power through me, if you haven't noticed. Not the other way around.""



Last month, Kellyanne also engaged in a tense exchange with CNN's Wolf Blitzer after the journalist asked her about comments George made during a media blitz against President Trump. Blitzer played footage from another outlet where her husband accused the president of using his office to ""advance his own personal interests as opposed to the country's.""



During a November interview on Fox & Friends, President Trump said of the Conways, ""Kellyanne is great, but she's married to a total wack job. She must've done some number on him,"" the president told co-host Ainsley Earhardt. ""I don't know what Kellyanne did to that guy, because I don't even know him. I met him for a second. He's got to be some kind of a nut job. She must have done some bad things to him, because that guy is crazy.""

George Takei tries to mock gun owners and inadvertently makes the case for owning an AR-15,"Liberal actor George Takei tried to mock gun owners, but many on social media noted that he had inadvertently made the argument in support of AR-15 ownership.

Takei made the comment in the wake of the horrific Uvalde elementary school massacre and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""Crazy thought, but those 20 million AR-15s now in this country could sure arm a lot of Ukrainians,"" tweeted Takei.

The ""Star Trek"" icon garnered a lot of retweets and likes in support of his supposition, but gun owners and others supporters of the Second Amendment noticed that he had undermined his own argument for gun control.

""In this episode, George Takei learns about the usefulness of an armed populace against foreign or domestic oppression,"" responded journalist Tony Kinnett.

""So...you're saying that a rifle could be used in a self defense situation against a tyrannical government? That's actually brilliant. Only if the Founding Fathers had thought of that, and enshrined it in some sort of document,"" read another response with more than 1k likes.

""Crazy thought, Americans should have the same right and ability to protect themselves that Ukrainians do,"" replied comedian Tim Young.

Not only was Takei's point taken up by conservatives, but some liberals were incensed that he hadn't thought it through.

""Why are people on this site advocating for a flood of untraceable weapons to Ukraine? Do you understand where this will lead?! Let’s not export our unregulated gun violence to other countries,"" read one tweet. ""For f***’s sake.""

Takei has been very vocal about his leftist beliefs and he has previously offended conservatives with his ill considered tweets. In one instance from June 2017 the actor opined that the universe was dealing a lesson in social justice when a lawmaker was treated by a gay nurse after being shot in the heinous baseball field attack on Republicans.

George W. Bush goes mega-viral over Freudian slip that reignited accusations that he is a 'war criminal',"Former President George W. Bush on Wednesday inadvertently described the invasion of Iraq, which happened under his watch, as ""wholly unjustified"" and ""brutal.""

What did Bush say?

The gaffe happened as Bush was speaking in Dallas about the importance of democracy while comparing Ukraine and Russia.

""In contrast, Russian elections are rigged. Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process,"" Bush said. ""The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq — I mean of Ukraine.""



The former president immediately added under his breath, ""Iraq, too — anyway.""

The crowd responded with laughter as Bush attributed his Freudian slip to his old age. Bush is now 75 years old.

The video of Bush's remarks has since been viewed 16 million times, generating tens of thousands of comments online.

What was the reaction?

While the crowd may have laughed away the Freudian confession, others did not laugh.

The remark reignited criticism against Bush, including accusations that he is a ""war criminal,"" the ""worst president of the last 100 years,"" and a ""trash person.""

After all, the 2003 invasion of Iraq — the pretext of which was the repeated assertion by the Bush administration that Iraqi dictator Suddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction — is considered one of America's greatest military blunders.

As the world knows now, Iraq never had WMDs.

The long, drawn-out war led to tens of thousands of deaths among coalition forces, including approximately 4,500 American soldiers, and a civilian death toll that is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

Even worse, the invasion and subsequent overthrow of Hussein's government created a political vacuum and power struggle that eventually allowed terrorist groups, like the Islamic State, to seize power in the 2010s.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/george-w-bush-freudian-slip-iraq-ukraine,2022-05-19
Restaurant owner puts up sign hammering Biden over inflation and telling his supporters to eat somewhere else,"A restaurant owner in Cartersville, Georgia, decried the policies of the Biden administration with a sign outside his business that also told the president's supporters to eat elsewhere.

A photograph of the sign outside of Appalachian Grill was posted to Reddit, where it quickly went viral.

""If you voted for Brandon's Build Back BS and don't have remorse or regrets I wish you would leave, I don't need your business,"" the note says.

""Your ignorant, naive decision has more than doubled our costs of goods and depleted our labor force by more than triple,"" the sign added. ""If this is what you consider to be building back better I don't care to look at or serve you, nor should any other restaurant!""

The image was widely circulated on Twitter among people who are critical of President Joe Biden.

Many said they would visit the restaurant in order to support the anti-Biden message, while others on the left were angry that the owner would politicize his business.

Some on social media criticized the restaurant owner by pointing out that the business and another he owned had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in coronavirus relief from the federal government.

The frustration with high inflation under the Biden administration has led to even more dire warnings about how Democrats will fare in the upcoming midterm elections.

The Biden administration has tried to blame high prices on everything from the pandemic to greedy meat conglomerates, but polling shows that more Americans blame Biden and his policies for high inflation. More recently, a Biden administration staffer was excoriated for trying to accuse critics of Biden of siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Germany's biggest cities limit water and heat while preparing for energy crisis over Russian gas,"Some of Germany's biggest cities are preparing for an energy crunch this winter by shutting off warm water, limiting heat, and switching off lighting.

The German city of Hanover is attempting to reduce its energy consumption by 15%.

Between Oct. 1 and March 31, Hanover's municipal buildings will not be allowed to be heated to a temperature over 68F. The city has banned the use of mobile air conditioning units and fan heaters.



The citizens of Hanover will be forced to take cold showers at city-run facilities. The German city will cut off hot water in public buildings, swimming pools, and gyms.

""The situation is unpredictable. Every kilowatt hour counts, and protecting critical infrastructure has to be a priority,"" said Hanover Mayor Belit Onay – who is part of the Green party. ""We are facing hard times due to the Russian aggression on Ukraine. And as we see that there's a looming gas shortage, this is a major challenge for municipalities.""

""I think everyone, not only the municipalities — the federal government also, and also every single person in Germany — is needed for this. Everyone has to save energy as much as possible so we can get through the winter,"" Onsay said. ""Otherwise ... in December or January, we will have much bigger problems than lighting or the showers.""

Hanover isn't the only German city limiting energy use.

Last week, the German city of Munich announced that it would turn off spotlights on its town hall. The city also shut off warm water at its municipal offices. Fountains in Germany's third-largest city would be turned off at night.

Nuremberg closed three of its four public indoor swimming pools run by the city.

""Vonovia, the country’s largest residential landlord, said it would be lowering the temperature of its tenants’ gas central heating to 17C (62F) between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.,"" the Financial Times reported. ""A housing association in the Saxon town of Dippoldiswalde, near the Czech border, went a step further this week, saying it was rationing the supply of hot water to tenants. From now on, they can only take hot showers between 4 a.m. - 8 a.m., 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. - 9 p.m.""

The district of Lahn-Dill, near Frankfurt, turned off hot water in its 86 schools and 60 gyms until mid-September.

Last week, Berlin's senate voted to turn off the lighting of 200 monuments, buildings, and landmarks in the German capital of more than 3.5 million people to save electricity.

""In April, Berlin had announced measures to keep its outdoor swimming pools at two degrees below the weather-dependent standard temperature throughout the summer season,"" The Guardian reported.



Bettina Jarasch – Berlin’s senator for the environment – said, ""In the face of the war against Ukraine and Russia’s energy threats it is vital that we handle our energy as carefully as possible.""

Germany is one of the countries most heavily dependent on Russian energy.

In 2021, 34% of Germany's crude oil came from Russia and 53% of coal imported into Germany was shipped from Russia. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Germany received 55% of its natural gas from Russia, according to the New York Times.

Last week, Russian gas giant Gazprom PJSC declared that it would limit natural gas shipped through the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany down to 20% of capacity, Bloomberg reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/germany-cities-energy-crisis-russia-gas,2022-07-31
Germany seeks to rebuild its defensive forces with Iron Dome style missile defense systems,"Germany is moving to strengthen its defensive forces in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Bloomberg reported that the formerly demilitarized nation is planning to buy a missile defense system as it moves to modernize its military.

The German government is reportedly considering options that include the American manufactured THAAD missile shield and the Israeli-made Arrow 3 system.

This past week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the successor to Angela Merkel — discussed the modernization of Germany’s military with German Chief of Staff Eberhard Zorn. Subsequently, the German government earmarked $110 billion (100 billion euros) for additional defense spending.

Currently, Germany only has 12 Patriot anti-rocket units that are unable to provide the country with comprehensive defense.

The revolutionary, Israeli missile defense system — known as the Iron Dome — is reported to likely cost less than 2 billion euros and according to Marcus Faber, a member of the Free Democratic Party in the German parliament, production on such a system could begin immediately.

Faber indicated that no final decision about what missile defense system to use has yet been reached by the German government.

Germany isn’t the only country after Iron Dome technology in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.

In late March, while addressing the Israeli Knesset, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew comparisons between the ongoing Russian invasion of his country to Nazi Germany’s attempts to exterminate the Jewish people, reported Reuters.

In doing so, Zelenskyy insisted that the Israeli government had an obligation to share its Iron Dome technology with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said, “Everybody knows that your missile defense systems are the best, and you can definitely help our people, save the lives of Ukrainians, of Ukrainian Jews.”

Zelenskyy went on to question Israel’s commitment to reaching a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Ukraine since the country’s leadership opts to remain neutral.

“We can ask why we can’t receive weapons from you, why Israel has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business,” Zelenskyy said. “Either way, the choice is yours to make, brothers and sisters, and you must then live with your answer.”

According to the German news network n-tv, installing Iron Dome defense systems would enable Germany to proactively defend itself and a number of other nearby countries.

N-tv said, “The radar devices are so powerful that the protective shield could also cover Poland, Romania, and the Baltic States.”

"Germany suspends critical oil pipeline with Russia, triggering astronomical threat by Russia","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced Tuesday that his country has stopped the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline after Russian troops moved into Ukrainian territories.

""The situation now is fundamentally different,"" Scholz said, explaining that he needed to ""send a clear signal to Moscow that such actions won’t remain without consequences.""

Why does this matter?

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was not yet functional, has been a hotly contested pipeline in European affairs. The pipeline would permit Russian oil to flow directly to Germany, thereby depriving Ukraine of billions of dollars in oil-transit taxes. The pipeline would also increase Russia's geopolitical influence in Europe, an undesirable prospect for Western allies considering that Germany is already reliant upon Russian oil.

Thus, Scholz's announcement means Germany is serious about causing Russia economic harm, which in theory could deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from moving forward with plans for a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. But it remains to be seen whether a temporary setback of the Nord Stream 2 would convince Putin to back down.

What was the reaction?

Russia responded by threatening to significantly raise energy prices, underscoring Europe's dependence on cheaper Russian energy supply and Russia's desperation for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to become operational.

""German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has issued an order to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Well. Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2.000 for 1.000 cubic meters of natural gas!"" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council and former Russian president, said.

To give an idea of the scope of Medvedev's threat, natural gas in the U.S. was $7.03 per 1,000 cubic feet last November, according to the most recent government data. Raising energy prices to that extent, then, would be a double-edged sword; while it would likely send Europe into an energy crisis, it would also damage Russia's economy, which is reliant upon oil export revenues.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba celebrated Germany's announcement.

""I welcome Germany’s move to suspend the certification of Nord Stream 2. This is a morally, politically and practically correct step in the current circumstances,"" Kuleba said. ""True leadership means tough decisions in difficult times. Germany’s move proves just that.""

Still, Richard Grenell, the former U.S. ambassador to Germany, explained why Scholz's announcement is but a small victory, noting the certification process for Nord Stream 2 was only temporarily halted.

""This is purely TEMPORARY. And is entirely too late,"" Grenell said.

What about President Biden?

Just last year, President Joe Biden lifted sanctions on the company behind the pipeline project, Nord Stream 2 AG, and its chief executive, Matthias Warnig, who is reportedly a close Putin ally.

Although the move essentially approved the completion of the pipeline, the Biden administration reportedly lifted the sanctions in an effort to improve relations with Germany. The sanctions had been implemented by former President Donald Trump.

Just two weeks ago, Biden promised the U.S. ""will bring an end"" to the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the Biden administration will announce its ""own measures"" later Tuesday, but did not immediately offer details about any forthcoming sanctions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/germany-suspends-critical-oil-pipeline-with-russia-triggering-astronomical-threat-by-russia,2022-02-22
"Rudy Giuliani defies congressional subpoena ahead of deadline: ‘If they enforce it, we’ll see what happens’","Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney of President Donald Trump, says that he wouldn't comply with a congressional subpoena related to the House's impeachment proceedings ahead of his Tuesday deadline for responding.

The former New York City mayor told ABC News that ""if they enforce it, then we'll see what happens."" He also told the outlet that he's not retaining the legal services of former Watergate independent prosecutor Jon Sale, but that he would again retain counsel if Democrats decide to enforce the subpoena.

Three Democrat-led House committees subpoenaed Giuliani at the end of September due to his involvement in the controversy surrounding President Trump's request that Ukrainian officials look into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2016 election and a Ukrainian energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter. That subpoena for documents came with an Oct. 15 deadline.

Days before the subpoena was issued, Giuliani told reporters that he ""would think of challenging their subpoena on the grounds that they're not a legitimate committee.""

Last week, the president's attorney told the Washington Post that he wouldn't testify as part of the impeachment proceedings unless the full House held a vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) were removed from his position as House Intelligence Committee chairman.

Giuliani's refusal comes a full week after White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Democrats stating that the executive branch would not participate in the impeachment investigation, citing the lack of a House vote as well as due process and fairness concerns.

""Given that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,"" the letter concluded.

Tuesday was also the deadline day for White House Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russ Vought and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. A senior administration official speaking on background told Blaze Media that OMB will let the White House's letter speak for itself. On Sunday, Esper told Fox News that officials from his department ""will respond as we can,"" but declined to say whether or not his department would meet Democrats' deadline.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/giuliani-defies-congressional-subpoena-ahead-of-deadline-if-they-enforce-it-well-see-what-happens,2019-10-15
'I am outraged' — Rudy Giuliani threatens to sue Fox News host who called him an 'unethical disaster',"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani threatened to sue a Fox News host who recommended he be fired from the president's legal team and called him an ""unethical disaster"" in a commentary segment on his show.

Giuliani tweeted about it from his social media account on Monday.

""I have not taken a penny for representing my friend, President Trump,"" said Giuliani.

""I am outraged that @SteveHiltonx reported that I was trying to pursue private business deals in Ukraine to 'enrich' myself, when in reality I have made ZERO in Ukraine! Very lazy reporting!"" he added.



Hilton, who hosts the show ""The Next Revolution"" on Fox News, not only criticized Giuliani, but also other defenders of the president, including reporter John Solomon, and lawyers Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova.

""There is another side to this swamp, and we need to be open about it,"" said Hilton on his show Sunday.

""What's he doing?"" he added, speaking about Giuliani. ""He's going around trying to make business deals out of the Ukraine situation at the same time that he's acting for his client, President Trump. He's trying to make money off of his relationship with President Trump. I don't like that.""

Giuliani said that Hilton's accusation depended on what he saw as false reporting from the New York Times.

""Since representing Trump I have considered and turned down all deals in Ukraine, even those not presenting a conflict,"" he said in a second tweet. He added that his lawyers told him he should sue Hilton for libel.

""If it wasn't for me, @SteveHiltonx wouldn't even be covering Burisma. He sure didn't cover it for the THREE YEARS it was in front of his face. He should apologize for his maliciousness and thank me for the story!"" he said in a third tweet.

"Rudy Giuliani accuses Joe Biden of threatening Lindsey Graham, compares him to the mafia","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused Joe Biden of threatening Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and compared him to the criminal mafia after Biden reacted to the opening of a probe into his Ukraine dealings.

Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, tweeted the accusation from his social media account on Friday after quoting the candidate's comments that Graham would ""regret his whole life.""

""This reminds me of Biden's decree to the media to silence me on September 29th,"" tweeted Guiliani.

""Now a threat to a US Senator. This is getting to be more and more like my old mafia cases,"" he added. ""They sure do sound like crooks.""



Biden responded on Friday to the probe of his and his son's activities in Ukraine by saying he was ""disappointed"" and ""angered.""

The Democratic frontrunner claimed that Graham was under the thumb of President Donald Trump and his allies because he knew that he would not be re-elected if he countered the president.

""Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life,"" he said to CNN's Don Lemon.

Giuliani took that to be a threat against Graham.

The investigation will try to uncover whether Biden abused the power of the vice presidency in order to benefit his son, Hunter Biden, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company at a time when the Obama administration had power influence in the country.

Giuliani has alleged that Ukrainian prosecutors who could corroborate these claims were being kept out of the country by the State Department.

"Giuliani calls Democrats a 'sad joke,' says he might challenge a subpoena if he's served","Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, laughed at reporters who asked about the possibility of a subpoena from House Democrats, and said he might even challenge it if he was served.

""I consider them a joke. A sad joke. They have no legitimacy. I would think of challenging their subpoena on the grounds that they're not a legitimate committee,"" Giuliani said on Friday to reporters, according to CNN.

Giuliani defended his part in the growing controversy over a call made by President Donald Trump to the Ukrainian president where he asked that their government look into claims of corruption related to the U.S. election.

He said that he was the true whistleblower because he had exposed corruption by Joe Biden.

On Friday, three House committees issued subpoenas to State Department Secretary Mike Pompeo for refusing to provide documents they had requested previously.

Giuliani also said he would not testify if the president told him not to do so.

""Ultimately, if I were to say yes and he were to say no, I can't testify,"" he told reporters.

The accusations of impropriety against the president were used by Democrats to announce the official commencement of an impeachment inquiry.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had resisted the calls from the progressive wing of the Democratic party to impeach, but she relented after the report from a whistleblower accused the president of acting unethically.

A poll released Thursday showed an increase in the support for impeachment, but not enough to mark a majority.

Giuliani: No administration officials will testify or provide documents to impeachment probe unless Adam Schiff is removed as House Intel Committee chairman,"Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, said that he will not testify before House investigators as part of Democrats' ongoing impeachment efforts against the president unless Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is removed as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and the House votes in full on taking up the impeachment probe.

In an interview with the Washington Post published Tuesday, Giuliani said that he wouldn't appear before the House Intelligence Committee and ""can't imagine"" Trump administration officials would do so either.

""The position I'm stating is now the position of the administration,"" Giuliani told the newspaper. ""I wouldn't testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and [Schiff] is removed.""

The former New York City mayor referred a soon-to-be-released letter that the Trump administration has sent to Congress regarding the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry. Reports about such a letter broke late last week. In the letter, the White House reportedly made the argument that it doesn't have to cooperate with impeachment probe demands until the House formally votes to launch an inquiry.

The chairmen of the three House committees that have subpoenaed Giuliani have given him until Oct. 15 to respond to them, but he says he's ready to challenge them on the summons.

""Let them hold me in contempt. We'll go to court. We'll challenge the contempt,"" Giuliani said.

Also, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) invited Giuliani to speak before the upper chamber panel and inform lawmakers ""of his concerns."" Graham said that he was ""tired of only hearing one side of the story"" and that it's ""now time to give voice to everything Ukraine. Let the chips fall where they may!""

Giuliani told the Washington Post that he was ""very interested"" in speaking to the Senate committee, but that ""there are a lot of legal issues to consider"" first.

""Graham wants me to lay out in one place, in one time the Ukrainian collusion and the Biden corruption,"" Giuliani said, adding that the idea for him to testify was not his. ""I appreciate Lindsey offering the opportunity to lay the whole case out.""

"Rudy Giuliani says US diplomats were doing the bidding of George Soros in Ukraine, in interview with Glenn Beck","Rudy Giuliani told Glenn Beck during an exclusive interview that U.S. diplomats were doing the bidding of billionaire philanthropist George Soros in Ukraine in a ""massive pay-for-play"" scheme that included falsifying evidence against President Donald Trump.

Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, spoke to Beck on his program Wednesday about the claims being made against him by Democrats in their ongoing impeachment inquiry.

""The anti-corruption bureau is a contradiction,"" said Giuliani about the bureau set up in Ukraine to root out corruption.



""They took all the corruption cases away from the prosecutor general, they gave it to the anti-corruption bureau, and they got rid of all the cases that offended Soros, and they included all the cases against Soros' enemies,"" he explained.

""One of the first cases they dismissed was a case in which his NGO, AntAC, was supposed to have embezzled a lot of money, but not only that, collected dirty information on Republicans to be transmitted, gotten by Ukrainians, to be transmitted to this woman Alexandra Chalupa and other people who worked for the Democratic National Committee,"" Giuliani continued.

""The first case that [former prosecutor Yuri] Lutsenko tanked was that case at the request of the ambassador,"" he added.

Elsewhere in the interview, Giuliani described his reaction when he discovered the Ukrainian collusion that undermined the accusations of the Democrats made against the president.

""Hallelujah! I now have what a defense lawyer always wants: I can go prove somebody else committed this crime!"" Giuliani said.

Giuliani explained to Beck that he had gone to Ukraine seeking exculpatory evidence, that which would exonerate his client, the president, in the special counsel Robert Mueller investigation.

When Giuliani was asked directly about the identity of the whistleblower, he said that he could not speak about the matter publicly, and could not indicate if he knew the identity or not.



He also claimed that there were several prosecutors in Ukraine currently who were willing to testify about the collusion, but they were being blocked by the U.S. State Department. When prompted by Beck, he said he would provide for him the names of those individuals off air.

""The case is a massive pay-for-play multimillion-dollar scheme, and it is an absolute travesty of justice,"" Giuliani said.

Giuliani reveals he has the 'smoking gun' in the Hunter Biden case with witnesses ready to 'name names',"Rudy Giuliani declared on Saturday night that he has three witnesses who are ready to ""name names"" in an investigation into Hunter Biden and his dealings with Ukraine.

Giuliani told Fox News host Jesse Watters that the revelations will result in President Donald Trump being ""totally vindicated"" following the partisan-led impeachment proceedings in Congress which resulted in the president being acquitted by the Senate.

""I want to prove what happened,"" the former New York City mayor and federal prosecutor said, ""because I believe if we prove what happened, he will be totally vindicated.""

According to Fox, Watters pressed Giuliani on whether he had documentation of the younger Biden's business relationships in Ukraine while noting that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) will be probing the matter.

""Lindsey, get started,"" Giuliani said, while adding he possessed ""what I used to call when I was U.S. attorney, the smoking gun.""

Watters described Giuliani's ""smoking gun"" as ""an international wire to avoid detection disguised as a loan.""

Giuliani said his revelations will also show that former Vice President Joe Biden should have been investigated after bragging back in 2016 that he got Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired as he was looking into the business practices of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter Biden sat on the board.

""Look, the government has been so lax in investigating, it's pathetic,"" Giuliani said. ""I mean, when I was a U.S. attorney, the day Joe Biden made that boastful announcement, the investigation would have begun the next day for bribery.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/giuliani_smoking_gun_hunter_biden,2020-02-09
"Giuliani's son calls raid on father's apartment 'absurd,' blames 'continued politicization' of DOJ","Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, held a media conference Wednesday expressing fury over federal agents executing a search warrant on his father's Manhattan apartment earlier in the day.





What are the details?

""This is disgusting,"" Andrew told reporters. ""This is absolutely absurd, and it's the continued politicization of the Justice Department.""

""If this can happen to the former president's lawyer, this can happen to any American,"" he continued. ""Enough is enough.""

Then, Andrew made a reference to President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, saying, ""The only piece of evidence that they did not take up there today was the only piece of incriminating evidence that is in there, and it does not belong to my father — it belonged to the current president's son.""

He added, ""To all Americans out there, our Justice Department should be independent of politics. Enough is enough, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot stand for this anymore.""

The raid of Rudy Giuliani's apartment took place around 6:00 a.m., his attorney confirmed, and the former mayor of New York's electronic devices were confiscated. According to the initial reporting by The New York Times, federal authorities are ""stepping up a criminal investigation into Mr. Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine.""

What else?

Meanwhile, another former personal attorney to President Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, appeared to celebrate the news that Giuliani's home was raided.

""Here we go folks!!!"" he tweeted, sharing The Times' report.

Cohen was the former president's friend and lawyer for many years before the two turned on each other after Cohen was targeted by investigations during Trump's term in the White House. Cohen has since written a book criticizing Trump.

The Hill reported that ""the FBI raided Cohen's hotel room, home and office in April 2018, on suspicions that his former lawyer was acting as an unregistered foreign agent, among other crimes.""

Cohen became a household name after defending the president during the Stormy Daniels scandal. The attorney later pleaded guilty to several criminal charges including tax fraud and excessive campaign contributions after confessing to paying two women ""for the principal purpose of influencing the [2016] election,"" purportedly at the request of Trump.

He also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress during the Mueller probe over a Trump Tower project in Moscow.

Cohen served time in prison and was released on house arrest due to COVID-19 concerns. He has met several times with the Manhattan district attorney's office ""as part of a criminal investigation looking into Trump's family business finances,"" The Hill noted.

After Cohen's tweet reacting to the Giuliani raid, his name began trending on Twitter to his own apparent dismay. He tweeted, ""Amazing that @RudyGiuliani home and office gets raided by law enforcement and I start #trending on @Twitter!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/giulianis-son-calls-raid-on-fathers-apartment-absurd-blames-continued-politicization-of-doj,2021-04-28
Glenn Beck: ‘His fingers are on everything’ — that’s why Democrats are ‘scared’ of naming the whistleblower,"The Democrats are concealing the Ukraine whistleblower's identity because his testimony would expose the State Department-funded and George Soros-led ""shadow government"" effort in Ukraine, Glenn Beck suggested in a lengthy exposé on BlazeTV Wednesday.



""This is the reason why Adam Schiff and the Democrats are scared of naming the whistleblower, because his fingers are on everything,"" Beck stated. ""There is no way this man can testify in an open forum.""

Beck made the case that all of the people who have been called to testify in the impeachment inquiry are career diplomats privy to the events surrounding the Ukrainian revolution in 2014 and leading up to Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president on July 25.

""This includes,"" Beck argued, ""their knowledge of the alleged whistleblower — Eric Ciaramella.""

Beck then gave details about Ciaramella that are bulleted in the image below:

Image Source: YouTube screenshot

Beck then questioned why it seems State Department officials, CIA and National Security Council staffers, and now Democrats in Congress are so ""scared of Donald Trump poking around in Ukraine.""

House Intel chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has seemingly reversed course on revealing the whistleblower, now banning his name from being exposed in the inquiry.

""What are they afraid of revealing?"" Beck asked.

He mused that they might be afraid of revealing that the State Department, in collusion with intelligence agencies, was paying large sums of money to George Soros-run non-governmental organizations in Ukraine, citing the $7 billion dollars Ukrainian law enforcement reported to U.S. prosecutors as misappropriated back in April.

""Well that's an answer I can't officially find, but that's an answer that Donald Trump was asking [about] on July 25,"" Beck said. ""And it must be answered in the Senate trial.""

Beck suggested that while the impeachment inquiry is ""a side show,"" it is pertinent that the inquiry move forward so that the real ""deep state"" scandal can be uncovered.

What Beck's team did find was an email chain released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request showing the alleged whistleblower contacting all the heavyweights within the State Department who were working on Ukraine.

""The entire email has been redacted,"" Beck displayed. ""Whatever Ciaramella specifically said, the State Department doesn't want us to know about.""

""But the final email in the chain reveals the overall context: Obama Administration dollars, going through the U.S. Embassy via USAID,"" Beck argued.

All of the research material has been linked on Beck's website.

Laying the foundation

The United States government has been creating and funding nation-building organizations since the start of the 19th century but calling them non-governmental organizations or NGOs, Beck asserted while laying background for his argument.

""The deep state is not a conspiracy theory,"" Beck said. ""And they're not meeting like S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in some little secret society room, but it is an ingrained culture of unelected officials who have their plans set and they work to fulfill their goals, regardless of who the president is — that's the deep state, a vast bureaucracy built over a century on the backs and shoulders of the elite, the progressive, the academic ideology.""

Beck outlined the ""deep state"" strategy, which is essentially this: the funding of NGOs to overthrow governments overseas so that bureaucratic officials could come in and shape new governments.

""And it's all being done in your name, with your money,"" Beck exclaimed.

The specifics regarding Ukraine

""Two items that keep popping up in our research … with the left and Ukraine … are 'civil society' and 'open society,'"" Beck stated as he transitioned into details regarding Ukraine. ""These two phrases are used by this global shadow government to mold the rest of the world into a socialist theme park — and again being done in your name and without your consent or vote.""

Beck then showed how the U.S. government was funding George Soros-backed groups — such as the Open Society Foundation and the Anti Corruption Action Center — in Ukraine in 2013 before the Ukrainian revolution in 2014.

Beck noticed one name pop up again and again: Alec Ross.

Ross was appointed to the State Department as a senior adviser on innovation to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

He later headed up a Clinton program called ""Civil Society 2.0"" that led tech camps in foreign countries training grassroots revolutionaries to mobilize.

Beck explained that ""Civil Society 2.0"" began to be the instigators of ""spontaneous indigenous popular uprisings"" that aimed to spur chaos to accomplish leftist policy objectives in foreign countries.

Civil Society 2.0 came to Ukraine in 2011, Beck said.

The game-plan

Later in the episode, Beck listed four points that he believed to be the deep state game-plan when getting involved in foreign countries:

Step One: U.S. State Department identifies, trains, and funds ""Civil Society"" groups to mobilize

Step Two: When an opportunity arises, U.S. trained activists go into action

Step Three: The State Department, and their proxies, actively support the opposition

Step Four: Infiltrate the government with hand-picked ""Civil Society"" leaders

He then pulled up a leaked document written by George Soros that characterized it as the ""comprehensive strategy for the new Ukraine"" and appears to outline the four steps above as having been taken in Ukraine.

"Glenn Beck announces rescue of Afghan soccer players targeted by Taliban, says State Department 'blocked' flight plans","Editor's note: This story has been edited to correct several details that were inadvertently reported incorrectly due to confusion and hasty communication from teams on the ground. We regret any errors in the original version of this story.



Glenn Beck announced Sunday the secure passage of nearly 100 people who were being held at the Mazar-i-Sharif airport in northern Afghanistan.

The group of people rescued includes 32 Afghan women's youth national football team, FIFA registered.

Beck explained on ""The Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Monday the girls who were rescued were at high risk to be exploited during the ongoing crisis caused by the Taliban takeover. The women and their families were placed in safe houses before being evacuated from Kabul and transported to the the Mazar-i-Sharif airport.

The Nazarene Fund, supported by thousands of generous Americans, worked together with DeliverFund, a nonprofit organization that combats human trafficking, and other private charities to secure the rescue of the vulnerable Afghans. Beck said Kam Air, the largest private airline in Afghanistan, helped, as did Ukraine, which secured planes permitted to land in the West.

How did it happen?

According to Beck, Pakistani Prime Minster Imran Khan helped make the rescue operation a success. Beck personally reached out to Khan, who responded ""with determination and without hesitation.""

Beck explained:

[Khan's] leadership of placing humanity before politics is a great example of inter-faith cooperation between the faiths, bridged by the shared value of human compassion. Prime Minister Khan's tireless leadership, supported by the military and civilian resources of Pakistan and their ability to cooperate with the Taliban, has enabled the first of 2 flights to depart Mazar I Sharif with FIFA female athletes and their families on board, in keeping with their unequivocal pledge to allow civilian allies of NATO forces to depart safely if they wished to.

Khan, in fact, advocated on behalf of the passengers to secure their safe passage beyond Taliban checkpoints.

What role did the US government play?

According to Beck, U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Daniel Rosenblum threw a wrench in rescue efforts when he ""blocked"" the planes from landing in nearby Uzbekistan. Rosenblum's decision forced rescue organizers to alter their plans.

""We had it ready, last week. We were going to Uzbekistan. And they blocked us,"" Beck explained, later adding, ""It was astounding. And it was ready — it was literally within three hours to go, and the ambassador from the United States to Uzbekistan said, 'You can't let that happen. You can't let these planes land.' And so they called it off.""

Ultimately, safe passage was secured via alternative means, and the planes eventually landed safely in Portugal after making a brief stop in Georgia.

The government of Portugal announced the safe arrival of the refugees on Monday.

Rescue operations to evacuate Americans, religious minorities, persecuted minorities, and those being targeted by the Taliban will continue in the days and weeks to come, thanks to the generous supporters of the Nazarene Fund.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/glenn-beck-rescue-of-afghan-soccer-players-targeted-by-taliban,2021-09-20
Glenn Beck reveals audio from Ukraine that repudiates impeachment narrative,"BlazeTV host Glenn Beck revealed explosive new evidence that unravels the official story behind the accusations that led to the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

""You are not being told what is really going on in Ukraine,"" said Beck during a special program on BlazeTV Thursday.

Beck relayed how Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau Chief Artem Sytnik appeared to be caught on audio bragging that he had helped Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.



A quote from former Ukrainian state prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko explains the importance of the Sytnik recording.

""I don't know how, but the Americans got an audio recording of Mr. Sytnik's conversation,"" Lutsenko says. ""He is resting with his family and friends and discussing how he would like to help Hillary.""

In the video played by Beck, Director Sytnik is heard speaking about the election and claiming that the Russians helped Trump.

""Yep. I helped him, too. Not him, but Hillary. I helped her,"" Sytnik says, according to a translation.

""While Hillary... she is — how shall I put it?"" he continued later in the recording. ""She belongs to the cohort of politicians who comprise the hegemony in the U.S. Both in the U.S. and in the entire world. Right. For us it is... sort of... better. For the Americans.... what Trump is doing is better for them.""

Sytnik also says that he made public the records that helped send Paul Manafort, the former campaign manager for the Trump campaign, to prison.

The audio was leaked to the Ukrainian press in October 2017 by Borislav Rosenblat, a Ukrainian member of parliament, but was not picked up by any mainstream media in the U.S.

Beck said that supporting documents for the audio will be available to the public on Friday morning.

UPDATE: Following the special, Glenn Beck released the documents and other source material that went into making his report. You can find them at GlennBeck.com.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/glenn-beck-reveals-bombshell-ukraine-audio,2019-10-04
Glenn Beck unveils money laundering scheme linked to Hunter Biden and Burisma,"In a Thursday night special, BlazeTV host Glenn Beck laid out the evidence implicating a possible international money laundering scheme linked to Ukrainian gas firm Burisma and former Burisma board member Hunter Biden.

The links provided by Beck show that $1.8 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars sent to Ukraine during the Obama administration is unaccounted for — and raises the question: Why hasn't Congress launched an investigation into how those funds were spent?

What are the details?

During the special, Beck explained that in 2014, $23 million was sent to a bank in London via wire transfer by Mykola Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma. British authorities immediately froze the accounts and began tracing the funds back to their origins.

According to Beck, the evidence suggests that the money had been laundered through the minimally regulated Latvian banking system and transferred into an array of shell companies.

""Not only did Biden not seem to care about his new company being investigated for stealing and laundering money,"" Beck said, ""he also apparently didn't mind that the primary owner of Burisma [Valeriyovych Kolomoyskyi] was on a U.S. visa ban list for — get this — murders and beheadings.""

A few weeks after Burisma was implicated in a money laundering ring, Hunter Biden became a board member, and within a few months, then-Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry lobbied for $1.8 billion to be delivered into PrivatBank — which was owned by Kolomoyskyi and became Ukraine's state bank.



That $1.8 billion is still missing and could have gone anywhere — possibly into Kolomoyskyi's own pocket, or possibly spent in whole or in part to bankroll Ukraine's war with Russia, given that the oligarch was known for ""bankrolling"" the conflict. But if the funds were used to fund a war with Russia, those taxpayer dollars were not authorized by Congress.

The International Monetary Fund has also been investigating corruption and money laundering in Ukraine, and in 2016, the Ukrainian government finally seized PrivatBank from Kolomoyskyi for enriching himself off of IMF loans.

On September 10, 2019, the IMF informed the White House Budget Office that there was an ""obligating event"" that needed to occur in order for Ukraine to receive further IMF funds.



On Sept. 11, police special forces raided PrivatBank, seizing documents and evidence needed to investigate the scheme. The same day, President Donald Trump released military aid to Ukraine.



""Trump wanted a public announcement of 'investigations,' and everyone assumed that he meant an interview on CNN,"" Beck said. ""I'd say a special forces daylight raid on Ukraine's biggest and most corrupt bank is one hell of a public announcement.""

Economic experts expect the global economy to worsen,"Global stock markets are expected to continue hemorrhaging money as more heavy selling continues this summer while central banks around the world hike interest rates to try and combat spiraling inflation.

Brunello Rosa, the CEO and head of research at the financial consultant firm Rosa & Roubini, believes that central banks around the world are going to continue monetary tightening while markets continue to spiral downward, CNBC reported.

Rosa said, “Now it’s time for a reappreciation of the economic fundamentals around the world in terms of growth. It’s hard for markets to be totally optimistic when inflation is going up, growth is going down, and interest rates are rising fast across the globe.”

This past Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,000 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 5%. This 5% decrease erased all the gains from a short-lived rally the day before when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would be raising interest rates. The short-lived rally was spurred on by investor optimism that the Federal Reserve hadn’t implemented a larger rate hike, but this optimism quickly gave way to fears of subsequent smaller rate hikes throughout the coming months.

Rosa suggested that investors initially were optimistic about the news of a 75 basis point hike being off the table but that the fact that there remains a strong possibility of several 50 basis point increases throughout the next months spooked investors.

Rosa said, “It’s clear that all of them [central banks] are talking tough at this stage. But the reality is that lots of tightening will eventually lead to economic contraction.”

He also suggested that most European governments and the U.S. are naïve to continue suggesting that economic shrinkage is avoidable.

He said, “In the eurozone and in the U.S. they are nowhere near realizing that actually there will be some form of contraction of economic activity.”

Rosa said that he expects the Russian invasion in Ukraine to last far longer than many investors are anticipating, which will continue to exasperate ongoing supply chain disruptions and inflation while adding fuel to the fire of rising interest rates.

Stoxx 600, a pan-European market index, fell 1% on Friday morning on the heels of Wall Street’s Thursday sell-off. Stoxx 600 is down more than 11% so far this year. In Asia, Hong Kong’s HangSeng index dropped 3.81% and in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite fell by 2.16% while the Shenzhen Component lost 2.14% of its value.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/global-recession-america-inflation,2022-05-07
Republican senators demand Biden send fighter jets to Ukraine: 'Enough talk. People are dying.',"A group of Republican Senators demanded that President Joe Biden follow through with a Polish plan to supply fighter jets to Ukraine as they try to fend off an invasion by Russia.

Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Joni Ernst of Iowa joined 40 other Republican senators who signed a letter calling on Biden to expedite the transfer of jets in order to ""prevent a brutal and unlawful takeover of Ukraine.""

The debacle began when the U.S. encouraged NATO allies to supply Ukraine with fighter jets and said that they were working with Poland to do just that. Poland surprised the U.S. with a plan to deliver a fleet of MIG-29 jets to the U.S. in the hopes they would deliver them to Ukraine. The Biden administration balked at the plan and then rejected the idea altogether.

“We need to be careful about every decision we make so that we aren’t making the potential for escalation worse,” explained Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby Wednesday.

Romney and Ernst decried the refusal in a media briefing Thursday.

""We had a hearing this morning with the Foreign Relations Committee. Chairman Menendez said the same thing, Senator Shaheen said the same thing. Democrats are saying the same thing: Send these MiGs. And the question is, why aren’t they being sent?"" asked Romney.

The administration faced vociferous criticism from both sides of the aisle over the failure to orchestrate the handoff.

""Enough talk. People are dying. Send them the planes that they need. They say they need MiGs. People say, well maybe that’s not the ideal weapon for them. That is what they say they want. They are there. They have the eyes to determine what they want,"" Romney continued.

""They want MiGs,"" he concluded. ""Get them the MiGs.""

Newly elected GOP 'Freedom Force' unites to fight socialism and the 'Squad',"Four incoming Republican members of Congress with personal experiences with communist or socialist countries are teaming up to form a ""Freedom Force"" to stand up to the radical left, and they want more members of the freshman class of lawmakers to join them.

Reps.-elect Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.), Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.), Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), and Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.) are positioning themselves to be a ""conservative counterweight"" to the democratic socialist ""Squad"" and its ringleader, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), according to a Politico profile of the newly elected GOPers. These representatives, who will be sworn into office on Jan. 3, bonded during orientation over their shared experiences with socialist countries, pledging to unite to fight big government here in the U.S.

""It was a natural alliance that formed. … We understand what it's like in other countries. We understand how truly special this nation is,"" Malliotakis, whose mother is from Cuba, said. ""And we look forward to working together to push back on anyone who tries to bring a socialist agenda to America.""

Gimenez, 66, is an immigrant from Cuba who fled to the United States as a child, around the time of the communist revolution led by Fidel Castro. Salazar, another Cuban-American, is a former TV journalist for the Spanish-language network Telemundo and the daughter of Cuban exiles. Both Republicans campaigned heavily on opposing socialism, messages that resonated with Hispanic voters and helped them each defeat Democratic incumbents.

Spartz is a Ukrainian-American who immigrated to the U.S. in 2000 at age 22 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006. When she was born in Ukraine in 1978, the country was still under communist control and did not gain independence until 1991, when she was 13. Spartz will be the first immigrant member of Congress from the former Soviet Union.

These four are joined by other freshman Republicans, including Reps.-elect Young Kim and Michelle Steel, Korean immigrants who will represent districts in California. Steel tells stories about how her parents escaped Korea and fled to Japan before the communist takeover of the northern part of the country.

Malliotakis explained to Politico that she and other Republicans want young people to understand the dangers posed by socialist ideology.

""We want to make sure, particularly young people, understand that socialism is not something grand,"" she said.

This newly elected generation of Republicans comprises historic numbers of women and minorities joining the lawmaking body and leveraging social media to galvanize their supporters and establish their brands.

Politico credited Ocasio-Cortez with inspiring this new style of transparent, ""pull-back-the-curtain style of politics"":

Many members of the GOP Force — who, like the Squad, are mostly young and female — have even adopted Ocasio-Cortez's pull-back-the-curtain style of politics. Ocasio-Cortez is known to post videos as she preps meals while casually discussing legislation coming to the floor.



Mace recently documented her journey through freshman orientation, which included getting lost in the Capitol building and racing across the campus. Salazar, who is credited with coining the Force moniker, posted a picture of the female group members with the caption: ""We're all working moms & we're a true FORCE to be reckoned with!""



And earlier this summer, Salazar, a former broadcast journalist for Telemundo,got nearly 600,000 views on a Twitter video in which she recorded herself in the Goya aisle of a grocery store blasting Ocasio-Cortez for pushing a boycott on the company for its leadership's support for Trump.



""I want to be different. I don't want it to be the same old, same old. This is a new Republican Party,"" said Rep.-elect Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), who made history as the first woman to graduate from the Citadel. ""We have to be different if we want to survive and be successful in the long term.""

Asked what she thought of ""the Force,"" Ocasio-Cortez told Politico, ""Imitation is a high form of flattery, right? So, I'm glad they think that way of me.""

GOP launches voter registration drive at gas stations as fuel prices reach historic highs: 'Biden and the Democrats do not care',"Are you upset about historic gas prices under President Joe Biden? If so, the Republican National Committee hopes you join the party — at the very location of your gas price-related frustration.

What is the RNC doing?

The RNC is capitalizing on historic fuel prices by launching a new voter registration program targeting gas stations nationwide.

Over the weekend, the RNC held voter registration drives at gas stations in Arizona. The party will expand its campaign to other states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin in the coming weeks, The Hill reported.

""Under Joe Biden, families are paying more for gas than ever before,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.

""After killing American energy independence, Biden is turning to our adversaries abroad for America’s energy needs,"" she added. ""American families are feeling the pain at the pump, and Biden and the Democrats do not care and are making it worse.""

Gas prices hit a historic high on March 11 when the average price of gas in America reached $4.33 per gallon. The price has dropped about 10 cents from its high to $4.24 per gallon as of Tuesday, according to AAA.

Gas prices have climbed for two years straight after reaching historic lows at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average price of gas in 2020 — former President Donald Trump's last year in office — was $2.18 per gallon. Prices rose under Biden to an average $3.02 per gallon in 2021.

What is the background?

Whether or not Biden's administration is fully to blame for historic gas prices, the narrative from the administration is certainly playing into the hands of Republicans.

Case in point: The administration has abdicated any responsibility for historic fuel prices, looking toward anyone and everything else to blame for economic woes.

Last year, Biden blamed growing economic problems — like inflation and high gas prices — on the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain problems. Now, the administration is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, some Democrats are even targeting oil companies, while climate groups hope Democrats exploit the moment to further demonize the oil industry as greedy profiteers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-launches-voter-registration-drive-at-gas-stations,2022-03-22
GOP memo outlines 'four key pieces of evidence' that are 'fatal' to the Democrats' impeachment allegations,"In a staff memo circulated to GOP committee members Monday night, House Republicans outlined ""four key pieces of evidence"" that they believe are ""fatal"" to the Democrats' allegations of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

The memo, written by top Republicans from three committees involved in the impeachment investigation, also excoriated Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for improperly conducting the inquiry from his ""Capitol basement bunker.""

""The fact-finding is all unclassified, so the closed-door process is purely for information control,"" the memo said. ""This arrangement has allowed Chairman Schiff — who has already publicly fabricated evidence and misled Americans about his interactions with the anonymous whistleblower — to selectively leak cherry-picked information to help paint misleading public narratives while, at the same time, placing a gag order on Republican Members.""

With the inquiry now moving to public hearings, the Republican memo was designed to update members on key points of evidence learned to date from the closed-door testimonies.

According to the memo, the four key pieces of evidence go as follows:

● The July 25 call summary — the best evidence of the conversation — shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure;



● President Zelensky and President Trump have both said there was no pressure on the call;



● The Ukrainian government was not aware of a hold on U.S. security assistance at the time of the July 25 call; and



● President Trump met with President Zelensky and U.S. security assistance flowed to Ukraine in September 2019 — both of which occurred without Ukraine investigating President Trump's political rivals.

In a section titled, ""Background,"" the memo sought to provide context to accurately ""asses the President's state of mind"" during his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The memo writers argued that ""Trump had a deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid"" due to its ""history of pervasive corruption"" which operated ""independent of and preceding any mention"" of Ukraine's alleged 2016 election interference and Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma.

An Axios report suggests ""the memo fails to consider counterarguments that Democratic members have been making in the media for weeks"" such as reports that top officials involved in Ukraine policy, Bill Taylor and EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, ""were under the impression that there was a quid pro quo involving the aid.""

"GOP seeks Hunter Biden as impeachment witness, but Adam Schiff already signals plan to block 'sham' request","House Republicans will seek the testimony of Hunter Biden, the government whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Donald Trump, and a range of other witnesses in the upcoming public impeachment hearings that begin next week, Fox News reported.

In addition to Biden and the whistleblower, the GOP will call on:

Devon Archer, the longtime business partner of Hunter Biden

U.S Ambassador Kurt Volker

Nellie Ohr, a former contractor for opposition research firm Fusion GPS

Tim Morrison, the former top presidential advisor on Russia and Europe on the National Security Council

David Hale, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs

Alexandra Chalupa, former Democratic National Committee staffer

""All individuals"" whom the whistleblower ""replied upon"" in drafting ""his or her secondhand complaint""

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, announced the list of witnesses in a letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) Saturday morning. Schiff has been tasked with leading the impeachment inquiry proceedings.

""Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite the Democrats' efforts to retroactively legitimize it last week,"" Nunes wrote in his letter.

""Because the Democrats' resolution unfairly restricts Minority rights and because you have provided no information about which witnesses you may invite to testify at future hearings not yet scheduled, we reserve our right to request additional witnesses, if necessary, as you announce additional hearings,"" he added. ""Your failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process.""

The impeachment resolution passed last week requires that Schiff and the Democratic majority approve all Republican witness requests. That means, essentially, that Schiff has sole power over who will testify during the public hearings.

In response, Schiff issued a statement Saturday saying that he would consider the GOP's list — but that he would not continue ""sham"" investigations into the Biden's, the Washington Examiner reported.

Schiff's statement is a signal that he will reject the GOP's witness to call Hunter Biden as a witness when the public hearings begin next Wednesday.

""This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President's effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,"" Schiff said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-seeks-hunter-biden-whistleblower-as-impeachment-witnesses-and-president-trump-adds-his-suggestions,2019-11-09
"GOP Sen. Grassley splits with President Trump, calls for whistleblower to be protected","While President Donald Trump has been casting aspersions on the whistleblower who alleged misconduct by the president regarding Ukraine, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has come to the whistleblower's defense, Politico reported.

Trump has repeatedly called for an opportunity to find out who the whistleblower is, meet them, and even interview them, about the complaint, which contains second-hand information and media reporting. But Grassley said the whistleblower deserves protection.

""This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers,"" Grassley said. ""Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim's credibility.""

Grassley has long been passionate and active in preserving whistleblower protections, and this situation is no different in his opinion. He urged patience and caution in moving forward and called for stakeholders to follow up on the facts before rejecting the complaint.

""...the distinctions being drawn between first- and second-hand knowledge aren't legal ones ... No one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts,"" Grassley said.

Meanwhile, President Trump has suggested that the whistleblower is a spy who should face severe punishment for his or her actions.

""In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the 'whistleblower,'"" Trump said. ""Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!""

The whistleblower complaint, as well as a transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, is being used by Democrats as evidence that the president has abused the office of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to investigate a political opponent — potential grounds for impeachment. Most Republicans in Congress aren't buying it, though.



""I don't see any evidence yet of any crime. Or any evidence approaching a crime. If there is any evidence or if there are any actual facts to that effect, I hope somebody will come forward with them. But we have right now is a bunch of speculation,"" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said. ""We do have the transcript. It's the only actual hard piece of data that we've got. It doesn't show a crime.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-sen-grassley-splits-with-trump-calls-for-whistleblower-to-be-protected,2019-10-01
GOP Senate chairman readies first congressional subpoena for Biden-Burisma probe,"Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is gearing up to issue the panel's first subpoena in its efforts to investigate corruption questions surrounding Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that formerly employed Hunter Biden as a board member.

In a letter to his colleagues Sunday, Johnson said he planned to hold a committee meeting to issue a subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian diplomat who also used to work for the public firm, Blue Star Strategies, as a consultant. Johnson noted that committee ranking member Gary Peters (D-Mich.) disapproved of issuing the subpoena.

""Blue Star, a U.S.-based government and public affairs firm founded by Karen Tramontano (former deputy chief of staff to President Clinton) and Sally Painter (a former senior adviser for the Clinton administration), was a U.S. representative for a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings,"" the letter explained. ""As part of the Committee's ongoing investigation, it has received U.S. government records indicating that Blue Star sought to leverage Hunter Biden's role as a board member of Burisma to gain access to, and potentially influence matters at, the State Department.""

Blaze Media obtained a copy of the letter, which was first reported by CBS on Monday.



In November, Johnson — along with GOP Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (Iowa) — sent a letter to the State Department requesting records in an effort to ""better understand what actions, if any, the Obama administration took to ensure that policy decisions relating to Ukraine and Burisma were not improperly influenced by the employment and financial interests of family members."" That letter pointed to a news report that Tramontano tried to set up a meeting with an Obama State Department official in March 2016.

While the joint November letter says it was ""unclear"" if the 2016 meeting ever happened, the senators added that ""later that month Tramontano and other members of Burisma's legal team reportedly met with Ukrainian prosecutors.""

In his Sunday letter, Johnson said that the committee has received some records from Blue Star and from Telizhenko, but that the supplied information is not enough.



""Although Mr. Telizhenko expressed his willingness to 'cooperate fully' with our investigation, he identified a limited subset of relevant records from his work with Blue Star that are responsive, but subject to a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) in his employment contract,"" Johnson's letter said. ""In other words, he cannot provide this responsive information unless he is compelled to do so by subpoena.""

Johnson also told his colleagues that Blue Star has not provided the relevant information and has told the committee ""that they will not be producing any more documents,"" despite being informed that the committee considers their response incomplete.

""In fact, although the Committee asked Blue Star twice to identify its employees and contractors who worked on the Burisma matter, it never identified Mr. Telizhenko,"" the letter continued. ""Because Mr. Telizhenko's records and information would be responsive to the Committee's requests, and Blue Star has refused to produce them, a subpoena to Mr. Telizhenko for these records is appropriate at this time.""

It isn't clear precisely what kind of work Telizhenko did for Blue Star or what he would have known about the company's efforts on behalf of Burisma. However, his name has also come up in other Ukraine-related stories. He helped President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani with efforts to look into the Bidens and Burisma; he also told Politico in 2017 that — while working at the Ukrianian Embassy during the 2016 campaign — he was instructed to assist then-DNC contractor Alexandra Chalupa with efforts to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign.

In order to issue the subpoena, Johnson would need the support of a simple majority from the Republican-controlled committee. He is one of a trio of Senate committee chairman who have been looking into questions surrounding Hunter Biden's Ukrainian Business dealings since last year. The other two include Grassley and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

"GOP senator prepares subpoenas for Adam Schiff, whistleblower, and the Bidens to testify in Senate trial","Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is preparing to file subpoena requests for multiple new witnesses to testify in President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial.

According to Politico, Hawley is targeting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and the Ukraine whistleblower, among others.

""I have drafted motions to subpoena Adam Schiff, the 'whistleblower,' Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden to testify. If the Senate calls witnesses, I will ask for votes on all these next week,"" Hawley announced on Twitter.

From Politico:



Hawley's strategy harmonizes with plans from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky to force votes to hear from Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.



Their tactics are intended to convince a handful of senators to sink a vote next week to consider new evidence in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the heart of the impeachment case against the president.

If Hawley is able to issue the subpoenas, he would also seek communications related to Schiff and his staff, the whistleblower, the House impeachment managers, and Joe Biden's admitted effort to oust a former top Ukrainian prosecutor, among other communications.

Hawley needs just a simple majority vote to seek the evidence and issue the subpoenas. The tactic would also undercut the Democratic narrative that Republicans are unwilling to consider new evidence and witnesses during Trump's Senate trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-senator-prepares-subpoenas-for-adam-schiff-whistleblower-and-the-bidens-to-testify-in-senate-trial,2020-01-26
"GOP senator questions impeachment witness' motives, defends Trump's Ukraine actions in letter to Intel Committee","Republican Sen. Ron Johnson (Wis.) submitted a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday in which he questioned the motives of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an impeachment inquiry witness, and backed up the president's reason for delaying security aid to Ukraine.

Johnson has some firsthand knowledge of some of the subject matter pertinent to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry; he is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he attended Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky's inauguration.

The senator referred to a comment Vindman made during that trip, when the National Security Council official said that ""our relationship with Ukraine should be kept separate from our geopolitical competition with Russia,"" something Johnson viewed as impossible. It caused Johnson to question Vindman's support of the administration's policies.

""I do not know if Vindman accurately stated the NSC's position, whether President Trump shared that viewpoint, or whether Vindman was really just expressing his own view,"" Johnson wrote. ""I raise this point because I believe that a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style and his intrusion onto their 'turf.' They react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office. It is entirely possible that Vindman fits that profile.""

One of the major points of contention in the impeachment inquiry is a debate about why President Trump temporarily withheld security aid to Ukraine. He has said it was withheld over concerns about Ukrainian corruption and because other European countries were not contributing enough, while Democrats allege he wrongly used the aid to pressure Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for political reasons.

Johnson wrote that Trump's reasons were consistent.

""The president was not prepared to lift the hold, and he was consistent in the reasons he cited,"" Johnson wrote of an Aug. 31 conversation with Trump. ""He reminded me how thoroughly corrupt Ukraine was and again conveyed his frustration that Europe doesn't do its fair share of providing military aid.""

"GOP senator 'reluctantly' asked by House Republicans to give firsthand info on Trump, Ukraine for impeachment inquiry","Top House Republicans have requested information about President Donald Trump's Ukraine dealings from GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, according to a letter sent to the senator over the weekend, CNN reported.

The request came from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee.

""Accordingly, because the Democrats have abandoned fundamental fairness and objectivity in their 'impeachment inquiry,' we reluctantly write to request any firsthand information you have about President Trump's actions toward Ukraine between April and September 2019,"" the letter read.

Johnson said he does not expect to be called to testify before the intelligence committee, but he will provide written information detailing his knowledge of the subject being investigated for potential impeachment.



""They're not going to call me because certainly Adam Schiff wouldn't want to be called by the Senate,"" Johnson said on ""Meet the Press.""

""There's going to be a separation there, but I think I will reply to that and I will supply my telling of events which is difficult to do in eight to 10 minutes on a show like this.""

Johnson attended the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky with a delegation that included former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, EU ambassador Gordon Sondland, and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker. Johnson was also involved in a debriefing on Ukraine with the aforementioned officials and President Trump.

According to Johnson, Sondland told him that the president was making security aid to Ukraine conditional upon a public announcement of investigations by Ukraine. Johnson said he asked President Trump about the issue, and the president denied any such conditions.

""So, I'm the one that raised the issue from my phone call with Gordon Sondland the day before, where he described some type of— something that Ukraine had to do before President Trump would release the funding,"" Johnson told CNN. ""And when I brought up that scenario, President Trump immediately — and I have described as adamantly and vehemently — denied it.""

GOP senators ask State Dept for all records related to Hunter Biden,"Republican Sens. Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa) wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, requesting that the State Department release all records pertaining to the agency's interactions with Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration.

What are the details?

Sen. Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and Sen. Grassley, head of the Committee on Finance, asked for all information on interactions related to Hunter Biden, several of his business associates, and affiliated business ties including those with Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings, where he was a board member until this year.

The senators cited newly released State Department emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, that were published and reported on by investigative journalist John Solomon and showed numerous meetings were set up between individuals linked to Biden and Burisma with State Department officials during the Obama administration — when Biden's father, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, was vice president.

Johnson and Grassley wrote that they were seeking ""to better understand what actions, if any, the Obama administration took to ensure that policy decisions relating to Ukraine and Burisma were not improperly influenced by the employment and financial interests of family members.""

Anything else?

Hunter Biden's employment with Burisma during the time his father was the Obama administration's point man in Ukraine has fallen under greater scrutiny in recent months, after Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump for allegedly threatening to hold up aid to Ukraine unless a corruption investigation into Burisma was reopened.

The Ukrainian government launched a corruption probe into the gas firm in 2014, and former Vice President Biden boasted last year that he threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid from the country unless it fired the prosecutor investigating the allegations against his son's firm.

The Bidens have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the scandal, and President Trump has maintained his own innocence while insisting it is his responsibility to root out corruption from countries accepting U.S. assistance.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-senators-ask-state-dept-for-all-records-related-to-hunter-biden,2019-11-07
GOP senators formally ask Secret Service for records on Hunter Biden,"Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray on Wednesday, requesting the agency to provide details on Hunter Biden's use of government security and travel accommodations while conducting business deals during the time his father, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, was vice president.

What are the details?

Grassley is chairman of the Finance Committee, and Johnson heads the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. The committees are ""reviewing potential conflicts of interest posed"" by Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China and want to know whether or not those relationships were fostered on the public dime.

1. Please provide the protective detail that Hunter Biden received while his father was Vice President.



2. Please provide a list of all dates and locations of travel, international and domestic, for Hunter Biden while he received a protective detail. In your response, please note whether his travel was on Air Force One or Two, or other government aircraft, as applicable and whether additional family members were present for each trip.

The GOP senators requested that the Secret Service:

The Daily Wire noted that the letter from Grassley and Johnson was sent ""immediately following President Donald Trump's acquittal in the Senate on Wednesday."" The chairmen asked that Director Murray provide the records no later than Feb. 19.

Anything else?

The Senate Finance Committee and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee have been investigating Biden's foreign business dealings for months, after the impeachment probe against President Donald Trump exposed Biden's contracts with firms in China and Ukraine — where his father represented the United States under the Obama administration.

In their letter Wednesday, Grassley and Johnson wrote that as part of their inquiry, the two committees have already written ""several letters"" to ""other agencies,"" and ""the Committee on Finance also has written to the Department of Treasury regarding potential conflicts of interest"" involving Rosemont Seneca Partners, a company co-founded by Biden and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry.

GOP to Biden: Release transcripts of your calls with Ukrainian and Chinese leaders,"The Republican National Committee presented a challenge to Joe Biden on Tuesday, after the Democratic presidential candidate called for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

Earlier in the day, the president announced that he would release the full transcript of a call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, following an anonymous whistleblower's allegations of impropriety during the conversation.

RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel then called on the former vice president to release the transcripts of his own conversations with Ukrainian and Chinese leaders.

McDaniel issued a statement, saying:

Once again, Joe Biden has shown he is just as extreme as the rest of the 2020 Democrats who are desperate to bring President Trump down. Instead of backing a baseless impeachment effort, Biden should be answering for the only scandal that exists: Why a corrupt Ukrainian company paid his son $50,000 a month to lobby the Obama-Biden administration, and why Biden threatened the Ukrainians if they failed to fire a prosecutor investigating the company.



Now that the President has authorized the release of the transcript of his call with President Zelensky, we call on Biden to release the transcripts of his calls as Vice President with Ukrainian and Chinese leaders while his son was conducting shady business deals in those countries.

The Hill reported that President Trump has denied there was any discussion of a quid pro quo with Zelensky, while ""Republicans have long questioned Biden's push as vice president in 2016 for Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating a natural gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch and whose board members included Biden's son Hunter Biden.""

Trey Gowdy says Adam Schiff's bias may doom Democrats' Ukraine investigation,"Former congressman Trey Gowdy opined that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has threatened the Democratic investigation into the Ukraine whistleblower accusations because of his bias.

Gowdy was speaking to Martha MacCallum on her Fox News show on Friday about the Ukraine debacle.



MacCallum asked him to comment on the Washington Post fact checker slapping Schiff with ""four Pinocchios,"" the greatest rating they have for an egregious lie.

""I think he got four only because you can't get five!"" he joked.

""I mean he got the maximum sentence you can get from the Washington Post fact checker, and don't you know how hard that was for the Washington Post to give Adam Schiff four pinnochios!"" he added.

""He's also a career offender, Martha, he's the same guy who had the parody, a week or so ago, the same guy that says he has evidence that even Mueller couldn't find,"" Gowdy said.

Schiff was criticized for clearly saying that he had not met with the whistleblower before the accusations came to light, but later admitted that they had come in contact.

""The question I have is how long is [House] Speaker Pelosi (D-Calif.) gonna put up with Adam mishandling this investigation? She's already taken it away from [Rep.] Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.),"" Gowdy continued. ""But if you're gonna do it, at least don't screw it up, Adam!""

Gowdy said that he hoped the Republicans make Schiff testify about his part in bringing the claims from the whistleblower to light.

""Bias kills investigations!"" Gowdy continued.

""And for anyone who wondered whether or not Adam Schiff could be objective, and dispassionate, I never wondered that, but if any of your viewers did, now you know he makes up facts and openings, and he lies about meetings with the whistleblower, when the truth would have served him just fine!"" Gowdy said.

""He just decided to lie about it!"" he concluded.

Lindsey Graham says Democrats threatened to pull aid from Ukraine to pressure them to investigate Trump,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) accused Democrats of threatening to pull aid from Ukraine unless they investigated President Donald Trump in 2018.

The admission came during an interview on Fox News with Martha MacCallum as he defended the president from accusations of impropriety related to a call he made with the Ukrainian president.

MacCallum asked Graham if the quote of the president from the transcript troubled him at all.

""It troubles me that Joe Biden the Vice President of the United States, threatened to cut aid to the Ukraine without disclosing that conflict,"" responded Graham.

""There was a letter by Democratic senators in May 2018 threatening to cut off the aid to the Ukraine if they did not investigate Trump!"" he added. ""You're gonna hear a lot more about this conflict.""

Graham also defended the president from conclusions that his critics reached about an alleged quid pro quo in the transcript of his phone call to the Ukrainian president.

""Read this transcript, no rational person would conclude that the president of the United States was threatening to cut off aid to the Ukraine unless they did something against Joe Biden and his son,"" Graham explained.

""The truth of the matter is, there was a conflict regarding to the firing of the prosecutor, and if it had been a Republican who had done this, it would have been front page news all over the world!"" he concluded.

Democrats have rallied around the accusations from the call with the Ukrainian president in order to bolster their campaign to impeach Trump.

Graham predicts enough GOP votes to call both Bidens and the whistleblower in Senate trial,"If the United States Senate decides to call further witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, they're going to get a lot of them, says a GOP senator who also predicts there will be enough Republican votes to call former Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and the CIA whistleblower to testify.

""If people want witnesses, we're going to get a lot of witnesses. This idea of calling one and one makes zero sense to me,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned Tuesday in reference to the possibility of a witness trade-off between Democrats and Republicans.

""I'll make a prediction,"" Graham said. ""There will be 51 Republican votes to call Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the whistleblower and the DNC staffer at a very minimum.""

""The DNC staffer"" was an apparent reference to Alexandra Chalupa, the former DNC contractor at the center of questions about whether or not the committee colluded with Ukrainian officials in 2016.

Graham made the remarks while briefing reporters in the basement of the U.S. Capitol before the trial resumed Tuesday, against a backdrop of new questions about whether or not the chamber would call former national security adviser John Bolton to testify following reports of allegations contained in a manuscript of his forthcoming book.

As to the allegations reportedly contained in Bolton's manuscript, Graham said that he's read the New York Times' story, saying he had ""no idea what they're talking about."" However, he supported what he called a ""reasonable solution"" proposed by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) to allow senators to read the manuscript's contents in a classified setting.

But Graham also said that he was ""comfortable with the idea I have enough,"" and would make his ultimate decision later in the trial.



""The House chose not to pursue witnesses that were available to them,"" Graham also pointed out, saying that he didn't ""want to start a precedent of just doing half-ass in the House and expecting the Senate to fix it.""

And if a majority of the chamber decides to bring in Bolton or others as witnesses, they're also going to end up looking into the questions about Ukrainian corruption at the center of the impeachment debate and that Democrats have repeatedly tried to dismiss as meritless.

""If we're going to open this up to additional inquiry, we're going to go down the road"" of whether it was ""legitimate for the president to believe there was corruption and conflicts of interest on the Bidens' part in the Ukraine,"" Graham said. ""We'll explore that and whether or not there's any credibility to the idea that the DNC may have been working with the Ukraine.""



Graham also told reporters ""it would have been wrong for President Trump not to raise this issue"" of alleged Biden-Ukraine corruption, and that ""you have to be willfully blind and say that Democratic misconduct doesn't matter to you not to believe that the president had a good reason to ask the Ukraine to look into the Biden affair.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/graham-predicts-enough-gop-votes-to-call-both-bidens-and-the-whistleblower-in-senate-trial,2020-01-28
Debunked ‘by who’? Graham pushes back on Democrats' talking points about Biden-Ukraine allegations in impeachment trial,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pushed back against Democrats' claims that the concerns of corruption surrounding the Bidens and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma have somehow been debunked, despite a number of questions that still remain unanswered.

""I don't know how many times it was said by the managers that the Biden conflict-of-interest allegations has been debunked and has been, there's no scintilla of evidence in terms of conflicts of interest and potential wrongdoing,"" Graham told reporters on Thursday.

""I know a lot about the Trump family and their dealings in Russia,"" the senator continued. ""I don't know anything about the Biden connection to the Ukraine. So when the managers tell me this has been looked at and debunked — by who?""

In a break from the trial the day before, Graham tweeted critically about impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) claiming that the Biden-Burisma concerns had been debunked.

Graham explained that the issue was ""becoming relevant"" amid the Senate's trial because the House impeachment managers ""talked about it almost 50 times that the president had no reason to believe that anything improper occurred in the Ukraine with the Bidens and he was just out to create a political advantage.""

Graham questioned whether or not those talking points would hold up to scrutiny.

""The point of fact is that nobody, particularly in your business, has done much looking at what happened in the Ukraine with Hunter Biden,"" Graham said to the media, adding that they would ""hear more about that and I'll tell you more tomorrow.""

Graham then went through a brief chronology of events in the Ukraine, which included the timeline of how Hunter Biden came to work as a board member at Burisma while his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was handling Ukraine policy for the Obama administration, and how a top prosecutor investigating the case was fired. In 2018, the elder Biden described how he pressured the former Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor.

The series of events ""doesn't pass the smell test to me"" Graham said. ""Why are you paying Hunter Biden? You can say they're corrupt, but they're not stupid.""

Graham explained that he made the remarks in order to get the public ""to understand that the claims they're making — that there's no 'there' there in the Bidens"" that ""nobody's looked; somebody should.""

Graham — who heads up the Senate Judiciary Committee — is one of a trio of Senate committee chairman who have been looking into the questions of Hunter Biden's Ukrainian business dealings since late last year.

And after looking into the matter himself, the South Carolina senator said that he has ""a lot of questions."" For example, ""Were they buying insurance by hiring Hunter Biden? Because they sure as hell weren't buying expertise.""



However, despite his stated desire to get to the bottom of what really went on in the Biden-Burisma matter, Graham said he would not vote to call Hunter Biden as an impeachment trial witness.

""There are a bunch of people on my side who want to call Joe Biden and Hunter Biden"" to testify in the trial, Graham said. ""I want to end this thing sooner rather than later; I don't want to turn it into a circus.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/graham-pushes-back-on-democrats-talking-points-about-biden-ukraine-allegations,2020-01-23
Lindsey Graham responds to Joe Biden’s warning: Hunter’s Burisma employment ‘doesn’t pass the smell test’,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has no intention of backing off his efforts to get to the bottom of questions about former Vice President Joe Biden, his son, Hunter, and the Ukrainian natural gas company that employed the latter on its board for tens of thousands of dollars per month, at least according to a statement Graham made on Monday.

On Friday, Joe Biden, a current presidential candidate, said that he was ""angered"" and ""disappointed"" that Graham — his former Senate colleague — would be looking into his interactions with the Ukrainian government while his son was sitting on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.

""Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life,"" the 2020 Democratic candidate told CNN. When asked if wanted to say anything directly to Graham, Biden responded, ""I say Lindsay, I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing. For you!""

Graham, however, made it clear that he was going to continue looking into the matter in a tweet sent Monday morning, which said, ""I love Joe Biden as a person but we are not going to give a pass to what is obviously a conflict of interest.

""I believe Hunter Biden's association on the Burisma board doesn't pass the smell test,"" Graham added. ""If a Republican was in the same position, they'd certainly be investigated!""

Questions about Hunter Biden's employment on Burisma's board and Joe Biden's influence on the firing of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company have been at the center of the Ukrainian controversy and subsequent impeachment fervor that has dominated things in Washington over the past few months.

Graham, who asked the State Department for documents and records related to Burisma and the Bidens on Thursday, is the third Senate committee chairman to start looking into the matter, behind Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who asked the State Department for records regarding the matter weeks ago.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/graham-responds-to-bidens-warning-hunters-burisma-employment-doesnt-pass-the-smell-test,2019-11-25
Great Barrier Reef records highest coral cover,"Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is flourishing despite previous reports sounding the alarm about the looming extinction of Australia's natural wonder.

According to new findings reported on Thursday, a majority of the thriving Great Barrier Reef boasted the highest coral cover ever recorded. Two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef had the largest amount of coral cover in the 36 years that it has been monitored.

The northern and central areas of the Great Barrier reef experienced growth, according to surveys conducted between August 2021 and May 2022 by the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. The northern section soared from an all-time low of 13% coral coverage in 2017 to 36% in the most recent report. The central region jumped from a low of 12% in 2019 to 33% coverage in the latest AIMS annual report.

The coral coverage in the southern section fell by 4% – from 38% in the previous year to 34% in the latest report. The environmental experts believe the decrease stems from outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish.

AIMS considers a hard coral cover of more than 30% as ""high value.""

AIMS CEO Paul Hardisty downplayed the positive news in a statement: ""This shows how vulnerable the Reef is to the continued acute and severe disturbances that are occurring more often and are longer-lasting.""

“Every summer the Reef is at risk of temperature stress, bleaching and potentially mortality and our understanding of how the ecosystem responds to that is still developing,"" Hardisty said.

""What we're seeing is that the Great Barrier Reef is still a resilient system. It still maintains that ability to recover from disturbances,"" AIMS Long-Term Monitoring Program leader Mike Emslie told Reuters, but he cautioned, ""But the worrying thing is that the frequency of these disturbance events are increasing, particularly the mass coral bleaching events.""

For nearly 40 years, AIMS has examined the status of the Great Barrier Reef through its Long-Term Monitoring Program – which claims to have conducted the ""most comprehensive and extensive record of coral status on any reef ecosystem in the world."" Each year, marine scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences survey between 80 and 130 reefs on the GBR.



Despite the promising report from the respected environmental organization, it wasn't long ago that there were experts claiming that the Great Barrier Reef could soon die off completely.



The New York Times has published several articles foretelling doomsday scenarios for the Great Barrier Reef.

In December 2016, the Times ran an article titled: ""The Great and Dying Barrier Reef.""

In March 2017, the outlet said, ""Large Sections of Australia's Great Reef Are Now Dead.""

In April 2018, the New York Times published an article titled: ""Damage to Great Barrier Reef From Global Warming Is Irreversible, Scientists Say.""

The Washington Post also claimed that climate change was killing the Great Barrier Reef, and it ""might never recover.""

In April 2019, the paper declared, ""The Great Barrier Reef is being battered by climate change, it might only get worse.""

In October 2020, the Washington Post published an article titled: ""Half of the Great Barrier Reef's coral is gone. It might never recover.""

Just in March, the Washington Post reported, ""Climate warming deals yet another blow to the Great Barrier.""

PBS News Hour featured a segment in March 2017 titled: ""Climate change is killing the Great Barrier Reef.""

In November 2020, Business Insider asserted, ""Experts say the time to take action is now, and if nothing is done, this world wonder as we know it today could be gone by 2050.""

The website Outside wrote an obituary for the Great Barrier Reef in October 2016.

In March, UNESCO considered labeling the Reef as ""in danger"" after the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority reported ""low to moderate bleaching"" of the natural wonder. UNESCO confirmed that two scientists would examine the Reef for 10 days, according to The Guardian.

A World Heritage Committee meeting on determining the status of the Great Barrier Reef was scheduled to happen in June in Russia, but it was postponed after the invasion of Ukraine.

The Great Barrier Reef was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1981.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/great-barrier-reef-coral-cover-record,2022-08-05
"US gov't censored TikTok content by leveraging threats to ban platform after accusing China, Russia of similar Big Tech tyranny: Glenn Greenwald","On Wednesday, independent journalist Glenn Greenwald published an article blasting the United States government for hypocritically pressuring TikTok to censor and shut down content that dissented from the establishment narrative after accusing China, Russia, and Iran of similar tyrannical offenses.



Greenwald's article, ""Reflecting New U.S. Control of TikTok's Censorship, Our Report Criticizing Zelensky Was Deleted,"" argued that U.S. officials and legacy media allies drastically changed their coverage of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after Russia invaded.

According to the report, TikTok removed a video posted by Greenwald that discussed how the corporate media went from negatively covering Zelenskyy before the war to portraying him in a positive light after Russia invaded Ukraine.

""When we learned it was TikTok - rather than FB or Google - that censored our critical report on Zelensky, we were surprised since China has no interest in shielding Zelensky's image,"" Greenwald stated. ""Once we learned the US Security State has commandeered this censorship power, it made sense.""

He noted that the video was not critical of Zelenskyy but discussed how the U.S. government and its media allies changed coverage.

On Twitter, Greenwald posted the video from his show, ""System Update,"" which was banned on TikTok.

""One of the most remarkable features of the Ukraine war is how the media rewrote years of history, almost overnight, to support U.S. intervention in Ukraine,"" the post stated. ""Before Russia invaded, Zelensky was not exactly the poster child for virtuous democratic leadership.""

""For years, U.S. officials and their media allies accused Russia, China, and Iran of tyranny for demanding censorship as a condition for Big Tech access,"" Greenwald wrote. ""Now, the U.S. is doing the same to TikTok.""

He noted that China is often accused of forcing Big Tech to bend to its censorship demands. For instance, in 2018, leaked Google documents revealed that the company was prepared to create a censored version of its search engine to comply with the Chinese Communist Party's requests. Additionally, in 2016, Facebook set out to enter the Chinese market by creating software to suppress certain posts. Facebook has also previously complied with demands from Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey to restrict content.

According to Greenwald's report, the United States government has participated in similar tyrannical censorship practices with TikTok.

""The U.S. national security state has leveraged threats to ban TikTok from the U.S. entirely into concessions that they, rather than TikTok's Chinese owners, will now make 'content moderation' decisions for the platform, thus leaving TikTok now in the same bucket along with Google, Meta, and Apple as massive companies subject to the censorship directives of the U.S. government,"" stated Greenwald.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/greenwald-us-govt-censors-tiktok-accusing-russia-china,2022-12-29
Ground beef and chicken prices reach all-time highs just before Memorial Day,"Ground beef and chicken breasts are more expensive than ever before and with all-time high prices that leave consumers with few alternatives some people may experience a meatless Memorial Day this upcoming Monday.

Bloomberg reported that ground beef and chicken are now retailing at historic highs of just under $5 per pound and over $4 per pound respectively. With Memorial Day serving as the unofficial start to the outdoor grilling season some grill enthusiasts might opt to order pizzas for the holiday instead.

The price spikes in meat come as inflation, in general, continues to spiral out of control, but in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine agricultural products are experiencing additional price hikes. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stalled crop exports in the Black Sea which has increased the global costs of animal feed.

Even the price for propane — which is essential for many grill owners to cook meat — has soared.

Michal Nepveux, a senior analyst of animal protein commodities at the risk-management firm Stable USA, said, “The inflationary environment is starting to take its toll. Instead of steak or chicken, we might have pasta or a pizza.”

The seemingly unending rise in inflation is having a considerable impact on how many Americans feel about President Joe Biden’s job performance.

According to a recent poll published by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research only 39% of adults in the U.S. approve of Biden’s performance as president.

Overall, only about two in ten adults believe the U.S. is headed in the right direction or that the economy is in a good condition. As Americans grow increasingly frustrated with record high gas prices and historic levels of inflation, Biden’s approval continues to plummet. Notably, his approval among Democrats is also starting to slip.

Biden’s approval among registered Democrats currently sits at 73% which is down from 82% last year.

Only 18% of Americans believe that Biden’s policies have helped the economy more than they have hurt it.

Small business owners — who employ large swaths of the American population — are also feeling increasingly pessimistic about the economy. 57% of small business owners said that they predicted the U.S. economy will continue to worsen into the next year.

As inflation continues to cut into the profit margins of small businesses, the number of small business owners that are expecting their revenues to increase in the coming year dropped to 61% marking a steep decline from May 2020’s level of 79%.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ground-beef-and-chicken-prices-reach-all-time-highs-just-before-memorial-day,2022-05-28
Hershey warns of Halloween candy shortage,"The Hershey Company – the fifth-biggest candy company in the world in 2021 – is sounding the alarm that they will experience a Halloween candy shortage this year.

The Hershey Company warned that it would not be able to supply enough candy for Halloween and the Christmas holiday season. The candy company blamed a scarcity of raw ingredients on the insufficient supply.

Reuters reported, ""Pandemic-induced global supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war have crunched supplies of cocoa, edible oil, and other food ingredients, pinching production lines of packaged food companies around the world.""

Hershey Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said on Thursday, ""We will not be able to fully meet consumer demand due to capacity constraints.""

Buck said that the company sources a great deal of its equipment and supplies from Europe – which has faced an economic downturn because of its reliance on energy from Russia. The invasion of Ukraine has also put a strain on getting products such as cocoa and edible oil.

Buck also noted that despite the candy shortage, the company expects sales to top last year still.



""Historically, Hershey's sales growth has been driven by higher prices and not necessarily volume ... The company is entering this period from a position of strength with that expertise,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.



The Hershey Company saw its net sales rise more than 19% in the second quarter – raking in $2.37 billion compared to estimates of $2.22 billion.

The Halloween season is Hershey's best-selling time of the year – comprising approximately 10% of the company's annual sales.

The 128-year-old company manufactures some of the most beloved Halloween candy – including Hershey's Chocolate Bars, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Kit Kats, Mounds, Good & Plenty, Bubble Yum, Twizzlers, Jolly Ranchers, Whatchamacallits, Milk Duds, 5th Avenue, and Hershey's Kisses.



On Thursday, food behemoth Nestle said it raised prices by 6.5% in the first half of 2022 because of an ""unprecedented"" rise in costs.

Nestle – the world's largest food company – hiked up prices in North America by 9.8%.

Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said, ""We limited the impact of unprecedented inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints on our margin development through disciplined cost control and operational efficiencies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/halloween-candy-shortage-food-hershey,2022-07-31
"Harvard Law prof suggests Tucker Carlson, 'Trump media' guilty of treason — then deletes tweets after backlash begins","Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe was forced on Monday to delete suggestions that Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the ""Trump wing"" of the Republican Party are guilty of treason against the United States.

What did Tribe say?

""Led by Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson, the GOP's Trump wing appears to be throwing its weight behind [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. If Putin opts to wage war on our ally, Ukraine, such 'aide and comfort' to an 'enemy' would appear to become 'treason' as defined by Article III of the U.S. Constitution,"" Tribe tweeted Monday morning.

Upon receiving pushback, Tribe claimed he was not using the word ""treason"" in a literal manner, and said ""treason prosecutions should be off the table"" because the U.S. is not at war with Russia.

""I'm persuaded by those who thought I meant to be using the word 'treason' literally — despite my use of the phrase 'would appear to be' — that I should've been more careful: Because we're not at war with Russia, treason prosecutions should be off the table,"" Tribe said. ""Sorry if I mislead you.""

Carlson's critics have accused him in recent weeks of being a stooge for Russia, and even charged that he promoted pro-Russia propaganda.

In reality, Carlson appears to oppose U.S. intervention in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Dismissing Russia's aggressive war build-up and opposing U.S. intervention is not, of course, the same thing as being a pawn for the Kremlin.

What about treason?

Tribe's tweets immediately generated backlash online precisely because the Constitution's treason clause is meant to protect individuals from shallow accusations of treason like the one Tribe floated.

Conservative lawyer David French described Tribe's suggestion as ""completely false"" that is ""not even in the same ballpark as the truth""; lawyer Harmeet Dhillon said that Tribe ""is often wrong, but rarely is he this risible""; First Amendment lawyer Adam Steinbaugh condemned the suggestion of treason, and instructed Tribe to ""please leave these tropes in the past where they belong.""

Here is what the Constitution's treason clause in Article III says:

Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.



The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.

Ironically, the treason clause was designed to protect American citizens from the exact shallow accusations that Tribe put forward.

Constitutional scholars Paul Crane and Deborah Pearlstein explain the treason clause was designed to ""guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition. Debate surrounding the Clause at the Constitutional Convention thus focused on ways to narrowly define the offense, and to protect against false or flimsy prosecutions.""

Because of the Constitution's high standard for treason convictions — along with increased standards determined by subsequent Supreme Court cases — the federal government has never executed an American citizen for treason under Article III.

However, William Bruce Mumford was executed for treason in 1862 — after he tore down an American flag and replaced it with a Confederate flag — but his execution was carried out under provisions of Martial Law, not the Constitution.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harvard-law-prof-suggests-tucker-carlson-trump-media-guilty-of-treason,2022-02-21
"'Hearsay can be much better evidence than direct,' Dem claims during impeachment hearing","Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Illinois) raised eyebrows when he defended the testimony of House Democrats' ""witnesses"" during the first day of public impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump on Wednesday, arguing that ""hearsay can be much better evidence than direct.""

What are the details?

After questioning Deputy Asst. Secretary of State George Kent and Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor — neither of whom directly heard the conversations on which they testified — Quigley offered what he called ""a primer on hearsay.""

""I think the American public needs to be reminded that countless people have been convicted on hearsay,"" the Democrat said. ""Because the courts have routinely allowed and created needed exceptions to hearsay. Hearsay can be much better evidence than direct as we have learned in painful instances, and it's certainly valid in this instance.""



Rep. Quigley claims that hearsay can be better than direct evidence youtu.be

Republicans disagreed. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (La.) asked on Twitter, ""In what universe is hearsay better than direct evidence?"" calling the hearing ""a total sham.""

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted, ""Both of the Democrats' star witnesses just admitted that they were NOT on the July 25th call between Presidents Trump and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky. Everything they are saying today is 2nd or 3rd or 4th-hand knowledge.""

McCarthy added, ""Democrats are trying to impeach the president based on a game of telephone.""



Anything else?

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also expressed frustration during the hearing that the so-called ""whistleblower,"" who he referred to as ""the guy who started it all,"" would not be called before Congress to testify.

In a snarky response, Democratic Rep. Peter Welch (Vt.) seized on the moment, telling Jordan, ""I'd be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify,"" adding, ""President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there.""

Heartbreaking text messages between slain Russian soldier and his mother revealed by Ukrainian ambassador: 'I'm afraid',"Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, revealed Monday heartbreaking text messages between a Russian soldier and his mother that were obtained from the soldier's smartphone after he died in combat.

What are the details?

While speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, Kyslytsya presented screenshots of the messages that he said were from the slain Russian soldier and his mother just moments before the soldier died.

""I would like to read from this screenshot of the smartphone of a killed Russian soldier. It’s an actual screenshot from someone who is dead already,” Kyslytsya said before reading the exchange in Russian.

The mother: ""Why has it been so long since you responded. Are you really in training exercises?”

""Why has it been so long since you responded. Are you really in training exercises?” The soldier: ""Mom, I’m no longer in Crimea. I’m not in training sessions.”

""Mom, I’m no longer in Crimea. I’m not in training sessions.” The mother: ""Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel.""

""Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel."" The soldier: ""What kind of a parcel, Mama, can you send me? I just want to hang myself now.""

""What kind of a parcel, Mama, can you send me? I just want to hang myself now."" The mother: ""What are you talking about? What happened?""

""What are you talking about? What happened?"" The soldier: ""Mama, I’m in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I’m afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians. We were told that they would welcome us and they are falling under our armored vehicles, throwing themselves under the wheels and not allowing us to pass. They call us fascists. Mama, this is so hard.""

The text messages are further evidence that Russian soldiers were unaware they were being mobilized in preparation for war against Ukraine.

Over the weekend, a viral video showed captured Russian solders telling their Ukrainian captors that they were told by their commanders they were going to Ukraine for training missions, but felt ""cheated"" when they were ordered to engage in war.

""We were told we were being sent for training at first, but we were put on the frontline,"" one Russian soldier said. ""We do not want this war. We just want to go home and we want peace.""

Another captured Russian said, ""They told us that everything would be fine. We knew nothing. We were deceived and abandoned.""

Anything else?

During his U.N. speech, Kyslytsya also called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to kill himself like Adolf Hitler did in May 1945. Kyslytsya's remarks came after Putin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert, which Kyslytsya implied meant Putin is ready to die.

""Following Putin’s order to put in alert Russian nuclear forces— what a madness,"" Kyslytsya said. ""If he wants to kill himself, he doesn’t need to use nuclear arsenal. He has to do what the guy in Berlin did in a bunker in May 1945.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/heartbreaking-text-messages-between-slain-russian-soldier-and-his-mother-revealed-by-ukrainian-ambassador-i-m-afraid,2022-03-01
Hillary Clinton calls not divorcing Bill the 'gutsiest' thing she's ever done,"Hillary Clinton is making the rounds in the public eye recently, as she does from time to time, and during an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" she shocked the host and her daughter with a candid answer about her marriage.

Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, are promoting a project titled, ""The Book of Gutsy Women."" So ABC News anchor Amy Robach closed out the interview with a simple question: ""What's the gutsiest thing you've ever done?""

""Ah, boy, I think the gutsiest thing I've ever done — well, personally, make the decision to stay in my marriage,"" Clinton answered. ""Publicly, politically, run for president. And keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.""

It was a notably authentic-sounding answer from a longtime politician with a reputation for being inauthentic — and even Chelsea was thrown off by the blunt reply, and stumbled a bit over her own answer.

""Oh, goodness, I think I'm so overwhelmed by my mother's answer that I'm a bit out of words,"" Chelsea said.

Hillary and Chelsea Clinton talk the 'The Book of Gutsy Women' l GMA youtu.be

Some might argue that Clinton's decision to stay with her husband Bill despite his public and repeated infidelity was more of a political calculation than a gutsy move, but that is debatable.

Clinton, of course, has weighed in on the the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump, having called him a ""corrupt human tornado"" on Twitter and telling GMA that the evidence against Trump regarding Ukraine is ""dramatic"" and ""irrefutable.""

The book they're promoting includes portraits of heroic and accomplished women.



""To us, they are all gutsy women — leaders with the courage to stand up to the status quo, ask hard questions, and get the job done,"" Chelsea Clinton said in a statement about the project. ""So in the moments when the long haul seems awfully long, we hope you will draw strength from these stories.""

"Hillary Clinton says the election isn't about disagreement, it's about the 'rise of authoritarianism' and a 'direct attack' on democracy","Hillary Clinton characterized the 2024 election as not of one between two parties disagreeing about policy, but about the ""rise of authoritarianism"" and a ""direct attack"" on democracy.

Clinton made the comments at the end of an interview with PBS published Friday when asked to address the very bad forecasts for Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections.

""I think it depends upon, you know, number one, whether Democrats are willing to point out the extremism that has captured the Republican party,"" said Clinton.



""And to make it clear, this is not about special interest groups, this is not about one group of Americans versus another, this is about the rise of authoritarianism within our own country,"" she claimed.

""This is a direct attack on our democracy,"" Clinton concluded. ""So if Democrats are willing, you know, not only to address the issues that are kitchen table issues, which we do pretty well, but also to raise some of the concerns about what kind of country we're going to have, I think that we can do better than is predicted.""

Clinton suffered a legal defeat when a judge ruled in favor of a request from U.S. special counsel John Durham to have some Hillary Clinton-Fusion GPS documents revealed in court that were previously protected by attorney-client privilege.

Elsewhere in the interview, Clinton said that the conservative justices on the court had suffered a ""brain change"" about whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion decision, had enough precedent to continue in force.

She also claimed that the campaign to end abortion rights by overturning Roe v. Wade was motivated on the part of Republicans by a desire to institute a patriarchal form of government on the U.S.

Hillary Clinton sells 'But her emails' merch after FBI raids Trump for allegedly mishandling classified information,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is trolling Donald Trump and his supporters after news broke that the FBI raided Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

Clinton, who for years faced allegations that she illegally mishandled classified documents on a private email server, took to Twitter to hawk ""But her emails"" hats and T-shirts after it was reported that the FBI raid was part of an investigation into former President Donald Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents.

""Every 'But her emails' hat or shirt sold helps [Onward Together] partners defend democracy, build a progressive bench, and fight for our values,"" Clinton tweeted Tuesday. ""Just saying!""

While serving as secretary of state in the Obama administration, Clinton caused controversy by using a private email server hosted at her New York residence for official government communications, in potential violation of federal record-keeping law. She exchanged more than 60,000 emails on this private server, communicating with top aides including Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, and Sidney Blumenthal.

A 2016 FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices found that more than 100 emails stored on her private server contained classified information, including 65 emails investigators determined were ""Secret"" and 22 deemed ""Top Secret."" Another 2,100 emails were retroactively deemed to contain classified information and were censored or withheld completely from public release by the State Department.

Clinton's apparent mishandling of classified information became a major point of contention in the 2016 presidential election. Trump vigorously attacked Clinton over her emails, while the Clinton campaign insisted she had violated no laws and that the entire issue was a distraction. Clinton in turn attacked Trump over his alleged cooperation with Russia to win the election. As it turned out, Trump was also under FBI investigation based on opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign that was later debunked.



On July 5, 2016, FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI had completed its investigation and that his recommendation to the Justice Department would be ""that no charges are appropriate in this case.""

""Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" Comey said. He also characterized Clinton's handling of classified information as ""extremely careless.""

State Department investigators later completed their own investigation and concluded that 38 people were ""culpable"" in 91 cases of sending classified information that wound up on Clinton's email server. A report released to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said that despite these violations, there was ""no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information."" However, it also noted that Clinton's use of a private email server increased the vulnerability of classified information.

Trump and many other Republicans have never forgiven the FBI and the Justice Department for declining to pursue charges against Clinton. The former president has repeatedly accused the Justice Department of holding one standard for Democrats and another for Republicans, asserting that the Russian collusion investigation and other law enforcement probes into his business dealings and conduct as president were politically motivated.

The ""But her emails"" phrase is used by Clinton supporters who accuse Trump supporters of whataboutism when it comes to the controversies surrounding Trump.

The FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago on Monday drew accusations from Trump that federal law enforcement has been ""weaponized"" by the Biden administration against its political opposition, as Trump is widely expected to challenge President Joe Biden in 2024.

Reports indicate the search and seizure were connected to records and classified documents that Trump allegedly had brought to Mar-a-Lago from the White House when he left office. The New York Times reported that Trump had delayed in returning 15 boxes of material requested by National Archives officials for months in a case that was referred to the Justice Department earlier this year.

The accusation that Trump mishandled classified documents has drawn comparisons to the accusations against Clinton's email conduct. The difference is that Clinton's private residence was never raided by the FBI.

"Hillary Clinton takes shot at Trump, GOP over Russia — and even invokes treason clause in Constitution","Hillary Clinton just cannot resist.

The twice-failed presidential candidate made reference to the Constitution's treason clause on Friday while implicitly condemning former President Donald Trump and parts of the Republican Party that she alleged have emboldened Russia's aggression.

What is the background?

During a radio interview this week, Trump described Russian President Vladimir Putin as ""very savvy."" He also described Putin's decision to declare the independence of two Ukrainian regions as ""genius."" And regarding the ""peacekeepers"" — which were Russian soldiers — that Putin sent into those eastern Ukrainian regions, Trump said, ""we could use that on our southern border.""

Meanwhile, Russian-state media have reportedly used comments from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Fox News host Tucker Carlson for their propaganda purposes.

What did Clinton say?



Speaking on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Clinton referred to Trump's comments and said that any American who parrots talking points worthy of being broadcast by Russian propaganda outlets must be called out.

""We have to also make sure that within our own country we are calling out those people who are giving aid and comfort to Vladimir Putin, who are talking about what a genius he is, what a smart move it is, who are unfortunately being broadcast by Russian media, not only inside Russia, but in Europe to demonstrate the division within our own country,"" Clinton said.



Clinton's comments implicitly invoked the Constitution's ""treason clause,"" which is found in Article III, Section 3:

Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.



The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.

Hillary Clinton: What's Left Of The GOP Must Stand Against Those Giving 'Aid' To Putin www.youtube.com

Later in the interview, Clinton described rhetoric from Trump and other Republican figureheads as ""heartbreaking"" and ""dangerous,"" and she repeated the accusation that they are giving ""aid and comfort"" to Putin.

""I think it’s time for what’s left of the Republican Party that has any common sense not just to say, 'OK, go help defend Ukraine against Putin,' but to stand against those people in politics and government, in the media and elsewhere in our own country who are literally giving aid and comfort to an enemy of freedom and democracy,"" Clinton said.

Such rhetoric, Clinton claimed, emboldens not only Putin, but also Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""It can’t continue because it plays right into the ambitions of not just Putin, but also President Xi of China to undermine democracy, to literally divide and conquer the West without ever invading us, but by setting us against each other,"" Clinton said.

Clinton attributed the development of the problem that she identified as happening because ""starting with ascent of Trump, there has been, sadly, a total loss of spine and conscience of too many Republicans.""

""There is also another element. These people are naive in such a dangerous way,"" Clinton continued. ""I think the naiveté that we saw starting with Trump but which has now been accelerated is really hard to understand. But we have to deal with it, and we have to call it out.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-takes-shot-at-trump-gop-over-russia-and-even-invokes-treason-clause-in-constitution,2022-02-25

In a Monday op-ed published in the New York Times, Levy explained that she was relatively active for an 87-year-old woman in New York.



""These days, I'm a little bored,"" Levy writes. ""The boardwalk is my lifesaver. I'm two blocks from the boardwalk. I can walk to Coney Island if I want to. I go alone. I have some friends here. We used to play canasta once a week. But when Covid arrived, my daughter insisted, 'You can't sit in one room!' So I talk on the phone. I read. The grandkids call in by Zoom. I also do a little bit of Zoom lecturing for the Museum of Jewish Heritage.""

In the op-ed, Levy says that she's busy keeping herself busy these days, and is ""trying not to give up."" It's becoming harder and harder, however, because she has faced the fact that she has essentially lost a year of her life.

""[T]his bothers me terribly,"" Levy admits. ""I'm 87 years old, and I lost almost a full year.""



Levy continues, pointing out just how much time she lost as a child in Chodorow, Poland (which is now Khodoriv, Ukraine) amid the height of the Holocaust. She recalled her family going into hiding and relocations to avoid being picked up by Nazis.

""[M]y father built a place to hide in the cellar,"" Levy recalls. ""My grandfather didn't want to go. He was shot in the kitchen; we heard it.""

Levy says that she and her family later spent time with a family friend who housed them in a barn on her property.

""My father built a wall inside the barn and a hiding place for nine people, where we slept like herrings,"" she recalls. ""It was just four feet by five feet. Pigs and chickens were on one side, and we were on the other: my parents, my aunt and uncle, my maternal grandmother, and four children, ages 4, 6, 8, and 12.""

Levy says that even though the family lived and slept among lice and rats, every day outside Nazi capture was a miracle.

""I'm not a regular person. I'm a miracle child. Most of the Jews of Chodorow never returned,"" she reveals. ""So when the coronavirus came, I thought, 'I'm a miracle. I will make it. I have to make it.'""

Levy has made it this far and says that she has more hope for the future when compared to how she felt during the war.

""During the war, we didn't know if we would make a day. I didn't have any freedom. I couldn't speak loudly, I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry,"" she writes. ""But now, I can feel freedom. I stay by the window and look out. The first thing I do in the morning is look out and see the world. I am alive. I have food, I go out, I go for walks, I do some shopping. And I remember: No one wants to kill me. So, still, I read. I cook a little bit. I shop a little bit. I learned the computer. I do puzzles.""

What now?

Levy says that despite having her life, she does still feel like she is missing out on her final years.

""A full year is gone. I lost my childhood, I never had my teenage years. And now, in my old age, this is shortening my life by a year,"" she continues. ""I don't have that many years left. The way we have lived this year means I have lost many opportunities to lecture, to tell more people my story, to let them see me and know the Holocaust happened to a real person, who stands in front of them today. It's important.""



Levy says that though she sometimes feels trapped, she hopes to outlive the pandemic and is making plans for the rest of her life.

""I understand the fear people have, and I understand you have to take care,"" she concludes. ""But there is no comparison of anxiety, of the coronavirus, to the terror I felt when I was a child. That was a fear with no boundary. This is going to end, and I am already thinking, planning where I am going first, what I will do first, when this ends.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/holocaust-survivor-covid-final-years,2021-01-04
Harrowing video captures moment Ukrainian nuclear plant employees plead with Russian soldiers: 'Stop shooting! You are endangering the security of the entire world!',"New video from inside Ukraine's Russian-controlled nuclear power plant showed the moment Ukraine employees began pleading with Russian invaders to ""stop shooting.""

On Friday, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted that Russia's shelling of a nuclear plant is a war crime. Fortunately, contrary to initial reports released during the fog of war, no reactors were hit during the attack and authorities stated that there was ultimately no risk of a radiation leak.

What are the details?

Following an attack, Russia began occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, and according to a report from CNN, management at the Zaporizhzhia is ""now working at gunpoint.""

CNN on Saturday aired disturbing footage taken from inside the plant.

CNN ""New Day Weekend"" co-anchor John Berman cued the video, telling viewers, ""We have new video from inside a nuclear power plant as it was under fire from the Russians, we told you about the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that broke out after this Russian attack. This is now a look inside the plant as those shots were being fired, employees using a public address system to try to stop the Russian troops.”

In the video, employees could be heard begging, ""Stop shooting! You are endangering the security of the entire world!""

Berman in the segment added that Russian troops are commencing an advance on Yuzhnoukrainsk Nuclear Power Station in Mykolaiv Oblast.

What else?

According to the report, Petro Kotin — head of state-owned nuclear power generator Energoatom — said that Russian forces ""entered the territory of the nuclear power plant"" and ""took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant.""

Kotin added that if the nuclear facility happened to be hit by shelling, it would surely lead to nuclear disaster.

A senior U.S. defense official on Friday told Fox News that Russia was likely seeking ""leverage"" over Ukraine’s civilian population by moving on the nuclear power sites.



""If your goal is to control population centers, if your goal is to supplant the government of Ukraine and replace it with one that that's more suitable to you, if your goal is to control Ukraine, one can surmise that you would want to control the infrastructure and to make sure that you can meter it to your needs,"" the defense official told the outlet in a statement. ""You can use your leverage in that regard to punish a population, to make it harder for that population to resist you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/horrific-video-captures-moment-russian-soldiers-storm-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-as-employees-plead-stop-shooting,2022-03-06
'Horses**t!' - John King is not happy about Devin Nunes' threat to CNN,"CNN host John King fired back at accusations from Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that he couldn't answer questions about his involvement with Ukraine because CNN is so biased.

Nunes was speaking to Maria Bartiromo on Sunday when he made the claims against CNN.

""Bottom line, were you in Vienna with Shokin?"" asked Bartiromo of claims that he had met with Ukraine's former Prosecutor General Victor Shokin in order to dig up political dirt on Joe Biden.

""Look Maria, I really want to answer all of these questions, and I promise I absolutely will come back on the show and answer the question, but because there is criminal activity here we're working with the appropriate law enforcement agency,"" Nunes responded.

""But I think you understand that I can't compete by trying to, trying to debate this out with the public media when 90 percent of the media is totally corrupt,"" he added.

""Forgive me, but horses**t,"" King responded.



""This is easy,"" he continued. ""This is easy. He was on a plane with staff that went somewhere during this time frame. There are either passports stamped or if they did it on a classified basis, there's a crew on the plane. There's the crew of his staff.""

King said Nunes could even force House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to look at his evidence and make a statement that the reporting was false.

""If it's demonstrably false, demonstrate it,"" King challenged Nunes.

Nunes has threatened to sue both CNN and the Daily Beast after Thanksgiving in federal court for reports that he said were false.

Pregnant woman and baby dead in wake of hospital bombing,"An injured pregnant woman who was evacuated last week after a maternity hospital was bombed in Ukraine has passed away, according to the Associated Press, which also reported that the woman's baby is dead.

Disturbing video footage shows the woman lying on the stretcher as people moved her in the wake of the attack.

Russia attacks Ukrainian hospital in Mariupol www.youtube.com





She was transported to a different hospital, the AP noted — realizing that she was losing her child, medics said that the woman declared, ""Kill me now!""

The AP reported that Dr. Timur Marin said that the mother had suffered a crushed pelvis and detached hip. The child was delivered through a cesarean section but manifested ""no signs of life,"" he noted. He said that ""more than 30 minutes of resuscitation of the mother didn’t produce results."" He said that, ""Both died.""

Another pregnant woman survived, but lost some toes due to the attack — she underwent a cesarean section, but the AP reported that her baby was alive.

The news comes as Russia wreaks death and destruction in Ukraine, a sovereign nation that has been fighting to defend itself during Russia's brutal onslaught.

Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was also injured while covering the events unfolding in Ukraine.

""Earlier today, our correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine,"" Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott noted in a statement on Monday. ""We have a minimal level of details right now, but Ben is hospitalized and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hospital-bombed-ukraine-pregnant-woman-dead,2022-03-15
House Appropriations Democrat threatens to withhold administration pay over ambassador’s canceled testimony,"A Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee has threatened to withhold executive branch pay over the canceled testimony of a United States diplomat amid the House's ongoing impeachment efforts.

Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump said that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland would not appear at a planned deposition that was part of House Democrats' ongoing impeachment efforts because he didn't want the official to be subject to a ""compromised kangaroo court.""

That afternoon, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claiming that the White House's decision violated federal law passed earlier this year and that whomever was responsible for it could have their pay withheld.

In the letter, Pocan sited a section of federal appropriations law passed in February that prohibits paying the salary of any ""officer or employee of the Federal Government who prohibits or prevents ... any other officer or employee of the Federal Government from ... communication or contact with any Member, committee, or subcommittee of the Congress.""



""I believe the person prohibiting Ambassador Sondland from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee is in violation of this statute, and that their salary should be withheld until Ambassador Sondland appears before Congress,"" wrote Pocan, who sits on three appropriations subcommittees.

""We refuse to bankroll this administration while they hold witnesses hostage. Sondland must testify on Ukraine,"" Pocan tweeted after sending the letter.



""Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,"" Sondland's attorney said in a statement, adding that the ambassador had agreed to testify voluntarily ""in order to answer the committee's questions on an expedited basis.""

As a sitting ambassador, the statement explained, Sondland is bound to State Department policy.

Later Tuesday morning, the Democratic chairmen of the committees that Sondland was scheduled to testify before responded to the administration's decision by announcing that they would subpoena Sondland ""for both his testimony and his documents.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-appropriations-democrat-withhold-administration-pay,2019-10-08
House Democrat declares it is 'un-American' to blame Biden for gas crisis: 'This is Putin's fault',"Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier claimed Monday that bucking the Biden administration's narrative on the intensifying gas price crisis is ""un-American.""

What is the narrative?

The Biden administration launched a full-court press last week blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for soaring gas prices and out-of-control inflation.

The problem, of course, is that inflation rates were already at historic highs and gas prices were already sky-high before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February.



What did Schrier say?

During an interview with journalist Brandi Kruse, the Washington Democrat regurgitated the Biden administration's talking points and charged that dissenters are ""un-American.""

""I believe a couple things: Right now, in the last two weeks, this is Putin. You should be blaming Putin if anybody for this,"" Schrier said. ""To not blame Putin, first of all, is denying reality, and second, frankly, I think is un-American.""

""So, this is Putin's fault,"" she declared.

Strangely, Schrier then immediately blamed the COVID-19 pandemic and supply problems — just as the Biden administration did before Putin invaded Ukraine.

""Before this because people were already suffering at the gas pump before this, right? We saw an increase of over $1/gallon over the past year and a half or so, that can be blamed realistically on— during the pandemic, when people were not going to work and driving was down, gas prices were down,"" she claimed. ""As demand increased and rigs had not yet been turned on, there was a supply-demand issue like with everything else in this country, and that was to blame.""

While Biden has abdicated any responsibility for the problem with gas prices and vulnerable Democratic lawmakers have indicated they will happily repeat Biden talking points, Biden recently bragged about dropping gas prices.

""I was able to bring it down 12 cents a gallon and will come down more, I believe,"" Biden said in December 2021.

The national average gas price as of Tuesday afternoon is $4.31 per gallon, according to AAA. That figure is down four cents from Monday, but still up since last week.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrat-declares-it-is-un-american-to-blame-biden-for-gas-crisis-this-is-putin-s-fault,2022-03-15
House Democrat floats wild conspiracy theory about President Trump and Russia that stuns CNN host,"Democratic Rep. Norma Torres (Calif.) floated a wild conspiracy theory on Friday, suggesting without evidence that President Donald Trump is acting as a ""handmaid"" to Russia because Russian President Vladimir Putin is blackmailing him.

""I am afraid that Vladimir Putin may have something on the president. And it is the reason why the president has continued to play the handmaid to Vladimir Putin, inviting him to the White House and opening the doors and not having any advisers present, taking the notes from the interpreter and continuing to talk to him and continuing to parrot everything that he tells him,"" Torres told CNN host Brianna Keilar.

""Russia is no friend of the U.S. They have never been a friend to us. They continue to compromise us internationally. They continue to attack our friends and our allies overseas. So, we have to be very careful, we have to keep a close eye on how this continues to evolve,"" Torres continued.

The Democratic lawmaker's suggestion left Keilar stunned.

""You said you think that Putin may have something, meaning compromising information, kompromat, as it's said in Russia, on President Trump? Do you have proof of that? Is there something specific that you're thinking of when you say that,"" the CNN host asked.

However, Torres did not provide evidence to back her claims. Instead, she claimed that ""there is no other reason why President Trump continues to capitulate to what Putin is telling him.""

""The fact that this President of the United States continues to depend on Russia to win the next election that he has coming, asking not only Russia, but asking Ukraine and China openly on TV to investigate his political opponents who could be challenging him, and who absolutely have an opportunity to win in this next election, I think is unconscionable,"" Torres said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrat-floats-wild-conspiracy-theory-about-president-trump-that-shocks-cnn-host,2019-12-21
House Democrats propose gas stimulus to slap bandage on rising prices,"House Democrats have put forward a bold new proposal to address inflating gas prices: Have the government spend more money.

Reps. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), John Larson (D-Ct.), and Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) have put forward the Gas Rebate Act of 2022, which they say will address rising energy prices by providing small stimulus checks to lower-income Americans.

The plan is to offer a rebate of $100 per month and $100 for each dependent for the rest of the year in any month where the national average price of gasoline is more than $4.00 per gallon.

“Americans are feeling the impact at the pump of Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and right now we must work together on commonsense policy solutions to ease the financial burden that my constituents are feeling,” Thompson said in a statement.

“The Putin Price Hike is putting strain on our economy, and I am proud to be working with Reps. Larson and Underwood to introduce this legislation to provide middle-class Americans with monthly payments to ease the financial burden of this global crises,"" he added.

The rebate payments are structured to phase out in the same manner as the COVID-19 stimulus payments. A single filer earning less than $75,000 would be eligible for the $100 rebate, which would be phased out to $80,000. Joint filers earning less than $150,000 can claim the $100 rebate, but the program is phased out at $160,000, according to a press release.

National gas prices reached record highs in March as inflation, increased demand for gasoline, constricted supply, and the war between Russian and Ukraine combined to push prices skyward. The national average price for a gallon of gas was $4.24 on Wednesday, according to the American Automobile Association. Gas is about six cents cheaper this week over last, as analysts predicted it would be after the price of crude oil declined last week. But experts say that as the weather improves in the spring and summer, gas prices could rise again because more Americans will be traveling.

In the meantime, prices are still high in various parts of the country. In Los Angeles, California, for instance, gas surged to an average of $6.00 for a regular gallon.

While Democrats blame Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine for the high prices, oil and gas industry representatives say President Joe Biden's policies are contributing too.

""Which is it? You can’t blame Putin and us at the same time. The bottom line is we are not price makers, we are price takers. We suffer from low prices and then we have higher prices. That is based on the price of oil globally,"" Western Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma said on Fox News Wednesday.

She said the industry ""would love to produce more [energy] in the United States and help to bring those prices down.""

Independent Petroleum Association of America Executive Vice President Dan Naatz added that fossil fuel energy companies are ""frustrated"" with the Biden administration's ""relentless assault"" on domestic oil and gas manufacturing.

""Increased regulations, talk of taxes, our members get frustrated when the administration, Jen Psaki just seem to say, now that we are facing an energy crisis, go out and produce like the snap of a finger. It is just not possible and as we face this relentless attack, we will have to do a lot of work. And you want to start a dialogue with the administration to address the challenges,"" he told Fox News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrats-propose-gas-stimulus-to-slap-band-aid-on-rising-prices,2022-03-23
House Democrats subpoena Rick Perry as part of impeachment inquiry,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry has now been pulled into the House Democrats' impeachment probe against President Donald Trump, as committee chairs subpoenaed Perry asking for a slew of documents Thursday.

What are the details?

Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent a letter to Perry along with a schedule of requested documents and communications related to the Energy Secretary's interactions with Ukrainian officials and an array of federal agencies.

""Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President's stark message to the Ukrainian President,"" the letter read. ""These reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to suppress Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani's push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.""

The impeachment probe was launched over allegations that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to press the country to re-open a corruption investigation into the business dealings of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The younger Biden has been accused of using his father's position as vice president to make lucrative deals with Ukrainian and Chinese firms.

Politico reported that ""earlier this week, Perry acknowledged asking Trump to make the July 25 phone call to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky that's at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.""

Perry denies ever bringing up the Bidens during his interactions with Ukrainian officials, telling the Christian Broadcasting Network, ""Not once, as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name — not the former vice president, not his son — ever mentioned.""

Perry was given a deadline of Oct. 18 to comply with the Democrats' requests.

Last week, several outlets reported that Secretary Perry is expected to step down from his post in the next month or so, but Perry himself has since denied that claim.

Anything else?

Engel, Schiff, and Cummings sent a similar request to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo two weeks ago, and since have also issued subpoenas to the White House and Vice President Mike Pence as part of their efforts to build a case against the president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrats-subpoena-rick-perry-as-part-of-impeachment-inquiry,2019-10-10
House Dems circulate talking points to combat GOP impeachment defense,"House Democrats wasted little time sending out an internal talking points memo to caucus members on Tuesday, laying out the response to Republicans' defense of President Donald Trump in the ongoing impeachment probe.

What are the details?

Monday night, top Republicans from three committees involved in the impeachment investigation sent out a staff memo detailing ""four key pieces of evidence"" that they believe dismantle Democrats' allegations against the president.

Democrats responded by sending out a memo of their own on Tuesday — on the eve of when public hearings in the probe are scheduled to begin — rebutting Republicans' arguments, The Hill reported.

While Republicans say the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky contains ""no conditionality or evidence of pressure,"" Democrats claim the call ""shows clear evidence of pressure and conditionality.""

Republicans point out that both Zelensky and President Trump have ""said there was no pressure on the call,"" but Democrats say ""Ukraine's president felt pressured.""

The GOP's position is that ""the Ukrainian government was not aware of a hold on U.S. security assistance at the time of the July 25 call,"" while Democrats argue ""Ukraine knew about the hold on security assistance before it became public.""

Finally, the GOP's memo states that ""President Trump met with President Zelensky and U.S. security assistance flowed to Ukraine in September 2019 — both of which occurred without Ukraine investigating President Trump's political rivals."" Democrats say ""security assistance flowed only after Congress intervened.""

The Democrats' memo goes on to further state that President Trump ""continued to withhold a White House meeting"" and argued that ""Ukraine is currently following Trump's order in reviewing past investigations.""

Democrats noted that those past investigations include looking into corruption allegations against Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas firm where Hunter Biden sat on the board until just this year. The final line in the memo states, ""There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Vice President Biden or his son.""

House Dems subpoena Mike Pompeo for Ukraine documents,"The House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Friday, requesting documentation relating to the Trump administration's interactions with the Ukrainian government.

What are the details?

Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent the letter to Pompeo as part of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In the subpoena notice, the chairmen accused the secretary of state of refusing to comply with previousrequests for the documentation, calling his actions ""troubling.""

""Your continued refusal to provide the requested documents not only prevents our Committees from fully investigating these matters, but impairs Congress' ability to fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to protect our national security and the integrity of our democracy,"" the letter reads.

The Representatives warned, ""Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry.""

The same lawmakers sent a second letter to Pompeo Friday, notifying him that five State Department officials have been slated to provide depositions between Oct. 2 and Oct. 10 as part of the impeachment inquiry.

The Hill reported that ""those officials are Marie 'Masha' Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; Kurt Volker, a former United Nations ambassador who is Trump's special representative for Ukraine negotiations; Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent; State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl; and Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union.""

Anything else?

Democrats launched their ""formal"" impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week, after months of pressure from the far-left facets of the party. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) agreed to pursue impeachment after an alleged whistleblower's complaint was exposed, accusing the president of improper conduct during a conversation with Zelensky.

House Dems subpoena Pentagon and White House Budget office of Ukraine aid amid impeachment probe,"The chairmen of three Democrat-led House committees have sent out a new batch of subpoenas to Trump administration officials as part of the ongoing impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump.

Monday's subpoenas went out to the Department of Defense's recently confirmed Secretary Mark Esper as well as White House Office of Management and Budget acting Director Russell Vought and are for documents related to Ukraine military aid. The legal demands were sent by the Democratic chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees — Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Elijah Cummings (Md.) and Elliot Engel (N.Y.), respectively.

""Pursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019,"" the chairmen wrote in letters to Esper and Vought.

The news release from the three top Democrats explains that the documents are necessary to evaluate ""the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security"" by withholding foreign aid and asking Ukrainian officials to look into the matter of a since-scuttled investigation of a company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter.

The release cites one story from the Washington Post and another from the New York Times that the funds were halted ahead of President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

According to the Times story, Trump ""personally ordered his staff to freeze more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine"" ahead of the phone call"" and ""issued his directive to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who conveyed it through the budget office to the Pentagon and the State Department, which were told only that the administration was looking at whether the spending was necessary,"" according to two administration officials.

""The enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the Committees to examine this sequence of these events,"" the chairmen wrote, ""and the reasons behind the White House's decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression.""



The subpoena schedule for Vought and Esper includes documents, meetings, and communications going back to Jan. 1, 2019.

In prepared congressional testimony given last week, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told Hill investigators that he became aware of a hold on financial assistance to the country about a week before the phone call ""and immediately tried to weigh in to reverse that position.""

However, he also testified, ""As I was confident the position would not stand, I did not discuss the hold with my Ukrainian counterparts until the matter became public in late August.""

""The issue of a hold placed on security assistance to Ukraine also came up during this same time I was connecting [a Zelensky aide] and [Trump's personal lawyer Rudy] Giuliani,"" the former envoy said elsewhere in the statement. ""I did not perceive these issues to be linked in any way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-dems-subpoena-pentagon-and-white-house-budget-office-of-ukraine-aid-amid-impeachment-probe,2019-10-07
House Intel Committee releases texts showing US and Ukrainian diplomats discussing Biden investigation,"The House Intelligence Committee released Thursday several pages of text messages between Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and Ukrainian officials.

The texts show that an official meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was offered on the condition that Zelensky's government agreed to investigate Ukrainian actions during the 2016 election in the U.S. and Burisma Holdings, the natural gas firm that employed Joe Biden's son, Hunter, on its board.



What did the committee say?

In a letter accompanying the texts, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) wrote that the texts ""reflect serious concerns raised by a State Department official about the detrimental effects of withholding critical military assistance from Ukraine, and the importance of setting up a meeting between President Trump and the Ukrainian President without further delay.""

What do the texts say?

In one text message from July 25, Volker told Zelensky adviser Andrey Yermak:

Good lunch - thanks. Heard from the White House -- assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate/ ""get to the bottom of what happened"" in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow- kurt

Two hours later, Yermak texted back:

Phone call went well. President Trump proposed to choose any convenient dates. President Zelenskiy chose 20, 21, 22 September for White house Visit. Thank you again for the help! Please remind Mr. Mayor [Giuliani] to share the Mardid's[SIC] dates [Giuliani was traveling to Madrid, Spain]

This at least implies that Trump considered a promise on an investigation by Ukraine into 2016 election interference as a prerequisite to giving the Ukrainian president face time.

Other texts showed that, speaking through U.S. and Ukrainian diplomats, Giuliani tried to get Zelensky to add a reference to Burisma and the 2016 election investigation into a planned statement on how the new Ukrainian government would fight corruption.

On Aug. 9, Volker texted U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland:

Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political process of the United States especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukraine politicians. I want to declare that this in unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 elections, which in turn will prevent a recurrence of this problem in the future.

According to CNN, the Ukrainians ultimately did not choose to add these references in the speech.

What else?

At least one U.S. official involved in these talks believed that there was a quid pro quo going on in which the U.S. would withhold aid from Ukraine if the Ukrainian government failed to investigate the 2016 election and Burisma. In an exchange from Sept. 1, senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor asked Sondland if the U.S. government was ""saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?""

On Sept. 9, Taylor repeated his concerns, telling Sondland that he thought it was ""crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""

This time, however, Sondland responded, ""Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-intel-committee-releases-texts-showing-us-and-ukrainian-diplomats-discussing-biden-investigation,2019-10-04
House Judiciary Committee approves articles of impeachment in pair of party-line votes,"The House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump in a pair of party-line votes on Friday morning.



One article of impeachment is for alleged abuse of power in his administration's interactions with Ukraine earlier this year, the other is for obstruction of Congress during the House's subsequent investigation into the Ukraine controversy. Both were introduced by House Democrats earlier this week.

The committee voted on each article of impeachment separately, passing each by a party-line vote of 23 to 17, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.

Friday morning's vote came after two days of heated committee deliberations over the articles, during which Republicans offered multiple amendments to the language, none of which were adopted.

Late Thursday night, committee chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) halted the proceedings and moved the vote to the following morning, saying that he wanted legislators ""to think about what has happened over these last two days and to search their consciences before we cast our final votes.""

Top committee Republican Doug Collins (Ga.) criticized the decision as a ""bush-league stunt,"" arguing that he and his colleagues weren't consulted about the change.

In brief remarks following the vote, Nadler said ""today is a solemn and sad day"" and that ""the House will act expeditiously"" on the matter.

In his own-post vote remarks, Collins criticized ""the folly of articles of impeachment that allege no crime and establish no case.""

""Today is a travesty for our country,"" Republican committee member Debbie Lesko said. ""Democrats are tearing our country apart with their sham impeachment, and they should be ashamed.""

The articles will now go to the full House of Representatives, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said that the House will vote on the issue ""next week.""

House Judiciary Committee's top Republican challenges Adam Schiff to testify on impeachment probe: 'Be the first witness',"If House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) wants to treat his impeachment proceedings as if he's a special counsel, then he should publicly testify like one when he's finished, says the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.

At a Thursday news conference following the House's mostly party-line vote on a resolution regarding the chamber's ongoing impeachment proceedings, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) issued the challenge.

Congressional Republicans have critiqued the clandestine nature of the current proceedings, arguing that the testimony from witnesses should be given publicly, rather than behind closed doors. However, those defending the current stage of the probe liken it to a grand jury or special counsel investigation.

""The special counsels in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments conducted their investigations in private and we must initially do the same,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to colleagues earlier this month.

""If he wants to be — as said — a special counsel ... then here's my challenge to Mr. Schiff,"" Collins said: ""You want to be Ken Starr? Then be Ken Starr.""

During the Clinton impeachment inquiry independent counsel Ken Starr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee in November 1998 and answered questions on his findings for severalhours.

""Come to the Judiciary Committee, be the first witness, and take every question asked of you,"" Collins challenged, ""Starting with your own involvement with the whistleblower.""

The language of the resolution passed Thursday allows for the impeachment matter to go to the Judiciary Committee at a later stage.

""Folks, this ain't over, get ready,"" Collins concluded. ""The cloud that is dropping will be dropping on [Democrats'] heads because process and substance will always win out in the end, and this president has nothing to worry about on substance.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-judiciary-top-republican-challenges-schiff-to-testify-on-impeachment-probe-be-the-first-witness,2019-10-31
House passes $1.5 trillion spending package,"Even as Americans continue suffering under the financial strain caused by high inflation, the House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a massive $1.5 trillion spending package.

The measure, which was passed in two votes, will head to the Senate.

The plan will fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. It will raise defense and nondefense spending as compared to the prior year. The package also includes funding related to Ukraine. It also contains earmarks for lawmakers in both parties.

Americans are suffering under the financial strain of rapidly skyrocketing gas prices, and the situation could get even worse in the days ahead.

President Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order banning the importation of Russian crude oil and other products, a move meant to turn up the heat on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The order prohibits importation of ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products"" from Russia.

Last month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the January consumer price index data that showed rapid price increases.

""The all items index rose 7.5 percent for the 12 months ending January, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending February 1982,"" BLS reported.

Hunter Biden admits he ‘probably’ wouldn’t have been on Burisma's board if his last name weren't Biden,"In a recent interview, Hunter Biden said that he probably wouldn't have been asked to be on the board of a Ukrainian energy company if not for his vice president father.

During the exclusive interview with ABC News — which aired Tuesday morning — Biden was asked about his involvement with the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, which is a major part of the Democrats' ongoing efforts to impeach President Donald Trump. House Democrats say the president inappropriately pressured the Ukraine government to investigate Biden and Burisma.

""If your last name wasn't Biden,"" ABC anchor Amy Robach asked, ""do you think you would've been asked to be on the board of Burisma?""

""I don't know. I don't know. Probably not,"" Biden responded in his Los Angeles home. ""I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden.""

Biden continued, ""Because my dad was vice president of the United States. There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that — my father in some way hasn't had influence over. It does not serve either one of us.""

Hunter Biden: Would “Probably Not"" Be On Any Foreign Company Boards If Joe Biden Not VP www.youtube.com

The 49-year-old Biden has faced criticism that he was asked to be on the board despite a notable lack of experience in the energy industry. Biden responded to those claims elsewhere in the interview, where he pointed to his experience as a board member at Amtrak, the quasi-public American train company, among other ventures.

""I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for five years,"" Biden said when Robach asked about his qualifications. ""I was the chairman of the board of the U.N. World Food Program. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner, one of the most prestigious law firms in, in the world.""

The former vice president's son also took issue with the amount of public scrutiny aimed at his business endeavors when Robach brought up the $50,000 he made per month while working for Burisma.

""Look, I'm a private citizen; one thing that I don't have to do is sit here and open my kimono as it relates to how much money I make or made or did or didn't,"" Biden said. ""But it's all been reported.""

Robach also asked Biden whether or not he ever thought that taking the position at Burisma was a bad idea, given his father's position.



""I'm a human, and you know what? Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,"" he said. ""But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-admits-burisma-board-based-on-last-name,2019-10-15
"Hunter Biden and partners got $16.5M in illegal money, Ukraine MP alleges","A Ukrainian member of parliament said Wednesday that Hunter Biden and his partners with Burisma received $16.5 million in illegal funds obtained by a Ukrainian crime family and laundered through another country, according to Interfax.

Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach said at a news conference that Biden and his colleagues took millions of dollars that really belonged to the Ukrainian people.

""The [prosecutor general's office] document once again confirms the data I had previously published on Burisma and international corruption,"" Derkach said. ""According to Zlochevsky's suspicion notice, Biden and partners received their $16.5 million for their services to Burisma. Biden received funds not due to the successful activity of Burisma or for brilliant business decisions or recommendations. This is the money of Ukrainian citizens. The funds were obtained by criminal means. That's what they say in the PGO.""

Derkach said the new information came from a suspicion notice to former Ukraine ecology minister and owner of the Burisma Group, Mykola Zlochevsky.

""According to the investigation, Zlochevsky was directly involved in the withdrawal of funds by the Yanukovych 'family',"" Derkach said. ""They laundered the funds of Yanukovych through three companies in Latvia.""

The money was then allegedly paid to Hunter Biden, Aleksander Kwasniewski, Alan Apter, and Devon Archer.

Burisma has been the subject of suspicion and investigation for years for corrupt business dealings. Hunter Biden was named to the board of the company in 2014, and just recently stepped down. His appointment to the board is controversial because it came while his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was the Obama administration's point man for Ukraine issues.

Joe Biden has boasted about his role in ousting a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been pursuing criminal investigations into Burisma in 2016. Biden used a $1 billion loan guarantee as leverage to pressure the government into firing the prosecutor.

Obama's ethics chief eviscerates White House for devising art scheme to sell Hunter Biden paintings to secret buyers for as much as $500K,"Art is a big business. Worldwide sales of art and antiques reached an estimated $64.1 billion in 2019, according to the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report. One of the more curious artists to begin selling their artwork is Hunter Biden. The son of President Joe Biden is selling his artwork for potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars presents a potential headache for the White House.

The Biden administration reportedly stepped in and helped broker a deal that would allow a purchaser of Hunter's artwork to remain anonymous, which has concerned many over the possibility of bribery and money being exchanged for influence. One of the critics who slammed this alleged secret selling situation is Walter Shaub, former President Barack Obama's onetime ethics chief.

Hunter's art dealer is Georges Berges, who ""plans to host a private viewing for Biden in Los Angeles this fall, followed by an exhibition in New York,"" according to Artnet. ""Prices range from $75,000 for works on paper to $500,000 for large-scale paintings.""

Shaub told Fox News that Hunter's art deal is ""the opposite of government ethics."" In effect, the Biden administration got the ""art dealer to promise not to give us the means to monitor whether the buyers are getting preferential access to government"" by keeping buyers anonymous, according to Shaub.

""Nobody ever said secrecy was the best disinfectant, but that's what we have now. And White House officials getting involved in any way other than to request transparency amounts to effectively putting an official stamp of approval on the president's son trading on his father's public service,"" Shaub said. ""Instead, the president should be begging his son not to go through with this sale, even if that means threatening to banish him from the family's Thanksgiving table this fall and publicly condemning his actions.""

""The idea's that even Hunter won't know, but the WH has outsourced government ethics to a private art dealer,"" Shaub wrote on Twitter. ""We're supposed to trust a merchant in an industry that's fertile ground for money laundering, as well as unknown buyers who could tell Hunter or WH officials? No thanks. Is this amateur hour for government ethics?""

The former Office of Government Ethics director emphasized, ""The WH has put its stamp of approval on the president's son profiting off his father's public service again.""

""Yeah yeah, I know some folks aren't going to like this thread because we're not supposed to criticize the president who's way better than the ethical disaster named Trump,"" Shaub explained. ""But, you know what? With democracy on the ropes, ethics has never been more important. And this ain't it.""

Richard Painter, who was a top ethics official in the George W. Bush administration, told the Washington Post, ""The whole thing is a really bad idea.""

""The initial reaction a lot of people are going to have is that he's capitalizing on being the son of a president and wants people to give him a lot of money,"" Painter said. ""I mean, those are awfully high prices.""



Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) pointed out some potential issues with Hunter selling expensive art to unknown entities, ""Some very tough ethical questions about whether the president's son, who is still investing in CCP-linked firms, should take $500,000 in payment (bribes) for his 'artwork.' Better consult the experts on this one!""

White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Hunter had done nothing wrong with his new business endeavor.



""The president has established the highest ethical standards of any administration in American history, and his family's commitment to rigorous processes like this is a prime example,"" Bates responded to the criticism.

A bipartisan Senate investigation released last July alleges that the art industry is ""largely unregulated,"" and ""uncovered a complex set of facts involving shell companies with hidden owners, intermediaries who mask purchasers and sellers, and lax money laundering safeguards in the U.S. art industry.""

""There is a lack of transparency in private art sales,"" the 150-page congressional report states. ""As such, Congress should add high-value art to the list of industries that must comply with BSA requirements. Given the intrinsic secrecy of the art industry, it is clear that change is needed in this multi-billion-dollar industry.""

The report alleges that ""certain Russian oligarchs appear to have used transactions involving high-value art to evade sanctions imposed on them by the United States on March 20, 2014, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.""

Last month, Shaub blasted President Biden for allowing children and relatives of powerful administration officials to be hired for key government positions.

""[T]his royally sucks. I'm disgusted,"" Shaub said in June. ""A lot of us worked hard to tee him up to restore ethics to government and believed the promises. This is a real 'f*** you' to us—and government ethics.""

Georges Berges describes Hunter Biden's jump into art:

Biden has been a lifelong artist that has devoted his artistic career to both the written word and the visual arts. A lawyer by trade who now devotes his life to the creative arts - he brings a myriad of experiences creating powerful and impactful pieces of art. Biden's paintings range from photographic mix-media to abstract works on canvas, yupo paper, wood and metal. He incorporates oil, acrylic, ink and the written word within his work to create a distinctively unique experience that have become signature Biden.

Artnet notes that some of Biden's artwork are ""geometric abstractions, filled with patterns and somewhat hallucinogenic.""

Hunter admitted in February 2020, ""For years I wouldn't call myself an artist,"" but, ""Now I feel comfortable saying it.""



""I don't paint from emotion or feeling, which I think are both very ephemeral,"" Biden said. ""For me, painting is much more about kind of trying to bring forth what is, I think, the universal truth.""



When asked what President Joe Biden thinks of his art, Hunter responded, ""My dad loves everything that I do, and so, I'll leave it at that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-art-paintings-ethics,2021-07-08
"After canceling Sen. Josh Hawley's book, Simon & Schuster announces new memoir from Hunter Biden","Simon & Schuster announced this week that one of its imprints will publish a forthcoming memoir from Hunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden.

The announcement came just weeks after the publishing house backed out of moving forward with the publication of a book from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).

What are the details?

Simon & Schuster announced on Thursday that Gallery Books, an imprint of publishing house, will publish a book from Hunter Biden in April titled, ""Beautiful Things.""

The book ""details Hunter's descent into substance abuse and his tortuous path to sobriety,"" according to a press release.

The book received advanced praise from novelist Stephen King, who gushed over the book.

In AA we say it doesn't matter if you come from Yale or jail, all addicts are the same. In his harrowing and compulsively readable memoir, Hunter Biden proves again that anybody—even the son of a United States President—can take a ride on the pink horse down nightmare alley. There are plenty of memoirs about the Three Rs (rum, ruin, and redemption), but there are sections in this one that stand out with haunting clarity. Biden remembers it all and tells it all with a bravery that is both heartbreaking and quite gorgeous. He starts with a question: Where's Hunter? The answer is he's in this book, the good, the bad, and the beautiful.

Hunter Biden has been in news headlines routinely since 2019, facing scrutiny for his overseas business dealings in Ukraine and China.

Hunter Biden admitted in December that he is under federal investigation.

""I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs. I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" Hunter Biden said in a statement, which was released by the Biden-Harris transition team.

What is the background?

One day after the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, Simon & Schuster cancelled the publication of Hawley's book, claiming the Republican lawmaker played a ""role"" in inciting the violence.

The publisher said in a statement:

After witnessing the disturbing, deadly insurrection that took place on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., Simon & Schuster has decided to cancel publication of Senator Josh Hawley's forthcoming book, THE TYRANNY OF BIG TECH. We did not come to this decision lightly. As a publisher it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voice and viewpoints; at the same time we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom.

In response, Hawley vowed to sue Simon & Schuster.

Fortunately for Hawley, Regnery Publishing, which is known for publishing conservative titles, announced they would publish Hawley's forthcoming book.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-book-deal-simon-schuster,2021-02-07
Hunter Biden lashes out at Trump and denies Ukraine scandal allegations in new book,"Hunter Biden lashes out at former President Donald Trump in a new book and denies the allegations of a Ukraine pay-for-play scandal that plagued his father's presidential campaign.

Biden's memoir is titled ""Beautiful Things"" and is scheduled to be released on April 6.

In the book, he says that the accusations surrounding his time on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma are all false, according to The Guardian, which obtained a copy. Although he says he would not have done it again, he says the controversy is ""remarkable for its epic banality.""

The 51-year-old Biden also admits that his name on the board was meant to jab at Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has ordered military aggression against the country in the past.

""To put it more bluntly,"" Biden wrote, ""having a Biden on Burisma's board was a loud and unmistakable f***-you to Putin.""

He goes on to call Trump ""a vile man with a vile mission,"" and says that the campaign to smear Biden was a way to get at his father, then-candidate Joe Biden.

""I became a proxy for Donald Trump's fear that he wouldn't be re-elected,"" Hunter Biden wrote in his book.

""He pushed debunked conspiracy theories about work I did in Ukraine and China, even as his own children had pocketed millions in China and Russia and his former campaign manager [Paul Manafort] sat in a jail cell for laundering millions more from Ukraine,"" he continued.

""None of that matters in an up-is-down Orwellian political climate,"" Biden wrote. ""Trump believed that if he could destroy me, and by extension my father, he could dispatch any candidate of decency from either party, all while diverting attention from his own corrupt behavior.""

Biden, a lawyer and businessman, also writes about the romantic relationship he had with the widow of his deceased brother, Beau Biden.

""Our relationship had begun as a mutually desperate grasping for love we both had lost,"" he wrote, ""and its dissolution only deepened that tragedy.""

"Hunter Biden may have to reveal full Burisma, China earnings in child support lawsuit","Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, may be forced to reveal exactly how much money he made in Ukraine and China as part of a child support lawsuit, according to Page Six.

Biden, 49, is being sued by Lunden Roberts, a former Washington, D.C., stripper who filed DNA evidence in court last month proving that Biden was the father of her child. She's seeking child support from Biden and in the process is demanding that Biden detail how much he made working for Burisma in Ukraine, as well as how much he's earned through Chinese business dealings.

Biden reportedly earned $50,000 per month as a member of the board of Burisma, a position he was named to while Joe Biden was vice president and point man on Ukraine matters for the Obama administration. Hunter Biden sat on the board from April 2014 until April 2019. A request by President Donald Trump for Ukraine to investigate the arrangement kicked off the impeachment inquiry.

Hunter Biden's work for Burisma has been a source of controversy, as the former VP's son had no apparent qualifications for such a lucrative position, creating the appearance that he may have been named to the board in an attempt by Burisma to buy influence with his father and the Obama administration.

Hunter Biden has asked for more time to ""consult with his accountants"" to figure out his finances for the lawsuit. Roberts' attorney said she is not attempting to make a ""spectacle"" out of the lawsuit or interfere with Joe Biden's campaign.

""She does not want this to affect Joe Biden's campaign,"" attorney Clint Lancaster said. ""She just wants this baby to get financial support from the baby's father. We have been in contact with Hunter Biden's attorney. We have attempted to work with Hunter and his attorney to settle this issue but that has not been successful.

President Joe Biden sold nearly 1 million barrels of oil to Chinese state-owned company that Hunter Biden invested in,"While Americans suffer through high gas prices, President Joe Biden sent more than 5 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserves to foreign countries, Reuters reported. There were 950,000 barrels of U.S. oil sold to a Chinese state-owned gas company that has financial ties to a private equity firm that was co-founded by Hunter Biden, according to a new report.

In April, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it was releasing 30 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The ""emergency sale"" was ""conducted as part of a coordinated action with our international allies and partners to provide a wartime bridge that will support American consumers and the global economy in response to Vladimir Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine.""

Despite the Strategic Petroleum Reserve being at its lowest mark since 1986, the Biden administration sold oil to foreign nations last month.

The Department of Energy received 126 bids from 16 companies for the ""price-competitive sale of 30 million barrels of SPR crude oil."" The Department of Energy awarded ""price-competitive"" oil to 12 companies – one of which was Unipec America, Inc.

Unipec is the trading division of China Petrochemical Corporation – which is also known as the Sinopec Corp. The Biden administration sold nearly 1 million barrels of ""price-competitive"" oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Sinopec – which is wholly owned by the Chinese Communist Party.

BHR Partners – a private equity firm Hunter Biden co-founded in 2013 – bought a $1.7 billion stake in Sinopec Marketing in 2015, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

The New York Post reported, ""BHR is primarily owned by Chinese investors, including the state-controlled Bank of China."" BHR claimed to have managed the equivalent of $2.4 billion.

Chris Clark, Hunter Biden's lawyer, told the New York Times in December that his client ""no longer holds any interest, directly or indirectly, in either BHR or Skaneateles."" Skaneateles LLC is Biden's personal company.

However, the Washington Examiner reported in March that Hunter was still listed as a part-owner of the firm.

""But business records from China's National Credit Information Publicity System accessed Tuesday continue to identify Skaneateles as a 10% owner in BHR, and Washington, D.C., business records continue to list Biden as the only beneficial owner of Skaneateles,"" the report stated.



The outlet noted, ""It’s possible that China’s business registry hasn’t yet been updated to reflect a potential transfer or sale of Skaneateles’s 10% stake in BHR to another party.""

In October 2019, Hunter vowed ""not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies"" if his father was elected president.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reacted to the report of Biden shipping oil to the CCP on Twitter.



""Pres Biden reportedly sold oil [from] American reserves to China's Sinopec which Hunter Biden may still [be] tied to via his financial ventures in China. If report [is] correct that’s OUTRAGEOUS. Sen Johnson & I highlighted these connections to communist regime in our 2020 report + bank records,"" Grassley tweeted.

""At a time when Americans must pay record price$ at pump Pres Biden should NOT [be] selling our strategic oil reserves to communist China,"" he added.

The reported email from Eric Schwerin, then president of Rosemont Seneca Partners, informs Joe Biden's son that he failed to disclose $400,000 in income from the Ukrainian gas company. Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma Holdings.

Schwerin sent the email to Hunter on Jan. 16, 2017, to advise him to ""amend"" his 2014 tax returns with the earnings from Burisma.

""In 2014 you joined the Burisma board and we still need to amend your 2014 returns to reflect the unreported Burisma income,"" Schwerin's email to Hunter reads.

The email also reveals that Hunter was paid more than $1.2 million for the year, which included the $400,000 from Burisma as well as income from Rosemont Seneca Advisors and a legal firm. The report does not say if there was any further communication regarding the $400,000 from Hunter Biden or Schwerin.

NBC News said it was provided the email by Rudy Giuliani's attorney Robert Costello, who claimed that he was given a copy of one of Hunter's laptop hard drives that were left at a computer repair shop in Delaware. NBC News noted that it did not have access to the full drive.



Hunter Biden is now the subject of a federal tax investigation. On Wednesday, Hunter issued a statement that was released by the Biden-Harris transition team.

""I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,"" Biden said. ""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.""



The Biden-Harris transition team released a statement that said, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""

On Friday, a Fox News report claimed that Hunter Biden is under ""yet another federal criminal investigation into the Biden family that appears to be focused specifically on Hunter Biden's business dealings with China and his relationship with Burisma Holdings in Ukraine.""

Fox News host Martha MacCallum stated, ""This is now the fourth federal investigation that has been reported in recent days.""

Contents from Hunter Biden's laptop first appeared in a New York Post report published in October, which linked Joe Biden to a top executive at Burisma. The purported emails also connected Hunter Biden to a Chinese energy corporation. During the alleged negotiations with officials with the China Energy Fund Committee, the deal asked for ""10 held by H for the big guy?""

NBC News analysis: Hunter Biden raked in $11 million in 5 years – more than half from Chinese deals. President Biden said his son did not make money in China.,"Hunter Biden made millions from overseas business deals, according to the analysis of the first son's infamous laptop by NBC News. Hunter Biden raked in the most money from Chinese business dealings. However, President Joe Biden previously said that his son did not make any money in China.

The NBC News report stated, ""From 2013 through 2018 Hunter Biden and his company brought in about $11 million via his roles as an attorney and a board member with a Ukrainian firm accused of bribery and his work with a Chinese businessman now accused of fraud.""

Of the $11 million that Biden made in the 5-year span, $5.8 million was attained from two business deals with Chinese entities.

""The documents and the analysis, which don’t show what he did to earn millions from his Chinese partners, raise questions about national security, business ethics, and potential legal exposure,"" NBC News reported.

The findings regarding Hunter's finances were derived from a copy of Biden’s hard drive, his iCloud account, and an 87-page report titled ""Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns"" released by Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in September 2020.

Hunter Biden's business deals in China

The analysis found that Hunter's most lucrative deal involved a Chinese businessman who is now believed to be detained in China, according to NBC News.



“According to business records referred to in the Senate report, Hudson West III, a venture funded by the Chinese oil and natural gas company CEFC and its chairman, Ye Jianming, paid $4,790,375.25 to Owasco P.C. over about one year.”

Owasco P.C. was controlled by Hunter Biden, according to filings in Washington, D.C.

In 2018, Ye Jianming was accused of “economic crimes” by Chinese prosecutors. He has not been seen in public since he was detained for questioning on accusations of fraud and bribery.

Ye Jianming is the former chairman of the China Energy Fund Committee. He is rumored to have ties to China's People's Liberation Army. A 2018 Financial Times report linked him to Chinese military intelligence.

""Ye's company, CEFC China Energy, aligned itself so closely with the Chinese government that it was often hard to distinguish between the two,"" CNN reported in 2018.

Chi Ping Patrick Ho – an associate of Ye Jianming and a top executive for CEFC – reportedly wired a $1 million payment to Owasco P.C. that was listed as “Dr Patrick Ho Chi Ping Representation.”

In March 2019, Patrick Ho was sentenced to three years in prison for international bribery and money laundering.

The New York Post reported in October 2020 that Patrick Ho had been in the process of brokering a partnership between the multibillion-dollar energy company and a business group involving Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden.

However, Joe Biden previously declared that his son had not made money from China during a 2020 presidential debate with Donald Trump.



""My son has not made money in terms of, this thing about, what are you talking about, China,"" Biden stated.

After being elected, Biden's White House doubled down on the assertion that Hunter did not receive money from China.

In March, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield was asked about the damning New York Times report that declared that emails from Hunter's abandoned laptop were authentic.

“We absolutely stand by the president’s comment,” Bedingfield responded. “And I would point you to the reporting on this, which referenced statements that we made at the time, that we gave to the Washington Post, who worked on this story. But as you know, I don’t speak for Hunter Biden so there’s not more I can say on that.”

Hunter Biden's Ukrainian connections

The NBC News report also mentions Hunter's position on the Ukrainian gas company Burisma.



""Biden’s addition to the company’s board as head of legal affairs was reported in a news release in May 2014,"" the outlet stated. ""At some point from May to December 2014, Burisma allegedly paid a bribe to a Ukrainian official to help stop a joint British/U.S. money-laundering investigation into Burisma’s top executive, according to a State Department email that quotes a Ukrainian prosecutor.""



The New York Post previously reported, ""In 2016, Hunter’s total income from Burisma was $999,996. In 2017 it dropped to $665,000, and then $498,000 in 2018.""

Hunter Biden blows through fast money



The analysis of his laptop hard drive showed that Hunter spent his money faster than he earned it.



""Expenditures compiled on his hard drive show he spent more than $200,000 per month from October 2017 through February 2018 on luxury hotel rooms, Porsche payments, dental work, and cash withdrawals,"" according to NBC News. ""Biden has admitted to burning through cash to pay for drugs and partying with strangers who routinely stole from him, and he struggled to pay multiple mortgages or keep up with alimony and child support payments to his ex-wife.""

In his divorce filing from February 2017, the attorney for his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, claimed, ""Throughout the parties' separation, Mr. Biden has created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations) while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.""

Hunter Biden may have been a national security risk

Frank Figliuzzi – the FBI’s former assistant director for counterintelligence – warned that Hunter Biden could be a national security risk.

""It’s all about access and influence, and if you can compromise someone with both access and influence, that’s even better,"" Figliuzzi told NBC News – where he is a contributor. “Better still if that target has already compromised himself.”



Walter Shaub –a former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics during the Obama administration – blasted Biden, ""No government ethics rules apply to him.”

Producers of Hunter Biden biopic say Hunter's Hollywood affiliates spied on the film,"A Hollywood lawyer, who is reportedly developing a legal and media strategy for Hunter Biden, has been accused of spying on the production of an independent movie about Hunter and his father, Joe.

Phelim McAleer, a producer of the biopic “My Son Hunter,” alleged that Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris and two of his associates flew to the film’s set in Siberia, where they claimed to be making a documentary detailing the corrupt business practices of Hunter Biden, the New York Post reported.

Morris has negotiated deals worth nearly $1.5 billion for Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the critically acclaimed show “South Park.” Morris also co-produced Parker and Stone’s popular, Tony-winning Broadway musical “The Book of Mormon.”

Morris also recently helped Hunter Biden settle more than $2 million in outstanding tax debts and paid the rent on Hunter’s $20,000-a-month home in Malibu, California, for an extended period of time.

In a press release, McAleer said that Morris and his associates were given full access to the set of “My Son Hunter” and were allowed to interview McAleer, the film’s co-producer Ann McElhinney, and the film’s cast over several days. Morris and his associates even shared meals with the film’s cast and crew.

Recent revelations about Morris’ pre-existing relationship with Hunter Biden have led McAleer to re-evaluate the Hollywood lawyer’s visit to the film’s set.

McAleer said, “They seemed to never switch the camera off — now I know why. This was an information-gathering exercise by a lawyer and his associates for their client.”

“Now that I know of his representation of Hunter Biden, his questions while they were filming suddenly make a lot of sense. I thought he was just making a documentary, but now it appears he was deceptively spying for his client Hunter Biden,” McAleer added.

This past Monday, CBS News reported that Morris’ office was confirmed to be helping Hunter Biden with his ongoing legal and image problems amid a federal grand jury probe into his litany of questionable business dealings.

Hunter Biden’s attorney, Chris Clark, confirmed that Morris was serving as both an “attorney and trusted adviser.”

“My Son Hunter” is currently in post-production. The movie was financed through crowdsourced funding on its website. The film’s production team was able to raise more than $2.5 million toward its goal of $2.75 million.

The film stars British actor and conservative activist Laurence Fox in the titular role as Hunter Biden, “Dynasty” actor John James as Joe Biden, and canceled-then-uncanceled co-star of “The Mandalorian” Gina Carano as a Secret Service agent.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-hollywood-corruption,2022-05-11
Lawyer for mother of Hunter Biden's child expects him to be indicted,"The lawyer for the mother of one of Hunter Biden's children expects President Joe Biden's son to be indicted for tax fraud.

""I expect him to be indicted,"" attorney Clint Lancaster said of Hunter Biden during a CNBC interview on Thursday. ""Just based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he's not indicted.""

Lancaster represents Lunden Alexis Roberts – the mother of Biden's 3-year-old daughter.

Lancaster said that both he and Roberts ""don’t want Hunter to go to jail.""

""It’s not my goal, much to the unhappiness of many people in the Republican Party,"" Lancaster said of Biden potentially being sentenced to jail.

Roberts – a former stripper from Arkansas – was once on Hunter Biden’s payroll at his consulting firm, according to a June 2021 report.

The Daily Mail claimed to obtain text messages from 2018 on Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop between the couple.

""Roberts had previously been reported as a former stripper at a Washington D.C. club which Hunter frequented, but texts reveal she was in fact a worker at his consultancy firm, Rosemont Seneca,"" according to the outlet.

Roberts claimed that she ""received money from a company"" owned or controlled by him from May 2018 until November 2018. Court records state, ""She never received tax documents for those payments.""

TheBlaze previously reported, ""At the time of Biden's affair with Lunden, he was dating his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, who he moved in with after divorcing his wife of 22 years. Biden remarried in May to Melissa Cohen, who he reportedly had met just days before.""

A DNA test confirmed that Biden is the father of the child ""with scientific certainty,"" and Roberts sued him for child financial support. Biden had denied the allegations previously. In his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things,"" Hunter wrote that he ""has no recollection of the encounter"" with Roberts.

Lancaster claims that Roberts, 31, supplied federal prosecutors with ""a significant amount of Hunter’s financial records.""

""They’re all in electronic form,"" Lancaster said of the financial data provided to the federal investigators after being subpoenaed last month. ""I would estimate it was anywhere from 10 gigs of data.""

CNBC reported, ""The documents were part of the case file for an Arkansas court child-support lawsuit that Roberts filed against Biden in 2019 in connection with their daughter.""

Included in the financial documents are pay records for when Biden was on the board of the Ukrainian gas firm Burisma while his father was vice president of the United States.

""I had his Burisma pay records,"" Lancaster told CNBC. ""I had records of ultimately what Burisma paid into the United States.""

The New York Post previously reported, ""In 2016, Hunter’s total income from Burisma was $999,996. In 2017 it dropped to $665,000, and then $498,000 in 2018.""

Regarding Biden's financial documents, Lancaster claimed he ""saw a lot of information” that is ""problematic.""



""I'm not making any statements about what was in the tax records, whether he paid taxes, or whether he didn’t pay taxes,"" he clarified.

Lancaster revealed that he and Roberts were interviewed by an assistant U.S. attorney, an FBI agent, and an IRS agent — “one that carries a badge and gun” — over a year ago regarding Biden at a meeting in Little Rock, Arkansas.

When asked if Biden has ever seen his daughter birthed by Roberts, Lancaster responded, ""No, he has not. It's sad, because the baby looks like him, with blond hair.""

Biden has five children from three different women.

Hunter Biden email says Joe Biden was office mate with Chinese financier,"Hunter Biden reportedly ordered keys to be made for his new ""office mates,"" which included his father Joe Biden, his mother, his uncle, and the emissary for a profitable Chinese energy company.

Hunter Biden was so convinced that he was going to have a working relationship with his family and a Chinese business partner that he ordered copies of office keys for them and considered them ""office mates,"" according to a newly resurfaced email that was revealed by the Daily Caller.

please have keys made available for new office mates:

Joe Biden Jill Biden Jim Biden

Gongwen Dong (Chairman Ye CEFC emissary)

The Biden Foundation

Hudson West (CEFC US)

The lease will remain under my company's name Rosemont Seneca.

if you need information on the individuals above please refer to their wiki pages

The email dated on Sept. 21, 2017, was sent to Cecilia Browning, the general manager of the office building that is named the ""House of Sweden."" Browning responded to Hunter Biden's request by writing:

Hunter,

We are very excited and honored to welcome your new colleagues!

Just to confirm you would like

1. Four more keys

2. Change of name on the door and in the north entrance – please note that there will be a charge for having the new signage made and installed

Is that in addition to the key that was requested yesterday as a replacement key?

Best regards,

Cecilia

Browning didn't confirm or deny the correspondence with Hunter Biden

""We have tenants who rent office space, and it is correct that Rosemont Seneca LLC rented an office at House of Sweden between February 2017 — February 2018,"" Browning told the Daily Caller. ""However, please note that we do not share information about current and previous tenants.""

Hunter described Gongwen Dong as ""Chairman Ye CEFC emissary,"" referring to Ye Jianming, who was the chairman of CEFC China Energy Company. Ye is rumored to have ties to China's People's Liberation Army. The former chairman mysteriously vanished in early 2018, when he was believed to have been taken into custody by Chinese authorities.



When the New York Post published ""smoking gun"" emails from Hunter Biden in October, Gongwen Dong was mentioned.

Joe Biden's son allegedly sent an email to Gongwen Dong on Aug. 2, 2017, which negotiated a three-year consulting contract worth $10 million annually ""for introductions alone.""

""The chairman changed that deal after we me[t] in MIAMI TO A MUCH MORE LASTING AND LUCRATIVE ARRANGEMENT to create a holding company 50% percent [sic] owned by ME and 50% owned by him,"" Hunter Biden reportedly wrote. ""Consulting fees is one piece of our income stream but the reason this proposal by the chairman was so much more interesting to me and my family is that we would also be partners inn [sic] the equity and profits of the JV's [joint venture's] investments.""

In October 2018, the Wall Street Journal described Gongwen Dong as an ""Asian financier,"" who was involved with an $83 million property purchase in New York City.

""Companies linked to Ye Jianming, a Chinese oil entrepreneur with ties to China's military, spent roughly $83 million on New York City's priciest properties,"" the Journal reported. ""Both of the transactions were executed in the names of limited liability companies that are registered at a Long Island home of Asian financier Gongwen Dong. Mr. Ye's name doesn't appear on the business registration document, but the people familiar with the transactions describe him as controlling the companies. Mr. Dong couldn't be reached for comment.""

Currently, Hunter Biden is reportedly under as many as four federal investigations for his taxes, and overseas business dealings in China and Ukraine.

Corporate media ran with 'Russian disinformation' narrative about Hunter Biden's laptop despite having no concrete evidence. Now it refuses to retract any of it.,"The New York Times published an article earlier this month that verified key aspects of the New York Post report from October 2020 regarding emails from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden and reportedly abandoned at a computer repair shop in Delaware.

""People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors had examined emails between Mr. Biden, Mr. Archer and others about Burisma and other foreign business activity,"" the Times wrote. ""Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.""

Previously, the Times dismissed the bombshell story that broke during the 2020 presidential election campaign and questioned the Post's reporting process.



One day after the New York Post released its damning Hunter Biden laptop report, the Washington Post published an article claiming that then-President Donald Trump was being influenced by Russian misinformation.

""U.S. intelligence agencies warned the White House last year that President Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was the target of an influence operation by Russian intelligence, according to four former officials familiar with the matter,"" the report alleged.



On Oct. 19, 2020, more than 50 former U.S. intelligence officials disregarded the New York Post's laptop story as Russian misinformation in a letter.

The letter was signed by Barack Obama's former director of the CIA, John Brennan – who is now the senior national security and intelligence analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. The letter was also signed by Obama's former director of national intelligence, James Clapper – who is now CNN's national security analyst. Former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden – who was appointed by George W. Bush and is now a national security analyst for CNN – also signed the letter.

The former intelligence officials claimed that is their ""view that the Russians are involved in the Hunter Biden email issue.""

""We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement – just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case,"" the letter stated.

During the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, President Joe Bidenparroted the letter, ""Look, there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics – four – five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.""

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki amplified the letter on the day it was released.

The Times declared days after the letter was published, ""No concrete evidence has emerged that the laptop contains Russian disinformation.""



In September 2021, the Times described the article about Hunter Biden as ""unsubstantiated."" However, the Times later removed the ""unsubstantiated"" description.

""Notably, the change was not accompanied by an editor's note or other acknowledgment of the original error,"" the National Review reported.

The New York Post recently reached out to all of the former intelligence officials who signed the letter asserting that the emails obtained from the alleged Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. The overwhelming majority of the officials did not respond or had no comment.

Of the 51 officials, only four provided responses – including James Clapper who said, ""I stand by the statement made AT THE TIME, and would call attention to its 5th paragraph. I think sounding such a cautionary note AT THE TIME was appropriate."" The other respondents said they stand by their decisions to sign the letter claiming Russian disinformation.

Corporate media outlets heavily spotlighted the report from the former intelligence officials despite the letter clearly stating that they ""do not have evidence of Russian involvement.""

Politico was the first to publish the letter, and ran with the headline: ""Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.""

TheBlaze has reached out for comment to Politico as well as several other media outlets and cable news networks that ran with the Russian disinformation narrative. The media outlets were asked about issuing a correction or update to the Hunter Biden story in light of the New York Times authenticating the emails from the abandoned laptop. At the time of publication, TheBlaze did not receive a response from Mother Jones, MSNBC, NBC News, the Hill, the Daily Beast, or Huffington Post.

A 20-minute video compilation of legacy media pushing the narrative that the emails from Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop are Russian disinformation despite lacking actual evidence highlights how feverishly cable news networks attempted to dismiss the laptop story. The compilation was created by a political video editor by the name of ""Kanekoa the Great.""

Hunter Biden-linked firm Burisma asked Obama administration for help amid corruption probe,"Ukrainian gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was employed as a board member — asked the Obama State Department for assistance when the company was being investigated for corruption, just one month before then-Vice President Joe Biden forced the country to fire the prosecutor looking into his son's company.

What are the details?

Investigative journalist John Solomon uncovered the findings in a bombshell report on Monday, revealing several memos he obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The documents show several meetings set up between Obama administration officials and Burisma employees, including Hunter Biden, during the 2016 election cycle.

Solomon notes that Hunter Biden's name ""was specifically invoked by [a] Burisma representative as a reason the State Department should help, according to a series of email exchanges among U.S. officials trying to arrange the meeting.""

A Feb. 24, 2016 email between State Department officials (with the headline, ""Burisma""), reads:

Per our conversation, Karen Tramontano of Blue Star Strategies requested a meeting to discuss with U/S Novelli USG remarks alleging Burisma (Ukrainian energy company) of corruption. She noted that two high profile U.S. citizens are affiliated with the company (including Hunter Biden as a board member). Tramontano would like to talk with U/S Novelli about getting a better understanding of how the U.S. came to the determination that the company is corrupt. According to Tramontano, there is no evidence of corruption, has been no hearing or process, and evidence to the contrary has not been considered. Would appreciate any background you may be able to provide on this issue.



Solomon explains that Novelli was the ""most senior official overseeing international energy issues for State"" during that time, and ""Tramontano was a lawyer working for Blue Star Strategies, a Washington firm that was hired by Burisma to help end a long-running corruption investigation against the gas firm in Ukraine.""

The meeting between Tramonanto and Novelli was scheduled for March 1, 2016. Another meeting was set for the next day, March 2, 2016, between Burisma board member Devon Archer and then-Secretary of State John Kerry. Within weeks of those two meeting dates, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from the Ukraine unless the country fired it prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.

Shokin, in early February of that year, had authorized the seizure of property from Burisma's founder, oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, as part of a corruption probe into the company that had been going on in Ukraine since 2014. Mr. Shokin was, indeed, fired and replaced following Joe Biden's request.

Hunter Biden linked to identity theft of his dead brother by investigator in paternity suit,"Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, was linked in court documents with alleged identity theft of his deceased brother Beau Biden.

The claims were made by a private investigator acting as a third-party intervener in the paternity lawsuit against Hunter Biden. He is accused of fathering a child with an exotic dancer he met in Washington, D.C.

The investigator said that evidence obtained by police pointed to the fraudulent use of identification in order to hide the admission of Hunter Biden into an Arizona rehabilitation facility under his dead brother's name.

The claims arise from suspicious items reported to police that were discovered in a Hertz rental car in October 2018.

""A bag containing the suspicious items, a cellular telephone (Apple) belonging to Shauna Stanglr, who is also known as Puma St. Angel, and a Delaware attorney general badge belonging to Hunter Biden's deceased brother Joseph R. Beau Biden III were provided to the police officer,"" the filing said.

Hunter Biden came under heightened scrutiny after claims of corruption were leveled at former Vice President Joe Biden over his son's involvement with Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) officially opened a Senate investigation into claims of corruption against the Bidens in November.

""I want to know are there any transcripts or readouts of the phone calls between the vice president and the president of the Ukraine in February, after the raid on the gas company president's house,"" Graham explained to Sean Hannity on Fox News.

Here's more about the Bidens and Ukraine:

"Hunter Biden may still be a board member of Chinese firm he vowed to step down from, records show","Hunter Biden, son of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, promised to step down from the board of Chinese firm BHR Partners. However, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported that Hunter Biden is still listed as a director in Chinese business records, indicating that he may not have followed through on his promise.

What Hunter Biden said he would do: In a statement issued by his lawyer, Biden said he would step down in October from the firm to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest in the event his father was elected president.



""To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR's board of directors,"" the statement read. ""He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest. Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR's investments. Hunter intends to resign from the BHR board of directors on or by October 31, 2019.""

Hunter Biden also promised not to serve on any foreign boards if Joe Biden became president.

What the records show: China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System still shows Hunter Biden as a director for BHR. And it doesn't appear that his inclusion is due to lack of updates, because it reflects a March 24 change showing the resignation of Eric Schwerin, a business partner of Biden's, according to the DCNF.

Qixinbao, a service that provides registration info about Chinese companies, also shows Biden as a BHR board member.



Hunter Biden still holds a 10% share in BHR through his own company, Skaneateles.

Why this matters: Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which date back to his father's time as vice president, have created the appearance of potential corruption in Ukraine with Burisma, and in China with BHR. Biden's promise to step down from BHR is an apparent acknowledgment of the bad optics. Hunter arranged for his father to meet with BHR's CEO in 2013 during a trip to China, just a few months after BHR was formed.

Hunter Biden owes the IRS more than $100K from his time on the board of Burisma: report,"Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, owes more than $100,000 in federal taxes from a year during which he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, according to the Daily Caller.

Biden reportedly earned at least $50,000 per month while on the board of Burisma — a position he did not appear to have any qualifications for — but he was not apparently giving the U.S. government its fair share of his income. The Daily Caller's Andrew Kerr reported:

The IRS placed a tax lien on Hunter Biden seeking $112,805 in unpaid taxes from 2015, according to records the Daily Caller News Foundation obtained.

The federal agency issued the previously unreported lien in November 2018 and it seeks unpaid taxes for a year in which Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, served on the boards of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings and the Chinese private equity firm BHR Partners.

Hunter Biden's finances became the focus of media and political attention this summer after President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings and Joe Biden's involvement.

President Trump's concern about the Bidens in Ukraine is centered on whether Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time of Hunter's Burisma appointment, used his power and influence as VP to protect Hunter and Burisma from investigative scrutiny.

More recently, Hunter Biden was revealed to be the father of a child in Arkansas, and the mother of the child is currently suing him for child support. Hunter has reportedly not been forthcoming with the details of his financial situation throughout the process.

"Hunter Biden was paid much more by Ukrainian gas company than originally thought, records reveal","Hunter Biden was reportedly paid much more to serve on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of Ukraine's largest natural gas companies, than originally believed, Reuters reported on Friday.

Oleksandr Onyshchenko, a businessman and former member of Ukrainian parliament who knows Burisma's founder, told Reuters that Biden was hired ""to protect (the company)"" at a time when it faced potential criminal prosecution. He was hired ""as a helpful non-executive director with a powerful name,"" the report said.

At the time of Biden's hiring, Mykola Zlochevsky, the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources who founded Burisma, was being investigated for corruption, tax violations, and money laundering.

Exactly how much Biden was paid for his advisory services has become a central issue. Records obtained by Reuters show that Biden received much more than $50,000 per month, the original figure reported.

From National Review:

Reuters reviewed payment records allegedly from Burisma which show $3.4 million in payments to a company headed by Biden's business partner, Devon Archer, called Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, between April 2014 and November 2015.



Every month during that 18-month period, the records show two payments of $83,333 for ""consulting services,"" which sources say were intended for Archer and Biden. One of the sources also said that in their investigations of Burisma, prosecutors obtained payment records which showed activities prior to when Archer and Biden were appointed to the board.

According to Reuters, Biden never visited Ukraine while working for Burisma, although he did attend the biannual company meetings — all of which were held outside Ukraine.

Biden's involvement with Burisma has come under intense scrutiny after President Donald Trump allegedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his father, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Biden, 49, is being sued by Lunden Roberts, a former Washington D.C., stripper with whom he fathered a now-17-month-old child. Biden is currently married to another woman, who is pregnant.

After initially denying that Roberts' child was his, Biden has been forced to concede that he is the father after a DNA test, and was ordered by a judge to disclose his sources of income, business ownership, and tax returns, among other documents.

""The defendant continues to act as though he has no respect for this court and its orders … or the needs of his child for support,"" Roberts' attorneys wrote.

Although the judge issued a protective order that would keep Biden's financial disclosures private, Biden may have some strong motivation to avoid detailed financial disclosures at all costs.

Biden has been a significant, albeit background, figure in the ongoing impeachment of President Donald Trump, who wanted the Ukrainian government to investigate his business dealings. Biden served on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma from 2014 until 2019, during which he was potentially paid millions of dollars despite having little-to-no qualifying experience. From Reuters:

Specifically, the records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were paid to Rosemont Seneca Bohai (a company tied to Biden) for ""consulting services.""

New book claims that Hunter Biden's assistant was a Chinese agent,"Hunter Biden’s laptop continues to haunt him as leaked emails show that the President’s son allegedly solicited secretarial services from a former researcher for the Chinese government.

This allegation surfaced in Peter Schweizer’s recently released book “Red Handed,” reports Fox News.

According to Schweizer, Hunter Biden’s secretary, JiaQi Bao, was employed by the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission as a research assistant.

After her tenure with the Commission, Bao went on to work for the Shanghai-based investment firm OpenGate Capital. OpenGate has known ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Bao became involved with Hunter Biden shortly after he started conducting business with Patrick Ho, the secretary-general of CEFC – a Chinese energy conglomerate. Biden once described Ho as the “spy chief of China.”

Ho formerly served as a home affairs secretary in Hong Kong and was arrested by the FBI in November 2017 on bribery charges. Schweizer explains in his book that Ho attempted to launder money through a “network of middlemen, millionaires, and suspected spies” to make “illicit payments to UN diplomats.”

In 2019, Patrick Ho was sentenced to three years in prison while his former associate, JiaQi Bao, remained in Hunter Biden’s employ.

Bao provided Biden advice on everything from “energy deals to his father’s presidential campaign,” noted Schweizer, before Biden terminated those services in 2018 when Biden stopped conducting business with the CEFC.

Notably, Biden served as a member on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma where he received more than $80,000, per the New York Post, in monthly compensation. It is believed that Hunter Biden was awarded this position on Burisma’s board solely for the sake of his connections to then-Vice President Joe Biden.

Hunter Biden’s business dealings and personal affairs were a source of such intense scrutiny during the 2020 presidential election that Twitter and Facebook prevented users from sharing articles that detailed the contents of his recovered laptop’s hard drive that could implicate his father.

In Miranda Devine’s recent book, titled “Laptop from Hell,” she speculates that Joe Biden, himself, benefited directly from his son’s shady business dealings. It is believed that “the big guy” receiving 10% of Hunter’s income from these dealings was his father, Joe Biden.

After his father became President of the United States, Hunter began a career as a professional painter. Each of his works sell for several thousand dollars apiece. His debut art show was held at the prestigious Georges Bergès Gallery in New York City.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-s-assistant-was-a-chinese-agent-a-new-book-reveals,2022-01-27
"Hunter Biden to step down from Chinese company, refrain from foreign work if father is elected","Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, said via statement Sunday morning that he will step down from the board of a Chinese company and will not engage in foreign business if his father is elected president, Bloomberg reported.

The Bidens have been battered with allegations that Hunter improperly leveraged his father's influence as vice president to profit from foreign business deals in Ukraine and China—allegations which both have denied, and which Hunter again denied in the statement issued by his lawyer, George Mesires.

Hunter undertook these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he. Hunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, irrespective of its effects on Hunter's professional interests. This was the standard observed throughout Hunter's professional career. When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith. He never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the president of the United States.



Even though everything Hunter did was supposedly legal and ethical, he has committed to discontinuing those legal and ethical practices if his father is elected president.

Hunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.

He will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration's guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.



The company Biden is stepping down from is BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management, an LLC that invests Chinese money outside of the country.

Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors. His lawyer said in the statement that Biden joined the company ""based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.""



According to Mesires, Biden never made any money from the position, nor did he play any role in directing or making investments. Still, he intends to resign at the end of the month.

Hunter Biden wants to pay less in child support for the 4-year-old daughter he has never visited,"President Joe Biden's 52-year-old son Hunter has asked a judge in Independence County, Arkansas, to recalculate his child support payments to former stripper Lunden Roberts, a former employee and the mother of the 4-year-old child he sired out of wedlock in 2018.

According to a court filing obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Biden cited ""a substantial material change"" in his ""financial circumstances, including but not limited to his income,"" as justification to lower the amount to be paid in support.

Biden similarly suggested he was hard up for cash in November 2019, when he stated in an affidavit: ""I am unemployed and have had no monthly income since May 2019."" Debts and obligations resulting from his divorce, he alleged, had proved ""significant.""

The first son moved out of a $5.4 million mansion in Venice Beach in 2021, out front of which he would park his six-figure-priced Porsche Panamera, and into a $20,000-a-month rental home in Malibu. Biden converted the three-car garage in his palatial new home into an art studio where he made some of the prints he sold last year for $75,000 each.

The court order setting Biden's monetary obligations to the Arkansas child and mother were filed under seal on March 12, 2020, approximately one year after he reportedly resigned from the board of Burisma, the energy exploration holding company based in Ukraine, where he was making roughly $50,000 per month.

As the order is under seal, it is unclear whether the calculation took into account the $4.8 million sent by the communist Chinese-affiliated CEFC China Energy company to a entity controlled by Biden and his uncle James Biden.

Roberts' lawyer, Clint Lancaster, suggested that Biden's efforts to pay less might prove costly. ""Ultimately, this is going to require us to look deeply, more deeply, into Hunter's finances.""



Before Biden's fight to pay less, he fought not to pay at all

Biden reportedly first met Roberts at the Mpire Gentlemen's Club in Washington, D.C., where she worked as a stripper. Shortly after breaking up with his dead brother's wife, Biden got Roberts pregnant.

The NY Post reported that Roberts — whom Biden claimed he had ""no recollection"" of meeting — had been on the payroll at the first son's now-defunct law firm Owasco PC during her pregnancy. After Roberts gave birth to the child, named Navy Joan, Biden promptly had Roberts kicked off the firm's health insurance plan.



Biden denied being the father (a paternity test later proved his parentage ""with near scientific certainty"") and refused Roberts' pleas to help care for the child. Consequently, Roberts sued him in an Arkansas court.

Biden defied the resulting court order to turn over financial information relevant to the case, refusing also to provide a list of the companies he owned or had an ownership interest in (e.g., Rosemont Seneca Partners, the ""$2.4 billion private equity firm"" he founded with former Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson Christopher Heinz) and a list of all of his sources of income. To avoid a contempt charge, Biden agreed to pay child support retroactive to November 2018.

Judge Holly Meyer subsequently ordered that these payments were to continue indefinitely and to be paid on the first of each month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-wants-pay-less-child-support,2022-09-15
Joe Biden refuses to say it was wrong for Hunter to serve on Burisma's board while he was VP,"Former Vice President Joe Biden refuses to acknowledge that his son Hunter's business dealings in the Ukraine were wrong, even if they were not technically illegal.

In an interview, Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart pressed Biden on the matter, but the aspiring Democratic presidential nominee did not budge. In fact, Biden tried to spin his way out when Diaz-Balart questioned Hunter's business ethics by responding that his son's actions were not unlawful. Biden then attempted to shift the focus back to President Trump.

Diaz-Balart: Your son did make a lot of money. There are some reports of $50,000 to $80,000 a month in a Ukrainian company while you were vice president. Also had dealings with a Chinese state government-run company while you were vice president. Was that wrong?



Biden: No, there is nothing asserting that he did anything that was illegal. Nothing.



Diaz-Balart: I'm not saying 'illegal.' Was it wrong?



Biden: Look, here's what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to—and I know you're not intending to do this—play the game to take the eye off the culprit.

Hunter Biden was a paid board member of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, as well as an adviser to a Chinese investment firm, while his father was the U.S. vice president.

Hunter gave a similar response

According to National Review, Hunter Biden in October denied having any kind of ""ethical lapse"" in his business affairs; however, he did apologize for creating a political headache for this father.

""In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it — I know that there was — did nothing wrong at all,"" Hunter said at the time.

""I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,"" he added. ""So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.""

Senators are probing Hunter Biden's dealings

Congressional leaders are not convinced the dealings surrounding Hunter Biden were entirely above-board.

Several U.S. senators are now probing a consulting firm that attempted to use Hunter Biden's name to gain access to the Obama administration while he worked for Burisma.

According to the Washington Times, Sens. Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa) have asked Blue Star Strategies' CEO for information regarding the work it did for the Ukrainian energy company following reports that it considered leveraging Hunter Biden's membership in Burisma's board to secure meetings with Obama administration officials.

'This is wildly immoral': Ilhan Omar is outraged that Biden is considering asking Saudis to pump more oil,"Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was outraged at a report saying President Joe Biden, also a Democrat, is considering asking Saudi Arabia to pump more oil as gas prices skyrocket at home.

Axios reported that Biden may make a trip to Saudi Arabia in spring to ask for increased gas production as energy prices jump skyward as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Omar lashed out at Biden over the suggestion.

""Our response to Putin’s immoral war shouldn’t be to strengthen our relationship with the Saudis who are currently causing the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet in Yemen,"" tweeted Omar.

""Yemenis might not matter to some geopolitically but their humanity should,"" she added. ""This is wildly immoral act.

Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has helped the Yemeni government fight against an insurgent movement by the Houthi Islamists, a group which has been labeled as a terror group.

Others criticized the report for different reasons. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas excoriated the Biden administration for seeking foreign sources of oil after shutting down domestic production.

""Two weeks after Biden banned new drilling on federal lands he's begging Saudi Arabia to drill for more oil. Does he think that only American energy is bad for the environment?"" tweeted Cotton.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that there was no plan yet for Biden to visit Saudi Arabia. She also went on to say that they would not be increasing domestic oil production to ease the oil crisis but instead spun the crisis to validate their anti-oil policies.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” she claimed.

Also on Monday, the stock market continued to tank in response to high oil prices and the escalating war in Ukraine from Russian invasion.

"Ilhan Omar lashes out at constituent at town hall meeting, somehow makes Ukrainian suffering about herself: 'Unless you are someone like me ...'","A recent town hall meeting left Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) railing about Russian ""internet disinformation"" and calling some of her own constituents ""dangerous propagandists.""

On Thursday, Omar held a town hall meeting where at least one constituent shared his concerns about America's continued financial support for the war in Ukraine.

An account called ""Jose Vega — Vote Diane Sare!"" shared a video of the incident on Twitter.

""JUST IN: Anti War Protester confronts #SquadMember @IlhanMN on her funding of the Ukrainian War that is leading us into nuclear war,"" the tweet with the video reads. ""She was part of the cowardly 30 who rescinded the letter calling for diplomatic talks with Russia!""

The unidentified man in the audience openly criticized Omar for voting to fund Ukrainian forces, even as her party's traditional platform eschews American intervention in foreign wars.

""You are supposed to be a progressive Democrat,"" the unnamed audience member shouted while Omar was speaking. ""Anti-war. Anti-war! Eighty billion to Ukraine is not anti-war!""

When Omar replied that the U.S. funding helped Ukrainians defend themselves, the man claimed that Ukraine, under the direction of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was ""killing its own citizens.""

Omar then pivoted to position herself as a victim and to seemingly co-opt some of the Ukrainian suffering as her own.

""We are helping little children like me,"" said the Democrat, who just celebrated her 40th birthday a few weeks ago.

A few moments later, Omar became angry with the man, who continued to argue with her. She once again turned the subject back to herself and told her constituents that they have little right to weigh in on the votes she casts on their behalf.

""Unless you are someone like me that has been that child,"" she yelled, ""you do not get to tell me what my votes mean and how I get to vote in supporting people who desperately need ...""

Audience clapping rendered the rest of her statement inaudible.

After the meeting was over, Omar continued to attack her anti-war critics online, calling them ""dangerous propagandists"" who spew Russian ""disinformation.""

""I am sorry, you all aren’t 'anti war protesters',"" she said, quote-tweeting Vega, ""you are dangerous propagandists who are literally making a mockery of the anti war movement. I have never had the pleasure of responding to [Russia's] ridiculous internet disinformation in person before. Thank you for the opportunity.""

""I am amazed at the nerve that some people have to not be upset with the country literally waging war, but at the country defending itself and those helping them do that,"" she added in another tweet. ""I was even told by one of these people tonight, 'it’s America that started the Russia war', seriously wtf.""

Despite her current support, Omar initially expressed skepticism about America's role in the Ukraine-Russia conflict and voted against a Ukrainian aid package back in early February. The U.S. has since sent tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine.

Omar's contentious town hall marks the second time in recent weeks that a member of the Squad has been confronted about her support for funding the war in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was similarly challenged about her pro-war voting record at a town hall event.

Impeachment again? GOP senator warns what will happen if Joe Biden wins presidency,"If Joe Biden wins the presidency in 2020, then he will open himself up to impeachment, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said Sunday.

Ernst told Bloomberg News that Democrats, in pursing a partisan impeachment against President Donald Trump, have opened the door to future cavalier impeachment endeavors.

""I think this door of impeachable whatever has been opened,"" Ernst said. ""Joe Biden should be very careful what he's asking for because, you know, we can have a situation where if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people, right the day after he would be elected would be saying, 'Well, we're going to impeach him.'""

Ernst explained that Biden would be impeached ""for being assigned to take on Ukrainian corruption yet turning a blind eye to Burisma because his son was on the board making over a million dollars a year.""

More from Bloomberg:

President Barack Obama sent Biden to Ukraine on his behalf to fight corruption, including leading the push from the U.S. and western European powers to remove prosecutor general Viktor Shokin from office. When Shokin was fired in 2016, no congressional Republicans expressed concern about the move.



Eventually, though, Shokin began to argue that he was fired because he was investigating Burisma and Biden wanted to protect his son, Hunter, who was on the company's board.

In response to Ernst, Biden campaign communications director Kate Bedingfield did not address Ernst's comments directly, instead urging Iowans to caucus for Biden.

""Iowans have the chance tomorrow to say the words that Donald Trump and Joni Ernst fear most: I'm here to caucus for Joe Biden,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment-again-gop-senator-warns-what-will-happen-if-joe-biden-wins-presidency,2020-02-02
"Impeachment effort began before Trump was elected, Democratic congressman says","Democrats have been searching for ways to impeach President Donald Trump since before he was elected, a Democratic congressman said, and the Ukraine situation just happened to be the first thing that gained enough political momentum to pull it off.

Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) has submitted articles of impeachment to the House more than once during President Trump's first term — evidence that impeachment was being wielded by Democrats as a political weapon rather than a legitimate constitutional measure against executive misconduct. But attempts to find grounds for impeachment preceded even Election Day.

Green was responding to MSNBC's Chris Hayes asking him to defend himself against Republican accusations that Democrats ""reverse engineered"" impeachment by searching for a set of facts to fit an impeachment narrative. Instead of refuting that accusation, Green confirmed its accuracy.

""Well, the genesis of impeachment, to be very candid with you, was when the president was running for office,"" Green told Hayes on Monday before going on to list numerous Republicans who have been critical of the president in the past. ""With those things in mind and with the president's behavior before us, firing Mr. [James] Comey who was investigating the intrusion of Russia into his campaign, our election, that was something that was not to be tolerated.

""And the president has continued to try to thwart the efforts of Congress to investigate with Mr. [Robert] Mueller. The president, by and through his White House counsel, tried to get this done again to deal with Mr. Mueller to extricate him, to remove him from the process.""

Al Green Say Genesis of Impeachment Was When Trump Was First Running For Office youtu.be

Green's transparency about Democrats' partisan weaponization of impeachment, as well as his openness to impeaching President Trump again later for some expected future offense(s), undermines claims by party leaders such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who have tried to emphasize how reluctant they have been to move forward with impeachment.

Impeachment hearing ends with Jerry Nadler stealing closing remarks from Adam Schiff: 'Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.',"The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump appears to be drawing to a close, and the Democratic House impeachment managers — perhaps frustrated by the seemingly inevitable failure of their efforts to result in Trump's removal — appear to be at odds with one another.

At the end of Thursday night's hearing, during which President Trump's defense team and the House managers fielded written questions from senators, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) stole the spotlight from House Intelligence Committee Chairman and lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

A Democratic senator asked the House managers to respond to a previous answer from the president's lawyers, and asked them to offer any other information they felt senators needed to hear before adjourning for the evening. It was, in effect, an open invitation for an impeachment manager to offer closing remarks to end the questioning segment of the trial.

Nadler hopped out of his seat and walked briskly to the podium. As he sped by, Schiff tried to stop him. ""Jerry. Jerry. Jerry,"" Schiff called out — but Nadler would not be denied. He ignored Schiff, went to the podium, and began addressing Chief Justice John Roberts and the Senate.

Schiff and Nadler were, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most significant people leading the House impeachment effort. However, there has been some evidence of tension between the two men.



The decision to have Schiff's Intelligence Committee take the lead in the high-profile impeachment inquiry hearings was seen by some as both unusual, and an indictment of Nadler's ability to handle such an important task as impeachment. The Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings, which occurred later in the process, were much less significant.

During a debate early in the trial over whether to hear testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton, Nadler accused senators of voting for a ""cover-up,"" an allegation that offended some senators and led Roberts to admonish both sides to conduct themselves appropriately when addressing the Senate.

When a reporter tried to ask Nadler about that situation on Wednesday during a news conference, Schiff stepped in and prevented Nadler from speaking for himself, saying, ""I'm going to respond to the questions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment-hearing-ends-with-jerry-nadler-stealing-closing-remarks-from-adam-schiff,2020-01-31
"House Dems circle back to Mueller report in attempt to bolster impeachment effort, want to know if President Trump lied to special counsel","As the House Intelligence Committee continues impeachment inquiry hearings related to President Donald Trump's actions toward Ukraine, House lawyers are fighting in court to get redacted information from the Mueller report that they believe could be evidence that the president lied in his written testimony, according to CNN.

A House lawyer argued in federal court Monday that the House Judiciary Committee needed access to Mueller grand jury material to determine the truthfulness of the written testimony Trump submitted to Mueller for his investigation into Russian collusion and election interference.

President Trump's former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates testified during the recently concluded trial of Roger Stone that Trump and Stone had discussed the impending release of information beneficial to Trump's 2016 campaign, around the same time Stone was working to get information from stolen Democratic documents obtained by WikiLeaks.

House Democrats believe that a redacted portion of the Mueller report in which former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort appears to discuss Trump and WikiLeaks is crucial to their investigation into whether Trump potentially lied or obstructed justice.

According to House general counsel Douglas Letter, Manafort's ""situation shows so clearly that there is evidence, very sadly, that the President might have provided untruthful answers and this is a key part of the impeachment inquiry.""

A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit questioned both sides on the issue, asking why the Justice Department felt it should not release the grand jury information, and calling for House investigators to justify its need for the information, particularly in light of concerns about public leaks.

The House impeachment inquiry, led by the Intelligence Committee, continues with several public hearings this week. At the conclusion of Intelligence Committee hearings, whether they end this week or later, the Judiciary Committee will review the resulting report and may hold some hearings of its own before potentially drawing up articles of impeachment to be voted on by the full House.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment-house-dems-circle-back-to-mueller-report,2019-11-18
"Impeachment manager says Democrats will subpoena Bolton, continue investigating Trump after Senate acquittal","Impeachment is set to end Wednesday. As senators make their speeches before the final vote, the only real uncertainty is whether a couple of moderate Democrats will vote to acquit President Donald Trump along with most or all Republicans.

But the resistance will continue, according to Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), impeachment manager and House Judiciary Committee chairman.

CNN's Manu Raju asked Nadler about the party's next moves after the impeachment trial ends, and Nadler responded that it is ""likely"" that Democrats will subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton and continue investigating the president even after he is acquitted.

""First of all, I think when you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore and you have to spotlight that. You have to protect the Constitution, whatever the political consequences. Second of all, no, as more and more lawlessness comes out, I presume the public will understand that,"" Nadler said.

House Democrats declined to fully pursue Bolton's testimony during the impeachment inquiry due to the prospect of a lengthy legal battle, despite clear indications from other witnesses that Bolton was one of three or four primary officials who had full knowledge of Ukraine dealings and direct contact with the president on the subject.

So, instead of testifying under oath, Bolton is attempting to publish a book in which he reportedly affirms the Democratic allegation that Trump wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine until President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to announce or open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Bolton said he would testify before the Senate if he were subpoenaed, but the Senate voted against hearing from new witnesses during the trial.

So, as impeachment goes the way of the Robert Mueller report, Democrats will continue to pursue accusations of corruption by President Trump, even as the election approaches. And, if he is re-elected in November, four more years of Trump may yield four more years of House investigations — unless Republicans regain the majority.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment-manager-says-democrats-will-subpoena-bolton-continue-investigating-trump-after-senate-acquittal,2020-02-05
Impeachment witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman escorted from the White House,"National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was escorted from the White House on Friday afternoon and his ""job is over,"" according to his attorney, in retaliation for testifying during the House impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

President Trump was acquitted in the Senate earlier this week, and had already signaled that Vindman could be on his way out the door.

What are the details?

Lt. Col. Vindman's attorney, David Pressman, issued a statement saying, in part:

Today, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted out of the White House where he has dutifully served his country and his President. He does so having spoken publicly once, and only pursuant to a subpoena from the United States Congress.

There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House. LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor ,his commitment to right, frightened the powerful. During his decades of service to this country, LTC Alexander Vindman has served quietly but dutifully, and he has served with honor. He came into the public eye only when subpoenaed to testify before Congress, and he did what the law commanded.



Pressman added:

The truth has cost LTC Alexander Vindman his job, his career, and his privacy. He did what any member of our military is charged with doing every day: he followed orders, he obeyed his oath, and he served his country, even when doing so was fraught with danger and personal peril. And for that, the most powerful man in the world - buoyed by the silent, the pliable, and the complicit - has decided to exact revenge.

According to The Washington Post, Vindman had already informed NSC officials that he intended to leave his post by the end of the month, ""but [President] Trump (was) eager to make a symbol of the Army officer sooner after the Senate acquitted him of the impeachment charges approved by House Democrats.""

NPR reported that earlier in the day on Friday, President Trump told reporters of Vindman, ""I'm not happy with him. You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not."" Regarding the prospect of whether the NSC aide would remain at the White House, the president said, ""They'll make that decision. You'll be hearing.""

Anything else?

Lt. Col. Vindman is a 20-year Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served in the Iraq War. He is an expert on Ukraine, his birth country, and was on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski that House Democrats used to launch an impeachment probe against President Trump.

PBS noted that during his testimony before Congress, Vindman ""testified that he didn't think it was 'proper' for Trump to 'demand' that a foreign government investigate' former Vice President Joe Biden and his son's dealings with the energy company Burisma in Ukraine.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment-witness-lt-col-alexander-vindman-escorted-from-the-white-house,2020-02-07
Pelosi leaves the door open for new articles of impeachment against President Trump,"Here we go again.

In an interview on Sunday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) left the door open to new articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

Pelosi was asked by ABC's George Stephanopoulos, ""You said he has violated the constitution again and again. Do you think it's possible the House may have to file new articles of impeachment?""

""Well, let's just see what the Senate does,"" the Pelosi responded.

Pelosi added, ""The ball will be in their court soon, and as I say, the American people have been very fair in saying 'yes, we do want to see witnesses.' That wasn't part of the discussion three weeks ago.""

What's happening?

House Democrats impeached Trump on Dec. 18, 2019, alleging the president had engaged in ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" in his dealings with Ukraine. Democrats approved two articles of impeachment against the president: obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.

The impeachment vote broke along party lines and not a single Republican backed the measures.

The constitutional process for impeachment is that the House sends the approved articles of impeachment to the Senate, which is tasked with conducting a trial to determine whether the president or federal official should be removed from office. Pelosi has yet to formally submit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, though.

Pelosi was said to be holding on to the articles of impeachment to try to influence how the Senate would conduct its trial. However, as TheBlaze's Nate Madden reported, the House Speaker said during a press briefing with reporters on Thursday that she will send them to the Senate ""when I'm ready,"" which ""will probably be soon.""

Politico reported on Friday that Pelosi will be sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate this week.

""I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate,"" she said in a letter to House Democrats.

Republicans respond to Pelosi

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said that the Senate cannot hold a trial until the House submits the articles of impeachment. He has also described the notion of Pelosi dictating terms to the Senate as a ""fantasy.""



Earlier in the week, McConnell announced that Senate Republicans had sufficient votes to agree to ""phase one"" of a trial without having to accept Democrats' demands on the process.

Reacting to Friday's news, McConnell said on Friday that he was ""glad"" the articles of impeachment were finally being sent to the Senate.

""We've been anxious to get started ... how many weeks has it been now?"" McConnell told reporters. ""It's been a long wait, I'm glad it's over.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment_trial_pelosi,2020-01-12
"In case of nuclear attack, government advises face masks and social distancing in shelters","In the case of nuclear war, the federal government wants Americans to know they should social distance and wear face masks when sheltering from nuclear fallout.

Wait, what?

The Ready Campaign, a government program meant to prepare Americans for emergencies, advises Americans to maintain six feet of social distancing and to wear face masks when sheltering indoors to avoid nuclear fallout.

Nuclear fallout is the dangerous aftermath of a nuclear explosion, when the highly toxic radioactive particles expelled into the atmosphere fall back to earth.

According to the Ready Campaign, you should find shelter in the nearest brick or concrete shelter following a nuclear explosion. After removing contaminated clothing and washing areas of unprotected skin, you should protect yourselves from COVID-19.

""Go to the basement or middle of the building. Stay away from the outer walls and roof. Try to maintain a distance of at least six feet between yourself and people who are not part of your household. If possible, wear a mask if you’re sheltering with people who are not a part of your household. Children under two years old, people who have trouble breathing, and those who are unable to remove masks on their own should not wear them,"" the recommendations say.

""Stay inside for 24 hours unless local authorities provide other instructions. Continue to practice social distancing by wearing a mask and by keeping a distance of at least six feet between yourself and people who not part of your household,"" they continue.

And in the case that authorities mandate evacuation to an emergency shelter, the government wants you to bring resources to stop the spread of COVID-19.

""If you are told by authorities to evacuate to a public shelter, try to bring items that can help protect yourself and your family from COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol, cleaning materials, and two masks per person,"" the government says.

The website indicates that it was last updated on Feb. 25, but was updated in November 2020 to include information related to COVID-19.

What is the background?

The threat of nuclear war has reached its highest point in decades over the weekend after Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russian nuclear forces on high alert.

India and Russia working to launch a rupee-ruble trade agreement that circumvents Western sanctions and weakens the dollar's global standing,"The government of India is expected to announce an agreement with its counterparts in Russia that will allow the countries to continue trading with one another while circumventing Western sanctions on Russia.

In a move that will surely shake up the global economy, the two countries are working on establishing a trade agreement that removes the U.S. dollar from the equation. CNBC reported that in order to continue conducting business with one another, India and Russia are going to implement a rupee-ruble trade mechanism.

This mechanism will eliminate the countries' reliance upon the SWIFT telecommunication network to conduct trade with each other, and it will provide them with an additional layer of security that prevents Western nations from meddling in their business affairs.

The rupee-ruble trade mechanism would also allow India to continue buying Russian energy exports when many global leaders have forbidden its import.

Dr. A Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, said that the Indian government is working on a proposal to allow ""four to five nationalized Indian banks"" to be engaged directly in trade with Russia. He said that the country's central bank governor and the finance minister have been in conversations with the banks to get lay the groundwork for the rupee-ruble mechanism.

Sakthivel suggested that the Western sanctions placed on Russia provide Indian exporters with an opportunity to grow their presence in the Russian market.

He said, ""Export to Russia is not much, only in agriculture and pharmacy products. Now that the whole of the West is banning Russia, there will be a lot of opportunities for Indian firms to enter Russia.""

Despite making logistical sense, India's move runs the risk of angering Western nations with whom the South Asian country still does business.

The United States, for instance, is India's largest market for exports. According to official government data, in 2021, the United States bought $71 billion worth of goods from India.

Conversely, Russia imported a measly $3.3 billion worth of goods from India in the same year. Most of these purchases were pharmaceutical products and exotic regional beverages like coffee and tea.

Historically, India and Russia have had a close relationship, and in an era of heightened geopolitical tension, it is unlikely that the Indian government is going to stop importing 85% of its military equipment from Russia or Russia's close allies.

That said, India's official stance of neutrality on the Russian invasion of Ukraine has angered its Western allies, and strengthening its economic relationship with Russia runs the risk of eliciting Western retaliation.

Sakthivel said, ""The government will take into account all the factors. The government is playing it very carefully.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/india-russia-rupee-ruble-trade-agreement-circumvents-sanctions,2022-03-29
"India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, bans all wheat exports after record-breaking heat wave","India has banned all wheat exports following a widespread heat wave that affected the country’s supply of the crop.

A notice that was sent out in the government gazette by the directorate of foreign trade on Friday said the food security of India, and its neighboring and vulnerable countries was being threatened by the rise in global wheat prices. Global wheat prices have increased by more than 40% since the beginning of the year.

The Guardian reported that one of the Indian government’s key aims is to control the rising cost of domestic food prices.

Prior to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the two countries accounted for a third of global wheat and barley exports. Since Russia’s February invasion, Ukraine’s ports have been blocked and civilian infrastructure and many grain silos have been destroyed.

Western nations have also issued thorough sanctions on Russia, making trade with the country incredibly difficult.

While Russian and Ukrainian wheat exports were being tied up due to war, India’s own wheat harvest experienced stunted production rates due to a record-breaking heat wave.

Even though India is the world’s second-largest producer of wheat, its population consumes the lion’s share of the crop it produces. Hoping to capitalize on the global disruption of supply chains and decreased wheat access due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Indian government had set a goal of exporting 10 million tons of domestically produced grain in 2022-23.

Indian wheat producers were preparing to find new markets for their product in Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, this plan has been halted for the foreseeable future. Much of the wheat and barley that was expected to be exported in this lot would have been sent to developing countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

The recent heat wave, however, wasn’t the only issue facing India’s wheat supply. The country’s historically vast stocks of wheat and barley — which in years past have served the country well as a reliable buffer against famine — became strained during the COVID-19 pandemic as the Indian government began to dole out grain to roughly 800 million people.

The Indian government needs about 25 million tons of wheat and barley each year for its extensive food welfare program that usually feeds more than 80 million people annually.

Statista reported that in 2018-2019, the United States had the fifth-largest production volume of wheat worldwide at 51.29 metric tons.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/india-the-world-s-second-largest-wheat-producer-bans-all-wheat-exports-after-record-breaking-heat-wave,2022-05-14
"Inflation breaks another record, 64% of Americans now living paycheck to paycheck in the Biden economy","Inflation kept getting worse in February, as price increases broke new records with no sign of slowing down.

The consumer price index increased 7.9% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday, reaching a new 40-year high for the measure of a wide range of U.S. goods and services prices. The gain for the month of February was 0.8%.

Inflation rose at the fastest rate since 1982, when there was an economic recession, beating the record set in January. Price increases for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest contributors to the overall CPI increase.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected inflation to increase 7.8% for the year and 0.7% for the month, so their predictions underestimated the actual inflation rate.

Gasoline prices rose 6.6% in February, a significant spike that comes amid war between Russia and Ukraine and harsh U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in response. The price consumers pay at the pump has gone up about 24% over the past month and 53% in the past year, according to the American Automobile Association.

Food prices increased 1% for the fastest monthly gain since April 2020, which was shortly after COVID-19 lockdowns began to go into effect. Shelter costs increased 0.5% in February and a total of 4.7% over the past year, which was the largest annual increase since May 1991.

While wages are rising as well, any increase in worker paychecks is being erased by higher prices at the gas pump and the grocery store. At face value, wages rose 5.1% over last year. But adjusted for inflation, average hourly earnings actually fell by 0.8% in February and decreased by 2.6% over the past year, according to BLS data.

Most Americans have effectively taken a pay cut because of inflation, and that's showing in the cost of living. A recent report by LendingCLub found that at the start of 2022, 64% of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, up from 61% in December and approaching the high of 65% from 2020.

As it turns out, inflation was not ""transitory,"" as many policymakers had suggested last year. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce the first of a series of interest rate hikes next year in an attempt to combat rising prices. It will be the first interest rate increase in more than three years and a reversal of the Fed's zero interest rate policy, according to CNBC.

"Inflation surged to 8.5% in March, fastest increase in more than 40 years","Consumer prices rose 8.5% through March, marking the fastest inflation increase since 1981.

The New York Times reported that the “stubbornly rapid price increases have been exacerbated by a surge in gas costs tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” with the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. peaking at $4.33 on March 11.

However, as the Times noted, “gas is not the entire story.”

Without accounting for the volatility of fuel and food, core prices rose 6.5% in the year through March, which is up from 6.4% in the year through February.

Citing data from the Consumer Price Index, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that energy costs increased an average of 32%, with energy commodities (crude oil, ethanol, electricity, etc.) increasing by 48.3% and energy services by 13.5%.

Food has increased by an average of 8%, with groceries increasing by 10% and “food away from home” by 6.9%.

Clothing has increased 6.8%, new vehicles set a historic record with a 12.5% increase, used cars and trucks are up just over 35%, “medical care commodities” have increased in price by 2.7%, and medical services have increased 2.9%.

The cost of housing increased 5%.

Prominent conservative figures were quick to comment on the numbers. Florida’s popular Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, took aim at President Joe Biden’s energy policy and the federal government’s spending habits.

DeSantis said, “Inflation is at a 40-year high of 8.5% due to federal policies of borrowing and printing money at unfathomable levels and bad energy policy, which is hurting Floridians. Biden could unleash domestic energy production to provide relief. Instead, he is content watching people suffer.”

Podcast host and pundit Jack Posobiec said that the “White House wants to blame inflation on the Russia-Ukraine war in Eastern Europe but the US itself went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and more and we didn’t see inflation like this from it.”

Robert Sprague, the current Republican treasurer for the state of Ohio, said, “Inflation isn’t just hurting consumers. It’s hurting our businesses, and it’s leading to shortages, delays, and spikes in prices.”

Gregory Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young’s strategy consultancy EY-Parthenon, told the Times that “these numbers are likely to represent something of a peak” in inflation as consumers begin to stop purchasing goods in response to higher prices.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/inflation-march-fastest-increase-in-more-than-40-years,2022-04-12
DNI: 'No intelligence' that Hunter Biden laptop story is 'part of some Russian disinformation campaign’,"Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe fired back at Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and other top Democrats Monday by clarifying that the bombshell reports on a laptop allegedly tied to Hunter Biden are ""not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.""

Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, recently told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the reports, which stem from a hard drive that has an alleged connection to former Vice President Joe Biden's son, are actually Russian propaganda. Schiff, along with other Democrats who parroted the narrative, did not supply any evidence for their claims.

According to Ratcliffe, that's because there isn't any.

Speaking with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo on Monday, Ratcliffe said, ""Let me be clear, the intelligence community doesn't believe that, because there's no intelligence that supports that, and we have shared no intelligence with Chairman Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden's laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign — it's simply not true.""



""Apparently Chairman Schiff wants anything against his preferred political candidate to be deemed as not real and is ... attempting to use the intelligence community to say 'There's nothing to see here,'"" Ratcliffe continued. ""Don't drag the intelligence community into this; Hunter Biden's laptop is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.""

In the interview with CNN, Schiff declared, ""We know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin. That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative about the vice president and his son.""

Ratcliffe suggested that is patently false, arguing that ""the only intelligence that Adam Schiff gets is the intelligence that we, the intelligence community, give him, and we have given him no such intelligence.""

""Members of Congress have the ability and have a platform to say things, and to say those things not under oath and to make representations to the American people. Unfortunately, sometimes the things that they say and the things that they represent are not true,"" the DNI pointed out. ""In this case, with regard to Hunter Biden's laptop being part of a Russian disinformation campaign and the intelligence community believing that or assessing that, [it] is simply not true.""

The controversy surrounding the laptop was first reported by the New York Post last week. In a series of articles, the Post disclosed emails and text messages purportedly demonstrating how Hunter Biden was cashing in on his father's high-profile government position, making business deals in Ukraine, China, and elsewhere under the promise of political leverage.

The Post reportedly obtained a copy of the hard drive from President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, after it was allegedly dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved. The repair shop owner reportedly gave a copy of the hard drive to Giuliani and handed over the hard drive to the FBI, as well.

Trump blasts Dems after House panel plans impeachment vote while he's overseas,"President Donald Trump blasted House Democrats for scheduling an impeachment vote while he will be on an overseas visit after news broke on Saturday that the House Intelligence Committee will vote on Tuesday on the findings of a report detailing the investigation of his dealings with Ukraine.

According to Politico, the procedure is an important step in Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile, an internal memo sent to the committee members over the weekend stated that lawmakers on the panel will be afforded 24 hours to review the report.

A committee official told The Hill: ""We expect to allow HPSCI Members to view a draft report in committee spaces beginning Monday evening. On Tuesday, the Committee will hold a business meeting, following our regularly scheduled briefing, at 6 pm to consider and adopt the report. The report — along with any Minority Views — will then be forwarded to the Judiciary Committee pursuant to H.Res. 660.""

A party-line vote expected



NBC News reports that House Intelligence Committee members will be able to view a draft of the report beginning late Monday. The committee will then vote at 6:00 p.m. Tuesday, once Congress returns from its Thanksgiving holiday. The report will presumably contain testimonies from 17 witnesses that House investigators interviewed in the process. Most of them are officials in the State Department and National Security Council.

It is expected that the committee will approve the committee's findings on Tuesday on a party-line vote, a formality in the impeachment process. The matter would then head over to the House Judiciary Committee, which is anticipated will draft and consider articles of impeachment beginning Wednesday.

Trump blasts Democrats



Trump blasted the process in a tweet on Saturday night and accused the House of intentionally scheduling the proceedings while he is overseas.

""I will be representing our Country in London at NATO, while the Democrats are holding the most ridiculous Impeachment hearings in history,"" the president tweeted. ""Read the Transcripts, NOTHING was done or said wrong! The Radical Left is undercutting our Country. Hearings scheduled on same dates as NATO!""

Possible new charges

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is said to be preparing the report in such a way that allows the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment for allegations of ""obstruction of Congress.""

""As the evidence conclusively shows, President Trump conditioned official acts—a White House meeting desperately desired by the new Ukrainian president and critical U.S. military assistance—on Ukraine announcing sham, politically-motivated investigations that would help President Trump's 2020 reelection campaign,"" Schiff wrote Monday.

Schiff added that a ""dozen witnesses have defied lawmakers' subpoenas in what Schiff alleged was ""an unprecedented campaign of obstruction.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/intelligence_committee_report_monday,2019-12-01
"International airlines cancel flights to Ukraine, fearing Russian violence","Airlines are canceling and diverting flights to Ukraine as the international community increasingly dears an imminent Russian invasion.

Notably, the Dutch airline KLM a subsidiary of Air France KLM has ceased service to Ukraine. Reuters reports that the Dutch airline announced that it would no longer be chartering flights to Ukraine shortly after the government of the Netherlands told Dutch citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as they possibly can.

Germany’s largest commercial airline and the second-largest airline in Europe, Lufthansa, began rescheduling flights to Kyiv in late January, citing the ongoing “problems” preventing airline staff from staying overnight in the Ukrainian capital.

Reuters reports that the United States Federal Aviation Administration has also instituted a ban on U.S. airlines flying over specific parts of Ukraine’s eastern region.

The Associated Press reports that SkyUp, a Ukrainian charter airline, said that a flight from Madeira, Portugal to Kyiv was diverted to the capital city of Moldova after the plane’s lessor banned flights into Ukrainian airspace.

In 2014, a Malaysia Airlines flight, providing service from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian and Dutch officials accused Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine of shooting down the jet with a surface-to-air missile manufactured by the Russians.

There were no survivors.

On Saturday, President Joe Biden had an hourlong phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden allegedly told Putin that there would be “widespread human suffering” should Russia invade Ukraine.

Biden also reportedly told Putin that Western nations were committed to finding a diplomatic way to end the ongoing debacle but that they stand ready for military intervention should it become necessary. Biden said the West is “equally prepared for other scenarios” should diplomacy fail.

The United States and its allies in NATO currently have no plans to send troops to Ukraine.

Russian leadership continues to deny that it intends to invade Ukraine, but it continues to amass military forces along the Ukrainian border. Russian troops have also been sent to Belarus to conduct military exercises.

The United States believes that Russia has amassed enough firepower along the Ukrainian borders that they could invade the country on short notice.

Should armed conflict occur following a Russian invasion of Ukraine the aftermath will affect far more than just Russia and Ukraine.

Iran's foreign minister echoes Dem talking points in shifting blame for passenger jet shot down by Iran,"Iran finally admitted late Friday that it is responsible for the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed outside Tehran on Wednesday after American intelligence indicated that an Iranian missile targeted the plane, killing all 176 on board.

However, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif later took to social media to regurgitate the talking points of some Democrats this week, shifting blame for the downed airliner onto the United States.

""A sad day. Preliminary conclusions of internal investigation by Armed Forces: Human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster,"" Zarif said.

The claim echoes allegations made this week by many of President Donald Trump's political opponents that Trump is ultimately responsible for the downed plane because he provoked Iran by authorizing the airstrike that killed Qassem Soleimani, Iran's chief terrorism architect.

On Friday, Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier (Calif.) claimed the downed jet ""is yet another example of collateral damage from the actions that have been taken in a provocative way by the president of the United States.""

Meanwhile, Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg said, ""Innocent civilians are now dead because they were caught in the middle of an unnecessary and unwanted military tit for tat.""

"Iran military reportedly fired a missile at its own ship, accidentally killing dozens of Iranian sailors","An Iranian military vessel was reportedly struck and sunk by a friendly fire missile Sunday, killing at least 19 Iranian sailors and wounding 15 others.

The incident, which Iranian media are characterizing as accidental, occurred during a training exercise in the Gulf of Oman, the Jerusalem Post reported. During the exercise, the frigate Jamaran reportedly opened fire on the missile boat Konarak, which had an estimated 40 military personnel on board at the time.

""The scope of the incident is under investigation by experts,"" Iran's Navy said in a statement, according to the New York Times.

The Times report added that the apparent mistake has drawn criticism on social media, especially due to its close proximity of another catastrophic mistake by the Iranian military — the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger jet in January, killing all 176 passengers onboard.

""Firing at your own targets, whether military or civil, in such a short space of time is not human error. It's a catastrophic failure of management and command,"" Maziar Khosravi, a pro-reform journalist, tweeted, according to the Times.

Anything else?

The Iranian military regularly conducts training exercises in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, often in order to demonstrate its military might to the United States amid rising tensions between the two countries.

Last month — after Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels swarmed U.S. ships in international waters — President Donald Trump instructed the U.S. Navy to ""shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats"" that harass American ships at sea.

In response, IRGC commander in chief Major-General Hossein Salami ordered the destruction of any American war ships that threaten Iran.

Iran nuclear deal talks put on 'pause' after Russia demands sanctions exemption,"Negotiations on a revived Iran nuclear deal were put on ""pause"" Friday after Russia made several new demands and raised objections to the economic sanctions enacted as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.

European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell Fontelles announced the delayed talks in a tweet, writing, ""A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors."" He added that the final text of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran's nuclear program is ""essentially ready and on the table,"" pending resumed talks. Since assuming power, President Joe Biden's administration has worked with European partners, including Russia, and Iran to hammer out the details of a new arrangement after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal reached by the Obama administration.

As part of the new deal, the U.S. would end the harsh sanctions Trump imposed on Iran and in return Iran would scale back its nuclear program.



According to the Washington Post, the negotiations were halted after Russia issued a series of demands Saturday for its trade deals with Iran to be exempted from U.S. sanctions. Russia says these exemptions must be included as a condition for participating in any revived nuclear deal.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov cited the ""avalanche of aggressive sanctions [on Russia] that the west has started spewing out,"" and said, ""This meant Moscow had to ask the US for guarantees first, requiring a clear answer that the new sanctions will not affect its rights under the nuclear deal.

“We requested that our US colleagues ... give us written guarantees at the minimum level of the secretary of state that the current [sanctions] process launched by the US will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with Iran,” he said, according to the Guardian.

Western officials have accused Russia of essentially taking the Iran nuclear deal hostage while the country continues its unjust war in Ukraine. Some are worried that Russia's late objections will prevent talks from resuming, which could kill the deal.

“It’s certainly serious. If you lose momentum at this late stage the dynamics shift in ways that it could become impossible to resume the talks,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of the European Council on Foreign Relations,"" according to the Washington Post.

Republicans have lambasted President Biden for negotiating with Russia on the Iran deal while simultaneously insisting that Russia become an international ""pariah"" for continuing the invasion of Ukraine. At a press conference Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said the Iran deal would be ""a massive win for Vladimir Putin"" if it includes ""a carveout"" for Russia to trade with Iran without threat of sanctions. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) called on Biden to walk away from the negotiations, and other GOP senators joined in with severe rebukes of the president.

Diplomats that spoke to the Washington Post said that informal talks are expected to continue and considerations will be made as to whether a final deal can be achieved without Russia. But Tehran has said it will not risk deteriorating relations with Russia by ignoring Moscow's concerns, making any deal difficult to achieve.

"Amid Russian invasion of Ukraine, Peter Schiff suggests that while 'times are hard,' Ukrainian President Zelenskyy should have worn a suit while addressing the US Congress","Peter Schiff faced significant backlash Wednesday on Twitter for posting a tweet suggesting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who delivered an address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, should have worn a suit instead of a t-shirt.

""I understand times are hard, but doesn't the President of the #Ukraine own a suit? I don't have much respect for current members of the U.S. Congress either, but I still wouldn't address them wearing a t-shirt. I wouldn't want to disrespect the institution or the Unites States,"" wrote Schiff, an economic and financial pundit who hosts ""The Peter Schiff Show"" podcast. Schiff is the chief economist and global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital.

Zelenskyy's address, and Schiff's comment about the man's attire, came as Russia continues to brutally bombard Ukraine, killing many, including civilians.

Schiff, who faced heavy pushback on social media, defended his comments.

""Peter, I agree with you on countless issues, but the guy is in the midst of war....I think it’s understandable and acceptable. Few in our congress would go to the frontlines of war...."" one person tweeted.

""If he was speaking live from a foxhole I would agree. But this was a planned historic event. He was not under fire. It makes no sense that he could not have dressed in something more formal than a t-shirt,"" Schiff replied.

""Dude, not only is he in a war-zone, where I'm sure it's hard to get a suit press and dry clean, but even if it was possible, it's favorable for people to see him as one of them sharing the struggle,"" someone else commented.



Schiff replied, ""He would not have had to press a suit. I'm sure he had a clean suit hanging in the same closet as his t-shirts. Plus even if there were not suits available, maybe a long-sleeved shirt with a collar.""

GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger responded to Schiff's suggestion that the Ukrainian leader should have stepped up his attire for the speech: ""I'm ok with it man. You know, war and all,"" Kinzinger tweeted.



""Imagine not just thinking this, but sending it out into the universe. What an ass. 'Times are hard' is the takeaway when Ukrainian lives are being destroyed simply for wanting to exist without intrusion? Talk about privilege. Here’s an example,"" Kimberly Ross tweeted.

Is war coming between Russia and Ukraine? Here's what that could mean for you,"President Joe Biden held a rare video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as tensions mount between Russia and neighboring Ukraine.

For months now, Russia has built up troops on its border with Ukraine, sparking fears in the international community that the former Soviet superpower intends to invade. Satellite images reported by Insider in November showed Russian personnel and equipment including tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers deployed to the Pogonovo training area and Yelnya in Russia and Novoozernoye in Crimea.



A recent U.S. intelligence estimate first reported by the Washington Post found that Moscow is planning a multi-front offensive against Ukraine as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops. Russia has demanded that the U.S. guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO and that the military alliance further refrain from certain military activities in and around Ukrainian territory.

Moscow has denied having plans to invade, despite having the clear capability to do so.

Though few analysts in either the West or the East believed a breakthrough would happen in the talks, Biden was reportedly ready to attempt to dissuade Putin from invading. The president was expected to threaten Russia with various sanctions and other punishing economic actions should it go through with any plans to attack Ukraine. U.S. intelligence believes that Putin has not made up his mind to launch a military offensive, and Biden was reportedly set to tell him the U.S. is prepared to take ""substantive economic countermeasures"" that will inflict ""significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy"" should an invasion happen, a senior administration official told reporters Monday.



The two world leaders spoke for about two hours, beginning at 10:07 a.m. ET and ending at 12:08 p.m. ET, the White House said.

Is Russia about to go to war?

There are good reasons to hope for peace and good reasons to believe Russia means war.

The troop buildup on Ukraine's borders is not unprecedented. Russia sent roughly 100,000 troops there last April as part of a military exercise before pulling those troops back and announcing that they had ""demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defense for the country."" Military leaders and Western analysts interpreted Russia's actions at the time as saber-rattling.

It may be the case that Russia simply wants to bring the U.S. to the table to make demands. After April's military exercise, Biden met with Putin in person for a summit in Geneva last June. Since then their last publicly known conversation was in July.

Russia has previously complained about ""aggression"" from Western countries because of U.S. and NATO naval patrols in the Black Sea and U.S. and British soldiers being present in Ukraine on training missions. Putin said last week that during Tuesday's meeting he would ask Biden for specific agreements that would prohibit NATO from expanding eastward or deploying weapons near Russia's borders.

But Biden is not likely to agree to Russia's demands that NATO must not admit Ukraine to the alliance. And Ukraine's desire to build stronger ties with the West may be what ultimately provokes Russia to act.

Ukraine is at the center of a geopolitical rivalry between the East and the West. The nation was the second-most populous and powerful of the 15 communist states that made up the Soviet Union, with important agricultural, industrial, and military resources. But it has deep ties to Russia that go back all the way to the Middle Ages — Russia traces its founding to the Ukrainian city of Kyiv.

The country itself is divided. Its western half has a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population that favors greater relations with Western Europe. But a largely Russian-speaking population in the east wants closer ties with Russia. There is ongoing violent conflict in the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are fighting against the pro-Western government.

Russia would like to see Ukraine come under its control once again. Putin once famously said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."" He seeks to restore Russia to the perceived greatness of the Soviet Union as a superpower, after decades of humiliation following the collapse of the union.

In 2014, under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was in the eastern region of Ukraine, becoming the first European state to annex the territory of another sovereign state since World War II.

Russia could attempt to take more territory from Ukraine under the same pretext, especially if it views the pro-Western government's desire to join NATO as a national security threat. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN that there will be a ""really bloody massacre"" should Putin invade, said the West must draw a red line in Ukraine, and warned that provoking Russia ""will not work.""

Reznikov stressed that an invasion would have ""disastrous"" consequences for the rest of Europe, estimating that as many as 4 to 5 million Ukrainians could become refugees. He also emphasized that Ukraine is a major producer of food for Europe and Africa and that war would disrupt production of those supplies.

What remains unclear is whether the U.S. and the rest of the West are prepared to impose steep costs on Russia for taking such action — although the West previously demonstrated an unwillingness to fight Russia over Crimea.

What would war between Russia and Ukraine mean for me?

The United States' interests in Ukraine are to ensure that the country is stable and sovereign, to act as a buffer against Russia and discourage Putin from taking further military action against other European states.

Before the Russian annexation of Crimea, the U.S. provided Ukraine with an average of more than $200 million in foreign aid per year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. After Russia's aggressive action in 2014, Washington bolstered aid to Kyiv to more than $600 million annually. The U.S. also provides Ukraine with military training, weapons, and equipment, and NATO allies hold joint military exercises with Ukrainian forces each year.

The U.S. does not recognize Russia's claims to Crimea and has imposed economic sanctions on Russia that will not be lifted until control of the peninsula is returned to Ukraine.

Ukraine wishes to join NATO. In 2020, the country became one of six enhanced opportunity partners, a special status for close NATO allies. But it is not an official NATO ally.

War between Russia and Ukraine would test U.S. and NATO commitments. Biden's administration has already made clear there will be economic consequences for Russia's action. And Congress and other European states would almost certainly approve more foreign aid for Ukraine in the event of war, which could mean additional unfunded government spending.

But that is likely to be the extent of the Western response. It is highly improbable that military intervention from the U.S. or any other state on behalf of Ukraine is politically feasible, or even desired. The U.S. has stated its goal of helping Ukraine defend its ""sovereign territory,"" but military action is not on the table. American troops will not be deployed to fight the Russians any time soon.

If war does break out, it could lead to further disruptions in global energy markets, as Ukraine is a major producer of oil and gas. And if Ukraine's defense minister's predictions about refugees come to fruition, the U.S. may agree to accept some Ukrainian refugees.

President Biden faces the daunting task of balance. He must put enough pressure on Russia to maintain U.S. commitments to Ukraine's sovereignty and independence while avoiding making a promise or threat the U.S. will ultimately not be able to deliver. If he fails, the U.S. will look weaker, America's enemies may be emboldened to take further aggressive action, and potential allies throughout the world would be sent a signal that the United States cannot back up its promises.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/is-war-coming-between-russia-and-ukraine-heres-what-that-could-mean-for-you,2021-12-07
Israeli leadership urged Ukraine to accept Putin's peace offer and cede territory to Russia,"Israeli leadership urged their Ukrainian counterparts to accept the peace offer made to them by Vladimir Putin.

On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the phone and urged the Ukrainian president to accept an offer extended by Russia to end the military conflict, the Jerusalem Post reported.

An official with the Ukrainian government said that Zelenskyy did not accept Bennett’s advice.

Bennett reportedly said, “If I were you, I would think about the lives of my people and take the offer.”

To which Zelenskyy responded with, “I hear you.”

The same Ukrainian official told the Jerusalem Post that “Bennett told us to surrender. We have no intention of doing so. We know Putin’s offer is only the beginning.”

Russian leadership said that it would end its invasion if Ukraine ceased military actions, changed its constitution to ensure geopolitical neutrality, recognized Crimea as Russian territory, and recognized the Russian-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s office has claimed that Israel’s mediation efforts force both Ukrainian and Russian leadership to seek a more cautious and balanced approach to the conflict. In this spirit, Israeli leadership asked the Russian government to cease its requests for military and defense aid from other nations.

According to the Ukrainian official, however, Zelenskyy is growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of results from Bennett’s mediation. The official said that Zelenskyy feels as though Bennett is functioning more as a middle-man who passes along messages from parties in Russia and Ukraine without doing much to help the two nations find an agreeable compromise.

“We don’t need a mailbox,” the official said, “We have enough of those. If Bennett wants to be neutral and mediate, we would expect to see him appoint someone to work on it day and night and try to get a compromise.”

The Ukrainian ambassador to Israel — Yvgeni Kornichuk — is expected to meet with Knesset Chairman Mickey Levi to discuss the details of Zelenskyy’s planned address to Knesset members.

Previously, Kornichuk said that Israel’s mediation efforts were a valuable resource for the Ukrainian government.

He said, “Thank you for the peace effort. This is priceless for us. This is much more important than sales of weapons and of munitions, which we are still fighting for, but we understand [your reasons for not sending them].”

In a Saturday briefing, Zelenskyy reaffirmed his belief that Israeli leadership serves an important role as a mediator.

He said, “I believe [Bennett} can play an important role, because Israel is a country with a lot of history and parallels [to our situation], as well as having a large migration of Jews from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-leadership-urged-ukraine-to-accept-putin-s-peace-offer-and-cede-territory-to-russia,2022-03-12
Ivanka Trump met with Ukrainian refugees during a recent visit to Poland,"Ivanka Trump, the popular eldest daughter of former President Donald Trump, recently traveled to Poland to meet with Ukrainian refugees and deliver food to families.

The former president’s daughter shared the experience with her followers on social media, the New York Post reported.

She said, “Grateful to have spent the last few days in Krakow & Warsaw to meet Ukrainian and Polish faith leaders who have shown so much compassion & love to Ukrainian families in need & for the opportunity to bear witness to the love, strength & resilience within each of these families.”





Ms. Trump shared photos of her playing the guitar alongside a young girl, chatting with teenage refugees, and standing with a mother and her newborn child.







Her trip materialized through an invitation from CityServe, a non-profit organization that has been delivering food and aid to refugees.



The Daily Mail reported that a spokesperson for the organization said, “There [Ivanka Trump] met with dozens of pastors serving Ukrainians on the frontlines, many of which helped support the one million meal distribution in March.”

“This week, they brought meals, financial support and toys to dozens of Ukrainian families seeking both short-term and long-term refuge in Poland until they can safely return to Ukraine,” the spokesperson added.

Reportedly, Ms. Trump has been involved in several efforts to provide relief to Ukrainians in need since March. CityServe says that she has purchased and helped distribute one million meals into Ukraine and was vital in delivering several cargo planes worth of requested medical supplies that will be distributed among hospitals and clinics throughout Ukraine.

Ms. Trump is just the latest high-profile American figure to visit the Ukrainian people.

In late April, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the U.S. federal government’s role in providing the Ukrainian military with more than $300 million in financing. In early May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a delegation of Congressional Democrats met with Zelenskyy to show support for the Ukrainian government. Shortly after Pelosi’s trip to Ukraine, First Lady Jill Biden made a surprise trip to Ukraine and met with her Ukrainian counterpart, Olen Zelenska.

About a week after the first lady’s trip to Ukraine, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell led a delegation of Congressional Republicans to meet with Zelenskyy in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.

Top bank CEO slams Biden admin's 'completely backwards' anti-oil policies: 'America should have been pumping oil and gas',"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon rebuked the Biden administration's energy policies this week, condemning the push away from oil and gas.

What did Dimon say?

Speaking with CNBC, Dimon responded to the energy crisis facing Europe this winter. In his response, Dimon said the Biden administration's approach to energy is ""completely backwards.""

""Well, I think we’re getting energy completely wrong,"" he said. ""Ever since [the Russia-Ukraine] war started, you know that Europe is going to have a problem. And that it was pretty predictable that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin was going to cut off some gas and some oil, and oil price would go up.

""By the way, for the climate folks here, it’s made the climate worse because people have this bad assumption that higher oil prices and gas prices reduce consumption, reduce CO2. No,"" Dimon explained. ""Poor nations — India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam — are turning back on coal plants, as are rich nations called Germany, Netherlands, France.

""We have it completely backwards,"" the CEO declared. ""In my view, America should have been pumping oil and gas.""

So what does this meaning for wintertime energy markets? According to Dimon, reduced oil and gas production will create ""longer-term problems,"" including increasing dependence on coal for energy needs.

U.S. should pump more oil to avert war-level energy crisis, says JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon www.youtube.com

Not only did Dimon knock the Biden administration's energy policies, but he also broke with President Joe Biden on the possibility of a recession, citing inflation, interest rate hikes, and the Russian-Ukraine war.

""These are very, very serious things, which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession 6 to 9 months from now,"" Dimon said.

On the other hand, Biden says a recession won't happen.

Speaking with CNN anchor Jake Tapper in an interview that aired on Tuesday, Biden responded to the possibility of a recession with a firm ""no,"" but later softened his forecast.

""I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a slight recession,"" he said, adding, ""I don't anticipate it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jaime-dimon-biden-energy-policies,2022-10-12
CNN anchor abruptly fact-checks top Biden adviser for claiming Putin is responsible for record-high gas prices,"CNN anchor Jake Tapper called out a top Biden administration official on Monday for claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin is responsible for record-high gas prices in the United States.

What happened?

During an interview with Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, Tapper asked about the ""exorbitant"" price of gasoline. But Deese completely deflected responsibility from Biden for the growing problem.

""Today on average gas is costing $4.60 a gallon. That's up more than 10 cents a gallon from last week, almost 50 cents from last month. We're one week away from Memorial Day. Should Americans be buckling up for these high prices for the entire summer?"" Tapper pressed.

""Well, we're doing everything we can to try to bring those prices down,"" Deese responded. ""As you know, this all emanates from Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, which took Russian oil off the market.""

Tapper, however, did not let the falsehood go unchecked.

""Not all of it. Not all of it,"" he shot back. ""I mean, some of it, yes.""

As Tapper indicated, it is true that Putin's decision to invade Ukraine — triggering a wave of crippling economic sanctions against Russia — is responsible for some of the increased cost of gas.

However, the price of gasoline has been steadily rising since Biden was inaugurated last year.

The oil and gas market is undoubtedly volatile and susceptible to subtle market shifts, especially in the shadow of COVID lockdowns that injected extreme upheaval into the global market and supply chain. But the Biden administration's hostility toward fossil fuels is no secret.

That antagonism has not lifted during the gas price crisis, which analysts at JPMorgan unfortunately predict will only get worse in the coming months. They believe that national gas prices could top $6 per gallon by August, a startling prediction that will hurt cash-strapped Americans who are already barely scraping by thanks to sky-high inflation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jake-tapper-calls-out-brian-deese-putin-gas-prices,2022-05-24
CNN anchor confronts Biden official for abdicating responsibility on inflation crisis: 'You don't use these tools',"CNN anchor Jake Tapper grilled a top Biden official Wednesday over dismal inflation numbers that show the U.S. economy is continuing its downward spiral.

The consumer price index showed that year-over-year inflation spiked 9.1% in June, a worrying figure that outpaced every expert prediction. The Biden administration downplayed the seriousness of the figure, repeatedly claiming it is ""backward-looking"" and does not reflect present-day reality.

What happened on CNN?

Tapper directly confronted Cecilia Rouse, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, over why the Biden administration is only talking the talk, but not walking the walk.

""I just feel like every month, one of you nice people from the White House comes on the show to talk about inflation, and you talk about these tools in the president's tool kit and you don't use them. You don't use these tools,"" Tapper confronted. ""Meanwhile, prices are still going up.""

In response, Rouse deflected responsibility from the Biden administration. She explained that Biden is doing everything in his power to help the economy and said it is time for Congress ""to act.""

""[Biden is] the Democratic president and the Congress is controlled by Democrats,"" Tapper shot back. ""So, it's not as though you guys don't have each other's phone numbers.""

Tapper even confronted Rouse over the Biden administration's repeated insistence that inflation has hit its peak, reminding Rouse that last December Biden told reporters inflation would go no higher.

""It just seems clear that the Biden administration has misjudged how bad inflation was going to get — for months and months and months,"" Tapper noted.

Instead of assuming some responsibility for the inflation crisis or admitting the administration was wrong about the trajectory of inflation (the administration claimed for months that it was only transitory), Rouse recycled the administration's overused talking points: The war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic are to blame for inflation.

Rouse ended the interview by saying Americans are fighting economic woes from a ""position of relative strength,"" words that ring hollow to most Americans, especially when coming from a high-paid government official.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jake-tapper-cecilia-rouse-inflation-crisis,2022-07-14
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admits Biden's spending worsened inflation,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted in an interview Wednesday that President Joe Biden's big spending has worsened inflation in the United States.

She made the comments in an interview with Matt Murray, the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal.

""As you know, one of the criticisms made for the administration and for the Fed really, in underestimating the toll of inflation, a year ago, one of the criticisms made of the administration, and it really goes back to the prior administration as well, is government stimulus spending related to COVID and the bill that the administration passed over the last year helped feed this,"" Murray said.

""You're an economist, you understand the causes of these phenomena. What's your take on how responsible government spending was in helping contribute to the problem that we're facing now on this front,"" Murray asked.

""So look, inflation is a matter of demand and supply, and the spending that was undertaken in the American Rescue Plan did feed demand,"" Yellen admitted.

""But I do think it was justified and appropriate at the time, given the risks the economy faced,"" she continued. ""At the time that President Biden was inaugurated, we had an economy where forecasters were envisioning very high unemployment for a very long time. We had especially low-wage workers who had been laid off in massive numbers. We saw cars lined up for miles in food banks, Americans worried about not being able to feed their families, get enough to eat. Forecasts were really quite dire.""

Yellen went on to say that high inflation was an unintentional result of the administration trying to avoid another recession and focusing on full employment, which she said was a success.

She also argued that the economy was strong despite facing the impact of the economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Despite the administration trying to pin the blame for high inflation on other causes, polls show that more Americans blame Biden and his policies for the spike in high prices than any other one contributing cause.

Japan moves to accept Ukrainian refugees and rebuild its military as countries continue to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"Japan announced this past week that it would accept Ukrainian refugees displaced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will send bulletproof vests to Kiev.

Historically, Japan has resisted taking in refugees and has maintained a pacifistic approach to foreign conflicts since the end of World War II. The Washington Post reported that Japan decided to break with its more isolationist tendencies “without ‘gaiastu,’ or foreign pressure.”

It is believed that Russia’s recent attack on a Ukrainian power plant inspired the Japanese government to accelerate debates over its pre-existing defense and national security policies. The Japanese government has been growing wary of China’s rising presence on the global stage and has been reevaluating its approach to stave off the growing territorial threat that China poses.

Akihisa Shiozaki, a member of Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, indicated that the Japanese government is growing increasingly skeptical of the United Nations’ ability to reign in the aggression of its member states.

He said, “It’s a big awakening that there are limitations to what the U.N. can do, limitations to what diplomacy can do, limitations to what economic sanctions can do.”

Regarding the shift in Japan’s policy approach, Shiozaki said, “It’s not about rewriting the boundaries of what Japan can do, but filling in the details of what we may not fully anticipate, or may have overlooked in our preparation.”

He added that Japan’s willingness to accept Ukrainian refugees enables the Japanese government to begin preparing for future refugee crises that may arise.

He said, “In considering future crisis scenarios in East Asia, including the Taiwan contingency, it is necessary to build and maintain the capacity to respond to refugees in times of emergency, even in peacetime.”

Japanese leaders are looking to their former ally, Germany, to see how a pacifist nation might reinstitute defensive measures.

Yoichi Funabashi, the chairman of the Asia Pacific Initiative think tank, said, “Japan is watching now, very much attentively, how Germany is responding to the Ukraine crisis and how fundamentally Germany is transforming to adapt itself to new reality.”

Within a week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Germany would vastly increase its spending on defense.

And, it appears, that Japan is following suit.

At a recent press conference, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, “Japan needs to implement a fundamental upgrade of its defense capabilities.”

Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, said in a recent T.V. interview that the ongoing reconfiguring the of the global power structure should be cause for the Japanese government to reconsider its approach to self-defense.

Abe said, “We should firmly consider various options when we talk about how we can protect Japan and the lives of its people in this reality.”

He also suggested that Japan should offer to hold nuclear weapons on behalf of the United States as a preemptive defensive measure.

Abe said, “In NATO, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy take part in nuclear sharing, hosting American nuclear weapons. We need to understand how security is maintained around the world and not consider it taboo to have an open discussion.”

Jared Kushner says he's busy 'cleaning up the messes' Joe Biden left behind,"Jared Kushner — White House senior adviser and son-in-law to President Donald Trump — hit back at Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's recent claims that Kushner is unqualified for his current gig, saying that much of what he does involves ""cleaning up the messes"" the former vice president left behind.

What are the details?

In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" that aired Sunday, Biden criticized President Trump for appointing Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, to high-level positions in the Trump administration where they are ""engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.""

When asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, ""You don't think that Jared Kushner should be negotiation a Middle East peace solution?"" Biden responded, ""No, I don't. What — what credentials does he bring to that?""

Israeli reporter Barak Ravid asked Kushner for his reaction to Biden's comments in an exclusive sit-down with Channel 13 News, released Tuesday.

""Look, he's entitled to his opinion,"" Kushner said of Biden, adding, ""but a lot of the work that the president's had me doing over the last three years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.""



Anything else?

Biden has spent weeks defending himself and his son, Hunter Biden, over accusations that the younger Biden used his father's position as vice president to secure lucrative business deals with firms in both China and Ukraine.

Hunter Biden's critics — including Donald Trump, Jr. — claim he did not have the qualifications or experience to be worthy of the international dealings on his own accord.

The former vice president has repeatedly denied that he or his son were engaged in any wrongdoing, and in return, has fired back at President Trump for hiring his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Kushner, to serve as advisers.

Peter Doocy forces Jean-Pierre to pretend Biden didn't say he would end fossil fuels as gas prices surge,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre appeared not to know President Joe Biden's past statements about the oil industry when she was confronted by reporter Peter Doocy on high gas prices.

Jean-Pierre made the comments during Wednesday's media briefing at the White House after the president announced an additional release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves in an attempt to relieve high gas prices ahead of the midterms.

""You're asking oil companies to further lower gas prices. What makes you think that they are going to listen to an administration that is ultimately trying to put them out of business?"" asked Doocy.

""How is the administration trying to put them out of business?” replied Jean-Pierre.

""Well, they produce fossil fuels, and he says he wants to end fossil fuel,"" he responded, referring to comments the president made during the 2020 presidential campaign.



Jean-Pierre went on to say that oil production was on track to reach a record high in 2023 and said that oil companies could drop gas prices by increasing production because they had already done it previously. She did not address Biden's comments about ending fossil fuel.

The Republican National Committee responded immediately by posting a video with Biden's comments promising to stop fracking in the U.S. and saying that he would end fossil fuels.

Even more bizarre was the fact that Jean-Pierre herself told Doocy in June that the administration still intended to end U.S. reliance on fossil fuels.

The Biden administration has tried to blame high gas prices and other increasing costs on the war in Ukraine and the pandemic, but polls show that many more Americans blame Biden's policies than they do other causes. Democrats are also panicking over a New York Times poll showing that Republicans are gaining popularity because of weakness in the economy under Biden's leadership.

Jean-Pierre says administrant expects 'highly elevated' headline inflation number,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a press briefing on Monday that the White House expects the upcoming consumer price index report to have a ""highly elevated"" headline figure.

The press secretary said that, ""June CPI data is already out of date because energy prices have come down substantially this month and are expected to fall further.""

Americans have been feeling the financial sting caused by roaring inflation that has been eroding the purchasing power of their savings and earnings.

Drivers have been facing significant pain at the pump. As of Monday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $4.678. That figure has declined slightly since it surpassed the $5.00 mark last month.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is slated to release new CPI data on Wednesday. In the CPI report released last month, the BLS noted, ""The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981.""

Last week, Jean-Pierre claimed that the nation is ""stronger economically than we have been, ah, in history,"" pointing to unemployment and jobs numbers. She said that the administration recognizes that fuel and food prices are high, but then blamed the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine as the culprits.



On Monday, Jean-Pierre continued blaming Putin for higher food and fuel costs — she also claimed that the U.S. has ""a strong economy.""

If Americans continue to suffer the painful economic repercussions of high-flying inflation in the months ahead, the issue could serve as a significant drag on Democrats during the 2022 midterm election cycle.

""Republicans are doing nothing but obstructing our efforts to crack down on gas-price gouging, lower food prices, lower healthcare costs, and hopefully, soon, lower your prescription drug costs,"" a tweet posted on the president's @JoeBiden Twitter account declares. ""This is not right. And that’s why this election is going to be so darn important.""

In response to the president's tweet, GOP Rep. Cliff Bentz of Oregon tweeted, ""This is the man who ran on the promise to take responsibility for his actions. First, it's Russia, now it's Republicans.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jean-pierre-highly-elevated-inflation,2022-07-12
"WH press secretary outright lies about Sen. Lindsey Graham's abortion bill, claims that abortions would be 'completely banned'","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre outright lied Thursday about Sen. Lindsey Graham's abortion bill.

What did KJP say?

During an interview on ""The View,"" Jean-Pierre addressed the issue of abortion and specifically Graham's bill, which he announced last week.

According to Jean-Pierre, the South Carolina Republican's legislation is inherently dangerous for American democracy because it strips women of autonomy and ""completely"" outlaws abortion nationwide.

""One thing I really want to call out: We have Lindsey Graham and other leaders of the Republican Party who are saying — they're being very clear about this, folks, we've got to listen to them — that they want a national ban on abortion,"" Jean-Pierre claimed.



""And it’s not gonna matter if you’re in a red state or a blue state — that means it will be completely banned. That is their message,"" she continued. ""That’s what they’re doing here and we have to remember that we can’t allow that to take us back. We cannot be moving backwards.""



White House Press Sec. Discusses Putin's Continued War Against Ukraine | The View youtu.be

But is that true?



Graham's bill — the Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act — does not, contrary to Jean-Pierre's claim, completely outlaw abortion nationwide.

Instead, the bill seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill includes exceptions for rape, incest, and the physical life of the mother, which are the least common reasons that women seek abortions.

Despite Jean-Pierre's claim, public sentiment actually backs Graham's moderate push. The historic trend of abortion polling shows that only one-third or less of Americans believe abortion should be legal under all circumstances. That means a majority of Americans favor restrictions on abortion, such as limiting it to the first trimester, or outlawing it.

Anything else?

After spreading a dishonest claim about Graham's bill, Jean-Pierre claimed Republicans will not stop at abortion, but they will fight to roll back marriage rights, contraceptive rights, and privacy rights.

Republicans are not advocating for anything Jean-Pierre claimed. However, some conservative have questioned the legal standing on which some of those rights were constructed with regard to Supreme Court cases, just as jurists questioned the jurisprudence on which Roe v. Wade was decided.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden also addressed Graham's proposal this week — and he, too, lied.

""Think about what these guys are talking about,"" Biden said at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser. ""No exceptions — rape, incest — no exceptions, regardless of age.""

If that were not bad enough, Biden also claimed, ""My church doesn’t even make that argument now."" That, too, is not true. Biden is a Catholic, and the Catholic Church considers abortion a grave sin.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jean-pierre-lies-graham-abortion,2022-09-23
Jean-Pierre faces ridicule after calling Russian pipeline 'Nordstrom-1',"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was mocked and ridiculed after she accidentally referred to a Russian natural gas pipeline as ""Nordstrom-1.""

Jean-Pierre made the gaffe during Tuesday's White House media briefing while discussing the controversy surrounding the Nord Stream-1 pipeline that delivers gas from Russia to some European countries.

“What we see Russia is doing, we’ve been very clear about this, is that they’re using energy, they’re weaponizing energy,” she said. “One of the things that has been out there, they shut down the pipeline of Nordstrom 1.”

Jean-Pierre apparently confused the oil pipeline with the department store, and many on social media were merciless in their reactions.

""Not sure what’s worse, that Karine Jean Pierre just called it The NORDSTROM Pipeline, or that Biden yelled at his TV, 'no dummy it’s Bloomingdales,'"" replied Fox Radio host Jimmy Failla.

""You can return stuff to the pipeline even if you wore it 3 years ago. No tag necessary,"" responded bitcoin commentator Natalie Brunell.

""In fairness, she appears to know roughly as much about it as the rest of the White House,"" said security advisor Omri Ceren.

""The pipeline through which Europe receives over-priced cardigans,"" joked another user.

""Russia is currently building Nieman-Marcus and Macy's pipelines, as we speak,"" replied one jokester.

Although the official reason for Russia cutting off natural gas from flowing through the pipeline is a malfunction in a turbine, a spokesperson for Moscow said that the suspension would continue until Western countries end their sanctions over the Ukraine war.

The suspension is likely to worsen the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. Some business owners have posted their electricity bills on social media to show that their utility costs have skyrocketed to as much as ten times as their normal bills.

""We closed our tearoom/cafe we’ve run for 7 years due to increasing costs,"" claimed one user. ""We can’t sustain the hikes and thought we would wait until the economy perked up again in the summer but obviously we will never open again.""

Some financial experts believe Europe will plunge into a recession caused at least partly by the energy crisis.

Jen Psaki claims she's never heard of the allegation that Hunter Biden got $3.5 million from wife of ex-Moscow mayor,"Stories of Hunter Biden's questionable and reportedly corrupt Ukrainian and Russian connections were ubiquitous during the 2020 election, causing headaches forJoe Biden, Hunter Biden's dad and the Democratic presidential nominee, at the time.

One of the more notable accusations was that Hunter Biden received — as detailed by a September report on his Ukrainian business dealings from the Senate Homeland Security Committee and Senate Finance Committee — a multimillion-dollar payment from a Russian billionaire.

According to the Senate report spearheaded by GOP Sens. Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa), ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""

Baturina, a Russian businesswoman and the country's only female billionaire, made her fortune when her husband, the late Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, orchestrated a number of municipal contracts with her company. Luzhkov was fired in 2010 by then-President Dmitry Medvedev over corruption allegations.

Baturina wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's investment firm for a ""consulting agreement,"" the Senate report stated.

The story was covered not just by conservative media but also ""mainstream"" outlets like Newsweek, Forbes, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, and CNN. It was even the subject of a PolitiFact fact-check that was inconclusive.

But President Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, claimed this week that she has never heard of the story.

What did she say?

Psaki told reporters Wednesday that she is somehow ""not familiar"" with the Baturina-Biden story.

The New York Post asked Psaki about the wire transfer story specifically, but she acted like it was news to her.

""I'm not familiar with that claim,"" she said. ""It doesn't sound like it's backed up by a lot of evidence. If you have evidence or specifics, I'm happy to discuss it further.""

She went on to assure the media that she was ""not familiar with the [Senate] report at all.""

Psaki's claim seems strange considering, as the Post noted, the wire transfer allegation was repeatedly cited during the campaign — including during both presidential debates.



For example, during the first debate on Sept. 29, then-President Donald Trump asked, ""While we're at it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave your son $3.5 millions of dollars. What did he do to deserve it?""

Biden responded, ""None of that is true; it's been totally discredited,"" which runs counter to PolitiFact's aforementioned findings.

Trump hit Biden with the wire transfer questions again a month later during the second presidential debate.

Yet Psaki claimed she had never heard of the story.

In response to Psaki's claim, Sen. Johnson tweeted, "".@PressSec heard you're not familiar with my and @chuckgrassley report. Here is a link.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jen-psaki-never-heard-allegation-against-hunter-biden,2021-03-25
Jen Rubin gets hammered online for claiming a state can now 'execute' a woman who gets an abortion,"Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin was criticized and mocked online after she claimed that women could now be ""executed"" by a state after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision.

Rubin tweeted her bizarre claim and was immediately lambasted for it.

""[A] state can now execute a woman for refusing to submit to a forced birth even if the 'abortion' is within hours of conception. barbarism,"" she tweeted Friday.

She added in a second tweet, ""senators cheering the decision are supporting states' power to criminalize all abortions in all situations. This is radical, inhumane and intolerable in a free society.""

Here's a sampling of the responses to Rubin's tweet:

""While I respect the enthusiasm you have thinking you can wish nonsense into existence, and I certainly hate to burst your crazy little bubble, but literally none of that is true,"" read one tweet.

""[I]t's wildly irresponsible for WaPo opinion writers, even less credible ones like Rubin, to spread this type of misinformation,"" responded Liz Wolfe of Reason.

""There’s something seriously wrong with you,"" replied radio talk host Jason Rantz.

Others pointed out that Rubin had previously argued against Democrats about elective abortions not being women's health.

Some just responded with confusion.

""What on God's earth are you talking about?"" said David Harsanyi of the Federalist.

Many pro-abortion supporters have taken to the streets Friday to protest against the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn federal abortion rights in the United States. Some Democrats have responded by saying they will ""defy"" the U.S. Supreme Court while others have come very close to calling for violence to meet their political goal of defending abortion rights.

Rubin has been touted by the Washington Post as their ""conservative"" columnist, but many on the right reject that identification given her constant haranguing and criticism of conservative politicians and policies.

Jennifer Rubin is getting hammered on social media for saying Biden's economy is great if you ignore inflation,"Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin was hammered on social media for giving a defense of the economy under President Joe Biden in her newest column.

Rubin argued in her column that if inflation were not a factor that Biden's ""economic performance"" would be ""unmatched.""

She touted the latest jobs report while admitting that high inflation had eaten into the gains made in Americans' wages. Rubin went on to blame inflation on the pandemic, the actions of the Federal Reserve, and finally blamed high gas prices on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Critics of the Biden administration took to Twitter to excoriate Rubin for the nonsensical economic defense.

""This article is incoherent. Much of Biden's 'extraordinary' economic accomplishments (like rising nominal wages) are just side effects of rising prices. You cannot divorce the two & act like inflation is some some separate branch that can be cut off while keeping the good stuff,"" argued Brien Riedl of the Manhattan Institute.

""If the economy weren’t doing badly, it would be good, area woman says,"" replied commentator Drew Holden.

Others used the same formulation Rubin used to mock her claim that Biden was doing a great job despite inflation.

""If it weren’t for the cost, I could afford to fly private,"" joked Charles C.W. Cooke of the National Review.

""If it weren't for IQ points, you would be Einstein,"" replied Ben Shapiro.

""If it weren't for the assassination of her husband, Mary Todd Lincoln would have enjoyed the play,"" joked Andrew Follett of the Club for Growth.

""If it weren't for my lack of a medical degree, my surgical skills would be unmatched,"" mocked Noah Blum.

""Opinion by Cheating Husband: If it weren’t for my ongoing affair, my marriage would be on really solid ground,"" read another mocking tweet.

Disastrous polling and other indicators point to a catastrophic outcome for Democrats in the upcoming November midterms election over high inflation, increasing gas prices, and embarrassing missteps by the Biden administration. Some on the far left, like socialist Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), blame the polling on Biden not pushing for progressive policies.

Jennifer Rubin says the GOP has turned into a movement seeking to implement 'White Christian nationalism',"Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin asserted that the Republican Party has ceased to be a political party and has instead transformed into a movement committed to implementing ""White Christian nationalism.""

""People might be confused about how a Republican Party that once worried about government overreach now seeks to control medical care for transgender children and retaliate against a corporation for objecting to a bill targeting LGBTQ students. And why is it that the most ambitious Republicans are spending more time battling nonexistent critical race theory in schools than on health care or inflation?"" Rubin wrote.

""To explain this, one must acknowledge that the GOP is not a political party anymore. It is a movement dedicated to imposing White Christian nationalism,"" she continued.

Conservatives oppose radical leftist gender ideology and the concepts of critical race theory, and they do not want schools to foist these ideas on kids.

Rubin claimed that white Christians in the U.S. desire to cling to political power.



""The media blandly describes the GOP’s obsessions as 'culture wars,' but that suggests there is another side seeking to impose its views on others,"" Rubin wrote. ""In reality, only one side is repudiating pluralistic democracy — White, Christian and mainly rural Americans who are becoming a minority group and want to maintain their political power.""

""The MAGA crowd is offended by any attempt to identify the ongoing reality of systemic racism (evident, for example, in the criminal justice system, maternal health care, housing discrimination and gerrymandering to reduce minority voting power). The notion that institutions they refuse to reform perpetuate racism is a sort of moral challenge to their claim to be 'colorblind.' Perhaps it is simply self-interested blindness,"" she wrote.

Rubin also said that white U.S. Christians who view themselves as victims suffer from ""moral confusion.""

""Our political problems are significant, but they are minor compared with the moral confusion that is afflicting the millions of White Christian Americans who consider themselves victims. Left unaddressed, this will smother calls for empathy, tolerance and justice,"" she declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jennifer-rubin-white-christian-nationalism,2022-04-28
Powell does not think America is in recession,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a press conference on Wednesday that he does not believe America is in the midst of a recession.

He explained his reasoning by saying that ""too many"" parts of the economy are doing ""too well"" — he highlighted the labor market to make his point.

Fed Chairman Powell holds press conference following FOMC meeting youtu.be

Powell's comments come as Americans continue to be soaked by soaring inflation and the Fed seeks to address the problem.



""Hey Powell, leave Washington and talk to any middle class worker for five seconds…we’re in a recession. A terrible one,"" Steve Cortes tweeted on Wednesday.

During remarks at the event on Wednesday, Powell described the labor market as ""extremely tight"" and characterized inflation as ""much too high."" He then noted a new 0.75 percentage point rate hike.

A Federal Open Market Committee statement says that ""the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.""



""Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,"" the statement reads. ""Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.""



""The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the statement notes.

Americans have been suffering the devastating financial consequences of roaring inflation, and if the problem persists in the months ahead, it could hurt Democrats during the 2022 midterm elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jerome-powell-no-us-recession,2022-07-28
"Fed chair Jerome Powell says US economy in 'pretty strong shape,' hopes to bring down inflation","At the European Central Bank’s annual policy forum in Sintra, Portugal, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed optimism about the forecast for the American economy, but still called ""price stability"" his highest concern.

Alongside fellow panelists ECB President Christine Lagarde; the general manager of the Bank of International Settlements, Agustín Carstens; and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Powell told moderator Francine Lacqua of Bloomberg Television, “We hope that growth will remain positive” and that “overall the U.S. economy is well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.”

As Lacqua remarked, American interest rates had remained historically low for close to two decades until earlier this month when the Federal Reserve elected to raise interest rates three-quarters of a point, the highest single rate hike since 1994. Officials also signaled that they may consider another half-point raise when they reconvene in July. The aim of these rate hikes is to reduce inflation from its current level of 8.6% to about 2%.

Doing so, Powell said, would help ""slow growth down so that supply will have a chance to catch up.""

“Is there a risk that we would go too far [with rate hikes]? Certainly there’s a risk,” Powell admitted. “But I wouldn’t agree that that is the biggest risk to the economy. The bigger mistake to make would be to fail to restore price stability.”

Powell and others on the panel insisted that economic changes stemming from the pandemic have permanently altered banking paradigms.

“The economy is being driven by very different forces. What we don’t know is whether we’ll be going back to something that looks like, or a little bit like, what we had before,” Powell said.

Lagarde agreed: ""I don’t think we’re going back to that [pre-COVID] period of low inflation.""

The group also cited the war in Ukraine as another roadblock with unpredictable economic consequences. Powell claimed that, thus far, the war has ""added tremendously"" to the upheaval in inflation and food prices.

Still Powell maintained optimism regarding the current state of the U.S. economy.

""The U.S. economy is in pretty strong shape,"" he averred.

Though careful to note that those in lower income brackets were not necessarily doing well, Powell claimed that ""households are in very strong financial shape"" because of increased savings from 2020 and that businesses are showing ""very low rates of default.""

Despite Powell's enthusiasm, others are much more skeptical about the economic future. According to Yahoo! Financial, ""About a third of economists predict a US recession as likely in the next two years, 21% seeing some time with zero or negative growth likely and the rest looking for the Fed to achieve a soft landing of continuing growth and low inflation, according to a survey earlier this month.""

Americans have expressed similar doubts about the state of the U.S. economy, and many polls indicate that voters will hold Democrats responsible for high gas and food prices in the midterm elections this November.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jerome-powell-us-economy-strong,2022-06-29
"First lady Jill Biden made a surprise Mother's Day visit to Ukraine, White House confirms there are no plans for Joe to travel to Kyiv","First lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine this Sunday marking a rare solo as the spouse of a sitting president to visit an active war zone.

Fox News reported that the first lady entered Ukraine by crossing the border from Slovakia on Sunday morning after visiting with Ukrainian refugees at a processing center. Reportedly, she met with Ukrainian first lady Olen Zelenska. The Ukrainian first lady has not been seen in public since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Mrs. Biden said, “I wanted to come on Mother’s Day. I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.”

Zelenska praised her American counterpart for making a “courageous trip” which reportedly occurred as an impromptu stop on the U.S. first lady’s four-day trip to Eastern Europe without her husband.

The first ladies met in a small classroom in front of reporters before holding a private meeting. Zelenska and her children have reportedly remained in an undisclosed location due to safety concerns as Russian officials made it an early priority of their invasion to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and members of his family.

The two women later joined a group of children who live at the school where they met in making tissue-paper bears to give as Mother’s Day gifts.

The first lady’s visit to Ukraine marks the third high profile meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

In late April U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to discuss the U.S. federal government’s role in providing the Ukrainian military with more than $300 million in financing. And in early May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi along with the Democratic U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks of New York, and Adam Schiff of California met with Zelenskyy to show support for the Ukrainian government.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also visited Ukraine and held a private meeting with Zelenskyy in the country’s capital city of Kyiv.

President Joe Biden has yet to visit Ukraine or host Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy previously told CNN host Jake Tapper that he thought Biden ought t visit Ukraine because ‘’he is the leader of the United States, and that’s why he should come here to see.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, however, confirmed that there are no plans to send Biden to Ukraine.

Rep. Jim Jordan grills Amb. Sondland on his quid pro quo claims: ‘When did it happen? ... Never did!’,"Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) heavily scrutinized Ambassador Gordon Sondland's impeachment inquiry testimony Wednesday in a fiery three-minute exchange that is making the rounds on social media.

Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified in his opening statement before Congress that there was a quid pro quo for Ukraine to announce investigations into Burisma and 2016 election interference that came from Rudy Giuliani at the guidance of President Trump.

Sondland said in sworn testimony that Giuliani, acting at the behest of President Trump, communicated to Ukrainian officials that a White House call and a White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was conditioned on a public statement announcing the launch of investigations by the Ukrainian government.

As for the allegation that the release of $400 million in frozen military aid was also a pre-condition of the quid pro quo, Sondland said that he ""later came to believe"" that it was, repeatedly claiming this belief as his ""presumption.""

He became personally convinced of his presumption, however, admitting to the Democratic majority counsel that ""two plus two equals four.""

In summary, Sondland claimed that three items — a White House call from Trump to Zelensky, a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, and the release of military aid to Ukraine — were conditioned on Ukraine making a public statement announcing investigations.

Jordan was not convinced

Rep. Jordan sought to expose Sondland's presumptive errors and was shot out of a cannon when it came time for his questioning.

""Ambassador, when did it happen?"" Jordan asked.

""When did what happen?"" Sondland retorted.

""The announcement,"" Jordan snapped back. ""When did President Zelensky announce that the investigation was going to happen?"" he said, citing Sondland's opening remarks where he outlined that the call, meeting, and aid were conditioned on the public announcement from Ukraine.

""Never did,"" Sondland acknowledged.

""Never did!"" Jordan repeated emphatically. ""They got the call July 25. They got the meeting — not in the White House but in New York — on September 25. They got the money on September 11.""

""I mean, you got all three of them wrong,"" Jordan argued. ""They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It's not two plus two, it's 0 for three.""

CNN's Jim Sciutto gets roasted for claiming inflation 'took a breather' in latest economic report,"The latest economic report showed a very minor decrease in the rate of inflation, and many on social media roasted CNN's Jim Sciutto for his characterization of the news on Twitter.

Americans have been struggling with the plague of high inflation caused by the big spending policies of the Democrats, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering damage from the pandemic and an economic shutdown.

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation for the month of April was recorded at 8.3%, a rate historically high, but slightly lower than the rate for March, which clocked in at 8.5%.

Sciutto responded by referring to the minor pause as inflation taking a ""breather"" for the month.

""US inflation took a breather last month for first time since August. Prices still increased, but at a slower pace than in previous months,"" Sciutto tweeted.

""CPI was up 8.3% in 12 mos ending in April - a decrease from the 8.5% recorded in March,"" he added.

Many on social media ripped into Sciutto for the tweet they saw as biased.

""You are an embarrassment,"" read one very popular response.

""Good news! Yesterday the quicksand enveloped me up to my chest, but today it's only up to my nose! I'll be out of here in no time,"" read another popular reply.

""Breaking news…the economy is fixed — in CNN land,"" said Matt Vespa of Townhall.com.

""Embarrassing, you are,"" responded Curtis Houck of Newsbusters.

""You never disappoint,"" said Charles C.W. Cooke of National Review.

The Biden administration has tried to pin the entire blame of inflation on the Russian invasion but polling suggests a plurality of Americans blame Democrats and their policies for the damaging decrease in the value of money.

"Hunter Biden agrees to pay child support, delaying contempt proceedings","Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, has agreed to pay child support to the mother of one of his children, earning a delay in contempt proceedings from a court that ordered him to hand over his financials.

What are the details?

Lunden Roberts, 28, an Arkansas woman who was formerly a stripper in Washington, D.C., has been fighting for Biden to provide support for the 17-month-old boy they share. Earlier this month, Arkansas Circuit Clerk Judge Holly Meyer officially declared Biden, 49, to be the child's biological father, citing a DNA test, following months of Biden claiming otherwise.

After Biden apparently failed to hand over sufficient financials, Judge Meyer ordered him last week to appear before her court Jan. 29 to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt, Page Six reported.

But that contempt hearing has now been pushed back to March 1, after Biden agreed to pay Roberts child support in a court filing posted Monday.

The amount of temporary monthly support has been redacted in the document, and Judge Meyer wrote that the amount may be amended later ""to rectify any inequities that might result from setting support without having all of the relevant information.""

The judge added, ""The Court reserves the judgment on temporary and final child support until after adequate discovery is completed and relevant evidence is available for a child support determination.""

Judge Meyer previously issued a protective order to keep Biden's financials private in the lawsuit. The case is high-profile, given questions over the income Biden received from foreign business deals — particularly from Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma, where Biden served as a board member during and after his father's time as vice president and point man to the nation during the Obama administration.

Biden is accused of using his father's name and influence to gain a spot on the board — in a position that paid at least $50,000 a month — despite his apparent lack of credentials and background for the job.

Anything else?

Burisma has been under multiple corruption investigations in Ukraine, and Biden's connection to the firm continues to fall under scrutiny as House Democrats seek the impeachment of President Donald Trump over allegations that the president sought to have Biden's involvement with the firm investigated.

On Monday, White House defense team member and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi made Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma a focus of her argument before the Senate, Townhall reported.

Bondi told the upper chamber, ""Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and others, unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest.""

Joe Biden explodes after reporter confronts him with simple question about Ukraine 'conflict of interest',"Joe Biden snapped at a reporter Friday who confronted him about whether his diplomatic work with Ukraine as vice president constituted a conflict of interest because of his son's business dealings in Ukraine at the same time.

""How was your role as vice president in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son's job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest?"" the reporter asked during the SEIU Unions for All Summit in Los Angeles.

In response, Biden raised his voice, angrily pointed his finger at the reporter, and demanded that the media focus on Trump instead.

""It's not a conflict of interest. There has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else — period,"" he snapped. ""I'm not going to respond to that.""

""Let's focus on the problem,"" he continued. ""Focus on [President Trump], what he's doing that no president has ever done — no president!""

The Ukraine controversy is clearly taking a toll on Biden as Friday's incident was not the first time he has lost his cool over questions related to the work of his son, Hunter, in Ukraine, which came while Biden managed high-level diplomacy with the nation.

While campaigning in Iowa last month, Biden snapped at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, who questioned Biden about the apparent conflict of interest.

In response, Biden stuck his finger close to Doocy's face and told him to ""ask the right questions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-explodes-when-reporter-confronts-him-with-simple-question-about-ukraine,2019-10-05
Joe Biden says he broke his foot after exiting the shower and grabbing his dog's tail,"Former Vice President Joe Biden finally revealed exactly how he broke his foot, and it is not your garden variety way of suffering such an injury. Also in the CNN interview, Biden said he would call on Americans to wear face masks for 100 days, and talked about his family's business dealings.

On Saturday, there was news that the 78-year-old Democrat was injured, and the initial reports stated that Biden had suffered a twisted ankle from playing with his dog. On Sunday, the former vice president visited an orthopedist in Newark, Delaware, who found that Biden had sustained a hairline fracture.

""Initial X-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging,"" said Kevin O'Connor, Biden's physician. ""Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden's lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks.""

On Thursday, Biden appeared on CNN and told the story of how he hurt his foot.



""What happened was I got out of the shower. I got a dog and anybody who's been around my house knows — dropped, little pup dropped a ball in front of me. And for me to grab the ball,"" Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper.

""And I'm walking through this little alleyway to get to the bedroom,"" Biden stated. ""And I grabbed the ball like this and he ran. And I'm joking, running after him and grab his tail. And what happened was that he slid on a throw rug. And I tripped on the rug he slid on. That's what happened. Oh man, not a very exciting story.""



Biden was allegedly playing with his dog named ""Major,"" one of his two German shepherds. The other is named ""Champ.""

Biden's campaign stated that the former vice president might have to wear a walking boot for ""several weeks,"" but he was seen without the medical boot on Thursday when he arrived at The Queen theater in Wilmington, Delaware, for the CNN interview.

Also in Thursday's CNN interview, Biden vowed that his family's business dealings would not conflict with any White House responsibilities.

""My son, my family, will not be involved in any business, any enterprise, that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, with the appropriate distance from, the presidency and government,"" Biden said.



There has been much speculation about purported overseas business dealings by Biden's son and brother following the release of emails that were reportedly from Hunter Biden's laptop.

On the topic of the coronavirus, Biden said he would call on Americans to wear face masks for 100 days.

""Just 100 days to mask. Not forever — 100 days,"" Biden said. ""I think we'll see a significant reduction if that occurs with vaccinations and masking, to drive down the numbers considerably.""

In October, Biden hinted that he would implement a mask mandate on federal property.

Hunter Biden business partner confirms email about Joe and China,"A man claiming to be a former business partner of Hunter Biden has released a statement alleging that the email that the New York Post published about a ""lucrative"" deal with a Chinese company is ""genuine."" The professed business associate also claims that Joe Biden not only knew about his son's overseas dealings, but also profited from an agreement with a Chinese energy firm.

Tony Bobulinski is the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, which he claimed formed a partnership with the now-bankrupt Shanghai-based China Energy Fund Committee, which was run by Ye Jianming, who has been missing since 2018.

""I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family,"" Bobulinski said in the statement that was published by the New York Post on Thursday. ""I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden.""

In an email allegedly obtained from Hunter Biden's laptop, it details ""remuneration packages"" in a business venture for six people only identified as initials and nicknames. The email, which was written by James Gilliar of the international consulting firm J2cR, names Hunter Biden as the ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC (China Energy Co)."" His pay was noted to be ""850.""

""In addition, the email outlined a 'provisional agreement' under which 80 percent of the 'equity,' or shares in the new company, would be split equally among four people whose initials correspond to the sender and three recipients, with 'H' apparently referring to Biden,"" the Post reported.



As terms of the deal, the email states, ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" The ""big guy"" was not identified in the email, but Bobulinski claims that it is a reference to Joe Biden. There is a person identified as ""JB"" referenced in the email; Bobulinski alleged that it references Jim Biden, Joe's brother.

""Hunter Biden called his dad 'the Big Guy' or 'my Chairman,' and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,"" said Bobulinski, who is a Navy veteran. ""I've seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I've seen firsthand that that's not true, because it wasn't just Hunter's business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.""

Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has repeatedly denied that he ever involved himself with his son's business affairs, claiming he's ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.""

Bobulinski added that he is cooperating with an investigation into Hunter Biden's business overseas dealings led by U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).



""The committee is working to validate information being revealed by multiple sources. As part of those efforts, we have reached out to several individuals named in recently revealed emails, including Tony Bobulinski. We look forward to their cooperation in helping us uncover the truth,"" Johnson told Just the News.

Last month, Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released a report titled ""Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.""

""The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me — it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn't and wouldn't do that to their partners,"" Bobulinski said.

Bobulinski claims that he is ""not a political person,"" and ""what few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats.""

""I don't have a political axe to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned about what I saw,"" he said. ""The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China.""

The email was sent on May 13, 2017, when Biden was no longer vice president.

Another of Hunter Biden's alleged business associates is allegedly giving up information that could potentially be a problem for the Biden campaign.



Bevan Cooney, who is currently serving a prison sentence for fraud, reportedly provided access to his Gmail account to Breitbart investigative reporter and New York Times bestselling author Peter Schweizer. ""These associates sought to trade on Hunter Biden's relationship with, and access to, his father and the Obama-Biden White House in order to generate business,"" the report alleges.

""We're not looking at printouts. Not looking at PDFs. We're actually in his Gmail accounts themselves, sifting through these emails,"" Schweizer told Glenn Beck this week. ""And there's a shocking amount of information about deals involving China, involving Russia, involving all sorts of things they were trying to pull off.""

On Tuesday, Schweizer claimed that Cooney ""has been removed from the federal facility in Oregon where he is being detained.""

The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment, telling the Washington Examiner, ""For safety and security reasons, we do not discuss specific inmates' conditions of confinement.""

On July 31, 2019, Cooney was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison for ""defrauding a Native American tribal entity and various investment advisory clients of tens of millions of dollars in connection with the issuance of bonds by the tribal entity and the subsequent sale of those bonds through fraudulent and deceptive means,"" the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney's Office said.

On Tuesday, Joe Biden dismissed the allegations stemming from the leaked emails from his son's laptop that was reportedly left at a computer repair shop.

""This is the same garbage – Rudy Giuliani Trump's henchmen,"" Biden told WISN-TV during an interview. ""It's a last-ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-hunter-email-business-partner-china,2020-10-22
"Joe Biden met with 14 of Hunter Biden's business associates while he was vice president, despite denying knowledge of his son's foreign dealings: Emails, White House logs","At least 14 of Hunter Biden's business associates met with Joe Biden while he was vice president, according to a new report. President Biden has denied speaking to his son about his overseas business dealings.

According to Obama White House visitor logs and emails from Hunter Biden reviewed by Fox News, the first son's foreign business associates from China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia, and Ukraine met with Biden when he was the vice president of the United States.

On Feb. 26, 2014, Miguel Aleman Velasco and Miguel Aleman Magnani reportedly visited the Obama-Biden White House. The Mexican business partners of Hunter Biden were allegedly given a private tour of the White House Brady Press Briefing room by then-Vice President Biden.

In April 2014, Hunter emailed David Lienemann – Biden's official photographer – to ask for photos of the meet-and-greet.

Hunter wrote, ""Do you have pictures from the lunch I had in dad's office (I think on 2/26) with Miguel Alleman Sr. And Jr. And Jeff Cooper? If so let me know and I can send someone to pick them up. Thanks. How was Kiev?""

A month later, Cooper even asked Hunter, ""Any luck on getting those other pics from the WH [White House]-Alemán visit? Or getting a few signed for Miguel and his dad?""

Cooper was an attorney who worked with the late Beau Biden and was Hunter's business associate. Cooper was the managing partner of SimmonsCooper – an Illinois law firm that specializes in representing asbestos victims. SimmonsCooper donated nearly $200,000 to Joe Biden's political campaigns, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2008.

Biden's brother James and Hunter utilized SimmonsCooper in 2006 to purchase a group of hedge funds known as Paradigm. The Biden's later repaid SimmonsCooper $1 million after the deal fell through with the law firm.

Cooper and Hunter Biden started working together in February 2013, when Cooper reportedly emailed Bidden: ""This is setting up to be flippin gigantic brother.""

Hunter reportedly wanted to work with Carlos Slim – who at the time was the largest stakeholder of the New York Times and the second-richest person in the world.

In 2014, Hunter was reportedly able to secure a private meeting with then-Vice President Biden for Carlos Slim, Miguel Alemán Velasco, and Alemán Magnani – the CEO of Interjet airline and the grandson of the former Mexican President Miguel Alemán Valdés.



Hunter allegedly set up another meeting between his father and Slim on Oct. 30, 2015.

Photos allegedly found on Hunter's abandoned laptop show another meeting with then-Vice President Biden in Washington, D.C., dated Nov. 19, 2015, with Slim, Magnani, Velasco, Cooper, and Hunter.

Hunter and Cooper allegedly flew on Air Force 2 to Mexico City when his father was to meet then-President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto.

“We are arriving late tonight on Air Force 2 to MX City. We will be there for Thursday – I’m attending meeting w/ President N w/ Dad. Jeff [Cooper] is with me on lane and we will be with us all day,” Hunter reportedly wrote on Feb. 24, 2016.

However, Magnani allegedly went ""silent,"" which caused Hunter to lash out.

“I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F’ing White House and the Vice President’s house and the inauguration and then you go completely silent,” Hunter reportedly wrote to Magnani in an email. ""I don’t know what it is that I did but I’d like to know why I’ve delivered on every single thing you’ve ever asked – and you make me feel like I’ve done something to offend you.""

Hunter wrote to Cooper on July 24, 2018, ""Spoke to my dad about ‘Slim ask.'"" Cooper allegedly replied, ""Oh that sounds SO F’ING GOOD.""

Joe Biden also allegedly met with Rosemont Seneca Partners president Eric Schwerin. Rosemont Seneca Partners was an investment company founded in 2009 by Hunter, Christopher Heinz – stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry – and Devon Archer – an American businessman who was classmates with Heinz at Yale University.

Biden met with Schwerin on Nov. 17, 2010, in the West Wing, according to the New York Post.

Biden also met with Schwerin and former Columbia President Andrés Pastrana Arango at Joe’s Naval Observatory residence on March 2, 2012, according to an entry in Hunter’s personal calendar, obtained by the New York Post.

The Post reported, ""The logs also reveal that Schwerin met with various close aides of both Joe and Jill Biden at key moments in Hunter’s life when he was striking multi-million dollar deals in foreign countries, including China.""

Schwerin made at least 27 visits to the White House while Biden was the vice president, Fox News found.

Records on the infamous laptop claimed that Joe Biden met with Hunter's business associates from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia at a private ""Garden Room"" at the Café Milano restaurant in Washington, D.C., on April 16, 2015.

Fox News reported, ""The dinner’s guest list, according to an email from Hunter to his business partner Devon Archer, included Vadym Pozharskyi, an executive at Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter served as a board member. The guest list also included the late Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov and his wife, Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina, who was in business with Hunter’s Rosemont firm, though it is not clear whether they actually attended the dinner.""

The following day, Hunter received an email from Pozharskyi that allegedly read, ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together. It’s realty an honor and pleasure.""

At the time, Hunter was being paid $83,333 a month to sit on its board.

In 2001, the New York Post published a photo of the alleged meeting.



In June 2019, Hunter told the New Yorker that he introduced his father to one of his Chinese business partners in December 2013. Hunter introduced his then-vice president father to Jonathan Li – who ran the Chinese private-equity fund Bohai Capital.

Francis Person – a top adviser to Biden when he was a senator and the vice president until 2014 – worked with Hunter and Schwerin in business deals. In 2016, Person became the president of the Harves Group – a Chinese company whose founder has ties to high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party.

Person visited the White House at least seven times between 2015 and 2016, including during a holiday reception in December 2015 with Chinese executive Bo Zhang, according to official White House logs.

In a 2016 email, Hunter Biden referred to Zhang as his ""good friend and business colleague.""

Tony Bobulinski – a former Navy lieutenant and business partner of Hunter Biden – claimed that he met Joe Biden in May 2017.



Bobulinski is the former CEO of SinoHawk Holdings LLC – ""a global investment firm seeded with $10 million of Chinese money that would buy projects in the US and around the world 'in global and/or domestic infrastructure, energy, financial services and other strategic sectors,"" according to the New York Post . The Jim and Hunter Biden joint venture would be half owned by Chinese oil tycoon Ye Jianming – the chairman of CEFC China Energy Company Limited. Jianming disappeared in March 2018, after he was under investigation for suspected economic crimes, according to Reuters

Bobulinski wrote an email to Joe Biden's brother Jim on May 2, 2017, ""Great to meet u and spend some time together, please thank Joe for his time, was great to talk thx Tony b.""

In 2019, Joe Biden declared, ""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.""

Of Joe Biden's denial of being involved with his son's business dealings, Bobulinski told Tucker Carlson that it's a "" blatant lie .""

Bobulinski told Bobulinski told Fox News in October 2020, ""I've seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I've seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn't just Hunter's business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-hunter-emails-business-associates,2022-07-28
"Joe Biden leaves no room to backtrack, denies Hunter Biden made money from business deals with Chinese associates","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden unequivocally denied that his son Hunter Biden made money from a foreign business deal involving China during Thursday evening's final presidential debate.

As President Donald Trump went on the offensive bringing up allegations that the former vice president knew about his son Hunter's foreign business deals despite his multiple claims to the contrary, Biden forcefully claimed he has never received money from any foreign source.

""I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life,"" Biden said.

Responding to a question from moderator NBC News' Kristen Welker on whether Hunter Biden's involvement with Chinese and Ukrainian energy companies was ""unethical,"" Biden deflected and pointed the question back on Trump.



""Nothing was unethical,"" Biden answered. ""With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board I later learned of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person when he was going through [Trump's] impeachment testifying under oath who worked for him said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy. Not one single, solitary thing was out of line.

""The guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never, ever, ever happened,"" Biden said, referring to Trump.

Biden accused Trump of being the one benefiting from foreign governments, citing a recent report from The New York Times that Trump had a bank account opened in China.

Trump kept up the attack, however, noting that Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma while Joe Biden served as vice president despite having little experience in that field.



""He's the vice president of the United States and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich. They're like a vacuum cleaner,"" Trump said.

Questions abound over allegations that Biden's family leveraged his position as vice president to make financially beneficial business deals with foreign entities. Emails purportedly retrieved from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden indicate that the Biden family pursued ""lasting and lucrative"" deals with a Chinese energy company that had ties to the communist Chinese government.

The existence of the laptop was first reported by The New York Post, which cited former Trump campaign adviser Steve Bannon and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani as the sources for its story.

At the debate, Biden criticized Giuliani, saying ""he's being used as a Russian pawn"" and accusing the content of this laptop of being Russian disinformation.

Leaving no room to backtrack, Biden explicitly denied that his son made money from a business deal with Chinese associates.



""My son has not made money in terms of, this thing about, what are you talking about, China,"" Biden said.

Earlier Thursday, a former business associate of Hunter Biden, Tony Bobulinski, held a news conference accusing Joe Biden of falsely stating that he had no knowledge of Hunter's business deals and of being directly involved in those foreign business dealings.



Bobulinski claims that the email reported by the New York Post is ""genuine"" and that he has ""emails, Whats App chats, agreements, documents, and other evidence"" to support his claims, evidence that he has turned over to the FBI. He is also working with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee in their investigation of Hunter Biden's foreign business activities.

If Bobulinski's side of the story is true, it means Joe Biden lied to the American people at the debate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-leaves-no-room-to-backtrack-denies-hunter-biden-made-money-from-business-deals-with-chinese-associates,2020-10-23
Joe Biden stops Democratic debate to ask audience to stand and applaud for impeachment witness fired by Trump,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden paused the Democratic debate in order to have the audience stand and applaud for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the impeachment witness who was dismissed from the national security counsel earlier in the day.

""And by the way, Col. Vindman got thrown out of the White House today! Walked out!"" said Biden.

""I think we should, and the same time, he should be pinning a medal on Vindman and not on Rush Limbaugh!"" he added to growing applause.

""I think what we should be doing now, I think we should all stand and give Col. Vindman a show of how much we support him!"" Biden exclaimed.

""Stand up and clap for Vindman!"" he said. ""Get your, get up there! Who we are! That's who we are! We are not what Trump is!""

Vindman was a key witness for the Democrats in the House impeachment hearings. He testified in corroboration with the accusations that the president withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure a politically motivated investigation into Joe Biden and his son.

Vindman was escorted from the White House and removed as a national security adviser hours before the debate. Critics say it was retaliation for his testimony, while supporters of the president praised him for ""draining the swamp.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) defended the decision of the White House to demote Col. Vindman in a tweet that corrected the media by denying that he had been fired. ""He was assigned to NSC to serve the President who has a right to have people he trusts on his staff,"" Rubio wrote.

Joe Biden: My staff should've told me Hunter's job in Ukraine was a conflict of interest,"Former Vice President Joe Biden shifted accountability to his staff when asked during a recently released NPR interview about his son Hunter's ethically questionable appointment to the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.

Biden has sometimes been angrily defensive, and other times claimed ignorance, when questioned about whether Hunter's position in Ukraine was represented as a conflict of interest. Hunter was appointed to the board while Biden oversaw Ukraine policy in the Obama administration.

NPR's Rachel Martin challenged Biden during the interview about his son's actions, saying Biden knew it ""didn't look good"" for his son to take a lucrative position in Ukraine that he had no apparent qualifications for.

""The optics weren't good,"" Martin said. ""And you talk a lot about what it means to be a Biden and the integrity that is imbued in that family name. But there were former White House aides of yours who tried to warn you about the potential conflicts of interest.""

Biden disputed the assertion that his staff raised concerns on the issue.

""Nobody warned me about a potential conflict of interest. Nobody warned me about that,"" Biden responded.

Martin then pointed out that George Kent, a State Department official who served as deputy chief of mission in Ukraine under the Obama administration, testified during an impeachment hearing that he brought up concerns about Hunter to Biden's staff.

Biden claimed he never heard anything about it and speculated that his staff didn't bring it up to him because his other son, Beau, was dying from brain cancer.

""Well, my son was dying, so I guess that's why he said it, because my son was on his deathbed,"" Biden said. ""But that, that's not the reason why — they should have told me.""

Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine, as well as what his father did or did not know about it, remains a relevant question as House Democrats proceed toward impeaching President Donald Trump for allegedly leveraging the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into publicly announcing an investigation into the Bidens after Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign.

(H/T: Washington Free Beacon)",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-my-staff-should-have-told-me-hunters-job-in-ukraine-was-a-conflict-of-interest,2019-12-10
Joe Biden loses his cool at Fox News reporter who asked about his son's work with with Ukrainian natural gas company,"Amid the controversy over President Donald Trump's alleged remarks to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, former Vice President and current Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden apparently did not appreciate being asked to answer questions about his son's central role in the story.

The controversy centers around a complaint raised by an as-yet-anonymous whistleblower, who has claimed that Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani on an investigation into Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. Hunter Biden was previously on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukranian natural gas firm that has been under investigation by Ukranian prosecutors for corruption.

The scandal also potentially implicates Joe Biden himself, who once admitted to pressuring then-Ukranain president Petro Poroshenko to fire Ukraine's Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was leading the investigation into Burisma Holdings.

Biden once bragged during a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations event that in 2014, when he was Vice President and Ukraine was desperate for a one billion dollar loan guarantee from the United States, that he told Poroshenko, ""I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money."" Biden then told the audience, ""Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired.""

It would seem facially obvious, in light of the present controversy, that the actual propriety of Hunter Biden's dealings with Burisma, and Joe Biden's involvement in the Ukranian investigation of that company, would be a legitimate subject of a news inquiry.

Nonetheless, when Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked Biden on Saturday whether he had ever talked with his son Hunter about his work with Burisma Holdings, Joe Biden visibly lost his cool and treated the inquiry as completely out of bounds.

Biden first implausibly denied having ever spoken with Hunter about the matter, but then turned on Doocy, saying, ""Here's what I know. I know Trump deserves to be investigated... you should be asking HIM the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader? Trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that's what happened.""

Biden then snapped at Doocy, ""Ask the right questions!""

Biden's team actually tweeted the exchange from Biden's twitter account, with the caption, ""Eight. That's how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family. Why? Because he knows I'll beat him like a drum.""

The whistleblower's complaint has not yet been corroborated and appears to have been based on a secondhand account of the alleged conversations with Zelensky. The Ukranian foreign minister has strongly disputed that Trump pressured Zelensky in the alleged phone call.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-peter-doocy-ukraine,2019-09-22
Joe Biden remains isolated in Delaware as Putin flexes his nukes,"Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine continuing to escalate, President Joe Biden remains at his private estate in Delaware.

Fox News reported that Biden remains at his private residence in Delaware and that the media is having difficulty making contact with the administration.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

Putin blamed ""aggressive"" rhetoric from NATO members and thoroughgoing economic sanctions against Russia for why he chose to increase Russia's preparedness to use nuclear weapons.

Putin said, ""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country.""

""Senior officials of the leading NATO countries also allow aggressive statements against our country,"" the Russian president continued, ""Therefore I order the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.""

Last week, Putin warned that countries who interfere with the Russian invasion of Ukraine will face ""consequences you have never seen.""

Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer, said, ""[Putin] is right now threatening a nuclear escalation. This is a veiled threat – or maybe such a veiled threat – he just met with his chief of general staff and minister of defense. He is escalating the conflict into the nuclear domain in order to de-escalate – that is, topple Kyiv's regime quickly.""

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, ""It is not entirely clear if Mr. Putin has designs beyond the Ukraine, and it's because that's not perfectly clear that we continue to look for ways to bolster our NATO capabilities and to reassure our allies. I mean, one of the reasons we're doing this is because we want to make it clear to him that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.""

The Republican congressman from Illinois, Adam Kinzinger, referred to Putin's nuclear escalation as a ""bluff"" and suggested that Putin was merely posturing to make people fear Russia's capabilities.

He said, ""This breathlessness over nukes is mind blowing. We used to call his bluff. This is the Soviet Cold War play to make the public fear Russia.""

On Saturday, Western leaders issued a joint statement committing them to ending Russia's ability to access and use the SWIFT financial telecommunication network. By doing so, the West isolated Russia's economy, making it virtually impossible for them to conduct trade with their international partners.

Removing Russia from SWIFT will hurt the country's ability to export fossil fuels and natural gas.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-remains-isolated-in-delaware-as-putin-flexes-his-nukes,2022-02-27
"Joe Biden says his scandal-plagued son, Hunter, will join him on the campaign trail","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says his son, Hunter — who has been plagued by scandals for years and whose business dealings in Ukraine and China have drawn outrage from Republicans — will be joining the former vice president on the campaign trail.

What are the details?

The Reno Gazette Journal reported Thursday that the elder Biden said ""his son will be a visible part of the campaign,"" telling the paper of Hunter, ""He's a fine man. He's been through hell.""

Hunter Biden has thus far not been a presence during his father's current race, while scrutiny over Hunter's business dealings during Joe Biden's time as vice president are in the spotlight.

President Donald Trump is now facing an impeachment inquiry after being accused of asking the Ukrainian government to look into the Bidens' interactions in the country. Allegations of impropriety have swirled that Hunter used his position as the vice president's son to gain a paid seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm.

Hunter's involvement with a Chinese firm have also been called into question, but the Biden camp denies anything nefarious went on and claims the allegations have been refuted.

Regardless, Hunter has been the topic of tabloid fodder in recent years, after he dated his late brother's widow, was accused by his ex-wife of blowing money on prostitutes and drugs, allegedly fathered a child with a woman in Arizona but refuses to take a paternity test, and recently married another woman after knowing her just two weeks.

Anything else?

While President Trump is being accused of withholding aid from Ukraine in exchange for help to expose the Bidens, Joe Biden himself has boasted on tape that threatened to refuse the country $1 billion in aid in 2016 unless Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.

The Hill's John Solomon reported that Shokin, at the time, ""was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings that employed Biden's younger son, Hunter, as a board member.""

Joe Biden signs bills authorizing $40 billion in aid to Ukraine and to increase access to baby formula while in Asia,"On Saturday, President Joe Biden signed legislation that would authorize giving Ukraine an additional $40 billion in financial support as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine drags on.

This new legislation previously passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, CNBC reported, and deepens the U.S.’s commitment to Ukraine at a time of uncertainty as the Russian invasion enters its fourth month.

Ukraine has successfully defended its capital city of Kyiv as the Russian military refocuses its forces in the country’s eastern regions. Reportedly, American officials are warning that the Russian invasion could drag on for even longer.

The $40 billion aid package is intended to provide support for Ukraine through September and is considerably larger than an earlier emergency financing package that approved $13.6 billion.

Of the $40 billion, $20 billion is allocated for military assistance, ensuring the Ukrainian military has access to advanced weapons that will be used to slow the Russian military’s offensives; $8 billion is being allocated for general support of the Ukrainian economy; $5 billion will be used to address “global food shortages” that may arise from the recent collapse of Ukraine’s agricultural industry; and, more than $1 billion will be used to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees.

Biden signed the spending package while in the middle of his trip to Asia. According to a White House official, a separate U.S. official brought a copy of the unsigned bill on a commercial flight to Seoul for Biden to sign.

The fact that Biden signed the spending bill while abroad reflects the U.S.’s growing sense of urgency to continue providing support for Ukraine while overlapping international challenges pressure the president. While the Biden administration is reportedly working to reconfigure policy to confront China, it also is working to redirect American resources to accommodate Ukraine amid the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

While on his trip to Asia, Biden also signed an unrelated measure intended to increase access to baby formula while supplies remain scare in the U.S. This legislation is said to allow government benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — also known as WIC — to be used to buy more types of infant formula.

According to Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, the Biden administration knew that a baby formula shortage was imminent as early as this past February.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-signs-bills-authorizing-40-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-and-to-increase-access-to-baby-formula,2022-05-21
Joe Biden snaps at 'Today' host Savannah Guthrie over Hunter-Burisma question: 'You don't know what you're talking about!',"Former Vice President and presidential candidate Joe Biden snapped at ""Today"" co-anchor Savannah Guthrie on Monday morning after she asked him about the Burisma scandal surrounding his son, Hunter Biden.

What are the details?



During the interview, Guthrie asked the 77-year-old Biden whether he believed that his son's controversies in dealings with Ukraine have affected the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign.

Guthrie said that President Donald Trump's impeachment proceedings highlighted the scrutiny on Hunter's job at Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, and pointed out that Hunter's alleged dealings were placed on the forefront.

During the impeachment proceedings, House and Senate Republicans ""ensured that everyone knows"" about Hunter's role at Burisma.

""That's a good thing,"" the presidential candidate fired back. ""No one's found anything wrong with his dealings in Ukraine except they said that it's a 'bad image.'""

He agreed that the appearance of Hunter's role on the Burisma board did not look very good, but insisted that Guthrie didn't know what she was talking about anyway.

Guthrie asked if Biden believed it was inappropriate that Hunter accepted the position on the Ukrainian board as the company allegedly wanted access to information from the Obama administration.

""Do you think it was wrong for him to take that position knowing it was really because that company wanted access to you?"" she asked the presidential candidate.

“That's not true,"" he snapped. “You're saying things you do not know what you're talking about. No one said that. Who said that?""

Undaunted, Guthrie said that many people in the political world believed that it was ""kind of sleazy"" that Hunter accepted the job. She also wondered why Burisma would hire Hunter when he had no previous experience in the field, to which Biden responded, ""Because he's a very bright guy.""

www.youtube.com

Hunter, who has a well-known history of drug and alcohol abuse, was discharged from the Navy in 2013 after abusing drugs.



He took the position on Burisma's board in 2014 while his father was still President Barack Obama's vice president.

"Joe Biden snaps on Iowa voter who brings up Hunter and Burisma: 'You're a damn liar, man'","Former Vice President Joe Biden got very upset Thursday morning with an Iowa man who asked him about his son, Hunter, and his questionable appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Biden was at an event in New Hampton taking questions from attendees when a man got on the microphone and raised concerns about Biden's age, and about Biden's role in getting his son the lucrative position in Ukraine.

After prefacing his comments by expressing a belief that President Donald Trump has done wrong in Ukraine, the man turned the focus onto Biden.

The man accused Biden of sending his son to Ukraine to sit on the board of Burisma, where he was paid at least $50,000 per month despite having no relevant experience, and said Biden was just as guilty of ""selling access to the president"" as Trump is.

Biden cut the man off there, saying ""You're a damn liar, man."" The man said he heard those claims on television, specifically citing MSNBC.

The tense exchange then took a bizarre turn, during which Biden claimed ""I'm not sedentary"" and challenged the man to physical contests.

""You want to check my shape man, let's do push-ups together here, man. Let's run,"" Biden said. ""Let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take an IQ test. Ok?""

Biden later strangely accused the man of being ""too old to vote for me."" And at the 1:54 mark in the above video, it also sounds like Biden calls the man ""fat.""



It is simultaneously surprising and not surprising that Biden responded so poorly to the topic of Hunter and Burisma. Surprising because it is the most significant question for which he and his staff should have a prepared response, considering that Biden's Ukraine dealings are an important part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry and will certainly be used against him by Trump in the general election, should Biden advance that far.

Unsurprising because at various points throughout his campaign, Biden has seemed at times hostile, confused, and incoherent, and reports are that he is notoriously resistant to coaching from his staff.

Questions about the potential conflict of interest represented by his son being appointed to the Burisma board while Biden was vice president and point man on Ukraine are not likely to go anywhere. It is perhaps better to come up with a good answer for them rather than to attack voters for bringing it up.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-snaps-on-iowa-voter,2019-12-05
"Joe Biden small crowd at Detroit rally, uses huge teleprompter","Despite Joe Biden reportedly holding a commanding lead over President Donald Trump in the polls, some which show the former vice president leading by double digits, Biden continues to draw anything remotely close to a sizeable crowd. The concerning lack of excitement over Biden's campaign was punctuated last week when the Democratic presidential nominee and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made a campaign stop in Phoenix, and there was zero fanfare to greet them.

The Biden campaign experienced another dismal rally on Friday in Detroit, Michigan. Biden appeared at a ""voter mobilization event"" in Detroit at around 6:20 p.m. on Friday. This was a drive-in rally at the Michigan State Fairgrounds in Novi.

Video from the sparsely attended rally was shared on Twitter, where online commenters quickly noticed that Biden's teleprompter was bigger than his crowd.

The Biden campaign has been sensitive towards questions regarding Joe's use of teleprompters. Last month, Biden's national press secretary for the campaign became extremely defensive when he was asked about teleprompters.



Fox News' Bret Baier asked Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo, ""Has Joe Biden ever used a teleprompter during local interviews or to answer Q&A with supporters?"" Despite being asked the question several times, Ducklo never answered the question, dismissing the query as ""straight from the Trump campaign talking points.""

Days after Ducklo's interview, the Trump campaign released an ad titled ""Joe's Teleprompter,"" highlighting Biden's seeming dependence on a teleprompter during interviews.

In addition to the meager crowd at Biden's rally on Friday, Detroit was no picnic for Biden. Besides his poor turnout at the rally, Biden was asked about the New York Post article featuring alleged emails from Hunter Biden, which outline his son's reported overseas dealings in Ukraine and in China.



Right before Biden boarded a plane in Detroit, CBS News reporter Bo Erickson asked the former vice president for his response to the article. Biden lashed out, called it a ""smear campaign,"" adding, ""Right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-teleprompter-crowd-size,2020-10-17
Emails from Hunter Biden's laptop show that Joe Biden wrote a letter of recommendation for one of Hunter's Chinese business associates,"Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop continues to make waves following recent reports from the legacy media validating the authenticity of its contents.

After obtaining emails containing correspondence between Hunter Biden and his business associates involved in a joint venture with Chinese investment firms Bohai Capital and BHR, Fox News reported that in 2017, Joe Biden wrote a college letter of recommendation for the son of one of Hunter’s business associates.

In the email, dated January 3, 2017, Jonathan Li, the CEO of BHR, said, “Gentlemen[sic], please find the attached resume of my son, Chris Li. He is applying to the following colleges for this year.”

According to the email, Li’s son was applying to Brown, Cornell, and New York University. Li also attached an “updated version” of his son’s “CV"" in a subsequent email.

In a subsequent email exchange, Hunter Biden’s business associate, Jim Bulger, said, “Let’s [sic] see how we can be helpful here to Chris.”

Several weeks later, in February 2017, another business associate of Hunter’s, Erich Schwerin, said to Li: “Hunter asked me to send you a copy of the recommendation letter that he asked his father to write on behalf of Christopher for Brown University.”

“The original is being FedExed to Dr. Paxson directly at Brown,"" Schwerin said. “It should be there by Tuesday at the latest (given Monday is a holiday here in the US). Let us know if you have any questions.”

The recipient of the letter is the president of Brown University.

In response to Schwerin’s message, Li replied: “Hi Eric, Just see the email. It is just great! Thank you very much! And Hunter, thank you very much too. All the best to you all.”

It is reportedly “unclear” if Li’s son attended or was even admitted to Brown University.

When asked about these emails, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said, “We don’t comment on the laptop.”

However, he did not deny the laptop's existence or repeat a previous claim from the White House that the laptop was “Russian disinformation.”





A spokesperson from Brown University said that “because of privacy, we do not inquire of our Registrar’s office, Admissions office or any other office when we receive media requests such as these for information about Applicants to Brown.”

Joe Biden's campaign demands major news outlets stop booking Rudy Giuliani to speak about Ukraine,"Joe Biden's presidential campaign has sent a letter to major cable news networks and top anchors demanding they stop inviting Rudy Giuliani, the personal lawyer of President Donald Trump, on their programs.

The letter, sent on official Biden campaign letterhead, claims Giuliani is using the major news networks to spread ""conspiracy theories"" and ""advance his own narrative.""

Joe Biden to claim Hunter's emails as Russian misinformation,"President Donald Trump is very likely to use the emails and text messages regarding Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings that have allegedly been exposed in reports from the New York Post to confront Joe Biden in the final debate.

That became very evident on Thursday afternoon when there were reports that Trump's special guest to Thursday's presidential debate would be Tony Bobulinski, Hunter's former business partner. The Biden campaign may have tipped off how the Democratic presidential candidate will counter the potentially damaging accusations at Thursday night's debate.

Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager and director of communications for the Biden campaign, provided some insight on how the former vice president may respond to criticisms from President Trump regarding Hunter Biden's alleged business dealings in Ukraine and China.

""If we see tonight from Donald Trump these attacks on Vice President Biden's family, I think we need to be very, very clear that what he's doing here is amplifying Russian misinformation,"" Bedingfield told reporters during a pre-date press call.

Bedingfield added that the campaign expects Trump ""to continue to bully,"" and Biden is prepared for those attacks.

Top Democrats, such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), have already claimed, without evidence, that the allegations against Hunter Biden are Russian misinformation.

""Well, we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin. That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative about the vice president and his son,"" Schiff claimed in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.



Murphy proclaimed, ""Joe Biden — and all of us — SHOULD be furious that media outlets are spreading what is very likely Russian propaganda."" Murphy added that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani ""is effectively a Russian asset now.""

The Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe dismissed the claims that the alleged emails from Hunter Biden's laptop are Russian propaganda.

""Let me be clear, the intelligence community doesn't believe that, because there's no intelligence that supports that, and we have shared no intelligence with Chairman Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden's laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign — it's simply not true,"" Ratcliffe said.

Joe Biden dismissed the reported emails from Hunter Biden's laptop that was allegedly left at a Delaware repair shop.

""This is the same garbage Rudy Giuliani, Trump's henchman. It's the last-ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family,"" Biden told WISN-TV. ""Even the man who served with him on that committee, the former nominee for the Republican Party, said there's no basis to this, and you know, and all and the vast majority [sic] of the intelligence people have come out and said there's no basis at all.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-hunter-biden-presidential-debate-trump-emails,2020-10-22
Joe Rogan shreds social media's censoring of 'accurate' Hunter Biden laptop allegations,"Podcaster Joe Rogan says the social media crackdown on the Hunter Biden laptop allegations is disturbing and wrong.

What's a brief history here?

Hunter has been under scrutiny after the contents of laptops that purportedly belonged to him went public through a computer store owner in his home state of Delaware.

The contents reportedly included emails appearing to confirm clandestine foreign business dealings between his father and the Ukraine.

The New York Post was the first to report on the findings, and Twitter responded in kind by suspending the outlet from using its account. At the time of this reporting, the account still appears to be locked up as the Post reportedly refuses to delete the reports from its feed.

Former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has denied all allegations regarding overseas family business involvement.

What are the details?

According to the Washington Examiner, Rogan blasted Twitter and Facebook as well as traditional media outlets for what he says was a mishandling of the laptop allegations.

During a recent episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" the pragmatic show host explained that the New York Post — which broke the news of the laptop allegations — and its reporting was accurate.

""The Post, what they printed and put out there, is accurate,"" he began.

Alex Jones of Infowars, who appeared on the episode, argued that the proof is in the pudding when it comes to the Delaware repair shop's owner.

""They have the receipts,"" Jones argued.

What else?

New York Post editor Sohrab Ahmari spoke with Fox News on Wednesday night, and said that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is guilty of blackmail in attempting to force the New York-based outlet to remove its reporting from the social media platform.

According to Fox News, Ahmari's remarks were prompted by an exchange between Dorsey and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee.

""Dorsey explained that the Post is not technically locked out, because it can go back and delete the original post from two weeks ago announcing the Hunter Biden laptop story, and repost it today because the site's 'terms of service' have since changed.""

Speaking with the network's Martha MacCallum, Ahmari argued, ""I say that sounds like high-tech racketeering. We're being blackmailed the way an old mob boss would do.""

He later added that Dorsey as well as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg clearly have ""too much control over what we see and what we think.""

""Neither Mr. Joe Biden or Mr. Hunter Biden has denied the authenticity of the emails,"" he continued. ""Neither has denied the ownership of the laptop. Now we have an on-the-record source on one of the threads that we reported out saying 'Yes, they're real.' Again, what policy have we violated and what will happen if the only journalism that is allowed is journalism that the subject of the story permits?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-rogan-social-media-hunter-biden,2020-10-29
Financial records show Joe Biden has made millions since leaving office. How did he do it?,"Middle-class Joe, no mo'...

Joe Biden once described himself as the poorest man in the United States Senate, but financial records now paint a very different picture. In the two years following leaving office as vice president to Barack Obama, Biden and his wife made $15 million, according to a report published this summer in the Washington Free Beacon.

According to the Free Beacon, Joe and Jill Biden's income totaled approximately $390,000 by the end of the Obama administration. However, by the end of 2018, the Bidens' tax return reported an adjusted gross income of almost $4.6 million, a step down from the $11 million the couple made in 2017. The two are said to have a net worth of approximately $9 million, according to Forbes.

The focus on Biden's finances come as news of his son Hunter Biden's questionable business dealings in Ukraine have become public knowledge. The younger Biden served on the board of Burisma, an energy company that Ukrainian prosecutors suspected was engaged in fraudulent activity. Hunter Biden had no energy industry experience prior to accepting the position where he was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars.

How did they do it?

In an article published this week, Business Insider detailed how the Bidens made their wealth.

In his last year in the Senate, Biden's salary was $169,000. Thereafter, his tenure as vice president from 2009 to 2017 gave him a 30 percent raise, earning an average of $225,000 per year. Joe and Jill Biden also earned about $500,000 in pensions and social security benefits during those eight years.

Since leaving the vice presidency, Biden has made hundreds of thousands of dollars from books and speaking fees, and has even amassed a multi-million dollar real estate portfolio.

Biden invested in second and third homes after leaving office, including the purchase of a lavish $2.7 million beach-front 4,800 square-foot house in Delaware. He also rents a 12,000 square foot five bedroom, ten bathroom home in McLean, Virginia.

Millions in speaking fees and royalties

Biden made a significant amount of money from his 2017 book, ""Promise Me, Dad,"" about his relationship with another son, Beau Biden, who died of cancer. Biden's financial disclosure forms showed he made between $8,000 to $90,000 per stop on his book tour. The Free Beacon noted that the former vice president charged $234,000 for a ""VIP appearance"" stop on his book tour.

According to Forbes, the sales from the book book resulted in $1.8 million for the Bidens. Additional public speaking engagements contributed $2.4 million to the couple's net worth. CNBC also reported that Biden was paid $190,000 for a March 2018 lecture at Drew University in New Jersey.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe_biden_millions,2020-01-11
"Retired Senate Dem leader tells Glenn Beck: If I were still in office, I'd vote to acquit President Trump","Retired Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) was once one of the most influential Democrats in the country, but he has grown increasingly independent and wary of his party's growing radicalism.

Now Lieberman, who was nearly elected as the country's vice president in 2000, says that House Democrats have taken their impeachment power too far and if he were still in the Senate, he would vote to acquit President Donald Trump.

In a radio interview with Glenn Beck on Friday, the former senator says that while he believes Trump's dealings with Ukraine were ""inappropriate,"" they do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.

""The call that President Trump made with President Zelensky of Ukraine was inappropriate, was wrong, it shouldn't have been done,"" Lieberman told Beck, ""but did it reach the point where we can say nine months before an election (...) that, if we keep him in office, he represents a danger to the country? I don't think so.""

It's what the founders intended

Lieberman continued by noting that voters should ultimately decide Trump's fate.

""Leave it to the people in November. In other words, impeachment, as our framers intended, I believe was not meant to be punitive, to punish you either criminally or by taking you out of office,"" the retired senator said.

""It was meant,"" he added, ""to protect the country until the next election—and the closer it is to an election, the higher the threshold to convicting somebody, a president, and removing him from office.""

The former running-mate of Al Gore added that Trump's now inevitable acquittal in the Senate is a ""fair conclusion"" to his trial. Lieberman also added that if founders James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were alive today, they would look at Trump's acquittal in the Senate and say: ""This is what we intended.""

He would have voted for witnesses though

Lieberman also told Beck that while he believes Trump should be acquitted, he would have supported allowing testimony from additional witnesses if he were still in the Senate.

""I'd probably vote for witnesses,"" he said, adding that during the ""good ol' days"" of the Clinton impeachment, Senators were able to work across party lines and set a limit to the number of witnesses and conclude the trial within a reasonable time frame.

Ultimately, with or without witnesses, Lieberman believes this matter will be decided in voting booths come November.

""The people will decide,"" he concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe_lieberman_acquit_trump,2020-02-01
John Bolton has dirt on 'many relevant meetings and conversations' not yet discussed in impeachment probe: lawyer,"A lawyer for former national security adviser John Bolton said Friday that his client has information about ""many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed"" in the House's impeachment probe into the Trump administration's interactions with Ukrainian officials earlier this year.

Bolton's attorney, Charles Cooper of Cooper & Kirk, PLLC, teased the information in a letter sent to the House of Representatives' general counsel regarding House Democrats' efforts to get Bolton and his former deputy Charles Kupperman to testify before the ongoing impeachment inquiry.

In the letter, Cooper explained that his clients are prepared to testify over the objections of the president — who has asserted testimonial immunity in the matter — pending a judge's decision on whether or not they can.

On Thursday, House Democrats announced that they wouldn't subpoena Bolton after his legal team threatened to file a lawsuit on the matter when he didn't show for a scheduled voluntary deposition.

""We regret Mr. Bolton's decision not to appear voluntarily, but we have no interest in allowing the Administration to play rope-a-dope with us in the courts for months,"" a House Intelligence Committee official stated Thursday. On Wednesday, the House withdrew a subpoena for Kupperman in response to his lawsuit over his testimony.

In the Friday letter, Cooper wrote that he is ""dismayed that the Committees have chosen not to join us in seeking resolution from the Judicial Branch of this momentous Constitutional question as expeditiously as possible"" because it is important to both clients ""to get a definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch determining their Constitutional duty in the face of conflicting demands of the Legislative and Executive Branches.""

""Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months,"" said Bolton, who served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. for former President George W. Bush and has been repeatedly referred to over the last several weeks as a possible key witness to events important to the House impeachment hearings.

""For the backstory, stay tuned ..."" he cryptically offered.

Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned........

— John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) November 22, 2019

Fox News noted that the tweets appeared amid President Trump's wide-ranging interview on ""Fox & Friends"" Friday morning, and that, during the interview, Trump was asked if he was involved in freezing Bolton's account.

""No, of course not,"" Trump said. ""I had a good relationship with John.""

Then Bolton tweeted again, this time alleging that his account was ""suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of [his] resignation as National Security Advisor.""

We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come.....

— John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) November 22, 2019

Bolton, as if in response, tweeted again Friday afternoon, claiming it was in fact ""the White House"" that ""refused to return access to [his] personal Twitter account"" after he resigned.

""Out of fear of what I may say?"" Bolton asked, before adding, ""To those who speculated I went into hiding, I'm sorry to disappoint!""

The mystery continues



Bolton resigned from his post as national security adviser in September, claiming he was uncomfortable defending the president's foreign policy and national security decisions.

Since then, it has been alleged that Bolton was upset over Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani's involvement in the Ukraine investigation, claiming Giuliani was conducting a ""rouge operation"" along with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Fiona Hill, the former senior Russia and Europe adviser at the White House, recalled Bolton telling her.

Hill testified in her closed-door testimony with House impeachment investigators that Bolton called Giuliani ""a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.""

Bolton was so wary he allegedly told Hill to alert National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg about the operation.

Wait, there's more

Later, a story broke that Bolton's personal attorney teased in a letter to Congress that his client had ""many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed"" in the impeachment probe, though, so far, Bolton has declined to voluntarily testify.

Democrats, likely interested in his testimony, have yet to subpoena him, and it is rumored that Bolton would challenge it in court if her were to be subpoenaed.

While there is justified speculation that Bolton's hiatus and now return to Twitter is linked to the impeachment probe, Axios says it's worth noting that Bolton has a forthcoming book about his time in the Trump White House.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-bolton-ominous-twitter-return,2019-11-22
"John Bolton's lawyers are negotiating with House Democrats leading impeachment inquiry, report says","Former national security adviser John Bolton may cooperate with House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

According to CNN, Bolton's lawyers have negotiated with the House committees spearheading the impeachment probe — Judiciary, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs — about the possibility of Bolton offering closed-door testimony.

If Bolton agrees to be deposed, he would offer investigators his knowledge about Trump's relationship with Ukraine. The president is accused of threatening to withhold aid from Ukraine if they did not comply with Trump's request to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Before his tumultuous West Wing departure, Bolton had become alarmed over Trump's Ukraine dealings.

Fiona Hill, the president's former Russia adviser, testified to the impeachment panel last week that Bolton was so concerned about the Ukraine intervention of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, that he directed Hill to inform a White House lawyer.

Hill told Congress that Bolton referred to the intervention as a ""rouge operation"" by Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.

""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Hill recounted Bolton telling her.

John Kerry's response to Ukraine invasion: 'I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate',"John Kerry cautioned Wednesday that Russia's war on Ukraine will distract the international community from one of the Biden administration's top national security priorities: climate change.

The former secretary of state and current U.S. special envoy for climate was discussing Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine during an interview on BBC Arabic when he said the war will have ""massive emissions consequences"" for the entire world.

""I'm very concerned about, I'm concerned about Ukraine because of the people of Ukraine and because of the principles that are at risk, in terms of international law and trying to change boundaries of international law by force. I thought we lived in a world that had said no to that kind of activity. And I hope diplomacy will win,"" Kerry said.

""But massive emissions consequences to the war but equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he continued. ""So, you know hopefully President Putin would realize that in the Northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.

""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk. And the people of Russia are at risk,"" he added. ""And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry's comments echo comments he made in an interview Sunday, when he told GZERO Media's Ian Bremmer that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will have a ""monumental impact on the ability and willingness of people to do what's necessary"" to fight climate change.

""Ukraine, one way or the other — we're going to resolve it, ultimately, over X number of years. But the climate crisis remains existential, just as it was before the Ukraine crisis came up,"" Kerry said, before the invasion began.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its sovereign neighbor Ukraine Thursday with ground, air, and naval forces in the largest military campaign by one state against another in Europe since World War II.

Ukrainian cities have been attacked with shelling and airstrikes. Civilians have either attempted to flee or made makeshift bomb shelters in subway systems. Reports indicate there are hundreds of casualties, although the exact numbers of injured or dead remain unknown in this chaotic, ongoing war.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Thursday that the Russian army destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities, including 11 airbases, just hours after launching the invasion.

Ukraine said Thursday morning that at least 40 soldiers and 10 civilians had been killed in the conflict.



In the context of widespread suffering in Ukraine caused by Russian President Vladimir Putin's war, Republican lawmakers blasted Kerry's statements about climate change.

""Climate change religious zealot John Kerry is worried that the first major ground war in Europe in 80 years & #Putin’s threat of nuclear consequences is getting more attention than his climate agenda,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted.

""As Sec. of State, John Kerry did nothing to stop the invasion of Crimea, all for an unenforceable agreement to fight the air. Now that his chickens came home to roost, he’s more worried about emissions from war & distraction from the climate than the slaughter in #Ukraine,"" said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.).



""Putin is killing innocent Ukrainians and John Kerry is asking him to stay 'on track' for the climate? Despicable,"" Rep. August Pfluger (R-Fla.) remarked. ""Russian energy is some of the worst for the environment. The Biden Admin climate religion has made our world less safe.""

"Boris Johnson says 'toxic masculinity' led to war in Ukraine, suggests that a woman wouldn't have started the war","A female Russian president would never have invaded Ukraine, so says British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

According to Business Insider, Johnson sat down with German news outlet ZDF shortly following the G7 summit and blamed much of Vladimir Putin's behavior, especially the war in Ukraine, on his male identity.

""If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn't, if he were, I really don't think he would have embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has,"" Johnson said, per ZDF.

""If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it's what he's doing in Ukraine,"" Johnson continued.

However, despite his criticisms of Putin, Johnson does not foresee the war in Ukraine coming to a conclusion any time soon, telling ZDF that there is ""no possible deal"" between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at present.



The gendered nature of Johnson's comments likely stems from various gender equality conversations he and other leaders had throughout the three-day summit. According to Kevin Liptak of CNN, ""Gender equality was one of the themes of this year's G7, where leaders dedicated an entire working session to the subject.""

Though there was no formal G7 discussion about the Dobbs decision from the United States Supreme Court, which effectively overturned Roe v. Wade, the topic did simmer under the surface.

""We have discussed gender equality and indeed, there were many voices, very sad and very worried about the setback,"" European Union Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

President Biden has expressed similar frustrations about the Dobbs decision.

Biden and Johnson joined Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi for the summit. Though many of their conversations were of a serious nature, Johnson and others still found a way to poke fun at Putin, who was not in attendance.

When Johnson joked with photographers about whether the group should keep their jackets on or take them off, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau replied, “Let’s wait for the picture.”

“We all have to show we’re tougher than Putin,” Johnson then said in jest, referring to the famous photograph taken of Putin while he was riding horseback shirtless in 2009.

“We’re going to get the bare-chested horseback-riding display,” Trudeau agreed.

“Oh, yes! Horseback riding is the best,” von der Leyen added.

“We got to show them our pecs,” Johnson said to close out the joke.

Texas Sen. Cornyn blasts Dems: 'First time in history a president has been impeached for a non-crime',"Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn did not hold back on congressional Democrats on Sunday morning.

In an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" the top GOP senator ripped the Democratic-led impeachment of President Donald Trump over his dealings with Ukraine.

""This is the first time in history where a President has been impeached for a non-crime for events that never occurred,"" Cornyn told host Margaret Brennan, adding that the charges against Trump were ""really unique"" and will be taken ""very seriously"" by his Senate colleagues.

Cornyn, who is a former judge, also correctly noted that the article of impeachment against the president alleging ""abuse of power"" is not a crime within itself. ""He's been charged with abuse of power, which is not treason, which is not bribery, which is not a high crime and misdemeanor,"" he said.

'Grifters and other hanger-ons'

Brennan pressed Cornyn on whether recent allegations by Lev Parnas, who claimed in an MSNBC interview that Rudy Giuliani acted as a personal lawyer to Trump when he went to Ukraine in order to gather evidence against the Bidens, should be included in the Senate trial.

""I would be careful before crediting the veracity of someone who is under indictment...and trying to get leniency from prosecutors,"" Cornyn responded while pointing out it was not the first time someone has exaggerated their proximity to Trump and his team.

""There's no question that there have been a series of grifters and other hanger-ons that have associated themselves with the president's campaign and claimed to have a special relationship with the president,"" Cornyn explained.

'Constitutionally invalid'

Cornyn's scathing criticism of the Democrats' impeachment case come as Trump's lawyers have blasted the articles of impeachment against the president as ""constitutionally invalid"" and ""nothing more than a dangerous attack on the American people.""

In a six-page formal response to the Democrats' allegations that was released on Saturday evening, White House lawyers Alan Sekulow and Pat A. Cipollone argued the charges levied by House Democrats do not withstand scrutiny.

""The Articles of Impeachment are constitutionally invalid on their face. They fail to engage any crime or violation of law whatsoever, let alone 'high Crimes and Misdemeanors,' as required by the Constitution,"" the document read.



""In the end, the entire process is nothing more than a dangerous attack on the American people themselves and their fundamental right to vote,"" Sekulow and Cipollone concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jon_cornyn_rips_democrats_impeachment,2020-01-19
Joy Behar shredded for jaw-dropping complaints that Ukraine invasion might interfere with her swanky European vacation plans,"Joy Behar, co-host on ""The View,"" is facing heavy backlash after selfishly complaining that the Ukraine-Russia crisis could derail her plans for a European vacation.

What are the details?

Behar on Thursday — the very day Russian forces invaded Ukraine — expressed her concerns that the ongoing conflict might affect her plans to visit Italy for a lavish vacation.

The panel began by discussing the escalating war during the broadcast, prompting co-host Sunny Hostin to express her fears for those Ukrainians who might end up injured or dead due to the ongoing conflict.

""What I also thought about was the fact that estimates are 50,000 Ukrainians will be dead or wounded and that this is going to start a humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis in Europe,"" she explained. ""We’re talking about 5 million people that are going to be displaced. It’s heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen.""

Even co-host Whoopi Goldberg added that the conflict was ""so disheartening.""

""The people in Russia, they don't want this war,"" she added. ""[Putin] wants it because he's trying to hold on.""



Behar, however, appeared to care little for human suffering, casualties, and displacement and said that she was concerned that her trip to Italy might be derailed.

""Well, I'm scared of what's going to happen in Western Europe, too. You know, you plan a trip, you want to go there,"" she attempted to reason. ""[I wanted] to go to Italy for four years. I haven't been able to make it because of the pandemic — and now this. It's like, what's going to happen there, too?""

What was the reaction?

Much of social media condemned Behar's remarks.

Leading the criticism was Barstool Sports writer Kevin Clancy, who castigated Behar for her apparent selfishness.

""The true horror of the worldwide pandemic and Russia invading Ukraine? Joy Behar hasn't been able to take her trip to Italy,"" Clancy wrote on Twitter. ""Thoughts and Prayers for Joy. We hope she makes it through this tragedy.""

New York Post and Fox News writer Karol Markowicz added, ""Did Putin even stop to think how his invasion would affect Joy Behar's trip to Italy?""







Washington Times columnist Tim Young spat, ""Joy Behar is elitist trash.""

He later added, ""Joy Behar is the perfect liberal Karen... she doesnt care about people getting killed in Ukraine, just that this might interrupt her trips to Italy.""

A widely liked tweet from user Joanne Mason read, ""God grant me the absolute confidence and egocentricity of Joy Behar complaining that a war ruined her vacation plans while the bombs are still literally dropping.""

Even Behar fans turned their backs on the co-host over the remarks.

One user wrote, ""She sounded so damned entitled when she said that and I actually like her.""

""I'm old and say dumb stuff sometimes too, but holy hell, she was being just startlingly oblivious,"" another user added.

Twitter user Sarara chimed in, ""Can you even imagine being so privileged, so removed from reality, so far up your own colon that you’d respond to a massive humanitarian crisis by complaining about your hypothetical vacation being disrupted? Seriously, what the hell @JoyVBehar?""

Joy Reid says no one used the word inflation until Republicans taught them what it means to damage Democrats,"MSNBC anchor Joy Reid said that no one used the word inflation until Republicans taught them what it means in order to damage Democrats.

The bizarre charge was made by Reid on the progressive news channel Thursday.

""The only people you ever really hear use the word inflation are journalists and economists. Right? So that is not a part of the normal lexicon,"" she claimed.

""So it's interesting that Republicans are doing something they don't normally do, right, which is not use the common tongue, not use just common English, like do on their campaigns, like they do with crime,"" Reid continued.

""But what they've done is they've taught people the word inflation. Right? Most people who would have never used that word ever in their lives are using it now because they’ve been taught it. Including on TV, including in newspapers, they’ve been taught this word,"" she added.

""And they sort of wrap this word around whatever it is that they really want to vote, you know, the reason they really want to vote,"" Reid concluded.

Video of Reid's claims were circulated on social media and ridiculed by many on the right.

The Biden administration has tried to explain away high inflation by blaming the Russian war in Ukraine and supply chain issues caused by the global lockdown response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, polling shows that a plurality of Americans blame Biden's high spending policies for the damaging rise in prices.

In May, Steve Rattner, who worked for the Obama administration, admitted that most economists were saying Biden's spending was like tossing gasoline onto a fire in relation to inflation.

Meanwhile, Joy Reid's ratings are about as low as inflation is high. In April, her show garnered the lowest ratings in its entire two year span, both in overall viewers and among the most important demographic ages.

MSNBC's Joy Reid wants a 'Trump Crimes Commission' installed after the election,"MSNBC host Joy Reid floated the idea of a potential future Biden administration establishing a ""Trump Crimes Commission"" to investigate President Donald Trump's actions while in office — and perhaps even during his campaign, Mediaite reported.

Such a move would be unprecedented in American politics, as it is a longstanding norm that successors do not use their authority to investigate former political opponents.

Reid, an outspoken Trump critic, made the suggestion Tuesday night while discussing the final release of the bipartisan Senate report on Russian interference in the 2016 election with former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes.

""It strikes me in just reading through this that Paul Manafort did to the United States what he had previously done to Ukraine,"" Reid said. ""He had messed with their elections in the past in order to put a [Russian President Vladimir]Putin puppet in charge. And now you have a president who is ruminating apparently on meeting with Vladimir Putin in New York, has talked about putting him back in the G7, and seems to be doing everything — you know, if there was a Christmas list that Vladimir Putin would have put together, it couldn't have gotten any better than what Donald Trump is doing.

""If Joe Biden becomes president ... should [there] be something like a Trump Crimes Commission?"" she asked. ""Should he impanel such a commission? And do you think that members of the Trump campaign including up to the president should be at least looked at for prosecution?""

Reid is not the first to float such an idea. Journalist Andrew Feinberg and MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner have also called for a crimes commission to be empaneled, along with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California.

Rhodes, in response to Reid's prompting, essentially agreed with the proposition but with a few caveats about how it would look and how it should be executed.



""There is no question in my mind, Joy, that there has to be an accountability process if Joe Biden wins, to protect the integrity of our democracy,"" he said. ""It's not about getting revenge. It's not about going after political opponents. That's what Donald Trump does. It's about sending a message that if you collude with, facilitate, coordinate with a foreign adversary and hacking private materials and releasing them that there are going to be consequences.""

He added: ""We cannot just say we're going to turn the page. We have to deal with this as a country. And so I really think it's essential that we have some accountability process if Joe Biden wins the election.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-reid-trump-crimes-commission,2020-08-19
JPMorgan analysts say you'll be paying $6 per gallon for gas this summer,"As the average price for gasoline reached $6 per gallon in California on Tuesday, analysts at JPMorgan are warning that price could be the norm everywhere in the country by the end of summer.

The national average price of gas is now at a record high of $4.57 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. That number is a 16 cent increase from the average last week, a 48 cent increase over last month, and nearly $1.50 more expensive than the national average last year, which was $3.04. Every state now has an average gas price above $4 per gallon, with Georgia, Kansas, and Oklahoma catching up to the rest of the country as of Tuesday.



Prices are expected to continue to rise as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine disrupts international supply chains while at home, the Biden administration has canceled oil and gas lease sales. With more Americans expected to travel for work or vacation over the summer, a likely increase in demand for gas could push prices up even higher.

""There is a real risk the price could reach $6+ a gallon by August,"" JPMorgan analyst Natasha Kaneva told CNN on Tuesday. JPMorgan predicts that prices could soar another 37% by August as East Coast gasoline inventories have reached their lowest level since 2011.

U.S. and Canadian oil refineries took a hit during the pandemic, with some closing permanently and others being converted to refine renewable fuels instead of crude oil, CNN reports. The war in Ukraine is exacerbating the problem by heavily restricting the supply of gas available to European countries that have relied on Russia for oil, which has led to increased demand for U.S. and Canadian exports.

The shift in focus to exports has diverted U.S. and Canadian refineries from supplying Eastern U.S. gas stations, according to JPMorgan's analysis.

""If exports persist at this elevated pace and refinery runs -- already near the top range for reasonable utilization rates -- fall within our expectations, gasoline inventories could continue to draw to levels below 2008 lows and retail gasoline prices could climb to $6/gallon or even higher,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote.

If those assumptions hold, total U.S. gasoline inventories could fall below 160 million barrels by the end of August, which would be the lowest level since the 1950s and would translate to a national average price of $6.20 per gallon of gas.

To avoid that disaster, U.S. refineries need to ""immediately"" reduce exports and increase gasoline production. If they don't, ""US consumers should not expect much in the way of relief in prices at the pump until the end of the year,"" JPMorgan said.

There are other factors that could keep the price of gasoline from hitting $6, but none of them are good. If the price rises too high too quickly, some consumers will be unwilling to drive as much and that reduced demand could help stabilize prices. Another bad option is economic recession: Reduced job growth would mean fewer people driving to work, which would ease demand for gasoline. Prices could fall, but would that matter if people were losing their jobs?



Government estimates paint a slightly more cheerful picture. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast in April that the national average retail price will drop to $3.75 per gallon in July and then $3.68 per gallon in September, citing an expected increase in gasoline production from U.S. refineries to ""gradually place downward pressure on wholesale gasoline margins and retail prices during the summer.""

JPMorgan CEO warns economic 'hurricane' is approaching America: 'You'd better brace yourself',"JP Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon warned Wednesday that an economic ""hurricane"" is forming that could unfortunately make landfall in the United States.

What are the details?

Speaking at a financial conference in New York, Dimon disclosed that America's largest bank is preparing itself for the impending storm, Bloomberg News reported.

""You know, I said there’s storm clouds but I’m going to change it — it’s a hurricane,"" Dimon warned.

Dimon explained economists do not know if the forthcoming economic storm will be ""a minor one or Superstorm Sandy,"" referring to the 2012 hurricane that made landfall in New Jersey and caused tens of billions of dollars worth of damage.

""You’d better brace yourself,"" he added. ""JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we’re going to be very conservative with our balance sheet.""



Two specific factors have Dimon and JPMorgan concerned. The first is the quantitative tightening the Federal Reserve is expected to begin this month. The second is the war in Ukraine, which will continue to negatively impact the commodities market, especially oil.

""Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,"" Dimon said, CNBC reported. ""That hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way.""

Anything else?

Last month, JPMorgan economists slashed their growth outlook for the second half of 2022 and 2023.

The bank had expected 3% growth in the second half of 2022, but lowered that expectation to just 2.4%, while the growth outlook for the first half of 2023 was lowered to 1.5% from 2.1% and the second half of 2023 was lowered to 1% from 1.4%. Ongoing economic woes were behind the tempered expectations.

Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts warned just two weeks ago that Americans could be paying at least $6 per gallon of gas by August. The national average hit $4.67 per gallon on Wednesday, a new record.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jpmorgan-ceo-warns-economic-hurricane-is-coming,2022-06-01
More bad news for the Joe Biden clan: Judge orders Hunter Biden to appear for sworn testimony,"Joe Biden has had a rough few weeks. After losing three consecutive Democratic primary election battles in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, an Arkansas judge has now ordered the former vice president's son to testify in court in person.

According to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Circuit Judge Holly Meyer has ordered Hunter Biden to appear next month for a deposition after he said he was unavailable until April.

""He needs to make himself available and unless his hair is on fire, he needs to be in Arkansas and he needs to be in a deposition,"" she told the lawyers involved in the case during a recent telephone call.

What's this about?

Hunter Biden is the defendant in a paternity lawsuit filed by Lunden Alexis Roberts. In January, an Arkansas court determined that the 50-year-old Biden is the father of her toddler after a DNA established his paternity.

The legal battle now turns to the issue of child support, which Biden has delayed, claiming that he is unemployed.

In a Nov. 27 affidavit, Biden swore to the court that he did not have a reliable source of income since last May.

Clint Lancaster, an attorney representing the child's mother, had tried unsuccessfully to depose Biden before a March 13 pretrial hearing. However, Biden's attorney, Brent Langdon, has argued a notice of deposition instructing Biden to testify in Little Rock on March 5, was ""unduly burdensome and oppressive.""

Langdon wrote that Biden ""can be available April 1, 2020,"" in a ""motion to quash"" and ""motion for protective order"" he filed on Tuesday.

""My client cannot be available prior to that date,"" he argued.

However, during a conference call with lawyers on Wednesday, Judge Meyer probed Langdon on Biden's availability and current employment status.

""My question to you is, why could your client not be available until after April 1? All the information I have is that he's unemployed,"" she said, according to the Democrat Gazette.

Langdon did not tell the court what was keeping Biden so busy, the report said.

What else?

Democrats fret that Hunter Biden testifying in court could further jeopardize his father's campaign, as he could be forced to disclose the nature and sources of his business dealings in Ukraine, which came under scrutiny during the Democratic-led impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump.

Judge Meyer ordered Hunter Biden to appear in court in January after he was accused of improperly withholding financial records. Hunter Biden was instructed to ""show cause, if any exists, as to why he should not be held in contempt for any of the alleged violations of this Court's orders.""

Hunter Biden has denied any allegations of wrongdoing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-orders-hunter-biden-to-appear-for-sworn-testimony,2020-02-27
"Just two weeks before his firing, Michael Atkinson wrote letter to Chuck Schumer about whistleblowers","President Donald Trump fired Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson on Friday, triggering accusations of ""retribution"" against the man who first informed Congress about the Ukraine whistleblower.

Just two weeks before his ousting, Atkinson wrote to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and ""took a thinly veiled swipe"" at officials who did not defend the whistleblower, including, presumably, the president, although Atkinson did not cite specific names, Politico reported.

""As you know, the past six months have been a searing time for whistleblowers and for those who work to protect them from reprisal or threat of reprisal for reporting alleged wrongdoing,"" Atkinson said.

Atkinson went on to write:

People may spend their entire careers publicly encouraging whistleblowers to come forward and sound the alarm if they observe suspected abuse or wrongdoing in the federal government. Many of those same people proclaim publicly that they will stand by whistleblowers and protect them from reprisal or threat of reprisal when they do sound the alarm.



Those repeated assurances of support for whistleblowers in ordinary matters are rendered meaningless if whistleblowers actually come forward in good faith with information concerning an extraordinary matter and are allowed to be vilified, threatened, publicly ridiculed, or — perhaps even worse — utterly abandoned by fair weather whistleblower champions. It is precisely when the stakes are highest, and the conditions searing, that public officials must well and faithfully discharge the duties of their offices.



According to Politico, Atkinson's letter came in response to Schumer's request that all inspectors general investigate ""instances of retaliation against anyone who has made, or in the future makes, protected disclosures of presidential misconduct.""

Trump defended his decision to fire Atkinson on Saturday as his ""absolute right."" He also bashed Atkinson for giving Congress the ""terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report.""

Atkinson's firing will become official in 30 days.

In the meantime, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said the White House must answer questions Atkinson's dismissal.

""Congress has been crystal clear that written reasons must be given when IGs are removed for a lack of confidence. More details are needed from the administration,"" Grassley said Saturday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/just-two-weeks-before-his-firing-michael-atkinson-wrote-letter-to-chuck-schumer-about-whistleblowers,2020-04-05
Kamala Harris claims Giuliani has 'clearly broken many laws' — but crumbles when confronted by Anderson Cooper,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) claimed Friday that Rudy Giuliani has ""clearly broken many laws"" — but crumbled under the weight of her unsubstantiated claims when pressed by CNN host Anderson Cooper.

""I'm just glad to see that the process is beginning to really do the investigation into Rudy Giuliani. He has clearly broken many laws,"" Harris told Cooper.

The Democratic presidential contender was responding to news that Giuliani — who works as President Donald Trump's personal attorney — attempted to secure a State Department visa for ousted Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who had promised Giuliani dirt on Democrats, CNN reported.

Harris characterized Giuliani's actions as ""further evidence of corruption"" by the Trump administration. She said Giuliani's actions demonstrate a violation of an ""extraordinary number of rules and ethical laws.""

But when pressed by Cooper exactly what rules or laws Giuliani has violated, Harris could not name a single one.

""Are there specific laws that you believe has broken,"" Cooper asked.

""Well, I, I, I don't know,"" Harris responded.

The California lawmaker went on to speculate on the ""range"" of crimes she thinks Giuliani has committed, citing abuse of power, bribery, and lying about the breadth of his work. She did not, however, offer evidence to back any of her claims.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-claims-giuliani-has-clearly-broken-many-laws-but-crumbles-when-confronted-by-anderson-cooper,2019-10-19
Kamala Harris brutally mocked over plans to help secure border — but not in America: 'Sorry Ukraine!',"Vice President Kamala Harris, whom President Joe Biden tasked with managing the border crisis, is finally going to help secure a national border.

Just not in the United States.

What are the details?

Harris jetted off to Germany on Thursday to meet with European leaders and help bolster border security in Ukraine. While attending the Munich Security Conference, Harris will meet about one dozen heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and leaders of the Baltic states, the Associated Press reported.

With an estimated 150,000 troops along Ukraine's border, Biden said this week that he expects Russia to invade Ukraine within several days.

""I’m in Munich, Germany to lead the U.S. delegation at the Munich Security Conference. Tomorrow I will join other world leaders to underscore our commitments to our allies and partners, and demonstrate our unity in the face of Russian aggression on Ukraine’s borders,"" Harris explained on Twitter.

What was the reaction?

Harris was brutally mocked over the purpose of her trip — to help bolster security along Ukraine's borders by diplomatically easing tensions and decreasing the likelihood of war in eastern Europe — given that Harris abdicated her responsibility to secure America's southern border.

Last March, Biden appointed Harris to lead the Biden administration's response to the border crisis, which resulted in nearly 2 million migrant arrests in 2021. Unfortunately, it took nearly 100 days after Biden's appointment for Harris to visit the southern border; that visit was to El Paso, a Texas city hundreds of miles away from the epicenter of the border crisis.

""She’s the undisputed expert on open borders,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) mocked.

""If she treats Ukraine’s border like she has our southern border she’ll propose paying invading Russians,"" conservative radio host Dana Loesch mocked.

""It would be great if Kamala Harris did her job and secured our southern border before flying to Ukraine to help secure theirs!"" Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) said.

""She can’t even secure our own border,"" Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.) pointed out.

""Democrats are willing to fly across the planet to protect anyone else’s border but our own,"" one person observed.

""Wrong Border,"" another person observed.

""Did she ever go to OUR border????"" one person wondered.

""Does she ever plan to fly to Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas to help secure America’s border, or nah?"" another person questioned.

""Only in the United States do our elected officials feel more of an obligation to other countries’ borders than our own,"" one person said.

""She’s 0-1 at securing borders so far. Sorry Ukraine!"" one person mocked.

""Broke: Secure the southern border. Woke: Open borders. Bespoke: Open borders while securing the border of a nation 5,600 miles away,"" another person mocked.

""The search continues for a border she can actually secure,"" another person mocked.

While Harris looks abroad to bolster her border-securing résumé, the Department of Homeland Security reported nearly 154,000 migrant encounters at the southern U.S. border last month, meaning the border crisis in American remains alive and well.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-mocked-secure-border-in-ukraine,2022-02-18
Kamala Harris says to 'leave Joe Biden alone' on Ukraine — Nikki Haley blasts 'embarrassing' defense,"Democratic presidential candidates are having a difficult time speaking definitively about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son's business in Ukraine.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she didn't know whether her own proposed ethics policy would preclude a vice president's child from serving on the board of a foreign company.

Over the weekend, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was asked a similar question — and responded by telling everyone to ""leave Joe Biden alone.""

Reporter: If you were elected president, would you allow the son or daughter of your vice president to serve on a board of an oil company outside this country?""

Harris: Probably not. The problem that we've got, again, with this issue is that it's a distraction from the fact that, look, as far as I'm concerned, leave Joe Biden alone. Just leave him alone. On the issue of what this president has done that has been about corrupting America's democracy, being in cahoots with a foreign leader, to yet again, try and manipulate the election of the President of the United States.

Harris admits that she would not allow her vice president to do what Biden did during the Obama administration — indicating that she believes something was improper about the arrangement — yet she demands that everyone stop asking questions about it, even though Biden's strong chance at becoming the Democratic presidential nominee could possibly be diminishing.



Democrats have struggled to push for President Donald Trump's impeachment while avoiding in-depth discussion about Biden's own potential abuse of power. The problem for them is that the two are inextricably linked, and you can't really dig into Trump without digging into Biden.

Hunter Biden was named to the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, earning $50,000 per month. In 2016, Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless Ukrainian officials fired prosecutor Viktor Shokin — who reportedly happened to have conducted an investigation of Burisma and Hunter Biden before he was fired.

Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the situation during a July phone call, which is being used by Democrats as potential grounds for impeachment.

Former U.S. Ambassador to United Nations Nikki Haley called Harris out for this deflecting response on Twitter.

""Leave Joe Biden alone? So are you telling us @KamalaHarris that what Biden did was ethical and moral?"" Haley wrote. ""Where are the questions about the conflict of interest that occurred from Biden's actions and the issues with his son? This response is embarrassing.""

"Kamala Harris blunders about NATO again, this time in a deleted tweet","Vice President Kamala Harris was caught in a precarious blunder again when she implied in a tweet that Ukraine was a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin has cited the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO as part of his justification for invading the former Soviet republic as a matter of national defense.

""When I was in Poland, I met with U.S. and Polish service members, thanking them for standing with our NATO allies for freedom, peace, and security,"" read the tweet from the @KamalaHarris account. ""The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance.""

Harris' false claim that Ukraine had already joined NATO was an embarrassing and potentially harmful blunder.

That tweet was deleted and replaced with one clarifying that the U.S. stood behind Ukraine and also behind NATO.

Harris had made the exact same mistake in a speech on Saturday at the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Washington D.C.

""Russia’s invasion threatens not just Ukraine’s democracy, it threatens democracy and security across Europe,"" Harris said during her speech. ""So I will say what I know we all say, and I will say over and over again: The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance.""

The White House altered the transcript of the event to add the word ""and"" in parenthesis to fix the gaffe.

After deleted the tweet, Harris' office blamed the DNC for the mistake.

""The 'and' was omitted by accident, so we took it down and reposted with the correct remarks,"" the DNC said in an email to Fox News.

The vice president's office has been plagued by staffers leaving amidst rumors of dysfunction and contentious bickering with the president's staff. Harris has been accused by some of being unprepared for media briefings and other official meetings.

Kamala Harris wants President Trump's Twitter account suspended over his whistleblower tweets,"Democratic U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) said President Donald Trump's Twitter account should be suspended over his tweets about the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal that could lead to Trump's impeachment, CNN reported.

""The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" Harris told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

'The privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him'

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people ... I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that ... his Twitter account should be suspended,"" added Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate. ""I think there is plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people. And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.""

Cooper asked the California senator if she was concerned that suspending Trump's Twitter account would be viewed as Silicon Valley trying to ""silence"" him. Harris replied that a president's words shouldn't be ""about belittling, much less harming, anyone"" and that she doesn't believe Trump ever ""fully appreciated that responsibility.""

""If he's not gonna exercise self-restraint, then perhaps there should be other mechanisms in place to make sure that his words do not, in fact, harm anyone,"" she added. ""And that's my point. What we want to make sure is that his words do not actually result in harm to anyone.""

"Keith Olbermann says Tucker Carlson, Tulsi Gabbard are 'Russian assets,' suggests 'detaining them militarily' — and gets lambasted for it","""The View"" co-hosts on Monday said Fox News' Tucker Carlson and former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) should be investigated by the Justice Department and even be criminally detained for alleged pro-Russian views.

A few hours later, far-left noisemaker Keith Olbermann piggybacked on those assertions and called Carlson and Gabbard ""Russian assets.""

What are the details?

On ""The View"" episode, co-host Ana Navarro said, ""I think DOJ, in the same way that it is setting up a task force to investigate [Russian] oligarchs, should look into people who are Russian propagandists and shilling for Putin. If you are a foreign asset to a dictator, it should be investigated.""

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg added, ""They used to arrest people for doing stuff like this. If they thought you were colluding with a Russian agent or putting out information or taking information and handing it over to Russia, they used to actually investigate stuff like this. And I guess now, you know, there seems to be no bars.""

And co-host Joy Behar declared that Carlson and Gabbard were getting ""money"" for expressing what she saw as their expression of pro-Russian views.

A few hours later a Twitter user posted a video of ""The View"" co-hosts in action, calling their declarations ""deranged"" — and Olbermann fired back in agreement with the show.

""They are Russian Assets, and there is a war,"" Olbermann wrote in reference to Carlson and Gabbard. ""There's a case for detaining them militarily. Trials are a sign of good faith and patience on the part of democracy.""

Others on the left have attacked Carlson for opposing U.S. intervention in Ukraine, Mediaite said, adding that he's floated the idea that American citizens have no direct issue with Putin.

Meanwhile U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Sunday accused Gabbard of ""treasonous lies,"" after which Gabbard said Romney should resign if he can't offer evidence to back up his accusations.

Both Carlson and Gabbard have denied being mouthpieces for Putin.

Not that it matters to Alexandra Chalupa — a longtime Democratic operative and daughter of Ukrainian immigrants who investigated former President Donald Trump's alleged ties to Russia prior to the 2016 election and worked with reporters in that vein. And despite it all turning out to be a hoax, Chalupa appears to be singing that same old song — but this time about Carlson:

But folks appear to be on to Chalupa. ""Alexandra, as an attorney, I’m sure you know the importance of providing evidence to back up your claims,"" one commenter told her. ""Would you like to share with the rest of the class, or nah?""

""We're not at war. Why are you issuing psychotic proclamations? Any dissent to the Biden regime qualifies as being a war criminal?"" another user told Chalupa. ""You ppl have been hyperbolic for years, but this is over the top. Too far. BTW, what was your role in DNC/Ukraine 2016 election meddling?""

How did folks react to Olbermann?

As you might guess, a number of Twitter users weren't down with Olbermann saying Carlson and Gabbard are ""Russian assets"":

""Yes, nothing says 'democracy' like detaining those with opposing political beliefs,"" one commenter wrote back to Olbermann.

""Sounds like your gut instinct is to encourage a mob lynching of anyone who disagrees with your warmongering,"" another user told Olbermann. ""But you're willing to show 'good faith and patience' by putting American dissidents on trial for wrongthink? Do you understand you're revealing the soul of a fascist?""

""Good little fascist, aren't you? Or is it communist?"" another commenter asked. ""I get you totalitarians mixed up some times. We are not at war. I recommend reviewing your tapes [of] the Bush years, and then checking yourself into the prison you so heartily recommend for others.""

""You are right on par with the ladies on the view, and NO ONE is surprised by that,"" another user said to Olbermann.

"Kellyanne Conway: If Adam Schiff testifies at impeachment hearing, I'll show up to represent Trump","After White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined an invitation by chair Jerry Nadler to participate in Wednesday's House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway presented a (probably sarcastic) alternative.

""Is Adam Schiff going to testify? Because he is a fact witness. That would be great. I'll tell you what: If Adam Schiff testifies, I'll show up on behalf of the White House,"" Conway said Monday.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, oversaw the first phase of the impeachment effort, which concluded with public hearings last month. He has carefully controlled the process, wielding the Democrats' majority status to set the terms of hearings and control who does and does not testify.

This is, of course, within his and the House Democrats' power because they have the votes, but the president and Republicans have protested the process from the beginning as unfair. Conway called the impeachment process ""unconstitutional"" and ""illegitimate.""

Whether Conway was serious about her offer to represent the White House on Wednesday is probably irrelevant—Schiff does not want to testify and will not be made to testify by Democrats. Republicans strongly desire to have a chance to question him under oath about the anonymous whistleqblower and the origins of the complaint that started everything.

Wednesday's hearing, however, doesn't appear to be concerned with uncovering facts or evidence. Based on what the Judiciary Committee has revealed, it will consist of testimony and legal analysis from constitutional law experts about whether Trump's alleged actions are impeachable.

The questions being considered are whether Trump abused the power of the presidency by attempting to pressure Ukraine, through the withholding of military aid, to publicly investigate a political opponent (Joe Biden and his son, Hunter). And, if he is determined to have done so, whether that would qualify as an impeachable act.

The Judiciary Committee will receive a full report from the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, and will then be tasked with drafting articles of impeachment to be voted on by the full House, if Democrats choose to proceed. They do not need any Republican support to impeach, although former Republican and current independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) has been supportive of the effort.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kellyanne-conway-if-adam-schiff-testifies-at-impeachment-hearing-ill-show-up-to-represent-trump,2019-12-02
Kellyanne Conway thanks Rep. Adam Schiff for boost to President Trump,"White House counselor and former pollster Kellyanne Conway likes what she sees in recent numbers coming out in favor of her boss, President Donald Trump — and extended some gratitude to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for making it all possible.

What are the details?

In the midst of House Democrats' ongoing impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Conway tweeted Thursday, ""Thank you @RepAdamSchiff! NEW #POLL: Support for impeachment has flipped; 45% now oppose.""

""Independents show biggest swing, opposing impeachment 49% to 34%,"" she continued, adding, ""President Trump's approval has increased 5 points in past month: 48% approve; 47% disapprove.""



Conway linked to the most recent results from Emerson Polling, which shows approval for President Trump jumped from 43 percent approval in October to 48 percent in November. The analysts report that ""support for impeachment has flipped since October from 48% support with 44% opposing to now 45% opposed and 43% in support.""

Notably, the college points out, ""The biggest swing is among independents, who oppose impeachment now 49% to 34%, which is a reversal from October where they supported impeachment 48% to 39%.""

Conway, ever the pollster, went on to note in her thread (with further citations) that ""In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan: 7 in 10 'Obama-Trump voters' approve of the president's job performance.""

Further bolstering her case for gratitude toward Schiff — who has spearheaded the highly controversial impeachment probe — Conway pointed to a Politico-Morning Consult Poll released Tuesday that showed ""opposition by independents to the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry jumped 10 percentage points in the last week,"" The Hill reported.

Anything else?

TheBlaze's Giancarlo Sopo also presented an array of recent polls Thursday, spelling out the case that despite ""testimony from a roster of 'star witnesses' and overwhelming negative media coverage of the administration, Americans are less convinced now that President Trump should be impeached than they were before they launched their probe into his dealings with Ukraine during depositions in mid-October.""

This all looks positive for President Trump for now, but Sopo warns, ""Things will likely get worse before they get better.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kellyanne-conway-thanks-rep-adam-schiff-for-boost-to-president-trump,2019-11-22
NBC reporter bravely asks two critical questions about the Biden classified docs: 'They did not tell the public until this leaked',"The mainstream media and Democrats have absolved President Joe Biden of wrongdoing after classified documents, some of which were marked ""top secret,"" were discovered in his post-vice presidential office.

But NBC News correspondent Ken Dilanian spotlighted on Tuesday two critical questions that should be asked about the circumstances surrounding the discovery.

""There are some significant concerns here,"" Dilanian said on MSNBC. ""A) how did these classified documents get to a place they shouldn’t have been and B) why did the White House sit on this for so long?""

""They knew six days before the November midterm. Joe Biden knew, his aides knew, yet they did not tell the public until this leaked to the news media,"" he added.

Sen. Warner calls for briefing on classified documents found in Biden office www.youtube.com

Those questions are especially important because the White House claims that Biden did not know the classified documents were being stored at his private office. Therefore, if Biden was unaware that they were there, who, having access to highly classified information, could have stored the documents in the office without Biden's knowledge?

Not only is the timing of the news suspicious and suggests the government is not being as transparent as the media claims, but we do not yet know whether Biden retained more classified documents in his office and whether investigators even searched for more.

Attorney General Merrick Garland has assigned U.S. Attorney John Lausch Jr., a Trump appointee, to investigate the discovery.

As Dilanian noted, Garland likely tasked Lausch with the investigation ""to create an appearance of independence.""

What is Biden saying?

Biden personally addressed the discovery of the classified documents on Tuesday while in Mexico.

The president claimed he was ""surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office,"" and he said he does not know what information the documents contain.

Sources told CNN the documents contain ""intelligence memos and briefing materials"" related to Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom. Some of the documents were reportedly marked ""top secret"" with the ""sensitive compartmented information"" designation, which is typically reserved for highly classified intelligence.

Kentucky teachers' retirement system lost millions in Russian bank stock — and narrowly avoided losing way more,"Kentucky teachers' pensions were rumored to be on somewhat shaky ground this week after a report circulated online alleging the state pension system remained a major shareholder in a tanking Russian bank stock.

What allegedly happened?

Russia's largest lender, Sberbank of Russia, cratered 95% on the London stock exchange Monday upon announcing it would be pulling out of the European market. News of the stock free fall turned up an interesting note: as of Dec. 30, 2021, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System was listed as the bank's second-largest U.S. institutional shareholder.

In a tweet posted Thursday night, the Twitter account ""Market Sentiment"" claimed that as a result of Sberbank's collapse, the teachers' pension system suffered a concurrent 95% loss in its position, amounting to more than $12 million.

Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie picked up on the tweet and remarked, ""It's obviously part of a much larger portfolio, but still unfortunate and notable."" Later he added, ""Buy the ticket, take the ride.""

The pension system sets the record straight

But on Friday, one of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System's lawyers shut down the rumors, claiming them to be ""completely false.""

Beau Barnes, TRS' general counsel, said in a statement that TRS sold off its direct investments on Feb. 23, one day before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.

The sell-off resulted in the pension system losing $3.2 million of its initial $15.6 million investment, Barnes acknowledged.

""TRS’s holding was in an over-the-counter, American-exchange portion of Sberbank known as an American depositary receipt. This is a small piece of the overall Sberbank capital structure,"" Barnes clarified against the implication that TRS's holdings accounted for a sizable ownership of the massive Russian bank.

The lawyer went on to further calm any hysteria by noting that TRS' previous holdings in Sberbank and its ""remaining exposure to holdings in Russia is proportionately negligible in a portfolio of about $26 billion.""

According to the Lousiville Courier-Journal, he previously disclosed that approximately $30 million — or about 0.12% — of the pension system's $26 billion investment portfolio was in Russian investments.

Anything else?

Several other states have recently begun withdrawing Russian assets amid the country's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, especially as sanctions levied by the U.S. and its Western allies begin to take effect, crippling the Russian economy.

""I strongly encourage divestment from all Russian holdings,"" said Kentucky Treasurer Allison Ball in a statement, according to WSIL-TV. ""Outside fund managers who maintain indirect holdings of pension funds should proceed with divestment from Russia. Any individual holdings of pension funds should also be divested through best efforts as soon as possible.""

""The world has been inspired by Ukraine’s heroic fight for freedom, and Kentucky is committed to doing its part to support U.S. sanctions against Russia to stand alongside the sovereign nation of Ukraine,"" Ball added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kentucky-teachers-retirement-system-russian-bank-stock,2022-03-04
CNBC host grills Rep. Jeffries on inflation: 'You don’t take any responsibility? It's just all a Putin price hike?',"CNBC host Joe Kernen grilled a congressman over the Democrats' excuses for increasing inflation and high gas prices.

Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York appeared on Kernen's show on Tuesday just ahead of a new report that showed inflation worsening instead of improving. Jeffries tried to offer talking points as an excuse for inflation, but Kernen bulldozed through them and pressured him to take responsibility.

“In this country, we’re still down front from peak production. You don’t you think there’s anything that you can do in Congress or to convince a Biden administration, you don’t think there’s any regulations that need to be eased? You don’t think there’s any offshore activity?” asked Kernen.



“You don’t take any responsibility? It’s just all a ‘Putin price hike’?” he added.

“Yeah, part of the challenge domestically in terms of production is that the oil and gas companies have refused to actually act on the permits to drill that they currently ...” Jeffries began to respond.

Kernen blasted the talking point as a ""red herring"" and explained why he thought the excuse was unreasonable.

“So there’s leases. There’s, you know, there’s also just the overall pressure from ESG and the green lobby about whether an oil company is going to make plans five or 10 years down the road when, you know, a large part of the population wants to put them out of business completely,” Kernen said.

Jeffries went on to blame corporations for their high profit margins which didn't persuade Kernen much.

On Wednesday, the Labor Department issued its latest consumer price index report that found inflation in June rising to 9.1% on an annual basis. The stock market dropped farther as a result of the report that many took as a sign that the economy was sinking into a recession.

Many economists say that the high spending policies of the Democrats worsened inflation despite other causes like the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. A recent poll found that many Americans were unconvinced by the excuses the Biden administration was making for high inflation.

Rep. Kinzinger condemns 'sick' Democrat blaming Trump for Iran shooting down passenger plane,"Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) strongly condemned Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) for suggesting that President Donald Trump was responsible for Iran reportedly shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane with a missile on Tuesday.

""This is.... sick. Once again Iran is the victim,"" Kinzinger tweeted.

He was reacting to a comment from Speier to Wolf Blitzer on CNN.



""This is yet another example of collateral damage from the actions that have been taken in a provocative way by the president of the United States,"" Speier said.

Kinzinger later appeared himself on CNN to explain his condemnation of her comments.

""Blaming the President for the Iranian airliner shoot down, we are broken as a country if this is the level of our debate moving forward,"" he said. ""And we have to move on from it, and be adults again.""

Kinzinger went on to condemn the overheated rhetoric on both sides, including claims from some Republicans that Democrats were commiserating with terrorists when they criticized the timing of the US airstrike on Soleimani.

All 176 passengers traveling in the Ukrainian plane perished when it went down after it took off from Tehran in Iran.

Early reports from Iran attempted to blame the crash on instrument error, but U.S. officials on Thursday said that there was growing evidence that the plane was hit by a Russian-manufactured anti-aircraft missile fired by Iran.

Kremlin spokesperson says 'this can be stopped in a moment' if Ukraine meets several conditions,"Russia has told Ukraine that it is prepared to end military activity if Ukraine satisfies several conditions, a Kremlin spokesperson said, according to Reuters.

""And they were told that all this can be stopped in a moment,"" Dmitry Peskov said, according to the outlet.



""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc.""

""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment,"" Peskov said.

The outlet reported that Peskov said it is ""not true"" that Russia is calling for Ukraine to surrender Kyiv.



Ukrainians have been bravely defending their country in the face of a brutal Russian onslaught that has wreaked death and destruction, killing many, including civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has valiantly rallied Ukrainians to resist the Russian invasion, recently released a video in which he declared that he is still in Kyiv.

""I stay in Kyiv. On Bankova Street. I'm not hiding. And I'm not afraid of anyone. As long as it's necessary to win in our patriotic war,"" he said, according to Sky News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kremlin-spokesperson-says-if-ukraine-meets-several-conditions-this-can-be-stopped-in-a-moment,2022-03-08
"Popular Los Angeles lifestyle boutique goes viral for mercilessly mocking Democrats, leftist celebrities over hypocrisy and more","Los Angeles' premier ""lifestyle boutique,"" Kitson, is going viral for blasting Democratic lawmakers and leftist celebrities with a massive display across their storefront.

What are the details?

One of the L.A.-based stores hung a variety of posters in their front windows depicting their ""People of the Year,"" which includes Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Hunter Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci, actress and activist Alyssa Milano, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and more.

Each person has their own picture plastered across the storefront with remarks on their conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mayor Eric Garcetti

Labor secretary asked for solutions to inflation crisis. But he can't name single one — and offers only excuses.,"Labor Secretary Marty Walsh was asked Friday what short-term measures the Biden administration can take to reduce inflation and stop the growing economic crisis dead in its tracks.

But Walsh offered only excuses — and no solutions.

What is the background?

The latest report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the consumer price index rose to an annual rate of 7.5% in January, the highest rate in 40 years. Unfortunately, economists believe inflation will continue to grip Americans, especially as prices of good continue to grow while wage growth remains stagnant.

What did Walsh say?

During an appearance on ""Bloomberg the Open,"" host Jonathan Ferro questioned Walsh over short-term solutions to the inflation crisis. But Walsh was unable to name a single measure the Biden administration is taking to provide relief for Americans.

Instead, Walsh only pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain, and the Russia-Ukraine war as inflation-driving problems.

""Well, I think if you’re talking about inflation, I think what’s happening here is— I mean, we’re in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, certainly, that’s one. We’re in the midst of dealing with supply chain issues. Now we have a major conflict in the world — that all eyes of the world are on the Ukrainian people and Ukraine,"" Walsh said.

""And I think that as we move forward here — and the question earlier — as oil supply gets cut back from Russia, if that’s what ultimately happens, we’re going to see an increase in gas prices. And I think that there’s a point here that we have to just continue to move forward,"" he continued.

In fact, Walsh was extremely vague, saying ""lots of conversations"" and ""lots of actions"" will be had and taken in the coming weeks and months to address inflation, but he did not offer any specific details.

""The president has been very clear on bringing down inflation, he talked about it at the State of the Union. But we’re living in very interesting dynamic and times are happening here,"" Walsh said. ""So, again, there’s lots of conversations and lots of actions that we’ll be taking over the next weeks and months.""

The relevant portion of the interview begins at 30:57:

During his State of the Union address, Biden pushed his social agenda plan — the ""Build Back Better"" plan, which has since been rebranded as ""Building a Better America"" — as the solution to inflation and other economic woes.



Although any form of Biden's social spending plan is unlikely to ever pass Congress, economists believe the plan would contribute to inflation — not relieve economic problems.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/labor-secretary-cannot-name-single-inflation-solution,2022-03-04
"Latvia was investigating 'suspicious' payments to Hunter Biden, Burisma in potential laundering scheme: report","Investigative journalist John Solomon reported Tuesday that the Latvian government had flagged and requested Ukrainian assistance to investigate allegedly ""suspicious"" payments to Hunter Biden and several Burisma associates in weeks before Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired at the request of then-Vice President Joe Biden and other international stakeholders.

According to a Latvian law enforcement memo, which Solomon said has been confirmed by the Ukrainian general prosecutor's office and the Latvian Embassy in the United States, loan payments totaling $16.6 million were sent to Burisma from Belize and the United Kingdom by way of Ukraine's PrivatBank.

According to the memo, some of those funds were transferred to Biden and three other Burisma officials.

Latvia's Financial Intelligence Unit notified Ukrainian officials of these suspicious payments in February 2016. Solomon reported that Latvia did not receive any evidence back to continue pursuing the issue.

It is the timing, as much as or more than the validity of the suspicions, that is significant, Solomon reported. Shokin was fired in March 2016. Joe Biden has bragged about the role he played in getting Shokin removed.

Those who say the firing had nothing to do with protecting Hunter Biden and Burisma point out that Shokin's Burisma investigation was not active at the time of his termination.

Solomon said Shokin told him differently, however, and that he had specific plans to interview Hunter Biden before he was fired.

Also in February 2016, the prosecutor general's office reportedly seized some assets of Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under court order. After Shokin's firing, Solomon reported, investigations into Burisma began to cool down:

Almost immediately, Burisma's American legal team was in Ukraine seeking to meet with Shokin's replacement at the Ukraine prosecutor general's office.



A summary of an April 6, 2016 meeting between Burisma representatives and Ukraine prosecutors – released by the Prosecutor General's Office – states ""false information"" was used to justify Shokin's firing.



Whatever the case, the corruption investigations were dropped in late 2016 and early 2017, and Burisma paid a penalty for tax issues.

"Leading House Democrat reveals their next GOP target, cite info that will be challenged by lawsuit","House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) revealed on Saturday the next target of House Democrats: Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee.

When asked Saturday on MSNBC's ""AM Joy"" whether Nunes would face an ethics investigation, Smith said, ""Quite likely, without question.""

""I understand a lot of this is about Joe Biden but the bigger thing is about what President Trump and the Russians and all these people have been doing ... is a systematic problem that is a threat to the country because of what Russia is doing to democracy,"" Smith went on to say, Politico reported.

Central to the push to investigate Nunes are allegations that he secretly met with former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin in Vienna last December to gather dirt damaging to Joe Biden.

CNN reported the allegations Friday after the lawyer for Lev Parnas — a Rudy Giuliani associate who was indicted on unrelated federal charges last month — told the news outlet his client wants to tell House impeachment investigators what he knows.



Nunes responded to the report Friday, telling Breitbart News he plans swift legal action against CNN and the Daily Beast, which published a similar story earlier in the week, for ""demonstrably false and scandalous stories"" that he called ""the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth.""

Nunes said both news outlets ""will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving.""

AP reporter berates State Dept. spox on claim that Russians planned false flag operation in order to invade Ukraine,"Associated Press reporter Mike Lee berated State Department spokesperson Ned Price over a report that the Russians were planning a false flag operation in order to justify an invasion of Ukraine.

The report claimed that the Russians were planning to fake a mass attack on Russian-speaking people in Ukraine in order to give them a pretext to invade and retake the country.

""One possible option the Russians are considering, and which we made public today, involves the production of a propaganda video, a video with graphic scenes of false explosions, depicting corpses, crisis actors pretending to be mourners, and images of destroyed locations or military equipment, entirely fabricated by Russian intelligence,"" said Price at the media briefing Thursday.

""To be clear, the production of this video is one of a number of options that the Russian government is developing as a fake pretext to initiate and potentially justify military action against Ukraine,"" he added.

Lee and other reporters pressed Price to produce evidence of the claims against Russia beyond the word of the State Department.

""It is an action that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that,"" said Lee. ""What is the evidence that they've planned, I mean, this is like, crisis actors? Really? This is like Alex Jones territory that you're getting into now. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?""

""Matt this is derived from information known to the U.S. government, intelligence information that we have declassified,"" responded Price.

""Well OK? Where is it? Where is this information?"" interjected Lee.

""It is intelligence information that we have declassified,"" Price said.

""Well where is it, where is the declassified information?"" Lee asked.

""I just delivered it,"" Price laughed.

""No, you made a series of allegations and statements,"" replied Lee. ""That's not evidence, that's you saying it, that's not evidence, I'm sorry.""

The situation devolved into a yelling match about whether Price's statements should be constituted as evidence of the accusations made against Russia. Price later fired back that Lee was more willing to trust Russia than the U.S. and its allies.

""If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" said Price.

Other reporters then pressed Price in the same way Lee did.

""The facts that we are able to go into such great detail, obviously I am not going to spell out what is in our possession, but I will leave, I will leave it to your judgement,"" said Price to another reporter.

""There are no facts that you've spelled out!"" interjected Lee.

""We are making clear what we know so that in the event it does take place, it will be clear to the world what this actually was and what it was not,"" explained Price later on.

Price tweeted about the heated exchange and praised Lee despite their disagreement.

""Clearly, he’s no one’s dupe, and I’d never want to suggest otherwise. Nothing but respect for him, which I underscored in a call to him after the briefing,"" tweeted Price.

Russia has amassed more than a hundred thousand troops outside of the border of Ukraine, sparking fears of a military invasion with the intent reconquer the country that was once part of the former Soviet empire.

President Joe Biden has more than once intimated that he believes an invasion is imminent. The statements have elicited bitter recriminations from Ukraine officials who have warned him against spreading rumor and panic.

Lee Zeldin calls reporters 'shills' for Adam Schiff after fiery exchange with NBC reporter,"Republican lawmakers had such a contentious briefing with reporters about the impeachment trial that one representative called the media ""shills"" for Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead impeachment manager.

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) was being aggressively questioned by Heidi Przybyla of NBC News when he made the comments.

""Congressman, so DOD certified this money in May, they said Ukraine met all anti-corruption standards, so what specifically happened that made the president all of a sudden concerned about corruption? What specific corruption was he chasing?"" asked Przybyla.

Zeldin gave a lengthy response about the corruption in Ukraine prior to the decision that Trump made to hold the military aid in question. Przybyla interrupted to ask him to focus in on why the president became so concerned with corruption at a specific time.

""You have to let me answer your questions,"" Zeldin said after Przybyla interrupted. ""If I give a good answer, that doesn't mean that you have to cut me off. OK? I know that if I give a bad answer you'd probably let me go all day.""

""I know it's a hard question,"" Przybyla said. ""The president is not on the record mentioning anything other than Biden and CrowdStrike, that's it, and you haven't mentioned anything else.""



When other reporters jumped in to challenge Zeldin along the same lines, he accused them of being biased.

""You're doing a great job as Schiff's shills,"" Zeldin said. ""This is the problem, the problem is that you're actually insulting your audience.""

Zeldin and Przybyla continued their feud on Twitter after the interaction.

Zeldin accused NBC News of cutting out his answer, while Przybyla responded that he didn't answer her question.

The Senate impeachment trial is not expected to result in a vote that would remove the president from office.

Leftist pundit Cenk Uygur says 'right wing' loves Vladimir Putin 'because he's a WHITE authoritarian leader' — and gets torn to shreds for it,"Left-wing pundit Cenk Uygur — founder of radical show the Young Turks and known for descending to further extremes when things don't go his way politically — tweeted Thursday that the ""right wing"" loves Russian President Vladimir Putin ""because he's a WHITE authoritarian leader.""

Here's his full tweet:

""Right-wing doesn't love Putin just because he is an authoritarian, tyrannical leader, they love him because he's a WHITE authoritarian leader,"" Uygur wrote. ""Race has become more important than even nationality. They've turned on democracy and now even America, in favor of a white warlord.""

Putin has launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine, and Russia's Defense Ministry claimed early Thursday that its military already destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities — including 11 airbases — only hours into its operation.

How are folks reacting?

If Uygur was starving for some attention — even of the negative variety, which he almost certainly must be used to by now — he sure got the job done: Uygur's inflammatory tweet was getting ratioed early Thursday afternoon, with nearly 10,000 comments and counting compared to about 4,300 likes.

And noted commenters responding to Uygur's claim that the color of Putin's skin is any kind of factor at the moment put him in his place with gusto:

Podcaster Graham Allen replied, ""You are the dumbest human in history…..literally the most insane thing I’ve read in a very long time.""

Conservative commentator and author John Ziegler said, ""Nailed it… that’s why we white conservatives here in California love our King Newsom so much!!""

Comedian Yannis Pappas quipped back at Uygur, ""As a Greek, your ethnicity and the name of your show is triggering for me. Please change it.""

Letter emerges from top Australian official refuting New York Times' latest Trump scoop,"The New York Times reported Monday that President Donald Trump recently ""pushed"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to help Attorney General William Barr gather information for an ongoing Justice Department investigation in hopes to ""discredit"" Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

The newspaper characterized Trump's alleged request as ""using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests"" — the same allegation Democrats and the media have made about Trump's controversial July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But a letter surfaced later Monday discrediting the Times' reporting.

Image via Twitter @KerrieYaxley

The letter — first reported by Australian reporter Kerrie Yaxley — shows Australia proactively reached out to Barr via Scot Hockey, Australia's ambassador to the U.S., in May to offer assistance in the Justice Department's investigation into the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation.



The letter states:

I refer to President Trump's announcement on 24 May that you will investigate the origins of the Federal Bureau of Investigations probe into Russian links to the 2016 US election.



I note that the President referred to Australia, the United Kingdom and the Ukraine as potential stakeholders. Moreover, I note that he has declassified intelligence material to support your investigation.



The Australian Government will use its best endeavors to support your efforts in this matter. While Australia's former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, The Hon. Alexander Downer, is no longer employed by the government, we stand ready to provide you with all the relevant information to support your inquiries.



The Acting White House Chief of Staff, The Honorable Michael Mulvaney, has been copied on this letter.

According to Fox News, Hockey wrote the letter after Trump told reporters he would direct Barr to seek assistance from other countries in the investigation, which is being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

A top Australian diplomat further corroborated Monday that it was Australia that initiated contact with Barr regarding the investigation.

Liberal CNN guest is mad that President Trump tweeted about his anti-Trump-voter CNN hit,"Leftist author and pundit Wajahat Ali complained Tuesday that President Donald Trump shared and criticized Ali's CNN appearance over the weekend in which he, host Don Lemon, and anti-Trump GOP strategist Rick Wilson mocked Trump voters' intelligence.

Some background please?

During a Saturday night exchange, Lemon and the two pundits branded the Trump supporters nothing more than a bunch of uneducated hicks.

Both Ali and Wilson ended up doing what they clearly thought were comical impressions of ""dumb"" Trump voters following a discussion about reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""screamed and cursed"" at an NPR reporter and demanded she point out Ukraine on a map.

Wilson guffawed, ""Look, [Pompeo] also knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter 'U' and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it. He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world, and so that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience, you now, the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump, that wants to think that 'Donald Trump's the smart one, and y'all — y'all elitists are dumb.'""

Ali mockingly added, ""You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling ... your reading ... knowing other countries ... sipping your latte.""

The mocking went on for several more moments, which resulted in a joyful Lemon.

Naturally, the pair faced significant social media backlash over the exchange, which you can read more about here.

Trump also shared the clip, writing, ""Don Lemon, the dumbest man on television (with terrible ratings!).""

What's happening now?

On Tuesday, Ali responded to Trump's sharing of the clip, writing, ""Thank you for sharing our clip. Can you please release your school transcripts that will show you're a very stable genius? Also, can you release your taxes and the full transcript of your 'beautiful' phone call with Zelensky? Also, can you locate Bangladesh on a map? #BeBest.""

Ali later complained that ""no one ever cares"" when Trump mocks minorities.

""How come no one ever cares about the Women, Immigrants, Black people, Journalists, Democrats, Never Trumper Republicans, Mexicans, Muslims that Trump always mocks and ridicules and threatens with malicious cruelty?"" he wrote. ""Maybe he'll lose because of the rest of us.""

Ali also said ""friends"" now fear for his safety because the president tweeted the clip, which was basically seen by everyone in America anyway.



""Trump tweeted our CNN clip from 2 days ago,"" he complained. ""Friends are now concerned about my safety. I refuse to be intimidated & bullied by bad faith actors who cry fake victimhood, whining about a harmless, silly 30 second clip while endorsing Trump, a cruel vulgarian who debases everyone.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-cnn-guest-is-mad-that-president-trump-tweeted-about-his-anti-trump-voter-cnn-hit,2020-01-28
Biden adviser says Americans need liberal world order,"President Joe Biden's director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, said Americans paying high gas prices is needed for the ""future of the liberal world order."" Reactions to the statement erupted on Twitter.

The Biden administration has repeatedly blamed high gas prices on Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday, President Biden said Americans should expect to pay high fuel prices for ""as long as it takes, so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine.""

CNN anchor Victor Blackwell interviewed Deese on Thursday and cited that Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Wednesday the war between Russia and Ukraine could be a ""grinding struggle"" for years.

Blackwell said, ""I think everybody understands why this is happening, but is it sustainable? What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay $4.85 a gallon for months, if not years? This is not sustainable.""



Deese – who was formerly the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock – replied, ""What we heard from the president today was about the stakes. This is about the future of the liberal world order, and we have to stand firm.""

""But at the same time what I'd say to that family, to Americans across the country, is you have a present administration that is going to do everything in its power to blunt those price increases and bring those prices down,"" Deese added.



Biden's director of the National Economic Council added, ""Good news, over the past two weeks, we've seen the price at the pump come down 20 cents, but it is still unacceptably high. That's why the president earlier this week was working to bring the G7 allies together around, exploring something around a price cap. To cap the price that can be paid for Russian oil. Which will actually target the pain more directly on Vladimir Putin and not on the rest of the world.""

In reactions on Twitter, conservatives blasted the Biden administration for prioritizing the ""liberal world order"" ahead of Americans.

TheBlaze contributor Carol Roth: ""A liberal world order is a place where feelings replace facts and hopes replace realities. It may sound nice in theory, but it is actually an epic disaster.""

Conservative commentator Tom Bevan: ""Another great election slogan for the Dems & Biden: 'Hey, America, suck it up for the Liberal World Order.'""

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.): ""The White House openly stated that you’re just going to have to pay more in gas so that they can hold the 'liberal world order' together and it barely registers as breaking news. They’re telling you EVERYTHING they plan to do and most don’t even care. WAKE UP!""



Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.): ""Inflation is causing money to be tight for many people, especially senior citizens barely able to buy food. Sustained high gas prices are causing people to drives less because they can’t afford it. We will not be paying for Biden’s liberal world order. People are angry.""

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas): ""$5 gas? No problem - do it for the 'the liberal world order…'""

Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance: ""Ohio families shouldn’t be expected to pay a dime for the 'liberal world order.'""

Republican congressional candidate for Washington's 3rd District Joe Kent: ""The ruling class’s obsession w/ the liberal world order got us to this point - putting our sovereignty & prosperity after the security of every other nation. Time to cast off the failed old ways.""

Republican congressional candidate for Ohio's 9th District J.R. Majewski: ""When White House advisors go on TV & say that we’re just going to have to keep paying high gas prices to keep the 'liberal world order' intact, that’s when every American needs to wake up and start paying attention. This is not your standard Democrat. This is a globalist coup.""

Republican congressional candidate for New York's 14th District Desi Cuellar: ""Anyone else notice how they don’t care about saying stuff like 'liberal world order' right out on television for everyone to hear anymore? They truly act like they don’t need our approval or out vote. Scary stuff.""

Conservative commentator Steve Cortes: ""The 'liberal world order.' He’s trolling us, right?! How about 'American nationalism' instead?""



Former Trump administration adviser Stephen Miller: ""Biden’s 'Liberal World Order' is a war on the working and middle class: — Domestic drilling bans to explode energy costs — Run printing presses to inflate dollar — Open borders to drain erode family income, resources, stability — Open jails to let loose predators upon the community — Destroy nuclear family, discourage childbirth, promote abortion as 'family planning' — Replace religion with regime ideology — Put gov’t between parents & children — Use schools & corps to instill woke propaganda, sow gender confusion, teach hatred of self/family/faith/nation — Erase distinctions of biological sex & force doctors to elevate ideology over science — Police speech, punish dissent, jail dissenters — Racial discrimination & stereotyping to divide/demean populace —Transfer wealth from workers to Wall Street via outsourcing — Globalist wars.""

In 2017, President Biden also used the term ""liberal world order"" while attacking former President Donald Trump.

“Violating the norms of personal conduct generates more anxiety and fear than any policy prescription that this president has enunciated,” Biden said during an event held at the University of Delaware. “This breaking down of international and national norms is the glue that holds the liberal world order together, and holds together our system. That is what is being attacked and that’s what’s most dangerous.”

In March 2022, Biden raised eyebrows when he used the terms ""liberal world order"" and ""new world order"" while speaking to corporate leaders.

""We’re at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy, not just the world economy, the world, that occurs every three or four generations,"" the president declared. ""[A general told me] that 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946, and since then we’ve established a liberal world order, and it hasn’t happened in a long while.”



""And now is a time when things are shifting,"" Biden added. ""We're going to — there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it. And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-world-order-biden-adminstration,2022-07-01
Liberals furiously lash out at the New York Times over article documenting Biden's verbal 'fumbles',"Many on the left excoriated the New York Times on Tuesday over an article documenting two ""verbal fumbles"" that President Joe Biden made the same day.

The article reported how Biden confused the Russian war in Ukraine with the U.S. war in Iraq and then immediately tried to explain it away by falsely claiming his son died in the Iraq War.

“Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq and the impact on oil and what Russia is doing,” said Biden at a campaign stop in Miami Gardens, Florida.

""Excuse me, the war in Ukraine,"" he corrected. “I think of Iraq because that’s where my son died.”

His son, Beau Biden, served in Iraq but returned to the U.S. in 2009 and died of cancer in 2015.

The article was tweeted out by NYT journalist Maggie Haberman, who posted it while shutting off direct comments to the tweet. Many on the left responded angrily while falsely assuming that she wrote the piece.

""The cowardly Trumphuffer turned off her comments,"" read one response.

""How many times did Trump verbally fumble and/or spew word salad that she never once felt compelled to write an entire article on? Maggie Haberman is a thoroughly dishonest, untrustworthy, completely biased propagandist. She is not a journalist, and she has zero credibility,"" replied another critic.

""As a Speech Language Pathologist who works with kids who stutter, I'd just like to take this moment to tell @maggieNYT to F*** Right Off,"" read another tweet.

""Meanwhile you are Trump's 'psychiatrist' per him. Go p*** up a rope,"" said a critic who identified herself as a feminist.

""Completely chickens**t cowardly move by MaggieButHerEmails Haberman to not allow comments on her little hate piece. I expect nothing less,"" read another response.

""Magpie limited who could respond to this swill scooped up from her toilet,"" another tweet said.

Others predicted it was just the beginning for Biden's health troubles.

""This is only the beginning. After the bloodbath that is coming, the Times is going to do a full story with White House sources on Biden’s decline,"" said commentator Erick Erickson.

Peter Baker, the author of the article, did not tweet out the story.

Majority of likely voters think Biden should prioritize boosting domestic energy production,"According to a recent Trafalgar Group poll, a whopping 77.3% of likely general election voters think that in the wake of the Russian incursion into Ukraine, President Joe Biden should make boosting U.S. energy production a priority. Just 9.3% did not think so, while 13.5% were unsure.

While 88.6% of Republicans thought the president should prioritize boosting the nation's energy production, just 67% of Democrats felt that way, according to the poll.

The poll was carried out March 7 to March 11 amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Americans, who have already been facing high gas prices, have recently been hit by even higher prices — according to AAA, the national average for a gallon of regular gas as of Wednesday is $4.305.

Last week, Biden issued an executive order to ban the importation of crude oil and other products into the U.S. from Russia.

High gas prices not only impact drivers, they also raise the cost of transporting goods at a time when Americans have already been getting hammered by rising prices — according to consumer price index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the all items index increased by 7.9% over a one-year period.

Some have been critical of the Biden administration's green energy push, including the move last year to revoke a permit related to the Keystone XL Pipeline project.

Lindsey Graham and Elon Musk feud over Ukraine and electric car subsidies,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk engaged in a Twitter feud over the war in Ukraine and electric car subsidies.

Graham lashed out at Musk over his suggestion to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine, currently in its seventh month, in a tweet posted on Tuesday.

Musk suggested that the region of Crimea be given to Russia while other annexed regions undergo another election under the supervision of the United Nations. He put it to a non-scientific vote on Twitter, where it lost 59.1% to 40.9% with more than 2.7 million votes.

""This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,"" he said in a second tweet. ""Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war.""

Many criticized Musk's suggestion as far too deferential to Russia, with Graham repudiating it forcefully.

""My concern with his Russian 'peace' proposal is he is legitimizing one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century by Putin,"" tweeted Graham after first praising Musk.

""Russia must adhere to the boundaries they agreed to in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum where Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons force — the third largest in the world — in return for assurances their territorial integrity would be protected,"" he continued.

""To do otherwise is an insult to Ukraine and will set in motion even more chaos throughout the world,"" he concluded.

In a second Twitter thread about Ukraine and Musk, Graham added a threat to review electric car subsidies that benefited Tesla.

""While we’re at it, maybe the Congress should revisit the electric vehicle tax credit boondoggle. It is where the credit is now solely benefiting electric vehicle manufacturers who have increased prices equal to the tax credit!"" he tweeted. ""It could be a good way to help save money by applying those funds to assisting Ukrainians in defending their homeland!""

That apparently caught Musk's attention because he responded to the threat.

""First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years & we didn’t ask for this one – GM & Ford did,"" he replied.

Ukrainian president Zelenskyy replied to Musk with his own Twitter poll implying that the plan was abandoning the cause of Ukraine.

Musk is in a legal battle with Twitter over his bid to purchase the popular social media platform.

Lindsey Graham invites Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate: ‘I’m tired of hearing only one side of the story’,"The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has invited President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to come speak to the panel in order to counter the narrative of the House Democrats' impeachment probe.

In a string of tweets sent out Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) invited the former New York City mayor to give testimony ""to inform the committee of his concerns"" regarding allegations of corruption in Ukraine and the president's efforts to get the country's government to look into them.

""Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin,"" Graham said. ""Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.""

In a later tweet, the chairman said that he was ""tired of only hearing one side of the story. It's now time to give voice to everything Ukraine. Let the chips fall where they may!""



Bloomberg reported that this invitation — which occurred as a rift was growing between Graham and Trump on foreign policy in Syria — came after ""days of pressure from top Trump allies including Donald Trump Jr. for Graham to act"" after the chairman had deferred investigation efforts to the probe being run by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Committee Democrats were eager to respond to the prospect of being able to question Giuliani themselves.

""Good,"" responded 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), ""I have questions.""

""I welcome the opportunity to question Rudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government's assistance to investigate one of the president's political rivals,"" committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said. ""Democratic members have plenty of questions for Mr. Giuliani and this would give us an opportunity to help separate fact from fiction for the American people.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) reacted to the announcement with a simple ""Bring it on.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — though not a member of the Judiciary Committee — said, ""We welcome Mr. Giuliani testifying"" and said that given his role in the Ukraine matter, ""he must testify under oath.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden — whose son's employment at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma is at the center of the Ukraine controversy — doesn't seem too enthused at the prospect of Giuliani's testimony. A campaign spokesman told Bloomberg that ""bringing forward noted conspiracist and liar Rudy Giuliani would further discredit the reputation of the Senate Judiciary Committee under Senator Graham.""

Giuliani is a key figure in the story leading up to President Trump's July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. According to testimony provided by a former top U.S. diplomat, Giuliani was central in the efforts to get Ukraine to look into the Burisma matter. House Democrats subpoenaed the former New York City mayor after Nancy Pelosi announced ""an official impeachment inquiry"" last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lindsey-graham-invites-rudy-giuliani-to-testify-before-the-senate,2019-10-08
"Lindsey Graham officially opens investigation into Joe Biden, his son, and their dealings in Ukraine","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called on the State Department to provide documents related to the claims that Joe Biden abused the office of vice president in his relations with Ukraine during the Obama administration.

Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the request in a letter published on Thursday and tweeted about the probe.

""Today, I sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents related to contacts between: Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko,"" he tweeted.

The accusations center around suspicions that Biden used his position as vice president to withhold support from Ukraine until they fired a prosecutor that was looking into corruption at the energy company Burisma. That company had also hired Hunter Biden, prompting many to wonder if Biden was trying to help his son by abusing his office.

""Why would you wanna fire the guy after he prosecuted the person you said was the dirtiest person in all of Ukraine?"" said Graham to Sean Hannity about the probe.

""I want to know are there any transcripts or readouts of the phone calls between the vice president and the president of the Ukraine in February, after the raid on the gas company president's house,"" he explained.

""After this raid, Hunter Biden kicks in, Hunter Biden's law business partner meets with John Kerry, and Vice President Biden on three occasions makes a phone call to the President of Ukraine, and goes over there in March, and they fire the guy!"" Graham added.

"Lindsey Graham promises Senate will investigate Ukraine whistleblower, the Bidens, FISA abuse","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Sunday that the Senate will investigate the Ukraine whistleblower, the Bidens, and FISA warrant abuse following the conclusion of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

The whistleblower

Speaking with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Graham said the whistleblower should testify before Congress because he wants ""to understand how all this crap started.""

""The Senate Intel Committee under Richard Burr has told us that we will call the whistleblower,"" Graham said. ""Why is it important? ... If the whistleblower is a former employee, associate of Joe Biden, I think that would be important. If the whistleblower was working with people on [Rep. Adam] Schiff's staff that wanted to take Trump down a year-and-a-half ago, I think that would be important. If the Schiff staff people helped write the complaint, that would be important.

""We're going to get to the bottom of all of this to make sure this never happens again,"" Graham vowed.



The Bidens

Graham said, ""I'm going to bring in State Department officials and ask them, why didn't you do something about the obvious conflict of interests Joe Biden had?""

""I can prove beyond any doubt that Joe Biden's effort in the Ukraine to root out corruption was undercut, because he let his son sit on the board of the most corrupt company in the Ukraine, and we're not going to give him a pass on that,"" Graham went on to say.

""Eventually, we will get to Hunter Biden. And I want to know why the Obama administration did nothing about this obvious conflict of interest,"" he continued. ""Joe Biden should have given up the Ukrainian portfolio, or Hunter Biden should be taken off the board, because they ruined America's ability to effectively deal with corruption in the Ukraine by having Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma. That's just a fact.

""We're going to get to the bottom of it,"" Graham vowed.

Graham explained the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would handle the Bidens.

FISA abuse

Graham said, ""When it comes to FISA, I'm going to call [Rod] Rosenstein, Sally Yates, [Andrew] McCabe and [James] Comey to find out how a warrant was issued against Carter Page on four different occasions without an adequate foundation and find out how the Department of Justice and the FBI became so out of balance when it came to Trump.""

Lindsey Graham hits Democrats with an ultimatum over 'quid pro quo' accusation,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) threw down a gauntlet and gave House Democrats a stern ultimatum on closed door testimony he claims will help exonerate the president against their accusations.

""If House D's refuse to release full transcript of Volker testimony as requested by Congressman Jordan, it will be an abuse of power,"" Graham tweeted.

""If this continues, I will call Volker before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify publicly to ensure the full story is told,"" he added in a second tweet.



Graham was referring to testimony from Kurt Volker, the former ambassador to Ukraine, about claims by a whistleblower that the president was improperly demanding political favors in return for military aid.

The accusation is the central claim in the House Democrats' push for a formal impeachment inquiry.

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) told reporters that the testimony blew a ""massive hole"" in the impeachment narrative.

""When you are making the claim that the president was asking for a quid pro quo with President Zelensky, today is blowing a massive hole in the middle of that allegation,"" Zeldin told reporters.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also excoriated Democrats on their accusations.

""Release the transcript so they can see what Ambassador Volker spent nine hours telling us,"" said Jordan.

""Where he said there was no quid pro quo, there was no linkage... between security assistance dollars for Ukraine and any type of investigation into anyone in Ukraine or any investigation into the Bidens,"" he added.

"Lindsey Graham universally blasted after calling for Vladimir Putin's assassination: 'Seriously, wtf?'","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested Thursday that someone in Russia should assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

What did Graham say?

Speaking with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Graham called on someone in Russia to rise up and kill Putin, who Graham claimed is emboldened by President Joe Biden's weakness.

""How does this end? Somebody in Russia has to step up to the plate,"" Graham said.

""Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this sh*t ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,"" Graham continued. ""You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service.""

Graham repeated his remarks on Twitter and explained that killing Putin is paramount for Russia's 144 million citizens because their country will be isolated from the rest of world with Putin at the helm.

""The only people who can fix this are the Russian people. Easy to say, hard to do,"" Graham said. ""Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate.""



The suggestion was immediately condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike, some of whom called on Graham to resign.

""This is an exceptionally bad idea. Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil & gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves. But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said.

""Seriously, wtf? I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid WWlll. As the world pays attention to how the US and it’s leaders are responding, Lindsey’s remarks and remarks made by some House members aren’t helpful,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said.

""Honestly gobsmacked at how reckless that Lindsey Graham tweet is,"" MSNBC host Chris Hayes said.

""Lindsey should resign over this. The most disgracefully irresponsible US senator in a long time,"" writer Sohrab Ahmari said.

""One of the craziest things he’s ever blurted out, and that’s really saying something,"" liberal journalist Michael Tracey said.

""Won’t take long before Russia uses this tweet for propaganda…,"" conservative Kassy Dillon observed.

""Are you TRYING to cause escalation? Now Putin can say 'one of the most senior U.S. Senators has called for my assassination.' Why would you want to help him? This war is causing some who know better to lose their minds,"" CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen said.

Even Chinese propagandists seized on Graham's remarks.

LISTEN: Adam Schiff welcomes damaging information on President Trump in recently resurfaced prank call,"Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) took aim at Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) over the weekend, resurfacing a nearly two-year-old prank call in which Schiff told two Russian shock-jocks that he would accept information damaging to President Donald Trump.

The Florida lawmaker spliced together Schiff's comments to the radio hosts and remarks Schiff made last week in which he criticized the president for using the presidency to ""manufacture dirt on his [political] opponent.""

Schiff's comments then, in relation to the standard he is now applying to the president, makes him a ""hypocrite,"" Gaetz said.

In the prank call, which occurred in January 2018, the radio hosts — Vladimir ""Vovan"" Kuznetzov and Alexey ""Lexus"" Stolyarov — pose as Andriy Parubiy, the now-former speaker of Ukraine's parliament, and offer Schiff damaging material on Trump, which included alleged naked photos, Roll Call reported.

""So, you have recordings of both [Russian journalist Ksenia] Sobchak and [Russian model and singer Olga] Buzova where they're discussing the compromising material on Mr. Trump?"" Schiff asked the pranksters.

""Absolutely,"" one replied.

Schiff later responded, ""Well obviously we would welcome a chance to get copies of those recordings.""

The radio hosts also claimed they had a recording of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn talking with a Russian spy.

While Schiff has not responded to Gaetz's charges of hypocrisy, a spokesperson for Schiff told The Atlantic last year that Schiff informed law enforcement about the prank call.

""Before agreeing to take the call, and immediately following it, the committee informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus,"" the spokesperson said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/listen-adam-schiff-welcomes-damaging-information-on-president-trump-in-recently-resurfaced-prank-call,2019-10-01
The cost of lithium — a metal used to make electric car batteries — is up nearly 500% since last year: 'Supply is simply nowhere near enough to feed this demand surge',"The race to a low-carbon future via electric vehicles already comes with a hefty price tag. But that price tag may enlarge even more in the coming months if the skyrocketing cost of lithium serves as any indication.

What are the details?

The cost of lithium carbonate — a key ingredient used in the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries and other low-carbon energy resources such as solar panels — has jumped 95% already in 2022, and is up almost 500% year-over-year.

According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a leading price reporting agency, battery-grade lithium carbonate (EXW China, ≥99.5% Li2CO3) was averaging a whopping $76,700 a tonne in mid-March. During the same month last year, the metal was trading at $13,400 a tonne.

Benchmark reportedly added that based on reports out of China, things aren’t going to get any easier in the short term due to continued low inventory levels. China is a major producer of the mineral, selling nearly 20% of the world's supply.

But it's not just lithium. Nickel, another metal that serves as a key component in lithium-ion batteries used in EVs, has undergone an eye-popping price surge of late. On March 8, nickel prices more than doubled in a matter of hours, CNBC reported. While the price has come down from its apex in recent days, it still remains significantly inflated.

It should be noted the surge in the price of nickel is especially related to Russia's war in Ukraine, as Russia remains the metal's third-largest producer.

Why does it matter?

Overall, the news of soaring costs for lithium and nickel spotlights what some say is a market completely unprepared for the surging demand for electric vehicles.

""The price explosion tells you that lithium supply is simply nowhere near enough to feed this demand surge,"" OilPrice.com reported.

S&P Global reported earlier this year that supply stands almost no chance of catching up to demand, which has erupted over the last 18 months.

""Although the battery industry has been investing significantly in downstream battery capacity to power the surging EV demand, lithium is still getting less funding than required — and such investment could be too late to prevent a structural deficit in the coming years,"" S&P said.

It added the ""structural deficit"" could last ""throughout this decade.""

Yet the Biden administration continues to push EVs as a remedy not just for environmental woes but economic ones, as well.

In a press conference earlier this month, as gas prices soared as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg unabashedly claimed that ""clean transportation can bring significant cost savings for the American people.""

Perhaps they forgot that new EVs cost an average of $56,437, according to Kelley Blue Book. Prices at the pump would have to soar much higher than their current average for Americans to switch to EVs for strictly cost-saving benefits.

Now it appears the cost of manufacturing or replacing EV batteries will grow higher. Total cost of the vehicles will likely follow.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lithium-cost-skyrockets-amid-electric-vehicle-demand,2022-03-22

Yesterday's hearing featuring U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was the most dramatic to date, with Sondland claiming there was a quid pro quo for Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into Burisma and 2016 election meddling in order to secure a White House call and a meeting between President Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky.

It appears that the drama will continue in Thursday's hearings.

It was reported Thursday morning by several outlets with access to Hill's prepared opening remarks that she plans to go after Republican lawmakers on Thursday for pushing what she calls a ""fictional narrative"" about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Hill will gives House investigators a window into former national security adviser John Bolton's objections to Trump's Ukraine activities, Axios reports in a morning briefing ahead of the hearing.

Last month in her closed-door testimony, Hill said Bolton warned about a ""drug deal"" being cooked up by Trump's deputies, including Rudy Giuliani. She also said that Bolton called Giuliani a ""hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up.""

Holmes attended a lunch in July in Ukraine with the Ambassador Gordon Sondland, in which he overheard a phone call Sondland had with Trump about investigations into Ukraine. After the phone call, Holmes claimed in his closed-door testimony that Sondland recalled that Trump only cared about the ""big stuff"" that affected him, in reference to the Biden investigation.

Lawmakers hope by questioning Homles they will be able to suss out more details about that phone call, and consequently, Trump's state of mind surrounding the events.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/live-feed-fiona-hill-to-testify,2019-11-21
"LIVE FEED: Amb. Gordon Sondland, pivotal figure in the impeachment inquiry, testifies before Congress","In the most highly anticipated public hearing to date in the House impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testifies before Congress Wednesday.

Watch the YouTube livestream of the hearing here:

WATCH LIVE: Open Hearing with Ambassador Gordon Sondland youtu.be

Who's testifying?

Wednesday's hearing will feature three witnesses, the most prominent being Ambassador Sondland, who has become the most pivotal witness in the impeachment inquiry thus far.



Also appearing before Congress Wednesday are Laura Cooper, a senior Defense Department official, and David Hale, a top State Department official.

What's the background?

Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and donor to the 2016 Trump campaign, was personally appointed by Trump to his post in 2018.

Sondland has been cited by other witnesses as having direct knowledge of the alleged freeze of military aid to Ukraine until demands of an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, were met.

In this way, he gives the House Intel Committee the opportunity to question someone with potentially firsthand knowledge of what Trump himself knew.

Sondland has amended his closed-door testimony, recently saying he told a top Ukraine official that the disbursement of military aid was ""likely"" contingent upon the initiation of an investigation into the Bidens.

Last week, a Reuters report broke citing Ukraine's Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko asserting that Sondland did not explicitly link the aid with opening the investigation.

On Wednesday morning, news broke that Sondland would testify that a quid pro quo for Ukraine to announce investigations into the Bidens came from Rudy Giuliani at the direction of the president.

According to our own reporting, ""much of the evidence presented by Democrats and their chosen witnesses that point toward an alleged … 'quid pro quo' by President Donald Trump rests on allegations that Sondland, who had direct contact with Trump, delivered the message to Ukraine that aid was contingent upon a Biden investigation.""

Both Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee hope Wednesday's hearing will sort out the facts.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/live-feed-gordon-sondland-testifies,2019-11-20
"LIVE FEED: House impeachment hearing, featuring ex-Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch","The second public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is set to begin Friday at 9 a.m. ET. The YouTube livestream is available here:

WATCH LIVE: Open Hearing with Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch www.youtube.com

Who is testifying?

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed by Trump from her post in May of this year and has become a key player in the impeachment inquiry, will appear before the House Intelligence Committee.

Yovanovitch's testimony follows Wednesday's hearing where Congress heard testimony from Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.

On Friday, starting at 9 a.m., House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) will make an opening statement, followed by an opening statement by the ranking member on the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, (R-Calif.), then Yovanovitch will make an opening statement.

What is the background?

Trump made reference to Yovanovitch in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, where he said: ""The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just want to let you know that.""

John Solomon reported to Blaze Media that Yovanovitch blocked Ukrainian investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, and that this may have been the reason for her removal.

The State Department officially denied that there was anything unusual about her removal, saying her assignment ended as normal and she was simply removed early to align the change with a new Ukrainian administration.

Yovanovitch believes she was ousted as part of a ""concerted campaign"" by Trump and Ukrainian officials, and testified of this belief in a closed-door session before House impeachment investigators from the Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees in October.

According to a report last week from Fox News Host Tucker Carlson, Yovanovitch may have lied under oath during her closed door testimony with Congress on Oct. 11.

Carlson's show obtained a private email from a Democratic staffer to Yovanovitch seeking to discuss ""delicate and time sensitive questions.""

Yovanovitch claimed in her testimony that she never responded to the email. But ""in fact, it turns out that she did respond,"" Carlson revealed. ""She said she 'looked forward to chatting with [the Democratic staffer].""

WATCH LIVE: Open Hearing with Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams youtu.be

Who is testifying?

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer at the National Security Council, and Jennifer Williams, his counterpart at Vice President Mike Pence's office, will testify before the House Intelligence Committee at 9 a.m.

Later in the afternoon, at 2:30 p.m., NSC official Timothy Morrison and former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker will testify before the House.

What is the background?

Vindman and Williams, the morning witnesses, have expressed concern over President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, of which they were direct witnesses who listened in on the call. Democratic lawmakers will undoubtedly press them on why they felt Trump calling for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, was inappropriate. They will also be asked to provide more detail on any quid pro quo withholding of military aid by the president.

Both Vindman and Williams, being that they are White House aides, also bring the inquiry closer to Trump than ever before. Last week's hearings with testimony from career diplomats Bill Taylor and George Kent, along with ex-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, were charged with dealing in mostly hearsay and secondary source material.

The afternoon witnesses, Morrison and Volker, were requested by Republicans, who have argued that their testimony will undercut Democrats' claims of any wrongdoing by the President.

Democrats hope to find holes in their stories and squeeze their testimonies to see if their minds have changed since hearing from other witnesses since they testified at closed-door meetings several weeks ago.

According to a report from the New York Times Tuesday morning, Volker may modify his testimony, now saying he didn't know that military aid was tied to the call for investigations, or essentially, that he was kept out of the loop.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/live-feed-third-impeachment-hearing,2019-11-19
"'I will vote to impeach the president,' says GOP Rep. Liz Cheney","Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming became the second House Republican to announce support of the impeachment of President Donald Trump after a congressman representing New York's 24th congressional district became the first.

Rep. John Katko of New York was the first House Republican to announce support Tuesday afternoon.

""On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic,"" Cheney said in her statement

""Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough. The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,"" she continued.

""Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not,"" Cheney said.

""There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she added.

""I will vote to impeach the President,"" Cheney concluded.

Katko, a former federal prosecutor, gave similar reasons for his support of impeachment.

""To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,"" Katko said in a statement. ""For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this president.""

Prior to the announcements, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reportedly told people close to him that he believed Trump had committed impeachable offenses over his encouragement of the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois also announced on Tuesday that he would support a second impeachment.

Democrats have drawn up an article of impeachment that accuses the president of inciting an insurrection.

Trump was first impeached by the Democrat-controlled House in December 2019 on two articles of impeachment related to a controversial call the president made to the president of Ukraine. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted against convicting and removing the president.

Here's more about the effort to impeach Trump again:

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman — key witness in Trump impeachment trial — announces military retirement following what he says was political retaliation,"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a key witness in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, announced his military retirement on Wednesday.

What are the details?

Vindman said that his future in the military would ""forever be limited"" due to political retaliation by Trump and his allies, according to his attorney, David Pressman.

Vindman — a Purple Heart recipient — served in the armed forces for 21 years and is an expert on Ukraine, his birth country.

Pressman added that Vindman has endured a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation"" since testifying against the president in 2019. He said that Trump has led the effort against Vindman since the impeachment trial.

Trump fired the military officer from the National Security Council after Vindman testified about his purported knowledge of a 2019 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.

During explosive November testimony, Vindman said that Trump's insistence on the Ukraine investigating former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden was inappropriate and he knew ""without hesitation"" that he should report the knowledge to superiors in order to hold the president accountable.

Since delivering the testimony and losing his position at the NSC, Vindman has said that Trump and his allies have reportedly attempted to blackball Vindman, including blocking a promotion to colonel.

Vindman, who was bound for the National War College as his next assignment, said that he opted to retire rather than be forced underneath a glass ceiling because of his role in the president's impeachment trial.

In a statement to CNN, Pressman said, ""The President of the United States attempted to force LTC Vindman to choose: between adhering to the law or pleasing the president. Between honoring his oath or protecting his career. Between protecting his promotion or the promotion of his fellow soldiers.""

""These are choices that no one in the United States should confront, especially one who has dedicated his life to serving it,"" he added. ""[Vindman] did what the law compelled him to do, and for that, he was bullied by the president and his proxies.""

You can read more about his testimony here.

On Wednesday, Vindman tweeted, ""Today I officially requested retirment from the US Army, an organization I love. My family and I look forward to the next chapter of our lives.""

What else?

Earlier in July, John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, told CNN that he fully believed Vindman deserved the promotion.

""Based on not just his service, but his twin brother's service at the NSC, both of whom were pushed out of their assignments early, I think they certainly deserve a promotion based on what I saw,"" Bolton said. ""They shouldn't be discriminated against. I hope there's nobody in the White House who's holding this up or putting bureaucratic obstacles in the way. I think this is something, this kind of corruption of this promotion process, unfortunately, typical of a number of things that have happened in the administration, [and] I think it's a bad signal to all of our military.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lt-col-alexander-key-witness-in-trump-impeachment-trial-announces-military-retirement,2020-07-08
"Russia's second-largest oil company breaks with Putin, calls for end to war as stock price craters. Now, its website is down.","Russian oil giant Lukoil, the country's second-largest oil producer, shocked onlookers by publicly breaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, calling for an end to the ongoing invasion in Ukraine.

What are the details?

In a statement to shareholders Thursday, the massive company — which produces more than 2% of the world's oil and employs more than 100,000 workers — called for a ""fast resolution"" to the war.

""We stand for the immediate cessation of the armed conflict and duly support its resolution through the negotiation process and through diplomatic means,"" Lukoil's board of directors said in the statement posted on its website, the New York Times reported.

""We express our sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy. We strongly support a lasting ceasefire and a settlement of problems through serious negotiations and diplomacy,"" the board added, according to CNN.

As of Friday afternoon, the statement could not be viewed because Lukoil's website was down.

Why does it matter?

The Times noted that Lukoil likely issued the statement to protect its extensive operations abroad, which include some 200 gas stations in the U.S., predominantly in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Lukoil's market value collapsed by 99% on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday as Moscow's market remained closed for a third straight day. The firm was reportedly selling as a penny stock.

MarketWatch reported that the collapse of Moscow-based energy giants such as Lukoil and natural-gas giant Gazprom came even as U.S. and European sanctions specifically exempted the Russian energy sector.

""But traders have taken matters into their own hands, with very little demand for Russian-sourced oil,"" the outlet said.

Consumers reportedly boycotted the company's gas stations in the northeastern U.S. this week. Lawmakers in Newark went further by voting to suspend Lukoil licenses in the city.

What else?

However, even if the oil producer's motivations were to protect its assets, its statement reflects a wider movement as a growing number of Russia's business class members continue to distance themselves from the country's warmongering president.

At the very least, ""It says they realize it’s going to be difficult for them to engage in international commerce, let alone retail sales in the U.S.,"" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told the Times.

""I’d call a Russian brand for gasoline the 21st-century equivalent of the scarlet letter,"" he added.

According to Reuters, Lukoil's chairman and CEO, Vagit Alekperov, is one of Russia's richest men. Alekperov, a former Caspian Sea oil rig worker, and his deputy, Leonid Fedun, reportedly own a majority of the firm's shares.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lukoil-calls-for-end-to-ukraine-war,2022-03-04
Macron and Putin agree that a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis is needed after a weekend phone call,"During a Sunday phone call, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed for the need to find a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis on Ukraine’s border.

Reuters reported that the French and Russian foreign ministers will meet in the coming days to hold diplomatic talks and seek to hold a summit where Russia, Ukraine, and NATO allies establish a new European security order.

A statement from Macron’s office said that the two presidents discussed “the need to prioritize a diplomatic solution to the current crisis” and that “if conditions are met,” a diplomatic path will allow for the establishment of this new security order the New York Times reported.

The Kremlin, however, appears not to believe that Western leaders are seeking a diplomatic resolution. Shortly after Putin’s conversation with Macron, the Kremlin said that leaders of Western nations were pushing the Ukrainian government to pursue a “military solution” to the ongoing conflict.

Earlier this month, ABC News reported that the Kremlin wants guarantees from Western nations and NATO allies that Ukraine and other formerly Soviet nations will not join defense alliances that purposefully exclude Russia.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government insisted that it does not plan to launch an offensive against the Russian-backed separatists in its eastern region despite Russian insistence to the contrary.

The French and Russian presidents agreed to resume diplomatic talks within the Normandy Format. The Normandy Format is a negotiating channel created a little less than a decade ago by France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia to resolve a similar conflict when Russia attempted to annex Crimea in 2014.

The defense minister of the Russian-allied and Ukraine-bordering nation of Belarus announced that Russia’s military deployment in Belarus would be extended as the two nations continue their joint military exercises along the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

Despite Russia’s insistence that it has no intention of pursuing an armed conflict, American leadership remains unconvinced. The United States continues to insist that it has intelligence indicating an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And, despite the increasingly menacing presence of Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders, Ukrainian national security officials believe that Russia is unlikely to pursue conventional means of warfare.

Oleksiy Danilov, President Zelenskyy’s top national security adviser, believes that Russia is most likely to pursue a series of intense cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns while increasing economic pressure to foster social discontent within Ukraine.

Amidst the chaos, Zelenskyy seeks to meet with Putin so that the two might reach a diplomatic solution between themselves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/macron-and-putin-agree-that-a-diplomatic-solution-to-the-ukraine-crisis-is-needed-after-a-weekend-phonecall,2022-02-20
Maddow Show and Russia ambassador compare Hitler and Putin,"During a Friday night appearance on ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" a former U.S. ambassador to Russia was clobbered online for claiming that in certain aspects, Adolf Hitler wasn't as evil as Vladimir Putin. The comments were regarded as insensitive and blatantly false. The backlash forced both the ambassador and MSNBC to issue apologies in less than 24 hours.

Michael McFaul was appointed as the U.S. ambassador to Russia by former President Barack Obama, and served in the position from 2012 until 2014. McFaul found himself in hot water for comparing Putin to Hitler.

McFaul appeared on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" to give his opinion on ""how horrific"" the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has been. During his appearance, McFaul said he gave an interview to a Ukrainian TV news program 30 minutes prior to going on MSNBC.

""One of the Russian journalists said, 'You know, there's one difference between Hitler when he was coming in and Putin. Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans. He didn't kill German-speaking people,'"" McFaul told host Ali Velshi – who was filling in for Rachel Maddow.

""I think people need to remember that we're talking about cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol and Kyiv, there are large populations there, you know, up to a third and sometimes as much to a half that are Russian speakers and are ethnic Russians,"" said McFaul – who is a Stanford University professor of international studies. ""And yet Putin doesn't seem to care about that. He slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate.""

The Maddow Blog – which is a Twitter account run by ""Rachel Maddow and her staff"" – shared the sentiment, ""One difference between Putin and Hitler is that Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans, German-speaking people. Putin slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate.""

In reactions to the comments on Twitter, commentators were outraged by the simplistic and incorrect comparison, including by the official Twitter account for the Auschwitz Memorial.

Auschwitz Memorial: ""On a factual note: Hitler did kill ethnic Germans & German-speaking people: those who opposed the Nazi regime, those who resisted, those who did not fit into the 'Weltanschauung'. He ordered the murder of people with different disabilities & finally the murder of German Jewry.""

Investigative journalist Jerry Dunleavy: ""Hitler 'didn’t kill German-speaking people' is an insanely false claim since many of the Jews murdered in the Holocaust spoke German. Pro-Tip: You don’t have to try to play weird word games to try to make Putin seem worse than Hitler — Putin is plenty bad on the objective facts.""

Editor Noam Blum: ""'Ethnic Germans' is a really weird way to get around the wholesale murder of German Jews.""

Political commentator Drew Holden: ""I promise you, no matter what, you don’t have to favorably compare Hitler to current foreign leaders.""

Former CIA ops officer Bryan Dean Wright: ""VILE & WRONG: Obama’s Ambassador to Russia — Michael @McFaul — claimed last night that Hitler didn’t kill German speaking people. Putin, on the other hand, is killing Russian speaking people and thus is worse, he declared.""

Researcher and Middle East analyst Kyle Orton: ""The first systematic victims of the Nazi regime were disabled non-Jewish Germans, for one thing. And, of course, what makes the Shoah so shocking is that German Jews were so integrated - 'German-speaking' was the least of it - and were targeted simply because of their identity.""

Political commentator Pradheep J. Shanker: ""MSNBC arguing the relative moral superiority of... Hitler. STOP IT.""

Editor Max Blumenthal: ""McFail’s rant absolving Hitler to own Putin is not just a window into the mentality of the ex-US ambassador to Moscow who helped instigate the new Cold War, but of the Blinken/Nuland State Department that is driving the desperate campaign to extend and escalate the war.""



Journalist Jeff Carlson: ""Obama's ambassador to Russia – who helped promote the Russian-Collusion narrative: 'One difference between Hitler, when he was coming in, and Putin. Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans. He didn't kill German-speaking people.' These people are idiots.""

Following the severe backlash, the Maddow Blog and McFaul issued apologies for making the comparison.

The Maddow Blog wrote on Twitter: ""The historical record is clear. Hitler killed millions of Germans. We tweeted out part of an inaccurate statement made last night by former Ambassador Michael McFaul without attribution, and we regret doing so. We have since removed the tweet.""

McFaul also walked back his comparison of Putin to Hitler.

""After a long of commentary that started with Morning Joe and end with Maddow, I slipped late last night and violated an unwritten taboo – never compare Hitler with anyone. I agree. He was incomparably evil. I won't do it again,"" McFaul tweeted.



""To those who wrote to me to explain that Hitler committed the same atrocities against ethnic Germans that Putin is committing against ethnic Russians today in Mariupol and Kharkiv, please suggest to me the best scholarly readings on this history,"" he added. ""I'm eager to learn. END And please, to clarify the obvious, last night and today, we were NOT discussing Hitler's horrific killing of German citizens. Please have some decency to know that I would never compare Mariupol to the Holocaust.""

Despite blaming fatigue for his comparison between Putin and Hitler, it was only a little more than two weeks ago when McFaul said, ""I know it's taboo to compare anyone to Hitler. But the similarities between Hitler and Putin are just too many to ignore anymore. On some dimensions, they are very different. On others, they are not.""

Also on Feb. 24, the former ambassador wrote on Twitter, ""There are many parallels between Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 and Putin's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.""

McFaul likened Putin to Hitler on March 1, ""Two dictators in last hundred years have attacked Kyiv— Hitler and Putin.""

On Jan. 21, McFaul said, ""Ukraine has done nothing – absolutely nothing – to threaten Russia. But Putin is threatening to invade Ukraine. Feels like Saddam invading Kuwait or Hitler invading Poland. Wrong historical analogies? Which ones are better?""

McFaul once again suggested similarities of Putin and Hitler on Feb. 22, ""Dictators (& sometimes democrats) who use war to achieve their aims sometimes succeed. And sometimes for a while. And then, they overreach. For Hitler that was the day he invaded the Soviet Union, For Brezhnev that was the day he invaded Afghanistan. For Putin, Ukraine 2022?""

He also asked, ""Is Putin today acting more like Hitler or Milosevic? Discuss.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maddow-russia-ambassador-putin-hitler,2022-03-12
MSNBC expert Malcolm Nance faces ridicule over bizarre claim about Chernobyl during attack on Ukraine,"MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance faced online ridicule and mockery over a bizarre claim he made about the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine amidst the Russian attack on the former Soviet republic.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian president confirmed that Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl site, where the world's worst nuclear disaster was contained in 1986. The report raised concern after higher than usual levels of radiation were detected, though they were still within safety guidelines.

When someone asked on social media, ""What does [Russian President] Putin want with Chernobyl?"" Nance had an odd response.

""It powers central North Ukraine,"" he replied.

Social media users immediately mocked the suggestion, given that the nuclear plant had been decommissioned for decades.

""What in the ever loving hell is wrong with Malcolm Nance?"" read one tweet. ""And he was in 'intelligence' for over 30 years?? Explains a lot, actually.""

""Malcolm Nance googled 'Chernobyl,' saw that it was a nuclear power plant, and then just stopped reading,"" joked another user.

""Malcolm Nance is a Russian expert & doesn't know Chernobyl is a nuclear waste land?"" asked another detractor.

""Please don't listen to him. I mean the rest of Chernobyl has been shut down since 2000, ffs. He's just a grifter,"" said another critic.

""Well, In fairness to @MalcolmNance.... If he were smart or had any credibility at all, he wouldn't be on @msnbc, now would he?"" read another tweet.

Nance later deleted the tweet, but it was documented at an online archive.

Despite Nance's odd explanation, other experts said that Chernobyl was simply in the path of one of the quickest routes to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

Nance previously outraged many when he told Americans to get over the bombing in Afghanistan during the U.S. withdrawal from that country. He later said that he tweeted before knowing about the U.S. casualties in the terror attack.

On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that the Chernobyl nuclear plant was safe and secure despite the military occupation by Putin's troops.

Malcolm Nance says he's fighting for Ukraine against Russia: 'I'm done talking ... It's time to take action',"Former MSNBC foreign policy analyst Malcom Nance revealed on Monday that he had joined the fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Nance, who heads a think tank called the Terror Asymmetrics Project, appeared on Joy Reid's show on MSNBC to explain why he joined the fight against the Russians.

“The more I saw of the war going on, the more I thought, ‘I’m done talking, all right? It’s time to take action here.' So about a month ago I joined the international legion here in Ukraine, and I am here to help this country fight, you know, what essentially is a war of extermination,"" said Nance.

""This is an existential war and Russia has brought it to these people and they are mass murdering civilians, and there are people here like me who are here to do something about it,"" he added.

Reid asked Nance if being an international troop put him in danger's way more than the Ukrainians.

“No, it doesn’t, because the war that’s being waged here is being waged against everybody,” Nance responded. ""Look, they're not going around hunting for American flag patches or to see who’s Black, who’s Asian, who’s Latino. We are a part of the Ukrainian armed forces, we are brothers and sisters with the Ukrainian army.""

Nance went on to say that the U.S. needs to provide heavy weaponry to the Ukrainians in order to take away that advantage for the Russians.

“Let me say something to the president of the United States: give them counter battery long range artillery – multiple rocket launch systems,"" Nance said. ""Something that can out-range the artillery. If you do that, you stop the attacks on civilians, because that's what they are doing with the artillery - they are mass murdering civilians.""

Nance concluded the interview by saying the Russians are trying to wipe out Democracy in Ukraine and hope it ""cascades"" into other countries.

""This battle is here. It's gonna be fought now, and we're gonna win it!"" Nance said. ""You fight, you win, and this country is already winning and that's why Russia is already shifting its strategy.""

After his appearance, MSNBC confirmed that Nance was no longer an analyst at the network.

"Man who spit in immigrant's face, said 'go back to your country' ordered by judge to write 500-word essay","A man who spit in an immigrant's face and told him to ""go back to your country"" has been ordered by an Oregon judge to write a 500-word essay on the challenges immigrants face when moving to America, KOIN-TV reported.

What's the background?

Harold Denson III of Portland reportedly threw trash around outside a car dealership Aug. 25, the station said. The dealership's manager — a Ukranian immigrant — walked over to Denson with a bag and asked him to clean up the trash, KOIN reported.

Initially, Denson said thank you, the station said, but as the manager was walking away Denson became agitated and yelled that the dealership wasn't the manager's property but was ""American soil."" Denson then asked the manager where he was born before spitting in his face and telling him to ""go back to your country,"" KOIN said.

Denson also threatened to injure the manager with a box cutter, the station said.

Police responded to the scene, the Willamette Week reported, adding that no one was hurt.

Now what?

Denson on Friday pleaded no contest to charges of unlawful use of a weapon and second-degree bias crime, KOIN reported.

As a result, the station said, Multnomah County Judge Christopher Ramras sentenced Denson to 90 days in jail — and ordered him to write a 500-word essay on the difficulties immigrants face when moving to the United States.

“This is a unique resolution to a very serious incident,"" Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Nicole Hermann said of the essay order, KOIN reported. “Mr. Denson needs to understand the impact his actions had on the victim and our immigrant communities. This is an opportunity for him to reconcile his behavior through compassion, learning, and understanding.""

Here's a clip of the judge explaining the essay to Denson, as well as Denson's reaction to it:

"Sen. Joe Manchin knocks 'hypocritical,' 'senseless' Biden for continuing to buy up Russian oil while they invade Ukraine","President Joe Biden is expected to tout his administration's sanctions campaign against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine during his State of the Union address Tuesday night — but at least one Democratic lawmaker thinks the president's response is mightily lacking one key area.

What are the details?

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) rebuked the president on Monday over his refusal to cut off Russian energy imports, calling the White House's response ""hypocritical"" and ""senseless.""

Instead of continuing to buy up Russian energy, the moderate Democrat said the U.S. should be hitting the Kremlin where it hurts by curtailing purchases of Russian crude oil and energy while building up American energy independence.

""We produce energy cleaner than anybody in the world,"" Manchin told Bloomberg. ""We’re buying 650,000 barrels a day from Russia. It’s ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.""

The senator, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, later said in a statement: ""The entire world is watching as [Russian President] Vladimir Putin uses energy as a weapon in an attempt to extort and coerce our European allies. While Americans decry what is happening in Ukraine, the United States continues to allow the import of more than half a million barrels per day of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia during this time of war.""

Continued reliance on Russian oil poses a ""clear and present danger to our nation’s energy security,"" he added before calling on the Biden administration to ""ramp up domestic energy production"" right away.

""To continue to ask other countries to do what we can do for ourselves in a cleaner way is hypocritical,"" Manchin charged. ""To continue to rely on Russian energy as they attack Ukraine is senseless.""

Oil sales are a major income stream for Moscow and so remain a key funding source for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Given that fact, curbing energy imports seems like an obvious strategic maneuver, especially for a country as resource-rich as the U.S.

It's something even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau figured out — though Trudeau's declaratory ban on Russian crude oil imports was quickly called out as nothing but a public relations move. Canada hasn't imported Russian crude for years.

What else?

Nevertheless, Biden continues to allow Putin and his warring administration to benefit from foreign oil purchases, even while other sanctions levied by the U.S. and Western allies wreak havoc on the Russian economy.

A ban on crude oil imports from Russia could be the death knell for Moscow's war machine.

But just as he initially balked at imposing some of the most severe sanctions — such as removing Russia from SWIFT, a vital international banking system, and personally sanctioning Putin — Biden here again seems content to wait and see if such steps are necessary.

"Marco Rubio, something off, Vladimir Putin, Russia, Ukraine","As the people of Ukraine continue to come under assault by invading Russian forces, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that ""something is off with"" Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I wish I could share more,but for now I can say it’s pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,"" Rubio wrote. ""He has always been a killer,but his problem now is different & significant,"" the lawmaker continued. ""It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago.""

The Florida Republican, who has served in the U.S. Senate for more than a decade, is currently the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.



""I am requesting that the Biden Admin preemptively announce that anyone who joins a puppet Russian installed govt in #Ukraine be automatically sanctioned,receive a visa ban & will be the subject of an Interpol Red Notice,"" Rubio also tweeted. ""I ask other nations to do the same.""

His comments come as Ukrainians bravely fight back against a Russian invasion.

While President Biden has said that U.S. forces will not become involved in the battle between Russia and Ukraine, he also said that America will defend NATO territory.

Marco Rubio warns in no uncertain terms why a no-fly zone over Ukraine is a bad idea: 'It means World War III',"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) warned Sunday that establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would trigger World War III.

What is a NFZ?

A no-fly zone, otherwise known as an air-exclusion zone, is an order banning aircraft over a certain area.

In war, such aerial demilitarized zones are intended to prohibit military aircraft from engaging in bombing runs and other hostile actions. Military enforcement is thus required, which includes shooting down aircraft that violate the no-fly order. In this situation, if NATO were to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, enforcement would mean NATO forces engaging Russian aircraft.

What did Rubio say?

Speaking on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Rubio explained that imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would trigger another world war because enforcing a NFZ requires willingness ""to shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation.""

""Look, a no-fly zone has become a catchphrase. I’m not sure a lot of people fully understand what that means,"" Rubio began.

""That means flying [Airborne Warning and Control Systems] 24 hours a day. That means the willingness to shoot down and engage Russian airplanes in the sky. That means, frankly, you can’t put those planes up there unless you’re willing to knock out the anti-aircraft systems that the Russians have deployed — and not just in Ukraine, but in Russia and also in Belarus,"" he explained.

""So basically a no-fly zone, if people understood what it means, it means World War III. It means starting World War III,"" Rubio warned.

During a video conference with members of the U.S. House and Senate on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy essentially asked for a no-fly zone to stop Russia's bombardment of his country.

NATO has refused thus far to establish a no-fly zone over fears that doing so would escalate the war, just as Rubio predicts it would.

""The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin said over the weekend that imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be viewed by the Kremlin as participation in the war.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marco-rubio-warns-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-bad-idea,2022-03-07
Mark Meadows warns Republicans that they will face repercussions if they vote for new impeachment witnesses,"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) warned his Republicans colleagues that they would face political repercussions if they chose to vote to hear more witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

He made the comments in an interview with Norah O'Donnell on CBS News.

""I mean listen, I don't want to speak for my Senate colleagues. But there are always political repercussions for every vote you take,"" he answered.

""There is no vote that is higher profile than this,"" he explained.

Republican centrists are under pressure to split with the caucus in the Republican-controlled Senate in order to allow Democrats to call witnesses who have not yet testified.

One such witness who could have a deleterious effect on the president's defense is John Bolton, who served as the president's national security adviser. He has reportedly made comments criticizing Rudy Giuliani's quest to investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Bolton also gave Democrats hope when a report claimed that his forthcoming book will bolster accusations against the president of a ""quid pro quo"" with the Ukrainian president.

Republicans have also warned Democrats that if they try to call new witnesses for the prosecution, this will open up opportunities for new witnesses for the defense, including Hunter Biden.

Mark Zuckerberg was 'not aware' that Facebook's head election integrity official used to work for Biden,"During a period of intense questioning with senators on Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that he was not aware that a person who identifies herself as the person who ""leads efforts to ensure election integrity on [Facebook]"" was formerly a policy adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

The exchange, which was held via video conference, came in response to a question from Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who was quizzing Zuckerberg about the prevalence of prominent former Democratic staffers in key positions at Facebook.

According to Fox News, Thune asked, ""My understanding is that the person that is in charge of election integrity and security at Facebook is a former Joe Biden staffer, is there someone closely associated with President Trump in the same role at Facebook?""

Thune's question appears to have been referring to Atlantic Council Senior Fellow Anna Makanju, whose work for Biden is prominently stated on her Atlantic Council biography. Facebook announced a partnership with the Atlantic Council in 2018 to help boost its election security efforts. According to the Atlantic Council's website, Makanju leads those efforts.

In response, Zuckerberg claimed that he was unaware of the connection, stating, ""I think having balance is valuable, and we try to do that. I am not aware of the example of you say of someone in charge of this process who worked for Biden in the past, so we can follow up on that.""

Makanju's connection with the Biden campaign is relevant because of the bitter fight that has been waged between Biden and Trump supporters over the reliability and security of widespread mail-in voting. The Trump campaign has alleged that encouraging widespread mail-in voting could lead to potential voter fraud or disenfranchisement, while the Biden campaign disagrees.

While some states have successfully implemented secure mail-in voting after a yearslong process, the United States has never attempted mail-in voting on the scale that is being attempted this year as part of efforts to help people avoid in-person voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. In spite of the fact that mail-in voting in this manner and on this scale has never been attempted before, Facebook announced four weeks ago that it was coming down squarely in the Biden camp and would take action to penalize pages that shared stories questioning the reliability or integrity of mail-in voting.

Makanju's role at Facebook also came under scrutiny after Facebook announced that it would throttle the reach of a New York Post story alleging that Biden's son, Hunter, was trading on the Biden name in a series of shady business dealings with Chinese energy company known as CEFC, which functions as a de facto arm of the communist Chinese government.

At the time Facebook made the decision, many media outlets (including MSN) noted that Makanju told the Washington Post in 2019 that she ""listened to the calls and said release of the transcripts would only strengthen Biden's case that he acted properly.""

Also, Andy Stone, the Facebook official who announced Facebook's decision to throttle the Post story indicates in his Twitter biography that in the past, he worked for the Democratic House Majority PAC, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer (Calif.), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Democratic Rep. Jerry McNerney (Calif.).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-biden-adviser,2020-10-28
Stock market closes 2022 with worst year since 2008,"The stock market notched significant declines in 2022, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq marking their worst year since 2008, falling 8.8%, 19.4%, and 33.1% respectively, according to CNBC.

The stock market's fall in 2022 came during a year in which Russia has been waging a war against Ukraine and the Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates in a bid to combat the high inflation that has been hammering Americans.

""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 7.1 percent before seasonal adjustment,"" the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics noted in a consumer price index report released earlier this month. ""The all items index increased 7.1 percent for the 12 months ending November; this was the smallest 12- month increase since the period ending December 2021.""

Economic conditions could keep getting worse for awhile.

""You still have high inflation which is moderating, you have a declining housing market, you have slowing growth—all that suggest a potential continued deterioration in the economy in the first part of 2023,"" head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network Peter Essele said, according to the Wall Street Journal — the outlet reported that Essele suggested that the downturn may lead the Fed to start indicating a potential for interest-rate decreases. ""That could set up a very nice picture for the latter half of 2023,"" he said.

Congress recently passed an around $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package that ran thousands of pages long, sparking criticism from conservatives — Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas described it as a ""spending boondoggle"" that ""will drive inflation and prices even higher.""

Maxine Waters: Trump ‘needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement’,"One of the first House Democrats to openly call for President Donald Trump's impeachment now says it's not good enough and would rather see him locked up all by himself instead.

In a Tuesday afternoon tweet, Rep Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said that she had had enough of the president's ""filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed.""

""Impeachment is not good enough for Trump,"" said Waters, who started calling for Trump's impeachment shortly after his inauguration. ""He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.""

President Trump has been the subject of emboldened calls for his impeachment from Washington Democrats in the wake of the controversy over a whistleblower from the intelligence community's report about a late July phone call between the U.S. president and the president of Ukraine.

In the wake of the controversy and impeachment push from House Democrats last week, President Trump remarked that those who fed the information to the whistleblower were ""close to a spy"" and ""You know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.""

In a Monday tweet, President Trump publicly asked if House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for treason for giving a ""FAKE & terrible"" version of the Ukraine phone call at a hearing last week. On Tuesday, he tweeted about Schiff again, asking why Schiff isn't ""being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States?""

Schiff has defended his fictionalized version of the call transcript by saying it ""was meant to be, at least part, in parody.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maxine-waters-trump-needs-to-be-imprisoned-placed-in-solitary-confinement,2019-10-01
McCarthy vows to boot Schiff from Intel committee over Hunter Biden laptop lies,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) once again vowed to remove Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.) from the House Intelligence Committee if the Republicans take back the majority during midterms, this time slamming the controversial lawmaker for lying about Hunter Biden's laptop.

Schiff — who is best-known for his outsized role during the Trump-Russian investigation — dismissed without evidence reports about the president and his son originally published by the New York Post in the lead-up to the 2020 election, calling them nothing more than Russian ""propaganda.""

But on Wednesday, more than a year after the bombshell reports surfaced, the New York Times finally admitted that the laptop story is real. The news set off another firestorm across the American media landscape as conservatives called for a reckoning against those who censored the reports and denounced them as fraudulent.

In a press conference Friday, McCarthy made sure to hold Schiff to account for his role, arguing that his dismissal of the story was just another example of the lawmaker's routine politicization of the committee.

""The Democrats have politicized our Intelligence Committee. You've watched it year after year since Adam Schiff has become the chair,"" McCarthy charged, according to the Washington Examiner. ""No, he doesn't warn us about Ukraine or Afghanistan or what's happening around the world. He tells you about politics. But the worst part of it is you cannot trust what he tells you.""

""Two years ago, Schiff stated the emails found from Hunter Biden were all a whole smear on Joe Biden that comes from the Kremlin. That's what the head of the Intel said ... and what did we just find out yesterday from the New York Times? Yes, it is Joe Biden's laptop, and yes, Adam Schiff lied to us one more time.""

McCarthy went on to argue that Democrats should have immediately removed Schiff from the panel in the wake of the New York Times story, and vowed that if Republicans retake control, changes would be made.

""Why is he still chair of the committee? And why is he even on the committee?"" the GOP leader asked before asserting, ""In a new Congress, if it's a new majority, he will not be.""

""You cannot make this committee political. You cannot use it as a position of a chairman to lie, and you should be focused on what the American people want you to be focused on around the world,"" he added.

It's not the first time that McCarthy has promised to remove Schiff from the committee assignment. In January, the GOP leader promised Republicans would soon take action against the California lawmaker and two of his colleagues — Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) — once they take back the House.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mccarthy-adam-schiff-hunter-biden-laptop,2022-03-18
"After meeting with centrist Republican, Mitch McConnell has enough votes to block witnesses in impeachment trial","Republicans believe they now have the votes to block Democrats' demands to bring new witnesses in the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump in the U.S. Senate.

The news came after a meeting between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and centrist Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Democrats were hoping that moderate centrist Republicans like Murkowski might vote with them to call new witnesses, including John Bolton, the former national security adviser to Trump.

On Wednesday, those hopes appeared to be canceled.

""We're going to get it done by Friday, hopefully,"" said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.).

""I think I can say the mood is good,"" agreed Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). ""If I had to guess, no witnesses. We'll be in a place where I think everyone is going to have their mind made up and I believe that we'll be able to move to a verdict, and the witness question will be clear at that point.""

Bolton reportedly wrote in an upcoming book that he had concerns about personal favors that the president made to foreign leaders of Turkey and Russia. He also reportedly made claims that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine for the express purpose of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son.

Democrats hoped that Bolton's testimony would bolster their accusations in the two articles of impeachment against the president, especially that of abuse of power.

If Republicans are successful in denying Democrats' motions to bring new witnesses, the impeachment trial of Trump could be ended as soon as Friday.

"Mitch McConnell leaves door open for Republicans to call Hunter Biden, other witnesses in upcoming Senate impeachment trial","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) left the door open for Republicans to call key witnesses, including Hunter Biden, in the upcoming Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, NBC News reported Tuesday.

Speaking with reporters Tuesday afternoon, McConnell remarked that if witnesses are called, ""I can't imagine"" only the Democrats having people they would like to hear from appear before Congress.

In other words, if those who favor impeachment call someone they believe will help the case against Trump, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, it can be expected that those opposed to impeachment would be able to call on witness of their own, including Hunter Biden, who Republicans believe has relevant information validating Trump's concern about corruption in Ukraine involving former Vice President Joe Biden.

NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Kasie Hunt broke the news when she asked McConnell whether he would back calling Hunter Biden to the witness stand, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has recently suggested.

McConnell's comments came just hours after he knocked talk of calling additional impeachment witnesses, saying the need to call for more witnesses shows the impeachment case to be particularly weak.

""If the existing case is strong, there's no need for the judge and the jury to reopen the investigation. If the existing case is weak, House Democrats should not have impeached in the first place,"" McConnell said from the Senate floor, according to The Hill.

On Monday, Politico reported that GOP senators are at odds over how to handle the calling of witnesses in the upcoming trial, many weighing a vote in favor of calling witnesses despite McConnell's wishes.

Sen. Paul reportedly warned Republican colleagues at a party lunch last week, saying, ""Don't think you can just vote for Bolton and not the witnesses Trump wants.""

The GOP will need to decide rather quickly how to proceed as McConnell confirmed that ""in all likelihood"" the Senate impeachment trial would begin Jan. 21.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mcconnell-door-open-hunter-biden,2020-01-14
Mitch McConnell tells Republicans he doesn't have enough votes to prevent new impeachment witnesses,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reportedly told his caucus that he did not have the votes to prevent the Democrats' demands for new impeachment trial witnesses.

The possible inclusion of new witnesses has been a contentious debate between Democratic critics of President Donald Trump and his Republican allies and supporters.

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that McConnell admitted that enough Republicans had crossed over to support the demands from Democrats. However, many Republicans remained uncommitted on the issue.

Fox News confirmed the report but added that it was unclear just what the claim meant, since some Republicans are willing to make concessions in order to call Hunter Biden to testify.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said that he was among those Republicans who wanted to hear from new witnesses, including John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.

Bolton reportedly claimed that Trump was withholding military aid from Ukraine, a central accusation of the impeachment articles, in an upcoming book.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) warned Republicans publicly on Monday that if they voted with Democrats for new witnesses, they could face political repercussions.

Poll of voters says media bias in Hunter Biden laptop story,"In mid-October, the New York Post began publishing explosive allegations against Hunter Biden, accusing Joe Biden's son of having inappropriate business dealings with energy corporations in Ukraine and China.

The source for the accusations was reported emails from a MacBook Pro laptop that allegedly belonged to Hunter Biden, but he never picked it up from a computer repair shop in Delaware after dropping it off there in April 2019.

Joe Biden denied the allegations at the final presidential debate by saying, ""I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.""



The accusations arrived at the stretch run for the 2020 presidential election, but much of the mainstream media flat-out refused to cover the story or labeled the New York Post reports as a ""Russian disinformation campaign,"" despite many details being published in 2018 by the New York Times.

In a new Rasmussen poll, a majority of Americans believe that the media purposely buried the Hunter Biden laptop story to influence the 2020 election.



Rasmussen asked 1,000 likely U.S. voters: ""Which is closer to your thinking — that many news organizations ignored the Hunter Biden story to help Joe Biden's presidential campaign or that many ignored the story because they felt it was a partisan hit job?""

The national telephone and online survey found that 52% think that news organizations ignored the Hunter Biden story to help his father's presidential campaign. There were 32% who said the media ignored the story because they felt it was a partisan hit job, and 17% were not sure what to believe of the situation.

There were 56% who believed that Joe Biden was consulted about and perhaps profited from his son's overseas business deals.

The poll also found that 70% of voters said they have been ""closely"" following the news about Hunter Biden's business dealings, and 38% have been following it ""very closely.""

""Among those who have been following Very Closely, 76% say the media deliberately ignored the story before Election Day to help Joe Biden, and 72% think the president-elect is likely to have been consulted about and perhaps profited from his son's overseas dealings,"" Rassmussen noted.

Hunter Biden revealed in early December that he was under a federal investigation. Department of Justice sources reportedly said Hunter Biden's taxes had been under investigation since 2018. There are reports that Hunter Biden is under four federal investigations.

Since the investigation was made public, the mainstream media has shown more interest in covering the allegations. This week, NBC News published a story about the president-elect's son receiving an email from a business partner that warned Hunter that he had failed to disclose $400,000 in income from the Ukrainian Burisma gas company on his 2014 tax returns.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/media-bias-hunter-biden-story-poll,2020-12-18

"Miami holds gun buyback, plans to send guns to Ukraine","The city of Miami, Florida, is once again holding a gun buyback with a twist — the guns collected during the event could end up being transported over to the war-torn country of Ukraine, where Russia has been waging a brutal attack since earlier this year.

People can score a $50, $100, or even $150 gift card if they turn in a firearm during the upcoming buyback this Saturday.

""The City of Miami has set up a voluntary gun buyback program to assist in providing safety and defense equipment to Ukraine,"" according to a post on the city's website. ""Your donations will be used to assist the Ukraine support efforts. Receive a gift card starting at $50 for an old, unused, or found weapons, no questions asked.

""Turning in an undesired gun is a great way to take guns off the streets by preventing the potential of them falling into the wrong hands.

"Michael Atkinson speaks out, implies that Trump was politically motivated in firing him","Michael Atkinson, the former inspector general of the intelligence community whom President Donald Trump fired last week, spoke out on Sunday about his sudden ousting.

In a lengthy statement, Atkinson implied that Trump's decision to fire him was politically motivated.

""It is hard not to think that the President's loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General and from my commitment to continue to do so,"" Atkinson wrote.

Indeed, Trump's abrupt decision to fire Atkinson, made Friday evening, led to accusations of political ""retribution"" against Atkinson for informing Congress about the Ukraine whistleblower. The complaint, which alleged that Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate his political opponents, triggered Trump's impeachment, which ultimately concluded with his acquittal in the Senate.



In a letter to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Trump said on Friday that he ""no longer"" has confidence in Atkinson as inspector general, but did not explain why. On Saturday, Trump explained he fired Atkinson for delivering the whistleblower complaint to Congress.

""I thought he did a terrible job. Absolutely terrible,"" Trump said. ""He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report and he brought it to Congress.""

However, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz responded to Atkinson's firing by explaining that his handling of the Ukraine whistleblower complaint ""was done 'by the book' and consistent with the law.""

Both Democrats and Republicans were upset over Trump's decision. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the senior-most senator, said over the weekend that the White House must answer for Atkinson's dismissal.

Top GOP lawmaker discloses 'something more' to hostage crisis at Texas synagogue; investigation goes global,"A top House Republican revealed Sunday the investigation into the man who took four people hostage at a Texas synagogue on Saturday has gone international.

What are the details?

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN host Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" there is ""something more"" to the case than a lone actor.

In fact, McCaul disclosed that the FBI's investigation now extends to London and Tel Aviv.

""I know the FBI has now fanned their investigation out to London and Tel Aviv. So this has now turned into an international investigation. So there’s something more here,"" McCaul said. ""And the fact he’s calling for Lady al Qaeda’s release from prison has been, as you said, in the jihadist world kind of a cause celebre.""

""And so I think we’re going to find out a lot more in the next 24, 48 hours. He is British. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s Pakistani, just like Siddiqui. And we need to get to the bottom of this,"" he added. ""We haven’t seen one of these radicalized attacks in a few years now, and it is disturbing to see it raise its ugly head again.""

Law enforcement identified 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram as the perpetrator, and said he traveled to the U.S. approximately five weeks ago. The motive has not been officially determined, although his choice of attacking a synagogue on a Saturday during the middle of a Sabbath service strongly suggests religious motivations.

The suspect reportedly demanded the release of convicted terrorist Aafia Siddiqui, who is known as ""Lady Al Qaeda."" Siddiqui is serving an 86-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2010 of attempted murder and armed assault of U.S. military personnel. Siddiqui is incarcerated at a federal prison not far from the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue that was attacked.

""This is a disturbing case that demonstrates that anti-Semitism is unfortunately alive and well,"" McCaul said. ""I think they chose this synagogue because she, Siddiqui, the Lady al Qaeda, they call her, is being detained in a Fort Worth prison facility.""

Anything else?

After the FBI attempted to downplay the role religion played in hostage crisis at the synagogue, President Joe Biden condemned the incident as an act of terrorism.

""This was an act of terror,"" Biden said.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan also condemned the incident as an ""act of terrorism"" and an ""act of anti-Semitism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-mccaul-something-more-synagogue-hostage-crisis,2022-01-16

""My opponent, Evan McMullin, is a Democrat running in disguise. I understand the commitment made by my colleague. I work with him, like him — but here's the deal: I don't think Mitt Romney wants Chuck Schumer to continue to be the Senate majority leader,"" Lee said.



Lee urged Romney to ""get on board"" with every other Senate Republican who has already endorsed him against McMullin.

""Mitt, if you'd like to protect the Republican majority, give us any chance of seizing the Republican majority once again — getting it away from the Democrats who are facilitating this massive spending spree and a massive inflationary binge — please, get on board. Help me win reelection. Help us do that,"" he said.

Watch:



Last month, Lee posted a list of endorsements from 48 of his Senate Republican colleagues that notably excluded Romney.

Though both Utah lawmakers claim to be conservatives, they differ when it comes to former President Donald Trump. Romney is a longtime Trump critic and was the only GOP senator to vote to convict the Republican president in both of his impeachment trials. Lee, on the other hand, supported Trump's effort to challenge the results of the 2020 election and criticized the second impeachment effort against Trump as an overreach by Democrats.

While Utah is a red state where typically the two-term Lee would win reelection easily, McMullin has shaken the race up by running as an independent and convincing the Democratic Party not to field a candidate. An ex-CIA agent, McMullin previously ran for president as an independent against Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. He is attempting to build a coalition of Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to unseat Lee, and polls show he is closer to winning than any Democratic candidate who's faced the incumbent Republican before.



Earlier this year, Romney told reporters that he considers both Lee and McMullin to be friends and said he intended to remain neutral.

“I don’t think endorsements make any difference in a race to speak of. People in the race are my friends. I usually try and avoid situations where they’ve been friends. I may endorse and I may not, but I really haven’t given it any thought at this point,” he said on a video conference call in March.

Lee told host Tucker Carlson that Romney's neutrality amounted to ""tacit assistance"" of his opponent.

""Evan McMullin continues to raise millions of dollars from progressive Democratic donors nationwide who are hellbent on getting rid of me,"" Lee said.



""I think a lot of Utahans are being duped or fooled, and it doesn’t help to have tacit acquiescence, the tacit assistance of my Republican colleague from Utah.""

Mike Pence refuses to cooperate with Democrats' demands on Ukraine call,"Vice President Mike Pence refused to cooperate with Democrats' subpoena for documents related to a controversial call made by the president.

Pence sent a letter to a letter to House Democrats indicating that he questioned the legitimacy of their impeachment inquiry.

The letter asserted that ""the purported 'impeachment inquiry' has been designed and implemented in a manner that calls into question your commitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights.""

Democrats have used the claims of a whistleblower about allegedly improper demands from President Donald Trump in a phone call to the Ukrainian president to bolster their impeachment inquiry.

""Instead of being accountable to the American people and casting a vote to authorize what all agree is a substantial constitutional step, you have instead attempted to avoid this fundamental requirement by invoking the Speaker's announcement of an 'official impeachment inquiry' at a press conference,"" the letter continued.

The letter was sent to the Democratic chairpersons of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Democratic Rep. Ted Deutsch of Florida excoriated Pence for his refusal to comply.

""Vice President Mike Pence doesn't think that Congress or the American people deserve to know if he was involved in the effort to ask Ukraine to interfere in our elections,"" he tweeted.

""There is no privilege that allows anyone in the WH to cover up wrongdoing,"" he concluded.



Earlier on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that Democrats would not be taking a vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry.

Mike Pompeo fires back at 'shameful' NPR reporter who claims he berated her in private,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted an NPR reporter Saturday who accused him of screaming and cursing at her in private following a tense interview about Ukraine.

NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly alleged Friday that after Pompeo abruptly ended a pre-scheduled interview, he berated her in private and demanded that she identify Ukraine on a map.

In his response, Pompeo released a statement accusing Kelly of violating the ""basic rules of journalism and decency.""

""NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly lied to me, twice,"" Pompeo said. ""First, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record.""

""It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration,"" he continued. ""It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.""

""It is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine,"" Pompeo concluded, implying that Kelly did not correctly identify Ukraine.

Pompeo, however, did not deny Kelly's allegations.

In response to Pompeo's statement, NPR's senior vice president of news Nancy Barnes said, ""Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mike-pompeo-fires-back-at-shameful-npr-reporter-who-claims-he-berated-her-in-private,2020-01-25
Mike Pompeo receives millions of dollars in security each month due to 'serious and credible' threats from Iran,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his top aide while out of office are receiving millions of dollars worth of security from the State Department due to “serious and credible” threats from Iran.

The Associated Press reported that the U.S. State Department is paying more than $2 million per month to provide Pompeo and his former aide, Brian Hook, with 24-hour security.

The State Department told Congress that it cost $13.1 million to protect both men from August 2021 to February 2022.

The State Department’s recently published 2022 Annual Threat Assessment detail these expenses, according to CBS News.

Pompeo and Hook were key actors in the Trump administration’s campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran and, as such, have received intense death threats on a regular basis.

American intelligence assesses that the threats to their lives have remained constant since they left government and could intensify. Despite the Biden administration renewing negotiations with Iranian officials over the previously scrapped 2015 nuclear agreement, the threats against Pompeo and Hook have persisted.

As a former secretary of state, Pompeo was given 180 days of round-the-clock protection by the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security after leaving office. But according to a recent report, the current Secretary of State Antony Blinken opted to extend the security detail in 60-day increments due to “a serious and credible threat from a foreign power or agent of a foreign power arising from duties performed by former Secretary Pompeo while employed by the department.”

Hook — who worked closely with Pompeo to impose crippling sanctions upon Iran — was also granted this special protection by Blinken upon leaving government service.

Hook has been receiving 60-day security extensions similar to Pompeo.

The latest 60-day extension will soon expire and the State Department, along with the Director of National Intelligence, must determine by March 16 if the federal government should extend protections once more.

Current U.S. officials have said that the threats against Pompeo and Hook have been discussed in the renewed nuclear discussions.

In these discussions, Iranian diplomats are demanding the removal of all sanctions placed upon Iran by the Trump administration. This includes removing the label of “foreign terrorist organization” from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

These discussions have been paused in recent weeks as the Russian diplomatic envoy mediating the discussions raised concerns over Western sanctions on Russia in response to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Mitch McConnell and other congressional Republicans visit Zelenskyy in Kyiv as $40 billion aid package stalls in the Senate,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) led a delegation of Congressional Republicans to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this weekend in Kyiv.

McConnell was joined by Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, John Cornyn of Texas, and John Barrasso of Wyoming among others, NBC News reported.

After leaving Ukraine, the Kentucky senator issued a statement that the Republican delegation witnessed firsthand the “courage, unity, and resolve of the Ukrainian people” and that they, the Ukrainian government, “only ask for the tools they need for self-defense.”

McConnell said that the Republican delegation “reaffirmed to President Zelenskyy that the United States stands squarely behind Ukraine and will sustain our support until Ukraine wins this war.”

Adding that the defense of Ukraine and defending principles of sovereignty directly impact U.S. national security, McConnell said, “It is also essential that America not stand alone. Our allies and partners must continue to step up and do their part.”

After meeting with the Republican delegation, Zelenskyy said that the group's visit shows the strength of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.

Zelenskyy said, “We discussed various areas of support for our state, including defensive and financial. As well as tightening sanctions on Russia. I expressed gratitude for the historic decision to renew the Lend Lease program. I called for the official recognition of Russia as a terrorist state.”

The Republican delegation’s visit comes just days after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $40 billion spending package that included military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Rand Paul, the junior Republican senator from Kentucky, recently held up the package’s passage in the Senate.

The Republican delegation is only the latest group of American political figures to visit Ukraine amidst Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion.

In late April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to assure him that the federal government would soon be providing him with more than $300 million in military financing.

In early May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation of Congressional Democrats consisting of Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks from New York, and Adam Schiff from California to express political support for Ukraine amidst the Russian military’s renewed attacks in Ukraine’s eastern regions.

First Lady Jill Biden also paid a visit to Ukraine, about a week after Pelosi’s delegation met with Zelenskyy.

"Mitch McConnell: If House votes to impeach, Senate will have 'no choice but to take it up'","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) confirmed that if the House of Representatives did vote to impeach President Donald Trump, he would be forced to have the Senate vote on whether or not to remove the president from office.

What did McConnell say?

In an interview Monday, CNBC host Carl Quintanilla asked McConnell how he'd handle things if the House did in fact vote to impeach.

This may seem like an obvious question, but the U.S. Constitution does not require that the Senate vote on an impeachment resolution from the House. And while the House votes to impeach, only the Senate can remove a president from office.

But McConnell pointed out that a rule did exist: not in the Constitution, but in the rules of the Senate itself:

It's a Senate rule related to impeachment, which would take 67 votes to change. So I would have no choice but to take it up. How long you are on it is a whole different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.

Assuming that Republicans fill the vacant seat left by the resignation of Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) before the vote with one of their own, they will still only have 199 seats to the 235 held by Democrats (the remaining seat is held by former Republican Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.). This means that Democrats could get the simple majority they need to impeach, even if every Republican were to vote against it and even if more than a dozen Democrats decided to defect. It is far less likely, however, that the GOP-controlled Senate would vote to convict.

What's the background?

After resisting calls for impeachment from within her own party for months, Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced last Tuesday that she was ready to begin impeachment proceedings. The catalyst for this move came after a whistleblower reported that Trump had asked the president of Ukraine to investigate current 2020 Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden.

To date only two presidents in U.S history have ever been impeached: Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson (who fought against Congress' attempts to grant rights to former slaves), and Bill Clinton. Impeachment loomed for Richard Nixon, but he resigned from office before Congress could follow through on its threats.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-if-house-votes-to-impeach-senate-will-have-no-choice-but-to-take-it-up,2019-09-30
Mitt Romney claims 'truth and justice' require Senate to hold impeachment trial against Trump,"Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) claimed Sunday that the Senate will conduct a second impeachment trial against now-former President Donald Trump in order to uphold ""truth and justice.""

What did Romney say?

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Romney told show host Chris Wallace that an impeachment trial is necessary to hold Trump accountable for the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, as well as his controversial call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

In fact, Romney said ""truth and justice"" demand another trial.

""Well, we're certainly going to have a trial. I wish that weren't necessary, but the president's conduct with regards to the call to Secretary of State Raffensperger in Georgia as well as the incitation towards the insurrection that led to the attack on the Capitol call for a trial,"" Romney said.

""And, you know, if we're going to have unity in our country, I think it's important to recognize the need for accountability, for truth and justice,"" the Utah senator added.

Romney, of course, did not reveal how he would vote during the trial. But Romney did say that the article of impeachment passed by the House two weeks ago ""suggests impeachable conduct.""

""I will do my best as a Senate juror to apply justice as well as I can understand it,"" Romney promised.

Romney went on to say:

I think it's pretty clear that over the last year or so there has been an effort to corrupt the election in the United States. It was not by President Biden, it was by President Trump.That corruption we saw with regards to the conduct in Ukraine, as well as the call to Secretary of State Raffensperger, as well as the incitation to insurrection. This is obviously very serious and an attack on the very foundation of our democracy and is something which has to be considered and resolved.



What's the background?

Despite the fact that Trump is no longer president, the Senate will begin the impeachment trial on Feb. 8, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

However, the effort will unlikely end in Trump's conviction because the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for conviction, meaning 67 senators would have to vote in favor of convicting Trump. The Senate is currently split 50-50, which means 17 Republicans would have to support conviction.

In Trump's first Senate trial, Romney was the only Republican senator who voted for conviction.

Meanwhile, other Democratic lawmakers have suggested leveraging the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment to bar Trump from ever holding office again.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitt-romney-impeachment-trial-trump-necessary-truth-and-justice,2021-01-24
Mitt Romney says he is 'sickened' by what he read in the Mueller report — here's his full statement,"Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) released a scathing statement Friday condemning dishonesty that was documented in the Mueller report.

""It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice,"" Romney said in the statement. ""The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on.""

""Even so,"" he continued, ""I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia — including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine.""

""Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders,"" he concluded.

The Mueller report was released in a redacted form on Thursday, with Democrats reacting by emphasizing sections damaging to the Trump administration, while Republicans pointing to the lack of conclusive evidence of collusion.

Some Democrats, like presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called for impeachment proceedings to begin as a result of the Mueller report, but the leadership appears to be very reticent to do so.

Mitt Romney takes shot at Obama after Russia launches invasion of Ukraine: 'The '80s called',"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) released a blistering statement late Wednesday after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What did Romney say?

Noting that Russia's invasion is the ""first time in 80 years that a great power has moved to conquer a sovereign nation,"" Romney said in a statement that Russia was emboldened by ""tepid"" responses by the U.S. in response to previous Russian aggression.

""Putin’s impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided ‘reset,’ and the shortsightedness of ‘America First,'"" Romney said, referring to foreign policy initiatives of the Obama and Trump administrations.

“The ’80s called’ and we didn’t answer,"" he added, taking a direct shot at former President Barack Obama.

By invoking an unanswered call from the 1980s, Romney was referring to a pivotal moment in the 2012 presidential election. In March 2012, Romney described Russia as America's ""number one geopolitical foe."" Democrats seized on the remark as evidence that Romney was unprepared for the presidency because he lacked the foreign policy experience necessary for the job.

Obama then pounced during the final presidential debate. After Romney acknowledged the threat of al Qaeda, Obama delivered what may have been one of the most memorable and effective one-liner — ever — in a presidential debate.

""I’m glad that you recognize that al-Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years,"" Obama told Romney at the time.

Election 2012 | Obama to Romney: Cold War Is Over - Third Presidential Debate | The New York Times www.youtube.com

Romney's remarks — and the critical debate moment that helped cement Obama's re-election — have been revisited several times over the last decade, especially when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and after Russia engaged in cyber-manipulation of the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

Although Democratic strategists have since admitted that Romney was correct or ""had a point,"" the biggest mea culpa came from CNN analyst Chris Cillizza on Tuesday. Cillizza called the 2012 debate moment a ""mic drop"" — but now he admits Romney was right.

In an essay published on Tuesday with the headline ""It's time to admit it: Mitt Romney was right about Russia,"" Cillizza wrote, ""What looked like a major flub during the 2012 campaign — and was used as a political cudgel by Obama — now looks very, very different."" Earlier in the essay, Cillizza defined ""different"" by saying, ""And by 'different,' I mean 'right.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitt-romney-takes-shot-at-obama-after-russia-launches-invasion-of-ukraine-the-80s-called,2022-02-24
MLB is investigating an umpire over a deleted Trump tweet on impeachment,"Major League Baseball is investigating an umpire over a tweet he posted and deleted about the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump.

""I would say it's a joke or this is rediculous [sic], but it's way more than that. We have a political party trying to overthrow a president by lying, hiding, creating and manufacturing crimes,"" the tweet from longtime umpire Rob Drake reportedly read.

""Where do we live? This is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! This isn't Russia, Venezuela, Cuba,"" he added.

In another tweet, Drake allegedly tweeted that he was going to purchase an AR-15 rifle, ""because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL [sic] WAR!!! #MAGA2020"".""

Drake, 50, has been an umpire for the MLB since 1999. He deleted the tweets and then his account soon after they gained attention.

In another tweet, he referenced the ""birther"" theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.

Democrats have used accusations of an improper quid pro quo demand from the president to the president of Ukraine in order to fuel their impeachment inquiry. Republicans have accused the Democrats of abusing congressional power to attempt to unseat the president purely for political reasons.

The Major League Baseball Umpires Association said in a statement Wednesday night that Drake chose the ""wrong way"" to express himself while showing support for all umpires.

"Russian mom in Wisconsin paranoid over Ukraine war strangled 8-year-old son to death, tried to drown 11-year-old son, prosecutors say","A Wisconsin mother with Russian heritage ""amped up"" over Russia's war in Ukraine strangled her 8-year-old son to death one day after trying to drown her 11-year-old son, prosecutors said this week.

Natalia Hitchcock, 41, of Sheboygan Falls, has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide and attempted first-degree intentional homicide for the heinous crimes, WTMJ-TV reported.

In a media release last week, the Sheboygan Falls Police Department confirmed that the victim, 8-year-old Oliver Hitchcock, had passed away from his injuries after being choked unconscious a few days before.

Police responded to Hitchcock's apartment home on March 30 after the suspect's husband and the victims' father called 911 to report the possible stabbing of an 8-year-old and a woman who wanted to kill herself.

When officers arrived, the father, who was noticeably upset and emotional, directed them to the living room, where the boy was lying on the ground unconscious with bruising around his neck. The child reportedly later gained a pulse and was taken to a hospital for treatment, but ultimately did not survive his injuries.

According to a complaint, the father said he was awakened from a nap by his eldest son, who then told him that his brother was lying lifeless in his bedroom. The father claims he carried his son's body to the living room, where he began performing CPR while his wife walked around the house in a daze, knife in hand.

The father said his wife had become ""amped up"" and delirious while watching coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and threatened violence against the entire family. He added that his wife of 15 years began taking Tylenol and drinking vodka, both uncharacteristic of her, but told police that she had never exhibited signs of mental illness prior to the incident.

NBC News reported that Hitchcock waived her Miranda rights and admitted to violently attacking her children and stabbing herself repeatedly with a knife.

According to charging documents, Hitchcock told police that she had been unable to concentrate for the past five days and was in fear that her children would be taken away from her. At the time of her arrest, a ""critical"" amount of Tylenol was detected in her system.

""She also said that people had been looking at her strange and felt that people looked at her as a Russian spy,"" the complaint read, adding that she was worried ""people from the dark web were going to take her kids away and do bad things to them.""

""She advised that she believed it best to take [her youngest son's] life because he was the youngest and most vulnerable,"" the charging document read, according to Law & Crime. ""She said that she believed [he] would not have been able to defend himself if he had gotten abused and she thought it better to kill him rather than watch him be abused.""

As for her eldest son, Hitchcock said she dunked his head under water in a bathtub ""to scare him so that he would understand his life was in danger.""

Hitchcock is currently in custody on a $1 million bond.

During her first court appearance, she turned to her husband with tears in her eyes and said, ""I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-paranoid-over-ukraine-war-strangles-son,2022-04-08
"Mondaire Jones, Republicans, emboldened Russia","Progressive Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) said that Russia ""has been emboldened by"" GOP assaults against American democracy. The freshman lawmaker also described President Joe Biden as ""a very strong president.""

""I think the Russian Federation has been emboldened by Republican attacks on our own democracy here domestically,"" Jones told reporter Kevin Frey.



The congressman said that ""despite Donald Trump, when he was president, having a very cozy, encouraging relationship"" as it pertains ""to Vladimir Putin and his antics, we've got a very strong president in Joe Biden today.""



A Washington Post-ABC News poll of adults in the U.S. found that 48% believe that American leadership on the world stage has become weaker during Biden's tenure, while just 23% believe it has grown stronger, and 26% think it has stayed around the same. The poll was carried out Feb. 20 to 24.



The eyes of the world are on Ukraine, where Russia has mounted an invasion against the sovereign nation, wreaking death and destruction as Ukrainians bravely risk their lives to fight back against the Russian onslaught.

The U.S. has condemned Russia and levied sanctions. President Biden has said that U.S. troops will not intervene in Ukraine, though he has declared that America will defend NATO allies.

Rep. Jones is an advocate for adding seats to the U.S. Supreme Court, a move critics commonly describe as court packing.



""The only way to restore integrity to the Supreme Court is to expand it. Congress must do exactly that, before it's too late,"" the congressman said in a statement while applauding President Biden's decision to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill the high court vacancy that will be created by Justice Stephen Breyer's upcoming retirement.

Jones said that he is ""clear-eyed about the continuing threat the far-right, 6-3 majority on the Court poses to our democracy and fundamental freedoms. While Judge Jackson will bring a much-needed voice to the bench, her nomination will not change the balance of power on the Court.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mondaire-jones-republicans-russia,2022-02-26
Former Trump official forces Adam Schiff to answer for Steele dossier in fiery debate on 'The View',"Former Trump State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus forced Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to answer some tough questions about the Steele dossier during his appearance on ""The View"" Tuesday.

Schiff was on the show celebrating the passage of a massive spending bill by the Democrats while marketing his new book about the events of the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

""You've been really prolific over the past few years being the head of the Intel Committee, and you defended, promoted, you even read into the congressional record the Steele dossier,"" said Ortagus.

""And we know last week the main source of the dossier was indicted by the FBI for lying about most of the key claims in that dossier,"" she continued. ""Do you have any reflections on your role in promoting this to the American people?""

""Well first of all whoever lied to the FBI or lied to Christopher Steele should be prosecuted, and they are,"" Schiff responded.

""And unlike in the Trump administration if they are convicted, they should go to jail, not be pardoned. So, [former President] Donald Trump pardoned Roger Stone for lying, he pardoned Michael Flynn for lying. If people lied to the FBI they should go to jail,"" he added.

""But at the beginning of the Russian investigation I said that any allegations should be investigated, we couldn't have known for example people were lying to Christopher Steele. So it was proper to investigate them,"" Schiff said.

""Let's not forget what we learned in the that investigation. We learned that Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was giving internal polling data, campaign polling data, to Russian intelligence while Russian intelligence was helping the Trump campaign,"" he added.

""And to be clear, he was fired, halfway through the campaign,"" Ortagus interjected.

""Well he may have been fired,"" laughed Schiff, ""but the effort to get Russian help continued, and even beyond the effort to get Russian help.""

""But you may helped spread Russian disinformation yourself for years, by promoting this,"" Ortagus interrupted, ""I think that's what Republicans and people who entrusted you as the Intel Committee chair are so confused about your culpability in all of this.""

""Well I completely disagree with your premise,"" Schiff replied.

""It's one thing to say that allegations should be investigated, and they were, it's another to say that we should have foreseen in advance that some people were lying to Christopher Steele, which is impossible of course to do,"" he added.

""But let's not use that as a smokescreen to somehow shield Donald Trump's culpability, for inviting Russia to help him in the election, which they did, for trying to coerce Ukraine into helping him in the next election, which he did,"" Schiff continued.

""Into inciting an insurrection, which he did. None of that is undercut, none of that serious misconduct is in anyway diminished by the fact that people lied to Christopher Steele,"" he said.

""No, I just think your credibility is,"" Ortagus said.

""Well, I think the credibility of your question is in doubt,"" he replied.

The crowd applauded wildly at the conclusion of the debate between Ortagus and Schiff.

Ortagus was referring to the FBI arrest of U.S.-based Russian analyst Igor Danchenko for allegedly lying about the sources of some of the information in the dossier when he was interrogated by the FBI in 2017.

Morgan Stanley analyst directly blames Biden's 'excessive' fiscal stimulus for surge of inflation,"An analysis of the economy by Morgan Stanley put the blame directly on the ""excessive"" fiscal stimulus spending by the Biden administration for the surge of inflation that is hurting so many Americans.

Michael Wilson led a team of analysts in the assessment released on Monday.

""In summary, the slack created by the covid recession is being absorbed much faster than usual. While some of this absorption is due to the supply disruptions created by the lockdowns, we think it was more so due to excessive fiscal stimulus provided during the pandemic, particularly the last $1.9T package at the end of March 2021 just as the economy was already emerging from the lockdowns,"" the analysis read.

""In our view, this was what turbocharged consumption and drove inflation to 40-year-highs,"" it continued.

""In other words, we created too much demand for the supply chains to handle. The fact that the supply chains had been impaired to some degree only exacerbated the shortages and inflation, especially for consumer goods,"" they concluded.

The stock market has been plummeting in the last month as inflation worries crush investors' hopes of companies' earnings justifying their valuations.

The analysis from Wilson predicted that the market will continue to plummet before hitting a floor.

Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson responded to the assessment by pointing to a poll from March 2021 that showed voters were very concerned about the massive spending leading to inflation.

""Voters at the time were more worried about this possibility than many of our elected officials were,"" tweeted Anderson.

More recently, voters have indicated in polling that they blame Biden's spending policies for inflation more than the pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine, or supposed corporate greed. Biden has responded to the crisis by claiming that fighting inflation is his first priority.

Morgan Stanley CEO issues odds on whether US will fall into recession: 'It’s going to be bumpy',"Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman disclosed Monday that he believes the United States is at risk of recession, placing the probability at 50%.

""It’s possible we go into recession, obviously, probably 50-50 odds now,"" said Gorman, who was speaking at a conference hosted by his bank.

Gorman also appeared to take a shot at the White House, explaining that ""it was inevitable this inflation was not transitory."" The Biden administration claimed for months, beginning last year and into the early part of 2022, that inflation was transitory. But the heated economy always had a ""legitimate recession risk,"" Gorman explained.

""I used to think it was about 30%. It’s probably more like 50% now — it’s not 100%,"" he said. ""It behooves you to be a little cautious.""

Even if the U.S. economic tanks into a recession, Gorman predicted that a recession would not be ""deep or long.""

""I don’t think we’re falling into some massive hole over the next few years; I think eventually the Fed will get hold of inflation,"" he said. ""You know that it’s going to be bumpy; people’s 401(k) plans are going to be down this year.""

The prediction comes as gas prices remain at record highs. As of Tuesday, the average price of gas is $5.02 per gallon, a new daily record. Meanwhile, inflation — which decreases the purchasing power of every dollar — is continuing to increase. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed last week that the consumer price index is up 8.6% year-over-year in May, a 40-year high.

Officials say Ukrainian Neptune missiles sank Russia's Moskva – largest warship lost in combat since WWII. Russian state TV host warns conflict has 'escalated into World War III.',"Russia suffered a major loss on Thursday after Ukrainian Neptune missiles reportedly destroyed the Moskva warship.

Russia denies the warship was destroyed by a missile

A senior U.S. defense official confirmed on Friday that Russia's Moskva warship was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles in the Black Sea approximately 60 miles off the coast of Odesa. The missile strike allegedly caused a ""significant explosion"" that ultimately sank the large cruiser. The official said there are likely casualties.

The Russian defense ministry claimed an unexplained fire broke out on the ship and an explosion was triggered from ammunition onboard. Russia's defense ministry said ""the vessel is seriously damaged"" and ""the entire crew have been evacuated,"" the BBC reported.

The Kremlin asserted that while the damaged warship was being towed to a port that Moskva ""lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull."" The Russian defense ministry stated, ""Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank.""

Moskva is believed to be the largest warship to be lost in combat since World War II.

The Moskva is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet

The Moskva is a 611-foot-long, 12,500-ton missile cruiser with a crew of almost 500. Coincidentally, the Moskva was built in the 1970s at the Mykolayiv Shipyard in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. Originally, the ship was named ""Slava,"" which means ""glory."" The ship was renamed ""Moskva"" after the fall of the Soviet Union. The warship was the third largest vessel in Russia's active fleet.

Popular Mechanics reports, ""The Slava-class cruisers were built to hunt down aircraft carriers in the event of a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which was headquartered in the Soviet Union.""

The Slava-class cruiser is equipped with Vulkan anti-ship missiles, 16 long-range cruise missiles, anti-submarine, mine-torpedo weapons, and triple-tiered, 360-degree anti-air defense coverage.



""In addition to medium- and short-range defenses, it could engage six short-range close-in weapon systems (CIWS) as a last resort,"" the BBC reported.

""The CIWS system can fire 5,000 rounds in a minute, essentially creating a wall of flak around the cruiser, its last line of defense,"" naval expert Jonathan Bentham from the International Institute for Strategic Studies told the outlet.

The Moskva – which had undergone two modernizations during its time in service – has been involved in several Russian military campaigns, including being deployed in the Syrian conflict in 2015.

The Moskva was a floating command center that provided long-range and mobile air defense protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet during the invasion of Ukraine.

""The ship’s primary mission was air defense, according to the Pentagon, though the Moskva was also equipped with anti-ship missiles and had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, like those that have battered Ukrainian targets for weeks,"" the New York Post reported.

Losing the Moskva is a 'massive blow' to Russia

Alessio Patalano – professor of war and strategy at King's College in London – told CNN that losing the Moskva would be a ""massive blow"" to Russia.

""Ships operate away from public attention and their activities are rarely the subject of news,"" Patalano said. ""But they are large floating pieces of national territory, and when you lose one, a flagship no less, the political and symbolic message – in addition to the military loss – stands out precisely because of it.""

Retired Adm. James Foggo – who commanded U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa – told Morning Edition, ""This is a terribly humiliating blow to the Russian navy, and it's rather astonishing that they could allow this to happen to themselves.""

Ukraine uses a new kind of missile to defend its country

Odesa state regional administrator Maxim Marchenko claimed in a post on Telegram that Ukrainian forces had attacked the Moskva with Neptune cruises missiles.

Popular Mechanics details the Neptune missile:



The Neptune missile is a Ukrainian subsonic, low-altitude anti-ship cruise missile. The missiles are based on the Cold War-era SS-N-25 ""Switchblade,"" which was so closely modeled on the American AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, it was derisively nicknamed “Harpoonski.” After the Cold War, Russia fielded newer versions of the missile as the Kh-35, while Ukraine went on to develop the Neptune , which has a range of 190 miles and packs a 330-pound, high-explosive warhead.

The Guardian reported, ""The whole system comprises a truck-based mobile launcher, four missiles, a reload vehicle, and a command and control vehicle. It is designed to fly close to the surface of the sea to avoid detection.""



The Neptune missile has a range of nearly 200 miles and became operational just last year.

Russian state TV host warns of World War III

Russian state TV host Olga Skabeyeva recently said that Russia is now ""fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself,"" according to The Independent.

“Otherwise, on the whole, it's impossible to accept the special operation which we started – Russia’s special operation in Ukraine,"" she continued.

""One can safely call what it has escalated into World War III,"" she said on Russian state-owned TV. ""That's absolutely for sure.""

“Right now, we’re definitely fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself. We need to recognize that,"" Skabeyeva added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/moskva-warship-russia-ukraine-neptune-missle,2022-04-16
Study confirms media coverage of Trump is 'more hostile than normal' and ignores good economic news,"Your suspicions of media bias are likely correct.

A new study by the Media Research Center confirms that broadcast news coverage of President Trump has been ""more hostile than normal"" since the Democrats' impeachment inquiry began, while nearly ignoring favorable economic news, and dedicating positive coverage to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son's dealings with Ukraine.

The researchers at MRC studied all media coverage of the president on the networks' evening newscasts, including NBC's ""Nightly News,"" ABC's ""World News Tonight,"" and CBS' ""Evening News"" and found that the overwhelming majority of it has been negative since the inquiry began on September 24.

In a memo summarizing the findings, MRC editor Rich Noyes wrote that ""out of 684 evaluative comments included in these broadcasts, a whopping 96 percent have been negative, vs. a meager four percent that have been positive."" Meanwhile, Noyes added that despite strong economic news in recent weeks, ""the President's handling of the economy was given a stingy 4 minutes, 6 seconds of airtime during these six weeks, or less than one percent of all Trump administration news""

Networks relying on anonymous sources

To determine the partiality of news coverage, the MRC analysts compiled all explicitly evaluative statements about the president or the administration from reporters, anchors and third parties. They did not include valuations from partisan sources or neutral statements.

MRC found that from September 24 to November 5, the networks dedicated 398 minutes of coverage to the Ukraine scandal, or more than three-fifths of the 645 minutes of news about during administration during the period. However, the analysts also concluded that 59 percent of the networks' impeachment coverage has relied on anonymous sources.

""Out of 172 news reports, a large majority (59%) relied on unnamed sources for their facts about the impeachment probe,"" said Noyes, adding it ""is slightly higher than when we first checked in late October, when 57 percent of impeachment stories used anonymous sources."" He said the networks use of leaks and anonymous sources is likely due to the fact that the early impeachment inquiry developments happened behind closed doors.

Coverage of ISIS raid was negative, too

Although the networks' coverage of the U.S. mission against al-Baghdadi was mostly positive, MRC notes that most of the coverage surrounding Trump's role in the raid was negative. ""Out of nine evaluative statements about the President himself, two-thirds (67%) were negative,"" said Noyes.

MRC's analysts found that, when it came to Trump, the networks focused on the president's refusal to brief congressional leaders and his characterization of the ISIS terrorist's last moments. A notable example cited by Noyes is NBC's Courtney Kube speculation during the October 27 broadcast of Nightly News that Trump's ""bellicose language about the manner in which [al-Baghdadi] died could actually inspire some ISIS fighters to retaliate.""

Boosting Biden?

Noyes found that the media's heavy focus on the congressional impeachment inquiry could be cutting in favor of the lackluster 2020 Democratic field. ""To determine the partiality of news coverage, the MRC analysts compiled all explicitly evaluative statements about the president or the administration from reporters, anchors and third parties. They did not include valuations from partisan sources or neutral statements.""

When it came his Ukraine dealings, MRC reported that former Biden has actually received the best press of his campaign, with 71 percent of the coverage being positive.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mrc_study_trump_media_coverage_negative_inquiry,2019-11-16
"MSNBC anchor says world cares about Ukraine because it is white, Christian: 'A lot of soul searching that we need to do'","MSNBC host Joy Reid claimed Monday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is receiving worldwide attention because Ukraine is largely white and Christian.

What did Reid say?

During a monologue on her show ""The ReidOut,"" Reid highlighted the Yemen Civil War, which is widely viewed as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

As Reid explained, the Yemen war, which the U.S. has been involved in by supporting Saudi efforts, has resulted in a significant humanitarian crisis, resulting in millions of displaced people and hundreds of thousands of deaths, according to the United Nations.

But, Reid observed, ""we haven't witnessed the same type of solidarity for the Yeminis as we do for the Ukrainians,"" citing sanctions and global companies taking a stand.

""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,"" Reid continued, before playing clips of reporters making comments about the Ukraine war that she found objectionable.

""OK, let's face it. The world is paying attention because this is happening in Europe,"" Reid claimed. ""If this was happening anywhere else would we see the same outpouring of support and compassion?""

""Well, we don't need to ask ourselves if the international response will be the same if Russia unleashed their horror on a country that wasn’t white and largely Christian — because Russia has already done it in Syria,"" she claimed.

""This is a teachable moment for us in the media. We're not afraid to call out our industry,"" Reid continued. ""There is a lot of soul searching that we need to do in western media about why some wars and lives seem to matter more than others. And why some refugees get the welcome mat while others get the wall.""

Anything else?

CNN host Fareed Zakaria disagrees with Reid's assessment, and explained over the weekend precisely why claims like Reid's are wrong.

According to Zakaria, Russia's full-scale war is not the same as other wars in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East because Russia is a the largest nuclear power in the world, and its war may not stop with Ukraine.

""It's not — to put it directly to people who think about this and they say, 'Why are Ukrainians, why do we pay so much attention, is it just because they are white?' — no, it is not because Ukrainians are white or European, it's because their aggressor, their invader, is a nuclear armed superpower,"" Zakaria said. ""That if Russia can get away with this, it can get away with invading Poland. It can get away with invading the Baltic states. China can get away with invading Taiwan.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-anchor-says-world-cares-about-ukraine-because-it-is-white-and-largely-christian,2022-03-08
"MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace calls Fox News' Laura Ingraham, others 'chickens**t' during live broadcast — and the left loves it","MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace called Fox News' Laura Ingraham — and apparently her guests John Yoo and Alan Dershowitz — ""chickens**t"" during a live broadcast Tuesday over what Wallace called a ""smear campaign"" by ""cable news"" against Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.

What's the background?

Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, listened to a July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's president — and Vindman testified during a closed-door deposition Tuesday for Democrats' impeachment inquiry against Trump that he ""was concerned"" about what he heard on the call.

Wallace ran a series of clips showing members of the media criticizing Vindman, ending with Ingraham on Monday telling Yoo and Dershowitz that ""here we have a U.S. National security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president's interests, and usually they spoke in English. Isn't that kind of an interesting angle on this story?""

Yoo replied, ""I find that astounding, and, you know, some people might call that espionage.""

'Except those people aren't chickens**t like the three of you'

After the series of clips, Wallace remarked on air, “Except those people aren't chickens**t like the three of you, and they know that he passed a background check that the president's daughter and son-in-law didn't.""

Wallace's guest, Nick Burns — a former U.S. ambassador to NATO — asked her, ""Did you say what I think you said?""

""I don't know,"" Wallace replied with a giggle before adding that Burns ""would never say"" such a profanity and that he was there ""to save us, to elevate us.""

Here's the clip. (Content warning: Language):

Nicolle Wallace calls Laura Ingraham and her guests ""chickens*t"" youtu.be

The left loved Wallace's profanity

A cursory glance at Twitter reactions to Wallace's ""chickens**t"" utterance shows more than a few on the left loved that she dropped that bomb on-air:

Scott Dworkin, co-founder of the Democratic Coalition, called Wallace's profanity ""awesome.""

Rosie O'Donnell thanked Wallace ""for all you do"" and said the MSNBC host was ""speaking truth to insanity — bravo brave u ... you are amazing and so needed.""

A gushing Alyssa Milano prompted her followers to ""watch this video all the way to the end.""

Crooks and Liars tweeted that ""we love foul-mouthed Nicolle.""

Others added the following:

""Nicolle Wallace is my new ALL fav!""

""Nicolle is a #BadASS.""

""Haha...love this!""

""MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace deploys glorious vulgarity to blast rival network.""

Anything else?

Yoo on Tuesday clarified what he said on Ingraham's program, telling the Washington Examiner:

""I want to clear up a misconception of my remarks on the Laura Ingraham show last night. I did not accuse Lt. Col. Vindman of committing the crime of espionage. I have tremendous respect for a decorated officer of the U.S. Army and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. What I was addressing was a report that Ukrainian officials had sought to contact Vindman for advice on how to handle Rudy Giuliani acting as a presidential envoy.""



""I meant to say that this sounded like an espionage operation by the Ukrainians,"" he added. ""I think it deliberately misconstrues my words to say that the separate issue of the phone call between the U.S. and Ukrainian president through the chain of command constitutes espionage by Vindman, or that Vindman is some kind of double agent.""

"Joy Reid's MSNBC show garners worst ratings ever, nearly half of audience has fled since its premiere","The ratings are in, and Joy Reid's MSNBC show is not exactly winning.

The ""ReidOut"" garnered its smallest audience in April after nearly two years in existence, according to Fox News.

Reid's show managed to only entertain 1.1 million viewers on average in April, a measure 31% lower from the same month last year. That figure is also 51% of the viewers the show garnered in its premiere month on July 2020.

The ""ReidOut"" did poorly when measured among the demographic of adults ages 25-54, where the show earned an average of only 124,000 viewers in April. That figure represents the lowest for MSNBC in the coveted demographic during the weeknight 7 p.m. slot since July 2015.

Reid has apparently and unsuccessfully tried to earn greater ratings with more and more outrageous statements calling various Republicans and others on the right racist, sexist, and other unsubstantiated accusations.

In March, the MSNBC host said that the world only cares about the invasion of Ukraine by Russia because the country is white and Christian.

""OK, let's face it. The world is paying attention because this is happening in Europe,"" Reid said at the time. ""If this was happening anywhere else would we see the same outpouring of support and compassion?""

Earlier in April, Reid said she was sick and tired of ""right-wing, Christian nationalist, abortion-obsessed trolls"" asking her to give a definition of the word ""woman"" after Supreme Court justice Ketanji Jackson Brown was unable to do so during her Senate hearings.

Later in April, she accused Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of ""child abuse"" over black children holding political signs against Critical Race Theory at a bill signing.

In her most recent outburst, Reid threatened to leave Twitter over the purchase of the company by billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.

Mueller team claims Manafort lied to prosecutors despite plea deal,"In November, special counsel Robert Mueller announced that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had violated his plea deal by lying. Newly released documents from Mueller's office reveal the extent of those alleged lies.



What do the documents say?

Konstantin Kilimnik was already a known person of interest in the Mueller investigation. Kilimnik is a Ukrainian national who was trained as a linguist by the Russian army and also has a background in Russian intelligence. It was already public knowledge that Manafort had associated with Kilimnik, and in August, Politico referred to him as ""Manafort's man in Kiev.""

According to these new documents, as late as February 2018, Manafort was working on a Microsoft Word document called ""new initiative for peace,"" as part of his efforts to help Kilimnik achieve a pro-Russian peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Crimea is part of Ukraine that had been seized by Russian forces in 2014.

The documents also show that Mueller's team believes that Manafort was in contact with Kilimnik between August 2016 and March 2018. Whatever the two talked about during that time, however, has been heavily redacted.

Additional heavily redacted documents filed by Manafort's own lawyers show that Mueller's team believe that he was coordinating with Kilimnik during the U.S. presidential election, in order to work on a way to resolve the crisis in Ukraine to Russia's advantage. Manafort's lawyers also said that Mueller's team had accused Manafort of lying ""about sharing polling data with Mr. Kilimnik related to the 2016 presidential campaign.""

Manafort was then-candidate Donald Trump's campaign manager from March to August 2016.

Trump has denied ever having knowledge of Manafort's actions, and nothing released from the special counsel's office to date alleges that this is not true. The documents do allege that Manafort had tried to get certain people appointed to positions in the administration, although there is no indication that he was successful.

The documents also allege that Manafort lied about a $125,000 wire transfer, although the details of this particular lie are also heavily redacted.

Murray accuses Petty of supporting massacre of children,"Gun control activist Po Murray has accused Ryan Petty — a man whose daughter Alaina was among the 17 people killed after a shooter opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 — of supporting the massacre of children.

Murray, chair of the Newtown Action Alliance, issued a tweet last week in which she claimed that people who do not back an assault weapons ban support kids being killed by a school shooter. ""If you don't support the assault weapons ban then you support one of the worst crimes in America --- children being massacred by a shooter with an AR15 in an elementary school,"" she tweeted.

Petty noted that he is not in favor of such a ban, and asked Murray whether she thought that he supported the massacre of kids.

Murray answered with an emphatic, ""YES!""

""You are a hack and a grifter. Your moronic gun free zones are why my daughter is dead. You shall not infringe on our right to protect ourselves & our loved ones. Go crawl back under a rock,"" Petty tweeted.

Murray, who has claimed that President Joe Biden's ""approval rating should be much higher,"" noted last week that she voted in Florida's 2022 gubernatorial election contest for Democratic candidate Charlie Crist.

She has accused ""MAGA Republicans"" of not caring whether children are killed by school shooters bearing AR-15s. ""MAGA Republicans don’t care if your kids are hunted & massacred by criminals with AR15s in schools,"" Murray tweeted.

She has also claimed that GOP figures who oppose gun control bear responsibility for violent crime in the U.S. and that ""MAGA Republicans"" are supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the nation of Ukraine.

""Republicans who block gun control measures are responsible for violent crime in our nation,"" a tweet declares. ""Don't be bamboozled. Gas prices are up due to the pandemic & the Russian invasion of Ukraine. MAGA Republicans politicized & prolonged the pandemic & they support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s their fault,"" another tweet reads.

The man who perpetrated the Parkland shooting will get life in prison without the potential for parole, though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who is currently seeking reelection, said last week that he thought the shooter deserved the death penalty. ""I think that, ah, if you have a death penalty at all, ah, that that is a case, where you're massacring those students with premeditation, ah, in utter disregard for basic humanity, that you deserve the death penalty,"" DeSantis said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/murray-petty-support-massare-children,2022-10-17
Video: Democrat Nadler lashes out at President Trump as 'a dictator' in speech dripping with hypocrisy,"After what seemed like three interminable days of opening remarks from Democrats in the impeachment trial, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) lost his mind and lashed out at President Donald Trump as ""a dictator"" in his closing remarks before his Senate colleagues.

Nadler accused Trump of declaring himself ""unaccountable"" to the Congress and wanting to be ""all powerful.""

""He does not have to respect the Congress. He does not have to respect the representatives of the people. He is a dictator. This must not stand and this is another reason why he must be removed from office,"" Nadler said, visibly trembling, as he concluded his remarks.

Nadler is referring to Trump administration officials not complying with House subpoenas that the White House claims are unconstitutional, but his comments are misleading and ignore that members of his own party have also refused to comply with congressional requests for documents and testimonies.

Nadler fudged the truth

The congressman from New York fudged historical facts by saying Trump ""is an outlier"" as the ""first and only president to declare himself unaccountable and ignore subpoenas backed by the Constitution's impeachment power.""

This is not true. Richard Nixon openly defied congressional subpoenas in the Watergate investigation, even after courts ruled he had to comply with House investigators' demands for documents and tapes. Conversely, Trump appealed the Democrats' subpoena requests to the courts and House Democrats impeached him for ""obstruction of Congress"" even before the Judiciary ruled on the matter.

We don't have to go as far back as the 1970s. When congressional leaders subpoenaed documents from the Obama administration pertaining to the Fast and Furious scandal, just as Trump did with the Democrats' Ukraine investigation, Obama claimed he had executive privilege and refused to hand them over. The matter was not resolved in the courts until last year.

What about Biden?

By Nadler's standards, Joe Biden would also be considered ""a dictator.""

When the former vice president was asked by the Des Moines Register last month if he would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed, Biden said he would not, as his presence would only ""[t]ake the focus off"" Trump.

""You guys are going to cover for three weeks anything that I said. And (Trump's) going to get away. You guys buy into it all the time. Not a joke … Think what it's about. It's all about what he does all the time, his entire career. Take the focus off. This guy violated the Constitution. He said it in the driveway of the White House. He acknowledged he asked for help,"" he said.

Just this week, Biden doubled-down on his refusal to testify before the Senate. ""They are trying to turn it into political theater,"" he said. ""But I want no part of being any part of that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nadler_trump_dictator,2020-01-25
Nancy Pelosi announces formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced Tuesday that the House of Representatives would begin an official impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

Pelosi had been resisting demands from the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party that sought to push for impeachment proceedings.

Critics of the president have pounced on a recent accusation from an anonymous government source that the president made improper demands of a foreign leader in order to bolster their demands for impeachment.

On Tuesday, Pelosi finally relented on those calls.

""The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution,"" Pelosi said, ""especially when the president says, 'Article Two says I can do whatever I want.'""

Nancy Pelosi claims more government spending is 'reducing the national debt',"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defied basic economics on Friday, claiming that increased government spending is ""reducing national debt"" — not contributing to the economic crisis.

What is the background?

The Biden administration began last week blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for growing economic problems, despite inflation and gas prices being issues before Russia invaded Ukraine.

The shifting blame game comes as President Joe Biden begins a renewed push to revive his social spending agenda, which was killed last year when Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) refused to support it. Deflecting blame for economic woes is a strategic political move because a majority of voters believe the economy is heading in the wrong direction and believe Republicans can fix it.

What did Pelosi say?

Speaking at the 2022 House Democratic Issues Conference on Friday, Pelosi regurgitated the Biden administration's talking points blaming Putin for domestic economic problems that existed before last month.

Then Pelosi defied basic economic sense by claiming that spending more money, referring to the Build Back Better Act, lowers debt.

""Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics said that that legislation does not increase inflation. It is non-inflationary because of the way it is written,"" Pelosi said, claiming the multitrillion-dollar BBB Act would save money.

""So when we're having this discussion, it's important to dispel some of those who say, well, ‘Is the government spending' — no, it isn't,"" Pelosi continued. ""The government spending is doing the exact reverse, reducing the national debt. It is not inflationary.""

Pelosi then celebrated Biden for ""breaking records"" of job growth, an assertion that has been thoroughly debunked. While the government added more jobs in 2021 than any previous years, most of those jobs were simply people returning to the workforce after pandemic lockdowns ended. The economy remains at a net loss on jobs when compared to pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.

Is Pelosi correct?

The Congressional Budget Office determined, in fact, that Biden's plan would add $367 billion to the national deficit over the next decade. However, the CBO score said that increased tax enforcement could bring in another $207 billion in tax revenue, leading to approximately $160 billion added to the deficit.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget agreed that after offsets, the BBB Act would add roughly $200 to the national deficit.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve bank in San Francisco determined the American Rescue Plan, Biden's COVID-19 stimulus, is contributing to inflation, an analysis made before inflation reached unfortunate historic highs this year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-claims-more-government-spending-is-reducing-the-national-debt,2022-03-14
Nancy Pelosi now exploring impeachment against President Trump amid Ukraine controversy,"After months of holding back, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now exploring whether the time has come for Democrats to impeach President Donald Trump.

Pelosi has spent the last several days ""sounding out"" impeachment, the Washington Post reported. She was actively busy Monday night gauging support in her Democratic caucus as to whether the House should proceed with the move.

The California Democrat is scheduled to meet with six House committee chairmen Tuesday to further discuss how they should proceed, CNN reported. The Constitution mandates that the House initiates impeachment proceedings.

According to the Post, Democratic aides believe Trump's impeachment is now ""inevitable"" whereas it was previously ""unlikely.""

Indeed, the development is a significant turn of events.

Just earlier this month, Pelosi scolded her party for continuing to push impeachment, which she called a ""divisive measure."" Instead, she urged her party to retreat from impeachment and engage in facts.

However, the tipping point came last week when new controversy enveloped Trump, stemming from a July conversation he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During that conversation, Trump allegedly pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, although Ukraine denied Trump pressured their president.

On Monday, Trump seemingly admitted to pressuring Zelensky. He told reporters that he threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid if Ukraine did not crack down on corruption. The president's detractors characterized the comments as a reference to the alleged corruption of Hunter Biden.

Pelosi's impeachment exploration comes after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) excoriated the Democratic Party over the weekend for inaction against Trump, which she called a ""bigger national scandal"" than Trump's ""lawbreaking behavior.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-now-exploring-impeachment-against-president-trump-amid-ukraine-controversy,2019-09-24
"President Trump's letter to Nancy Pelosi really angered her, and she just responded","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) responded briefly to a scathing letter President Donald Trump sent deriding impeachment, and called it ""ridiculous"" and ""sick.""

""I don't have a reaction. It's ridiculous,"" she said while hurriedly walking away.

""You have no reaction? Why not?"" Raju asked.

""I mean, I haven't full read it. We've been working,"" she added.

""I've seen the essence of it though,"" she concluded, ""and it's really sick.""

The letter from the president lambasted Pelosi and the Democrats for leading the charge to impeach him over charges related to a phone call he made with the president of Ukraine.

""By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy,"" Trump wrote in the letter.

""You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!"" he added.

Democrats will bring two counts in their impeachment campaign, which is expected to go to a vote on Wednesday. It is expected to pass along partisan lines, which would make Trump the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.

""History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade,"" Trump warned in the letter. ""Your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a Star Chamber of partisan persecution.""

Nancy Pelosi ridiculed for 'cringe' St. Patrick's Day recitation of Bono poem supporting Ukraine,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was roasted on social media after she recited what many users said was a ""cringe"" poem written by U2's Bono.

What are the details?

Pelosi read the poem during the Friends of Ireland luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday as an apparent tribute to Ukraine's fight against Russian invaders.

“Oh St. Patrick, he drove out the snakes with his prayers, but that’s not all it takes,” Pelosi began. “With the smoke symbolizes an evil that arises and hides in your heart as it breaks, and the evil risen from the darkness that lives in some men, but in sorrow and fear, that’s when saints can appear. You drive out those old snakes once again, and they struggle for us to be free from the psycho in this human family.”

“Ireland’s sorrow and pain is now the Ukraine and St. Patrick’s name is now Zelenskyy,” she concluded after adding that Ireland native Bono — whose real name is Paul David Hewson — has ""been a very Irish part of our lives.""

Following the poem's conclusion, she proudly remarked, ""How about that?""

What was the response?

Billy Gribbin, communications director for Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-N.M.), wrote, ""This is a Saint Patrick’s day hate crime.""

Radio host Gerry Callahan added, ""It is even worse than you imagined. I can only assume Bono has already gone into hiding or checked into rehab.""

Chuck Ross, reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, added, ""I need a Guinness to wash down the cringe.""

Commentator and Federalist publisher Ben Domenech wrote, ""Is this a prank? Did someone pretend to be Bono and sent her this?""

Author James Surowiecki — a former writer for the New Yorker — added, ""It was somehow worse than I had imagined it would be, and I had imagined it would be pretty bad.""

Liam Stack, reporter for the New York Times, responded, ""Nancy Pelosi introducing this poem: 'Bono has been a very Irish part of our lives.' Extraordinary levels of Irish cringe. This poem brought the snakes back.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-ridiculed-for-cringe-st-patricks-day-recitation-of-bono-poem-supporting-ukraine,2022-03-18
"Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Zelenskyy in Ukraine, vows 'to be there for you until the fight is done'","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this weekend.

This trip makes Pelosi the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the ongoing Russian invasion. NBC News reported that to many, this trip came as a surprise and that it provided further evidence of the West’s growing support for Ukraine’s fight against Russia.

The trip comes as Russian forces continue to refocus their military campaign in the eastern regions of Ukraine and struggle to make any significant territorial gains, while Ukraine’s allies increase their material support of the invaded nation by sending increasing quantities of military supplies.

Despite the influx of material aid, the Ukrainian military is receiving, the Russians are not backing down as it appears that both sides of the conflict are preparing for the conflict to go on for longer.

During a meeting with Ukrainian officials, Pelosi said, “We are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom. Your fight is a fight for everyone, and so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.”

Zelenskyy said he was “very grateful for this powerful signal of support.”

The Ukrainian president also said, “This shows that the United States today is a leader in strong support for Ukraine during the war against the aggression of the Russian Federation.”

Pelosi’s delegation consisted entirely of Congressional Democrats. It consisted of Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks from New York, and Adam Schiff from California.

The delegation’s trip marks the second major visit made by American officials to Ukraine in the month of April.

Earlier this month U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to discuss U.S. aid to Ukraine. In their meeting, the diplomats told Zelenskyy that the U.S. was prepared to provide Ukraine with $300 million in military financing and had also approved a $165 million sale of ammunition, that was not made in the U.S., that would be compatible with Ukraine’s Soviet-era weaponry.

The U.S. and many of its European allies pledge to send shipments of defensive munitions to Ukraine to aid the country in warding off future Russian advances into the country.

Much like the surprise visits by the American delegations, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a meeting with Zelenskyy earlier this month where the two men discussed European sanctions on Russia and Great Britain’s commitment to supplying Ukraine with materials needed for defense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-ukraine-russia,2022-05-01
NASCAR superstar offers donation of 1 million ammo rounds for Ukraine's fight against Russia — a 'wake-up call for America',"NASCAR legend Richard Childress has offered to donate at least 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine amid its fight for freedom against Russian forces, Fox News reported Wednesday.

What are the details?

The former race car driver and team owner told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade on ""Fox & Friends"" that he will donate 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukrainian forces after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for help from around the globe.

""I was listening the other day and heard President Zelenskyy say he didn't want out, he wanted ammunition,"" Childress recalled. ""I called my good friend Fred Wagenhals, who is the Chairman of AMMO, Inc., which is a publicly traded company, POWW, and I said, 'Fred, we gotta help these people. They need ammunition.' And he stepped right up, he said, ‘We’ll do it,’ and now we’re turning our production to this as our number one priority.""

Childress, who serves on AMMO's board of directors, is reportedly worth $250 million.

""This is a wake-up call for America, and why we have to have our Second Amendment,"" he added. ""We have ... 82 million gun owners in America, and to see the people in Ukraine fighting — it's terrible to see the lives that are being lost over there. We have to do all we can, and I felt with Ammo Inc. and myself, we were doing the right thing.""

Childress said that he and Wagenhals are working with the public and private sector in order to figure out the logistics of transporting the ammunition to the needy country.

""We're working with some government agencies, but to get it there quickly, we're going to work through a private company that will be working to get it in there,"" Childress explained. ""The number one ammo they're needing right now over there is the 7.62s, and that's what we're going to be producing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nascar-superstar-1-million-ammo-rounds-for-ukraine,2022-03-03
"National Archives launches official website for Trump presidential library, highlights impeachments","The National Archives and Records Administration went live with the official website for President Donald Trump's presidential library on Wednesday, the same day he left office.

But unlike his recent predecessors, there is a notable difference. The 45th commander in chief does not have a glowing biography, compared to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

What are the details?

The biographies for Obama and Bush are roughly 18 paragraphs each in length, with gushing reviews of accomplishments and no mention of any scandals marring either administration.

Trump's biography, in contrast, comes in at a brief seven paragraphs, two of which are dedicated to his two impeachments. They read:

In 2019 President Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives for abuse of power by soliciting the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and obstruction of Congress by directing defiance of certain subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives. A trial in the U.S. Senate found the President not guilty of the charges brought against him.



In 2021 President Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives for having incited an insurrection against the government of the United States.

It is unclear at this time who wrote the biography for Trump, but the author was likely not a supporter.

As Anthony Clark wrote for Politico Magazine in 2016, ""presidential libraries are perfect examples of just how far presidents will go to control their own legacies,"" while noting that exhibits are typically ""whitewashed"" and created by presidential boosters.

In another break from protocol, the National Archives is also working to publish messages from the personal social media accounts of public officials, including Trump's, who was infamous for his Twitter messages and eventually banned by the platform.

Politico reported Wednesday:

During his presidency, Trump was a prolific tweeter at all times of the day. However, his tweets were largely from his personal account, @realdonaldtrump, which was permanently suspended by Twitter as a consequence of his role in the Capitol riots on Jan. 6. Although personal accounts have not been archived, the National Archives is working to make such accounts of administration officials, including the former president, ""publicly available as soon as possible,"" according to the website.



What else?

According to the Washington Post, plans for Trump's brick and mortar presidential library are already on the mind of the president.

The outlet reported that a top campaign fundraiser for Trump ""said the president has told supporters he wants to raise $2 billion for the library — a far greater sum than has been raised for past presidential libraries — and thinks he can collect it in small-dollar donations from his grass-roots supporters.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-archives-launches-official-website-for-trump-presidential-library-highlights-impeachments,2021-01-21
National conservatives win decisive victory in Italy — Giorgia Meloni set to become country's first female prime minister,"Giorgia Meloni is set to become Italy's first female prime minister, with early official results confirming exit poll suggestions that her national conservative coalition, known as Centro Destra, has won enough seats to gain a parliamentary majority. The Fratelli d'Italia, which Meloni founded in 2012, won just 4.4% of the vote in the 2018 election. It is now Italy's largest party, with over 26%. The coalition to which it belongs received over 43% of the vote in Sunday's election.

Upon learning of her victory, Meloni told supporters that ""Italy has chosen us, and we won't betray her"" and that her party will ""govern for everyone.""

The winning coalition, which will now run the EU's third-largest economy, is composed of Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), former Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's Lega, and former Prime Minister Silvia Berlusconi's Forza Italia.

This victory comes just weeks after the rightist Sweden Democrats made substantial gains in the Nordic country's national elections with the second-largest share of the vote.

Meloni's views, Italian implications

According to Giovanni Capoccia, professor of politics at the University of Oxford, although Meloni's coalition lacks a supermajority to change Italy's constitution unilaterally, it does hold a majority in both Italy's Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.



Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe, suggested on the BBC that the three keywords best used to describe what Meloni stands for are ""ultraconservative values, anti-immigration and nationalism.""



In 2019, Meloni gave a speech to supporters in Rome, declaring: ""I'm Giorgia, I'm a woman, I'm a mother, I'm Italian, I'm Christian! You won't take that away from me!""

Meloni has previously stated she:

supports a naval blockade preventing illegal aliens from the Near East and Northern Africa from flooding into Italy;

opposes gay adoption and the LGBT lobby;

opposed COVID-19 passports;

believes in the defense of ""national interests and popular sovereignty"";

""a just relationship between government and taxpayers,"" emphasizing economic freedom;

seeks to ""protect religious and moral values,""

says ""Yes to the culture of life, no the abyss of death"";

says ""No to the violence of Islam, yes to safe borders"";

would ""pull out of China's Belt and Road Initiative""; and

would ""stay united"" with the rest of the EU as it relates to Ukraine versus Russia.

Luca Tomini, a political scientist at Free Brussels University, told EuroNews that ""what we need to expect is a more Eurosceptic position of the Italian government on several issues. There will be probably a realignment of Italy along with the government of Poland especially.""

The European Union has a fraught relationship with Hungary and Poland, particularly as the eastern European nations have pushed back against Brussels' LGBT policies and emphasized the priority of their own laws and sovereignty.

Earlier this month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, when asked about the Italian election, claimed, ""If things go in a difficult direction — and I've spoken about Hungary and Poland — we have the tools,"" intimating Brussels could financially penalize EU governments that are regarded as in violation of central policy.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki responded, calling Leyen's claims ""scandalous,"" suggesting, ""She said Brussels had the tools to discipline Italy if it created a government that would not be in favor of Brussels. ... Is this the Europe we want? ... The Eurocrats in Brussels dictate what the government should be?""

At the 2020 National Conservatism conference in Rome, in a speech she dedicated to Pope John Paul II and former President Ronald Reagan, Meloni stated that one of the great challenges ""facing us today is defending national identity and the very existence of nation-states as the sole means of safeguarding peoples' sovereignty and freedom.""



""We did not fight against, and defeat, communism in order to replace it with a new internationalist regime,"" said Meloni, ""but to permit independent nation-states once again to defend the freedom, identity, and sovereignty of their peoples.""

Although Meloni and her coalition have been characterized as fascistic, she suggests they are guardians of democracy. ""Whether the false democrats like it or not,"" she said, ""national conservatives in every latitude are actually the only real democrats, because it is only defending the nation-state that we defend the political sovereignty that belongs to the citizens of that state.""

Giorgia Meloni: God, Homeland, Family | NatCon Rome 2020 youtu.be

At a 2022 CPAC convention, Meloni told an American audience: ""Our individual freedom is under attack, our rights are under attack, the sovereignty of our nations is under attack, the prosperity and well-being of our families is under attack, our children's education is under attack. Faced with this ... the only way to be rebellious is to preserve who we are, the only way to be rebellious is to be conservative.""

Leftist panic and outrage



As with the implications of the Swedish election, the results of Sunday's Italian election have not been well received by the European and international left.

Enrico Letta, the leader of Italy's leftist Democratic Party, described the success enjoyed by Meloni's alliance as a ""sad day for Italy and Europe."" Letta indicated he will now seek continued leadership of the party as of its next congress.

Pietro Castelli Gattinara, associate professor of political communication at Université Libre de Bruxelles, told Vox that the rise of popular rightist movements in Europe is ""not that different from what we have been seeing in the U.S. with the radicalization of the Republican Party, what we are seeing in India with President [Narendra] Modi, what we have seen with Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.""

Gattinara suggested such political gains are, in part, connected to and resultant of a ""mainstreaming of far-right ideas, especially with respect to some topics such as ethnic diversity, immigration, and gender issues.""

Meloni as prime minister will, said Gattinara, ""be a reboot of the Berlusconi years ... but with a much stronger attention to some of the issues that are at the core of our far-right ideologies, I think, in particular, in terms of gender equality, in terms of civil rights, abortion rights, in terms of migration, in terms of religion.""

Some have already taken to social media to urge resistance to the new democratically elected government.

Italian writer Roberto Saviano wrote: ""I read #Saviano in trend because the voters of Meloni 'invite' me to leave the country. These are warnings. This is Italy that awaits us. They are already drawing up a first black list of enemies of the homeland, in spite of those who said that Fascism is something else.""

Whereas some have claimed that the conservative victory in Italy signals ""the elected return of Fascism,"" others, including Sara Gonzales, BlazeTV host of ""The News and Why It Matters,"" have indicated that this is instead part of a trend of ""People all over the world ... waking up!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-conservatives-win-decisive-victory-in-italy-giorgia-meloni-set-to-become-countrys-first-female-prime-minister,2022-09-26
"National Security Council found top secret info in Bolton book manuscript, warned classified details must be removed","The National Security Council notified an attorney for former national security adviser John Bolton last week that the manuscript for Bolton's upcoming book ""appears to contain significant amounts of classified information"" that must be removed prior to publishing or any other kind of disclosure.

Three days later, the New York Times reported on the details of the unpublished draft.

What are the details?

A letter from NCS official Ellen Knight to attorney Charlies Cooper dated Jan. 23 was obtained by several news outlets on Wednesday.

Knight warned that a preliminary review of the manuscript of the book, reportedly titled, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,"" appears to contain top secret information that could ""'cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security' of the United States if disclosed without authorization.""

Fox News reporter John Roberts noted on Twitter that the letter ""was transmitted 3 days before the @nytimes article came out.""



CBS News reported that ""Bolton submitted the manuscript to the NSC on December 30 for a standard prepublication review.""

In Knight's letter, she writes, ""The manuscript remains under review in order for us to do our best to assist your client by identifying the classified information within the manuscript, while at the same time ensuring that publication does not harm the national security of the United States.""

Knight adds, ""We will do our best to work with you to ensure your client's ability to tell his story in a manner that protects U.S. national security.""

According to the Times article, Bolton claims in his book that President Donald Trump told him ""in August that [the president] wanted to continue freezing $392 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including [Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden].""

House Democrats are currently seeking to have the president removed from office over allegations that President Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to try to get dirt on the Bidens.

Following the publishing of the Times story, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) declared it is ""increasingly likely"" that Republican senators will vote in favor of calling Bolton as a witness in the upper chamber's ongoing impeachment trial.

The Department of Justice has already spoken out disputing reported assertions made by Bolton in his book, and President Trump has heavily criticized Bolton in recent days while calling the book ""nasty and untrue.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-security-council-found-top-secret-info-in-bolton-book-manuscript-warned-classified-details-must-be-removed,2020-01-29
"NATO and China showcase their latest killer drones, turning page on autonomous ground warfare","October was a big month for ground-based killer drones. The Royal Netherlands Army announced on Oct. 14 that it had begun armed robot trials, deploying four armed and unmanned tanks to Lithuania. China similarly showcased defense contractor Kestrel's ""combat dog"" system in an Oct. 3 video demonstrating the unmanned ground vehicle's carriage by aerial drone and ability to run with a light machine gun.

While UGVs are presently an unreliable supplement to flesh-and-blood ground forces, their development and growing capabilities may signal their future adoption as soulless substitutes.

A new breed of dog

A social media account affiliated with Chinese defense contractor Kestrel released a video earlier this month of an unmanned aerial vehicle dropping off a robotic four-legged dog equipped with what WarZone reported was possibly a Chinese QBB-97 light machine gun, capable of firing 650 rounds per minute.

A translation of the post in which the video first appeared on the Chinese micro-blog site Weibo said, ""War dogs descending from the sky ... Red Wing forward heavy-duty drones deliver combat robot dogs, which can be directly inserted ... behind the enemy to launch a surprise attack.""

The post also suggested that the UGV could ""be placed on the rooftops and work with troops on the ground to ambush enemies inside buildings.""

A longer version of the demonstration shows the Chinese UGV climbing stairs and performing simulated ground operations with human companions.

Kestrel Defense Blood-Wing | Military promotional video #3 youtu.be

The same Chinese defense firm also released a video revealing the doglike UGV's ability to carry a loitering munitions launcher.

Unmanned tanks

Armored UGVs are not unprecedented, but have historically been grossly ineffective.

Russia, for instance, deployed its semi-autonomous Uran-9 tanks in Syria in 2016, which proved to be more trouble than they were worth. The technology is, however, improving.

Janes reported that the Royal Netherlands Army became the first Western military to start operational trials with UGVs.

Lt. Col. Sjoerd Mevissen explained that the four Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry Systems tanks that were deployed with the Netherlands' 13th Light Brigade to Lithuania last month ""have been handed over for experimental use in an operational unit in a military-relevant environment.""

""These are not simply tests on a training ground,"" said Mevissen. ""We are under the direct eyes and ears of the Russians, and as such in a semi-operational environment.

The THeMIS tank's various capabilities are showcased in this video:

General Dynamics announced on Oct. 4 that it would be unveiling the AbramsX, a modified version of the Abrams battle tank. Although it will not be a fully unmanned vehicle, General Dynamics indicated that it will have a ""reduced crew size and AI-enabled lethality, survivability, mobility, manned/unmanned teaming ... and autonomous capabilities.""

Remote-controlled terrors

Killer drones have long been a feature of modern combat. Unmanned aerial vehicles have been on the scene since the 1990s. The Guardian reported that one of their first impactful deployments was in the 1999 Kosovo war, when they were used to identify hidden Serbian positions.

Slate reported that in January 2001, the U.S. armed a Predator drone for the first time, equipping it with a laser-seeker and a Hellfire air-to-ground missile. Several months later, after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the U.S. recorded its first drone kill when, on Nov. 14, 2001, a Predator-launched Hellfire missile obliterated al Qaeda's Mohammed Atef and six of his terrorist allies.

Drones have been shown to be capable of hitting hard and airborne targets as well.

The first UAV air-to-air kill was recorded in 2017, when a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone shot down another with an infrared guided air-to-air missile, but by then drones were already ubiquitous.

This year, hundreds of lightweight U.S. Switchblades have been deployed in Ukraine, where they have been used to strike small targets.

This is the Power of the Switchblade Drone That Is So Scary! youtu.be

Janes indicated that by 2030, over 80,000 surveillance drones and nearly 2,000 attack drones will have been purchased. A 2019 estimate indicated that the biggest purchaser of combat drones over the next decade would be the United States, with over 1,000 prospective purchases. China was a distant second, looking to acquire only 68 drones.

With tensions rising between the U.S. and both China and Russia, as well as smaller international conflicts, those estimates may prove conservative.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nato-and-china-showcase-their-latest-killer-drones-turning-page-on-autonomous-ground-warfare,2022-10-28
NATO Response Force deployed for first time in response to Russian invasion of Ukraine,"For the first time in the history of the alliance, NATO has activated part of its 40,000-troop strong response force to secure member nations near the borders of the Russian-Ukraine war.

At a press conference announcing the unprecedented deployment of troops, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Friday that ""the Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine.""



""We are deploying [the NRF] to ... prevent any miscalculations, any misunderstandings that we are not ready to protect and defend all our allies,"" Stoltenberg said. ""This is something that all allies have agreed to do.""

NATO Response Force troops will deploy ""on land, at sea, and in the air"" in eastern Europe for the purpose of collected defense, Axios reports.

The secretary general explained that while the size of the NRF has tripled since 2014, not all of its forces would be deployed. He also said that NATO countries would be providing Ukraine with arms and air-defense systems at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government.

Stoltenberg told reporters that the eastern flank allies ""are extremely concerned"" with the events unfolding in Ukraine.

""They are close to the fighting in Ukraine, and they also border Russia, and they've seen not only the military buildup and the ongoing war in Ukraine, but also seen the very threatening rhetoric because this goes far beyond Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said.

""Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine. It's a devastating horrendous attack on innocent people in Ukraine, but it's also an attack on the whole European security order. And that's the reason why we take it so extremely seriously,"" he added.

U.S. President Joe Biden has also deployed troops to eastern Europe to secure NATO countries bordering the conflict. The president has made clear that these troops are being deployed as a defensive measure, and they will not be sent into Ukraine to engage with Russian forces.

NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said the activation of response forces was ""historic"" in a statement.



""This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,"" Wolters said. ""These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.""

In a statement released Friday morning, Zelenskyy thanked NATO for its support but requested more from the alliance to defend against the Russian invaders.

""We are alone in defending our country. Who is ready to defend us together with us? Honestly, I don't see any,"" Zelensky said. ""Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of joining NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nato-response-force-deployed-for-first-time-in-response-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine,2022-02-25
Navy says destroyer can't sail because commander won't get COVID vaccine — and his superiors want him gone,"The United States Navy is refusing to deploy a guided-missile destroyer because the ship’s commanding officer is unvaccinated for COVID-19 and allegedly has disobeyed orders related to COVID.

What is the background?

The U.S. military announced a COVID-19 vaccine mandate last year that went into effect in October 2021. The policy does allow for religious, medical, and administrative exemptions.

The ship's commander initially joined a lawsuit last October requesting relief from the mandate religious grounds. The commander then dropped from that lawsuit and filed another lawsuit, along with a Marine lieutenant colonel, in U.S. district court in January alleging their First Amendment rights were violated when they were subject to reassignment for refusing to get the COVID vaccine.

Neither the ship's commander nor the ship he commands has been publicly identified.

What is happening now?

In February, U.S. District Court Judge Steven Merryday issued a preliminary injunction barring the Navy from requiring either plaintiff to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Stars and Stripes reported. The order also prohibited military commanders from taking ""any punitive or retaliatory measure"" against the military officers.

The military responded on Feb. 28 by requesting an emergency stay on the injunction and condemned the court's intervention.

""The order is an extraordinary intrusion upon the inner workings of the military that presents a direct and imminent threat to national security during a global military crisis, and it indefinitely sidelines a Navy warship,"" the military claimed.

The Navy also claimed the ship's commander has endangered his crew and lost their confidence. Capt. Frank Brandon, commodore of Destroyer Squadron 26, claimed the ship commander disregard medical rules after experiencing COVID-19 symptoms last November. Brandon reportedly ordered the commander to get tested for COVID, which resulted in a positive test.

Thus, the Pentagon claimed Merryday's order ""effectively places a multi-billion dollar guided missile destroyer out of commission"" because it is ""forcing the Navy to keep in place a commander of a destroyer who has lost the trust of his superior officers and the Navy at large.""

""If it becomes necessary to deploy an East Coast-based surface ship in response to global events in Ukraine (or elsewhere), the Navy will not deploy the Commander’s vessel,"" the Pentagon said.

How did the judge respond?

Unfortunately for the military, Merryday denied the Pentagon's appeal on March 3.

According to the Navy Times, Merryday accused attorneys for the military of trying ""to evoke the frightening prospect of a dire national emergency resulting from allegedly reckless and unlawful overreaching by the district judge.""



Merryday also accused the military of acting ""as if [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] does not exist or has no application to the military or is a matter subject to the command discretion of the military.""

The question presented in this action and presented by the explicit language of RFRA is whether vaccinating Navy Commander or Lieutenant Colonel 2 over their religious objection, that is, athwart the right of each to the free exercise of religion, is “the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” RFRA establishes that explicit test and places the burden of proof on the government.



Proving the obvious, that vaccination is best for “the force” and necessary for “the force,” fails to satisfy the “to the person” test required by RFRA. The military designs to avoid the “to the person” test, but the statute is unflinching.

Interestingly, attorney Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, the organization representing the plaintiffs, said the military deployed the Navy commander for training exercises just last month.

""When [the Pentagon's response] was filed in court saying the ship is not deployable because they lost confidence in the Commander, the Commander was on board the ship out to sea for two weeks of testing and training for military readiness,” Staver told the Navy Times. “He returned to port last Friday, March 4, after the drills were completed.""

Considering the commander's ship was actually at-sea for more than 75% of the days before the COVID vaccine became available, attorneys for the plaintiffs described the Pentagon's actions as ""petty retaliation and contempt.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/navy-destroyer-can-t-sail-because-commander-won-t-get-covid-vaccine-and-his-superiors-want-him-gone,2022-03-09
"Nearly half of Americans believe impeachment is a partisan witch hunt, according to new poll","A new poll shows that nearly half of Americans believe the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is a partisan-driven attempt to remove the president.

The poll was published by Harvard CAPS/Harris on Friday.

It found that 47 percent of Americans polls saw the inquiry as a biased bid to oust Trump.

However, a majority of 57 percent said that the inquiry has been so far handled properly.

Democrats pushed a successful vote on the impeachment inquiry on Thursday, with not one vote of support from Republicans. The inquiry is based on allegations of improper demands from Trump in a phone call with the president of Ukraine.

The same poll found that only 45 percent of Americans believed the president should be impeached. Another 40 percent said he should not be impeached, while 15 percent said he should be instead censured by Congress.

A separate poll published by Suffolk University for USA Today on Tuesday showed that although a majority of Americans believed the president did something wrong in his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"Never let a crisis go to waste: As Biden bans Russian oil, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg ignore skyrocketing gas prices — and push electric cars","President Joe Biden banned Russian oil and gas imports Tuesday — which he acknowledged will cause already skyrocketing prices at the pump to spike even more.

The Washington Examiner reported that the national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $4.17 — which represents an increase of 10 cents in just 24 hours and a full dollar jump in just one year.

But the historic gas price surge that's hurting every American didn't seem to dampen the enthusiasm of Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who were all smiles Monday at an “Accelerating Clean Transportation” event.

What did Harris and Buttigieg have to say?

“Clean transportation can bring significant cost savings for the American people as well,” Buttigieg said. “Last month, we announced a $5 billion investment to build out a nationwide electric vehicle charging network so the people from rural to suburban to urban communities can all benefit from the gas savings of driving an EV.”

Not incidentally, the average cost of a new electric vehicle was $56,437 in November 2021, Kelley Blue Book said — an increase of 6.2% from November 2020.

Harris — offering her lilting vocal tone as if she was reading us a nursery rhyme — borrowed from John Lennon on the subject.

“Imagine a future: the freight trucks that deliver bread and milk to our grocery store shelves and the buses that take children to school and parents to work. Imagine all the heavy-duty vehicles that keep our supply lines strong and allow our economy to grow. Imagine that they produced zero emissions. Well, you all imagined it,” she said.

Harris added that ""we have the ability to see what can be, unburdened by what has been, and then to make the possible actually happen.""

The New York Post said neither Harris nor Buttigieg specifically mentioned skyrocketing gas prices during their addresses.

Any other dreamers out there?

Also on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki seemed to signal all is well as she deftly parried questions about reviving the Keystone XL pipeline and increasing domestic oil production amid the rapid rise in costs burdening the American consumer.

For some reason Psaki said U.S. oil production in the past year was higher than in former President Donald Trump's first year in office — it isn't clear what that's supposed to prove. Secondly she said U.S. oil production next year will be the highest in history.

“But if we are looking to the future and what we can do to prevent this from being a challenge in future crises, the best thing we can do is reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil because that will help us have a reliable source of energy so that we’re not worrying about gas prices going up because of the whims of a foreign dictator,” Psaki added.

"New book substantiates claim Joe Biden was the ‘big guy’ in shady Chinese deal, expected a 10% cut","A new book detailing the Biden family's array of controversial overseas business dealings provides fresh insight into an infamous meeting the family held with Tony Bobulinski, during which President Joe Biden allegedly greenlit a deal with Chinese business magnates and secured a 10% cut of the venture.

What are the details?

In ""Laptop from Hell,"" New York Post columnist Miranda Devine uses a massive cache of files obtained from Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop to reconstruct the meeting, which took place in 2017 at the Los Angeles Beverly Hilton hotel.

According to an excerpt of the book published by the Post on Sunday, Biden was scheduled to speak at the Milken Institute Global Conference. But in his downtime, he allegedly joined his son, Hunter, and brother, Jim, for a meeting with their prospective business partner Bobulinski to offer a go-ahead for the deal.

On May 2, 2017, at around 11 p.m. Biden — then just months removed from serving as vice president — sauntered into the Beverly Hilton lobby to vet Bobulinski.

Prior to the meeting, Devine wrote, Jim Biden explained to Bobulinski that the meeting would be strictly ""high level."" Hunter Biden added, “We will not go into any detail about the business. I just want my dad to be comfortable with you.”

During the ensuing meeting, Joe Biden and Bobulinski shared their backgrounds, got acquainted with one another, and spoke in generalities about the prospective deal with now-defunct Chinese government-linked energy conglomerate CEFC China.

It reportedly went well and resulted in Biden saying, “My son and my brother trust you emphatically, so I trust you.”

What else?

In the book, Devine explained that Biden was the ""final decision-maker"" and that ""nothing important was done without his agreement.""

And so, with Joe's approval, the plan to incorporate SinoHawk Holdings LLC moved forward. It would be a global investment firm kick-started with $10 million in Chinese money split 50/50 between Biden's business group and CEFC Chairman Ye Jianming.

The book's excerpt outlined a pivotal email obtained by the Post last year that detailed the “remuneration packages” for six individuals involved in the Biden family's business consortium.

In the email, James Gilliar outlined a ""provisional agreement"" for the distribution of equity that included ""20"" for ""Jim,"" ""20"" for ""H [Hunter],"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?”

Bobulinski would later report that the ""big guy"" mentioned in the email was unquestionably Joe Biden, noting that Hunter would often call his father ""the big guy"" or ""my chairman"" in verbal and written communication.

Anything else?

According to Devine, in a follow-up meeting with Jim Biden, Bobulinski was warned to keep Joe Biden away from the details of the deal so that he could publicly claim ""plausible deniability.""

The family was allegedly ""paranoid"" about someone mentioning Joe Biden's involvement, apparently fearing that his connection to unsavory dealings could tank his chances at the presidency.

During the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden claimed that he ""never spoken to [his ]son about his overseas business dealings.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-book-biden-big-guy-10-percent-cut,2021-11-29
Newly elected head of the House Freedom Caucus just introduced a measure to censure Adam Schiff,"The elected next leader of the Freedom Caucus has introduced a motion to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for his conduct during a hearing with the Director of National Intelligence regarding a phone call that President Donald Trump make to the president of Ukraine.

What is this about?

Yesterday during the testimony of Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, Schiff quoted an exaggerated version of Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine which read in part:

I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it. On this and on that. I'm going to put you in touch with people, and not just any people: I'm going to put you in touch with Attorney General of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr. He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him and I'm going to put you in touch with Rudy [Giuliani]; you're going to love him, trust me.



You know what I'm asking, so I'm only going to say this a few more times in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again; I'll call you when you've done what I've asked.



While this was not what the president said, Schiff claimed that it was ""in sum and character"" what he had been ""trying to communicate.""

Trump bashed Schiff in a tweet for this, saying that he should ""resign and be investigated"" and that he was ""a sick man!""

What happened Now?



In a statement on Friday, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said since Democrats had put an impeachment inquiry on the table over this phone call, Schiff's ""blatantly false retelling of President Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president"" was ""inexcusable."" He accused Schiff of ""toy[ing] with the process and mislead[ing] the American public.""

The resolution itself described what Schiff said as an ""egregiously false and fabricated retelling had no relationship to the call itself.""

The House Freedom Caucus selected Biggs earlier this month as its new leader, replacing Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) who will step down on Oct. 1.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-freedom-caucus-chief-censure-adam-schiff,2019-09-27
New Hunter Biden texts appear to show Joe Biden directly involved in setting up Chinese business deal,"As the Hunter Biden laptop story continues to develop, newly revealed text messages purportedly from 2017 appear to show Biden arranging a business meeting with representatives of a Chinese company and his father, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The messages, if accurate, clearly implicate Joe Biden in his family's business dealings with China, contrary to Biden's prior claims. They also corroborate claims made by Tony Bobulinski, a man claiming to be a Biden business associate who says that an email published by the New York Post about a ""lucrative"" deal with a Chinese energy company is ""genuine"" and that Joe Biden profited from this deal.

The text messages, obtained and shared on Twitter by The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis, allegedly show Hunter Biden setting up a meeting to discuss a business deal between the now-bankrupt Shanghai-based China Energy Fund Committee and his father Joe Biden and his uncle James Biden. According to Davis, the text messages are from May 2, 2017, and the meeting took place at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California.



""Mrng plse let me knw [sic] if we will do early dinner w your Uncle & dad and where, also for document translation do you want it in simple Chinese or traditional?"" one message reads.

""Not sure on dinner yet and whatever is the most common for a Chinese legal DOC,"" Hunter Biden replies.

""Chinese legal docs can be both, i'll [sic] make it traditional,"" the reply states.

""Dad not in now until 11 - lets me I [sic] and Jim meet at 10 at Beverly Hilton where he's staying,"" Biden said.

In May 2017, Joe Biden was a featured speaker at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, which was hosted at the Beverly Hilton hotel, placing the former vice president at the same time and place as alleged by these text messages.

""The next morning, on May 3, 2017, Hunter's business partner-turned-whistleblower Tony Bobulinski texted James Biden--Hunter's uncle/Joe Biden's brother--and asked him to 'please thank Joe for his time' for the meeting they all had on May 2 to discuss the China business deal,"" Davis reports.



""Great to meet u [sic] and spend some time together, please thank Joe for his time, was great to talk thx Tony b,"" a message states.



Tony Bobulinski, the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, recently released a statement claiming that his company was a ""partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye [Jianming] and the Biden family."" He spoke out to authenticate an email reported by the New York Post that allegedly came from Hunter Biden's laptop and discussed ""remuneration packages"" for six people involved in a business venture with CEFC China Energy Co.

That email, sent 10 days after the alleged meeting at the Beverly Hilton, discussed a percent equity stake of the deal held in reserve for ""the big guy,"" a reference to Joe Biden, Bobulinski claims.

Joe Biden has repeatedly denied having any involvement in his son's business affairs, claiming he's ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."" He has referred to a Senate investigation into the Hunter Biden emails as a ""desperate campaign to smear me and my family.""

Democrats have questioned the veracity Hunter Biden emails, suggesting the emails may be part of a disinformation campaign orchestrated by Russia to influence the 2020 election. The Department of Justice and the FBI have rejected this assessment.



Bobulinski claims that this email is authentic, that the Biden family arranged a deal with CEFC China Energy Co., and that Joe Biden was paid millions of dollars by this foreign entity with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.



""I've seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I've seen firsthand that that's not true, because it wasn't just Hunter's business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line,"" Bobulinski said in his statement.

""The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China,"" he claimed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-hunter-biden-texts-appear-to-show-joe-biden-directly-involved-in-setting-up-chinese-business-deal,2020-10-22
New poll shows very few Americans support Democrats' impeachment push,"As Democrats ramp up their efforts in the impeachment inquiry, a new poll shows that although most Americans believe the president did something wrong on a controversial Ukraine call, far fewer believe he should be impeached.

The poll was published on Tuesday by Suffolk University for USA Today.

Whether President Donald Trump asked for a ""quid pro quo"" during a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is the central impetus behind the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. The president and his allies have denied any wrongdoing.

According to the poll, 59 percent of respondents said that what the president did on the phone call was wrong.

But of those, only 38 percent said it was an impeachable offense.

Another 21 percent said that the president's actions were wrong, but not worth impeachment.

Only 31 percent of respondents said there was nothing at all wrong with the phone call.

The poll should be a warning to Democrats, especially those in swing districts who could see a backlash by Trump supporters in the 2020 election.

In another question of the same poll, 36 percent said the House should impeach the president, 22 percent said the House should continue investigating, but not impeach. And another 37 percent said the House should drop the investigation altogether.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced on Monday that the House would hold a procedural vote on the impeachment inquiry.

Report reveals 'yet another federal criminal investigation' into Hunter Biden after Joe Biden is confronted,"As the mainstream media are being denounced for squashing the Hunter Biden story before the election, Fox News reported Friday on the existence of ""yet another federal criminal investigation"" into Hunter Biden.

""We have just received word tonight of yet another federal criminal investigation into the Biden family that appears to be focused specifically on Hunter Biden's business dealings with China and his relationship with Burisma Holdings in Ukraine,"" Fox News host Martha MacCallum explained.

She added, ""This is now the fourth federal investigation that has been reported in recent days.""

""It raises a lot of questions about what was going on with Hunter Biden, with his uncle Jim [Biden], and potentially their U.S. and foreign business deals. Who was involved in them? What exactly were they selling? And why, in one instance, was a diamond given to Hunter Biden in return? Where did all the money go? And did they ever compromise themselves? Does China have anything they could hold over the Biden family?"" MacCallum went on to say.

Fourth federal investigation into Hunter Biden revealed www.youtube.com

What are the details?



The New York Times reported late Friday that Pittsburgh-based U.S. Attorney Scott Brady began investigating Hunter Biden earlier this year upon the direction of Attorney General William Barr.

Details were few, aside from the Times reporting that the investigation was spurred by material uncovered by Rudy Giuliani and that the investigation was similar to a criminal probe into Hunter Biden that was concurrently taking place in Delaware.

From the Times:

As federal investigators in Delaware were examining the finances of Hunter Biden during his father's campaign for president, a similar inquiry ramped up this year in Pittsburgh, fueled by materials delivered by President Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Attorney General William P. Barr had asked the top federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh, Scott W. Brady, to accept and vet any information that Mr. Giuliani had on the Biden family, including Hunter Biden. Mr. Brady hosted Mr. Giuliani for a nearly four-hour meeting in late January to discuss his materials.

The development comes just two days after Hunter Biden publicly revealed that he is under federal investigation by authorities in Delaware.

""I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs. I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" Hunter Biden said in a statement, which was released by the Biden-Harris transition team.

What has Joe Biden said?

The former vice president was confronted on Friday about his son for the first time since news broke about the Delaware federal investigation.

""Did Hunter Biden commit a crime? Have you spoken to your son, Mr. President-elect?"" a reporter asked Biden following a press conference.

Biden did not address the question directly, only responding, ""I'm proud of my son.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-report-hunter-biden-investigation-pittsburgh-scott-brady,2020-12-12
MSNBC anchor says the 'dehumanization' of GOP parental rights bills is comparable to Russian soldiers raping children in Ukraine,"MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace said that the ""dehumanization"" of of LGBT children by parental rights bills put forth by some Republican governors is comparable to the war atrocities where Russian soldiers reportedly raped Ukrainian children.

Wallace made the comments on Wednesday while speaking to Bulwark writer Tim Miller about parental rights bills passed by some Republican governors to ban teachers from talking about transgender and other sexual topics in early public school education.

""And I worry that in covering [Virginia Gov.] Glen Youngkin (R) and his politics of parental choice, all the focus was on how well it worked, and even in our conversations about [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis (R), it's about how well they're serving him,"" Wallace said.

""The truth is dehumanization is a tactic for politics is from war, dehumanization is a tactic, that's being used right now, the Russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them,"" she continued emphatically.

""Dehumanization as a practice, is a tactic of war, it's being deployed in politics, and people like you and I sometimes lose the plot, and admits its effectiveness, its, not its substance, but even the analysis of these tactics loses sight of what, of what, this speech bring us back to, which is, dehumanization has a cost right now, right now, as its deployed,"" Wallace added.

""And, and, Chasten Buttigieg made this point when 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was introduced, kids will die!"" she concluded.

Miller agreed with Wallace and registered no opposition to her overheated rhetoric.

""Yeah, I think that’s right,"" Miller responded. ""Their cruelty and inhuman behavior is inexcusable.""

Among the many reports of war crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there have been some unconfirmed claims that Russian soldiers are sexually assaulting children.

Trump tweeted a video to debunk something Biden said about Ukraine. Nickelback got Twitter to pull it.,"The band Nickelback successfully managed to get Twitter to pull a video from one of President Donald Trump's tweets due to copyright violation over the use of its music. The video itself claimed to disprove an assertion by former Vice President Joe Biden regarding his son's dealings in Ukraine.

What was in the video?

The original video used a popular parody of the Nickelback song ""photograph"" to target Biden. In it, while the song urges ""look at this photograph"" it showed a photo of former Joe and Hunter Biden at a golf course, along with a man named Devon Archer who was labelled as a ""Ukraine gas exec.""

The video also includes a video of Joe Biden insisting that he had never talked with Hunter about Hunter's role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm called Burisma holdings. This claim by Biden has already been undermined by his own son, Hunter Biden, who said in a New Yorker interview in July that he had discussed Burisma with his father ""just once.""

Image source: YouTube screen capture

Trump tweeted the video on Wednesday afternoon, along with the all-caps caption ""LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!""

But by early Thursday morning, the video had been pulled. In its place, the tweet now shows a gray box with the words ""This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.""

Who was in the photo?



Devon Archer isn't a Ukraine gas executive. He did sit on the board of Burisma Holdings, along with Hunter Biden, but his connection to the Bidens predates that by years.

Before Archer knew Biden, he was friends with the Heinz-Kerry clan. According to an article from last year by Peter Schweizer, in 2009 Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, and Chris Heinz (the son of Teresa Heinz-Kerry) started an investment fund called Rosemont Capital. This collaboration predates Hunter joining the board of Burisma in 2014. Archer had joined the board of Burisma shortly before Biden.

The photo itself, according to Fox News, which first obtained it, was taken in August 2014, not long after both Biden and Archer had joined the board of Burisma. The New Yorker reported in July that Archer had convinced Hunter Biden to join the board. Archer himself was convinced to join Burisma by the firm's co-founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, who said that he was looking for international members for the company's board and that he wanted to westernize how the company approached transparency.

Trump, and others, have tried to use this photo to prove that Joe Biden lied about not talking with Hunter about Burisma while he was in office. However, since Hunter Biden and Archer were associated with each other for years before this photo was taken, it hardly presents a smoking gun.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nickelback-gets-video-pulled-from-trump-tweet,2019-10-03
Bombshell: Nikki Haley claims senior officials tried enlisting her to sabotage President Trump,"Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, claims in her new book that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly attempted to recruit her to subvert President Donald Trump.

According to the Washington Post, Haley writes in ""With All Due Respect"" that Tillerson and Kelly confided in her that Trump was unsuited for the office of the presidency and they were resisting his directives in the best interests of the country.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly sought to recruit her to work around and subvert Trump, but she refused, Haley writes in a new book, ""With All Due Respect,"" which also describes Tillerson as ""exhausting"" and imperious and Kelly as suspicious of her access to Trump.



""Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country,"" Haley wrote.



""It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn't know what he was doing,"" Haley wrote of the views the two men held.



Tillerson also told her that people would die if Trump was unchecked, Haley wrote.

Haley writes in her new book that she refused their efforts and noted Tillerson and Kelly both felt threatened by her amicable relationship with the president. The Post reported that Haley said that during her time in the administration she felt obligated ""to carry out [Trump's] wishes since he was the one elected by voters.""

Additionally, Haley recalled feeling unconvinced when Tillerson told her he was resisting the president's decisions because ""if he didn't, people would die…""

'They should've been saying that to the president'

In an interview on ""CBS Sunday Morning"" with anchor Norah O'Donnell, the former governor of South Carolina said she was offended by the two men's comments and that instead of sharing their concerns with her, Tillerson and Kelly should have addressed them directly with the president.

[I]nstead of saying that to me, they should've been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan. It should've been, ""Go tell the president what your differences are, and quit if you don't like what he's doing."" But to undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive.""

As reported by TheBlaze, Haley has also strongly defended Trump from accusations that his dealings with Ukraine merit impeachment during her interview with CBS.

""When you look at that transcript, there is nothing in the transcript that warrants the 'death penalty' for the president,"" she told O'Donnell.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nikki-haley-claims-in-new-book-that-senior-administration-officials-tried-recruiting-her-to-sabotage-trump,2019-11-10
Video: Nikki Haley slams media's bias after CNN's Wolf Blitzer tries cutting her off in an interview,"Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley blasted the media's bias in its coverage of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry during an interview live on CNN on Friday.

In an exchange with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, the Situation Room host pressed Haley to respond to the allegation that President Trump unduly pressured the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation into his political rival, Joe Biden. Haley was having none of it.

""Show me the proof,"" she said, adding ""because I don't see anywhere where the president heavy-handed the president of Ukraine and said 'you have to do this or else.'""

""There is nothing that shows"" Trump did anything wrong

Blitzer then tried to cut Haley off, but Haley stopped him dead in his tracks.

""Look,"" said the former governor of South Carolina, ""I know you all want there to be something wrong, but at the end of the day, there is nothing that shows he threatened or that he held their hands saying 'we're not going to release [the money] until you do this,' and that's the issue."" Adding, ""that's obviously the problem in Congress and why they can't come to a resolution on this.""

The CNN host responded to Haley, ""When you say 'you all,' we just want to report the news, we just want to report the facts, we want to see where this leads...we don't have a political position here in the Situation Room"" as she smiled and nodded.

Slammed again

Blitzer then asked Haley why do current and former Trump aides refuse to testify in the Democrats' public hearings if the president is innocent of the allegations against him.

""I think if the president thought there was a genuine investigation, he would have no problem with them testifying,"" she responded. ""I think he feels like this truly is a witch hunt,"" added Haley, while slamming CNN and the media again. ""He thinks this is just a way for you all to trick everybody into saying something.""

Haley is currently on tour promoting her latest book, ""With All Due Respect,"" which was released on Tuesday, November 12. President Trump has praised Haley and her book on Twitter. ""Make sure you order your copy today, or stop by one of her book tour stops to get a copy and say hello.

In her interview with anchor Norah O'Donnell, Haley said that impeachment for a public official is akin to the death penalty and would be unfair to the president:

""You're gonna impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and– and giving money and it wasn't withheld?"" Haley said. ""I don't know what you would impeach him on. And look, Norah, impeachment is, like, the death penalty for a public official.""

Haley told O'Donnell, ""When you look at that transcript, there is nothing in the transcript that warrants the 'death penalty' for the president.""

The former Trump administration official underscored that the argument for impeachment is weakened by the fact that although the White House asked the Ukrainian government to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, the inquiry never occurred. ""The Ukrainians never did the investigation,"" she said.

Why is Congress making this decision?

Haley added that Americans should have the final word, presumably in the 2020 election, on whether Trump's actions merit him being removed from office.

""[T]here's just nothing impeachable there. And more than that, I think the– the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?"" the former governor of South Carolina said.

"No 'full blown' trial needed for impeachment, Joe Biden argued in 1999","A memo written by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden when he was a senator in 1999 has emerged, wherein Biden informed his caucus that ""the Senate need not hold a 'full blown' trial"" in the upper chamber against former President Bill Clinton.

The document was brought up on the Senate floor Thursday night during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, where the president's lead attorney referred to its contents as ""The Biden Doctrine.""

What are the details?

In the four-page memo obtained by Politico, Biden argued ""the Senate need not hold a 'full blown' trial"" and presented prior impeachment cases as evidence that ""in fact, the Senate need not hold a trial even though the House wishes to present evidence and hold a full trial.""

Biden further argued in 1999 that ""in a number of previous impeachment trials, the Senate has reached the judgment that its constitutional role as sole trier of impeachment does not require it to take new evidence or hear live witness testimony.""

""The public has ability to understand whether it, and its system of government, have been gravely harmed,"" then-Sen. Biden argued in making his case that the voice of the people should be heard. ""Where it (the public) expresses overwhelmingly the view that the President should not be removed from office and expresses this view not in a single poll but repeatedly over the course of a year, this is a constitutionally significant statement.""

Politico noted that ""Biden's comments from 1999 are at odds with current Democratic talking points that additional witnesses must be called to get to the bottom of Trump's actions in the Ukraine saga.""

Report noticed on Senate floor

The Politico report was published at 8:36 p.m. EST on Thursday night, while the Senate trial against President Trump was ongoing and senators were asking questions of House impeachment managers and the president's legal team. News of the memo's contents swiftly made it to the Senate floor.

President Trump's lead counsel, Jay Sekulow, read from Biden's 1999 memo, before declaring to the Senate, ""That was 'The Biden Doctrine' of impeachment proceedings.""

Sekulow pointed out, ""Some members in this chamber agreed with that. Some members that serve as managers also agreed with that,"" referring to Democratic senators and representatives now seeking to remove President Trump from office.

"North Dakota farmer arrested in Ukraine, accused of trying to assassinate a gov't official; his family says he is being railroaded to cover up other crimes","Two sisters in North Dakota spent Thanksgiving without their beloved brother this year — but not because of work obligations, health problems, or any other reasons that one might expect.

Rather, Kurt Groszhans, a self-described ""humble American investor"" and farmer from Ashley, North Dakota, is currently detained in Ukraine under suspicion that he attempted to assassinate the country's minister of agriculture.

But his family insists he is the victim of embezzlement and is now being railroaded to cover up the foreign government official's crimes. Now they are pleading for help from the American government to ensure that their brother is treated respectfully and granted a fair trial.

What are the details?

According to local news outlet, Inforum, Groszhans and a Ukrainian woman named Olena Bohach were arrested and placed in pretrial detention this week for allegedly seeking to arrange the assassination of Roman Leshchenko, the country's minister of agrarian policy and food.

Groszhans, whose family emigrated from Ukraine in 1910, started taking trips to the country in the early 2000s and eventually set up a farming company there. That's when he met and decided to go into business with Leshchenko, who at the time, according to Groszhans was just ""a middle-class entrepreneur in the agricultural sector.""

""He's just a good person, and he just has a passion for farming, and he just loved going back to the country where our ancestors came from,"" his sister Kimberly Groszhans told Inforum in an interview on Monday. ""He didn't do this.""

Groszhans himself claimed in a Medium post published in August that he is a ""deceived American investor."" He described how Leshchenko, who he appointed as the manager of his business, began embezzling funds from his company on his fourth day on the job. The Ukrainian, according to Groszhans, transferred the money into his family's account and also used Groszhans seeds on his family's land.

Groszhans eventually found out and started filing claims against Leshchenko. But while Groszhans was filing lawsuits, Leshchenko was rising to more powerful offices within the Ukrainian government, and eventually, to the office of agriculture minister.





Ukrainian Weekly reported that in the same week that Leshchenko was promoted to minister a lawsuit was filed in the Kyiv Commercial Court by Groszhans alleging Leshchenko had embezzled $430,000 from his company. Leshchenko is quoted in the report as saying he had repaid ""all debts to the American investor.""



In the Medium post, Groszhans says he was asked repeatedly when filing the claims, ""[Do you] understand who you are suing?""

What else?

Groszhans' sisters, Kimberly Groszhans and Kristi Magnusson, told TheBlaze in a phone conversation Friday that they had personally seen WhatsApp messages between their brother and Leshchenko on their brother's phone that indicated he was being threatened by the minister not to continue his legal pursuits.

They also said they have not been able to contact their brother or verify his health and safety since the arrest, neither have Ukrainian officials reported any further detail about where he is being held.

""We are worried about his safety,"" Kristi Magnusson said. It's suspected that his detainment conditions are less than ideal and they worry that a corrupt trial could hinder their brother's pursuit of justice.

The family first found out about his arrest through a friend of Groszhans' who lives in Ukraine. When that friend reached out informing them of Groszhans arrest, they didn't believe them. But when Groszhans didn't respond to message after message, it finally sunk in that their brother may actually be in trouble.

They responded by contacting congressional representatives in North Dakota and the U.S. Department of State. The sisters told TheBlaze that both North Dakota Sens. Kevin Cramer (R) and John Hoeven (R) have assured them that they have asked State Department officials to look into the situation and that they will keep the family abreast of any developments.

Sens. Cramer and Hoeven did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.

The State Department told TheBlaze in a statement, ""We are aware of reports of the detention of a U.S. citizen in Ukraine. We take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad, and are monitoring the situation. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.""

What are the allegations?

According to Ukrinform, which is described as a Ukrainian multimedia outlet, the Department of Strategic Investigations of the National Police received reports of the attempted assassination plot in August and began investigating a Ukrainian woman and a U.S. citizen.

Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky announced the news in a Nov. 18 briefing, during which he called the U.S. citizen, later identified as Groszhans, the ""the main perpetrator of this crime.""

Monastyrsky alleged that Groszhans and Bohach met at a restaurant in July to discuss their criminal plans. There, he said, ""a $20,000 deposit was provided before the crime was committed, and the U.S. citizen was to leave Ukraine after that, and the crime was to be committed after he arrived in the United States.""

""Therefore, a decision was made to detain this person in accordance with Article 208 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine. The U.S. Embassy was informed [about the case], and only after that the victim, Roman Leshchenko, was informed that such a crime was being prepared against him,"" Monastyrsky added, according to the outlet.

Anything else?

Groszhans' sisters say the allegations laid out sound nothing their brother would ever do, but they feel powerless to defend him and don't know where to turn for help.

They have set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds to help with ""unexpected expenses due to the horrific situation our brother is going through"" and promise that ""all money will go towards these expenses to ensure his safety and return.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-dakota-farmer-arrested-in-ukraine,2021-11-26
North Korea codifies right to preemptive nuclear attack,"North Korea’s leadership passed a law this week granting the country the right to launch preemptive nuclear strikes.

The law authorizes the North Korean military to use nuclear weapons “automatically and immediately” in case of an imminent attack against its leadership or “important strategic objects,” reports The Washington Post.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said this law also makes his country’s nuclear status “irreversible” and bars any talks of denuclearization. “The utmost significance of legislating nuclear weapons policy is to draw an irretrievable line so that there can be no bargaining over our nuclear weapons,” Kim told the country’s titular parliament.

Kim also shrugged off western sanctions. ""Let them sanction us for 100 days, 1,000 days, 10 years or 100 years,"" he said. ""We will never give up our rights to self-defense that preserves our country's existence and the safety of our people just to temporarily ease the difficulties we are experiencing now.""

The new legislation serves as a replacement to a 2013 law that first outlined North Korea’s nuclear status. The 2013 law stipulated that North Korea could use nuclear weapons to “repel invasion or attack from a hostile nuclear state and make retaliatory strikes,” writes The Guardian.

Prior to this new law, the United Nations was already warning about serious concerns it had with North Korea's nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, noted earlier this week that North Korea was in the process of expanding key facilities at its main nuclear site. ""The reopening of the nuclear test site is deeply troubling,"" the agency said in a summary of its findings.

This news comes in the wake of reports that Russia has been buying weapons from North Korea to help fuel its invasion of Ukraine.

North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, and now has the capability of delivering warheads to the U.S. mainland, notes The Washington Post. South Korean and U.S. officials believe that North Korea could soon resume nuclear tests for the first time since 2017.

The U.S. will continue to coordinate with allies for “the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” stated a National Security Council spokesperson.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-codifies-right-to-preemptive-nuclear-attack,2022-09-10
North Korea reportedly fires ICBM for the first time since 2017,"North Korea has test-fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time since 2017, according to South Korean and Japanese officials, in a provocative action that was condemned by President Joe Biden.

Japan's Defense Ministry tracked what is believed to be an ICBM, which flew to an altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) and to a distance of 1,080 kilometers (671 miles) with a flight time of 71 minutes before landing in waters near Japan's western coast, CNN reports.

Thursday's missile launch is the 11th test North Korea has conducted this year, including one test on March 16 that South Korean officials said exploded in mid-air. News of the test broke while President Biden is meeting other Western leaders in Brussels for a high-stakes summit to discuss Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The missile launch is the longest-range test conducted by North Korea since the country's dictator Kim Jong Un imposed a moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing during diplomatic talks with President Donald Trump's administration. The resumption of ICBM testing is yet another destabilizing action taken by an American adversary under Biden's watch since the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday to discuss the matter.

""The two Leaders discussed DPRK’s launch of a long-range ballistic missile, which both Leaders strongly condemned, stressed the need for diplomacy, and agreed to continue working together to hold the DPRK accountable,"" a White House official said in a statement, according to The Hill.

Officials from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea have each condemned the missile test.

""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

""This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people. We urge all countries to hold the DPRK accountable for such violations and call on the DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations,"" she continued.



""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions. The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" she said.



The missile test comes two weeks after South Korea elected a new conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is widely expected to be tougher on North Korea than his predecessor, according to CNN.

In response to the suspected ICBM test, South Korea's military conducted exercises, launching several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

""Our military is monitoring North Korean military's movements and have confirmed that we have the capability and posture to accurately strike the origin location of the missile launch and command and support facilities any time North Korea launches a missile,"" the JCS said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-provokes-with-suspected-icbm-test,2022-03-24
NPR reporter goes against own newsroom to call Hunter Biden laptop a legitimate story,"An NPR reporter disparaged her own newsroom for dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop story. It wasn't the first time the reporter called out her employer for labeling Hunter Biden's emails a ""waste"" of time.

Weeks before the 2020 presidential election, the New York Post published bombshell reports about a laptop abandoned by Joe Biden's son. On the laptop, there were reportedly emails that indicated that Joe Biden – while vice president – met with a top executive at Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma – where Hunter was on the energy company's board. There were also allegedly emails from Hunter Biden pursuing ""lasting and lucrative"" deals with Chinese energy company China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC) that he said would be ""interesting for me and my family.""

A little more than a week after the alleged ""smoking gun"" emails surfaced, NPR announced that the news organization would not ""waste"" time covering the accusations because it was a ""politically driven event.""

NPR investigative correspondent Laura Sullivan broke rank with her employer by challenging NPR's decision not to have any journalistic curiosity about the report from the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper.

""Really love it when managers make our jobsharder. I don't know if that's #HunterBiden 's laptop or what's on it, but it's certainly not a 'waste of time' to find out,"" Sullivan wrote on Twitter in October 2020. ""@NPR managers better hope that laptop was built out of an old Russian blender in Ukraine.""

Sullivan knocked her own newsroom again this week for purposely avoiding the Hunter Biden laptop story.

Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald called out legacy media for intentionally ignoring the Hunter Biden email story.

""Most of the national corporate media lied in unison to the country for weeks right before the 2020 election by telling them that completely authentic emails about Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine and China were 'Russian disinformation,' a lie they got from the CIA,"" Greenwald tweeted out on Wednesday. ""Twitter founder Jack Dorsey apologized and admitted it was wrong for Twitter to have censored any mention of the story. The WPost this week called for a media 'reckoning' over what they did. Beyond those 2, they all let their lie stand to this day.""

Sullivan responded to Greenwald by confronting her own newsroom's decision to completely ignore the Hunter Biden laptop story.

""Add @NPR to the list. Newsroom editors called it 'not a real story.' The 'Hunter Biden laptop' investigation may end up being a tax case, a hill of beans, or something else. But what it's always been is a story,"" Sullivan proclaimed.

The New York Times and the Washington Post waited 18 months after the story broke to finally confirm that Hunter's laptop and emails were authentic and not a Russian disinformation campaign – which both outlets previously suggested.

Earlier this month, liberal talk show Bill Maher host accused left-wing media outlets of burying the Hunter Biden email story.

""It looks like the left-wing media just buried the story because it wasn't part of their narrative and that's why people don't trust the media,"" Maher said of the story that was dismissed in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/npr-reporter-hunter-biden-laptop-story,2022-04-09
NPR hit with universal scorn over 'pathetic and insulting' article offering self-care tips for anxiety from war headlines,"An article from National Public Radio was hit with universal scorn because it detailed the self-care people might need in order to deal with the traumatizing headlines from the war in Ukraine.

""Russia’s attack on Ukraine means there’s a stressful news cycle ahead of us. The reality of conflict is always a shock to the system,"" read the tweet from NPR on Friday as Ukrainian citizens were defending their country against an overwhelming Russian invasion.

The article from NPR's ""Life Kit"" offered helpful suggestions about self-care while sitting at home reading about brave Ukrainian patriots dying in the streets to protect their families.

""Maybe this is the time that you finally recreate a family recipe, or maybe you learn how to make a prettier pie, or maybe you just lose yourself to a kitsch reorganization,"" read one of their recommendations.

The article was excoriated universally by those from both sides of the political divide.

""The stupidest thing NPR has ever proposed, and that's saying a lot,"" replied Politico columnist Jack Shafer.

""These people really do not envision their audience as grown adults. And maybe there's a reason for that,"" responded Dan McLaughlin of National Review.

""This sort of discourse drives me absolutely bananas and I think it is a direct result of media being increasingly dominated by people from super-privileged backgrounds,"" opined Jesse Singal in a tweet that garnered over 2,300 likes.

""I'm all for mental health awareness and therapeutic care. This thread provides for neither. It's just a lifestyle guide for narcissists,"" tweeted Daily Beast editor Anthony Fisher.

""Ukrainians: must cope with bombs raining down on them. Americans: must cope with hearing sad news. This is really a silly thing for a news organization to do, IMHO,"" said Yale professor Nicholas Christakis.

""The Ukrainian government is handing out AK-47s and NPR is handing out listicles about holistic ways to alleviate your doomscrolling anxiety,"" mused commentator Noam Blum.

""This is pathetic and insulting. You NEED to be stressed and Distressed by atrocity, calamity and tragedy not breathe deeply and bury yourself in pasta,"" said another critic.

While NPR readers sought for self-care, the Ukrainian president warned on Friday that the fate of his country was to be decided soon as Russian forces appeared ready to pounce on Kyiv, their capital city.

Nuclear disaster site Chernobyl sees spike in tourism thanks to HBO miniseries,"The site where a nuclear reactor exploded in Ukraine 33 years ago is experiencing another boom — in tourism — all thanks to the wildly successful HBO miniseries ""Chernobyl.""

What are the details?

HBO's portrayal of the worst nuclear accident in history has been hailed as some of the best television made in history. ""Chernobyl"" became entertainment review site iMDB's highest rated television show ever , winning over viewers and critics alike.

Since the miniseries launched in May, tour agencies in Chernobyl have seen a marked spike in bookings, according to Reuters.

Multiple local guide companies told the outlet they've seen 30 to 40 percent increases in both current business and future bookings. Curious travelers are offered trips to the plant grounds where the reactor remains entombed, aerial tours, and even the opportunity to dine at Chernobyl's only operating restaurant.

According to the site Chernobyl City, over 38,000 people booked tours of Pripyat (the town where the explosion occurred) in 2016 alone, in spite of the fact that the territory ""still contain[s] a number of hot radiation spots.""

In spite of the influx of tourists flocking to the site, questions remain as to the safety of the area given the magnitude of the radioactive material which remains and the fact that its effects are expected to last a millenium.

Guides say not to worry. Viktoria Brozhko told Reuters, ""During the entire visit to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, you get around two microsieverts, which is equal to the amount of radiation you'd get staying at home for 24 hours.""

But a travel writer for The Telegraph noted just a few years ago that ""Ukrainian officials have suggested that Pripyat will not be inhabitable for another 20,000 years.""

The author further noted that visitors at the site are instructed not to sit down, and are checked for radioactive particles before leaving.

Anything else?

NY Times makes bombshell admissions about Hunter Biden laptop story it once dismissed,"The New York Times has finally admitted that the Hunter Biden laptop story is real.

What is the background?

The New York Post ignited controversy in October 2020 after publishing an explosive story about a laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. The Post reported the laptop belonged to Hunter Biden, son of then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and explained the FBI had seized it in December 2019.

Emails recovered from that laptop, which were shared with allies of then-President Donald Trump, suggested corrupt activity involving the Bidens and Burisma Holdings, a large natural gas company in Ukraine.

When the story broke just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, the media immediately ran interference for Biden, working overtime to cast doubt on the story. Twitter and Facebook even actively suppressed the story on their platforms, decisions that essentially amounted to censorship.

What happened now?

The Times, the so-called ""paper of record,"" published an innocuous story late Wednesday about the ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden with admissions — albeit buried deep in the story — verifying key elements of the story the paper once dismissed.

Specifically, the Times authenticated the laptop emails and admitted that then-Vice President Biden attended a meeting in 2015 that a Burisma executive was slated to attend.

Emails: ""People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors had examined emails between Mr. Biden, [Hunter Biden business partner Devon] Archer and others about Burisma and other foreign business activity. Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.""

""People familiar with the investigation said prosecutors had examined emails between Mr. Biden, [Hunter Biden business partner Devon] Archer and others about Burisma and other foreign business activity. Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation."" Burisma Meeting: ""In another set of emails examined by prosecutors, Hunter Biden and Mr. Archer discussed inviting foreign business associates, including a Burisma executive, to a dinner in April 2015 at a Washington restaurant where Vice President Biden would stop by. It is not clear whether the Burisma executive attended the dinner, although the vice president did make an appearance, according to people familiar with the event.""

Not only did the New York Times refer to the Hunter Biden laptop story as ""unsubstantiated"" as recently as September 2021 — a description the paper stealth-edited from its online story — but according to the New York Post, the Times also promoted claims that the story was Russian disinformation.

The Times now says, ""No concrete evidence has emerged that the laptop contains Russian disinformation.""

Meanwhile, the Times cast doubt on the April 2015 meeting by reporting, ""A Biden campaign spokesman said Mr. Biden’s official schedules did not show a meeting between the two men.""

What was the reaction?

The New York Post reacted to the admissions by writing in an editorial, ""Forgive the profanity, but you have got to be s**tting us.""

Regarding the Times' authentication of the emails, the Post mocked, ""Authenticated!!! You don’t say. You mean, when a newspaper actually does reporting on a topic and doesn’t just try to whitewash coverage for Joe Biden, it discovers it’s actually true?""

And for admitting that Biden attended the April 2015 meeting, the Post said, ""Funny how this works when you don’t just take someone’s word for it.""

Describing the Times as a ""perfect stenographer"" for Biden, the Post also criticized its rival for not explaining how they authenticated the emails, something the Post explained.

""The Times does a hand wave to anonymous sources. No facts have changed since fall 2020. They knew the laptop was real from the start. They just didn’t want to say so,"" the Post editorial board wrote. ""There’s never any shame with these 180s. Sorry that we wrote a 'fact check' that turned out to be bull! Sorry we wrote a piece claiming something wasn’t a story and you were stupid for thinking so!

""Twitter banned us for supposedly publishing 'hacked materials' that weren’t hacked. The company’s CEO apologized, but by that point they had accomplished what they wanted,"" the editorial continued. ""Like The Times, they cast enough doubt to avoid making their preferred candidate look bad.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ny-times-bombshell-admissions-hunter-biden-laptop-story,2022-03-17
"NYC shoplifting gang reportedly steals $70,000 in designer goods. Spectacular video shows police in action striking their getaway car, breaking their windows — and getting their men.","Incredible viral video shows NYPD officers foiling the getaway of a gang of shoplifters with highbrow taste who reportedly stole more than $70,000 in designer goods from a SoHo boutique between two separate robberies.

What are the details?

The video, which was initially shared on TikTok, shows a group of NYPD's finest swarming a dark silver Dodge Charger in city traffic after the vehicle rammed a patrol car behind it in an apparent attempt to flee.

The three suspects reportedly entered a high-end boutique on Broome Street and ""removed items from the display cases and racks,"" the NYPD said in a statement. The gang then ran out of the store and into the Charger.

""When officers attempted to conduct a lawful car stop, the vehicle refused to pull over and recklessly drove through traffic,"" the statement added.

The drama unfolded just outside of the Holland Tunnel.

In the video, the officers can be seen beating on the windows of the Charger and demanding its occupants exit the vehicle.

Authorities arrested Newark, New Jersey, residents 29-year-old Jahil Pamplin, 27-year-old Brianna Grier, and 29-year-old Janavia Marable and charged them with grand larceny, reckless endangerment, fleeing an officer, and resisting arrest.

The Daily Mail reported that officers arrested the trio in February for a burglary at the same shop. The suspects reportedly removed at least 26 handbags with an approximate total value of $50,000 during the February incident.

According to the Fair Lawn-Glen Rock Daily Voice, all three suspects have a criminal history. Pamplin served more than three years in a state prison for aggravated assault and weapons convictions, while Marable and Grier have previously been arrested and jailed for crimes.

""In one incident, Marable was charged with Macing a stranger after some kind of pre-dawn confrontation in Newark,"" the outlet reported. ""The following year, she was arrested for shoplifting nearly a dozen items from the Footlocker in the Short Hills mall, records show. The NYPD charged her, Grier and Pamplin with grand larceny, reckless endangerment, resisting arrest and eluding.""

"NYC Uber drivers protest rising gas prices, demand relief","New York City Uber drivers protested outside the company's Manhattan headquarters on Tuesday, demanding that the company create a ""fuel surcharge"" to compensate for rising gas prices.

Inflation, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and supply constraints have collided with rising demand for gasoline as the world returns to the pre-pandemic normal, sending prices at the pump skyward. The national average price for a gallon of gas was $4.24 on Tuesday, which is 50% more expensive compared to last year and 17% higher than last month, according to the American Automobile Association.

Drivers in the rideshare industry say they are getting priced out of profits between paying for gas and sharing what they make with the company.

“Before I used to fill up my tank for $50. Now it’s $70,” protester Wasim Miya told the New York Post. “It’s very hard for drivers. It’s not even worth it to work more because you are using more gas.”

Earlier in March, both Uber and its competitor Lyft announced they would add a surcharge in response to rising gas prices. Uber tacked on a $0.45 to $0.55 fee per trip and Uber Eats deliveries added a $0.35 to $0.45 surcharge. These fees are temporary and will last for at least two months, the company said.

But drivers say this is not enough.

A survey conducted by ""The Rideshare Guy,"" a blog and podcast for rideshare drivers, found that 43% of Uber and Lyft drivers say they're driving less or have quit their jobs because gas is too expensive, despite the surcharge.

“Many drivers say that the fuel surcharges are not enough and they would have preferred to see a per-mile surcharge to account for the increased fuel expenditure on long trips instead of a flat fee,” said Harry Campbell, founder and CEO of ""The Rideshare Guy.""

With no hope of relief from the city government, drivers want rideshare companies to take a smaller commission from rides and charge passengers a higher surcharge to help cover the cost of gas.



“In a usual day when you book $200, you take $100, today you[‘re] taking $50 or $60 because all the money is going into buying gas,” said another driver, Jahon Gir.

Gir and other fed-up Uber drivers formed a caravan with their vehicles, driving across the Brooklyn Bridge to the company's headquarters on the West Side of Manhattan, then going to the World Trade Center. They carried signs saying things like ""Need Money 4 Gas"" and ""Gas Prices Are Killing Our Income!""



“I have a wife and six kids. Inflation is so high. I’m feeling the squeeze,” said Pedro Acosta. ""Our money is going nowhere because of the gas prices. We need some increase.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-uber-drivers-protest-rising-gas-prices-demand-relief,2022-03-30
"In unearthed private letter, Obama excoriated GOP-led probe into Biden as aiding Russian disinformation","A newly unearthed private letter showed former President Barack Obama's response to a Republican-led demand for information on Joe Biden, and it was not well received.

The letter was sent from the office of the 44th president to the National Archives and Records Administration in March over a request from Republican Sens. Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) for records relating to Biden's actions in Ukraine.

Critics have accused Biden of using his former position in the Obama administration in order to personally benefit his son Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

Obama called the request improper and said it was aiding a Russian disinformation campaign.

""It arises out of efforts by some, actively supported by Russia, to shift the blame for Russian interference in the 2016 election to Ukraine,"" claimed Obama in the letter, published by Buzzfeed News.

""The request for early release of presidential records in order to give credence to a Russian disinformation campaign — one that has already been thoroughly investigated by a bipartisan congressional committee — is without precedent,"" he added.

Despite the strong objections, Obama agreed to the release of the documents in ""the interest of countering the misinformation campaign underlying the request.""

The National Archives released 9,400 pages of the records requested since mid-March.

While he was hounded by questions surrounding his involvement in Ukraine, Biden became the presumed Democratic candidate for the presidential election.

"Barack Obama gives Democrats reality check about connecting with voters, winning elections: 'Not being a buzzkill'","Former President Barack Obama is criticizing his own party for not focusing on the issues Americans care about most.

Poll after poll shows American voters most care about the economy and inflation, jobs, crime, and immigration problems. Democrats, however, are focusing on abortion, Donald Trump, and Jan. 6.

What did Obama say?



Speaking on the ""Pod Save America"" podcast, Obama knocked Democrats for spending too much energy on Trump.

""We spend enormous amounts of time and energy and resources pointing out the latest crazy thing he said ... that’s probably not something that, in the minds of most voters, overrides their basic interests: Can I pay the rent? What are gas prices? How am I dealing with child care, etc.,"" Obama said.

In fact, Obama said he believes Democrats ""get into trouble"" with voters because they overemphasize identity policies.

""I think where [Democrats] get into trouble sometimes is when we try to suggest that some groups are more — because they historically have been victimized more, that somehow they have a status that’s different than other people, and that we’re going around scolding folks if they don’t use exactly the right phrase,"" Obama said.

""Or, you know, that identity politics becomes the principle lens through which we view our various political challenges,"" he explained.

""To me, I think, that, for a lot of average folks, ends up feeling as if you’re not speaking to me and my concerns, or for that matter, my kid’s concerns and their future,"" Obama added.

Later in the interview, Obama said Democrats, if they want to win elections, must counteract Republicans' effective argument that Democrats are ""coastal liberals"" who ""are looking down on you and think you’re stupid.""

Therefore, Democrats have to connect with average Americans, Obama said, and not feed them a ""bunch of policy gobbledygook.""

""That’s not how people think about these issues,"" Obama said. ""They think about them in terms of, 'The life I’m leading day to day. How does politics, how is it even relevant to the things that I care most deeply about? My family, my kids, work that gives me satisfaction, having fun' ... not being a buzzkill, right?

"Obama slapped with history lesson after claiming he was tough on Russia, had to 'drag' European allies into action","Former President Barack Obama was blasted Thursday for ""self-serving revisionist history"" after claiming he was tough on Russia as president.

What happened?

While speaking at the ""Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy"" conference at the University of Chicago, Obama claimed he was forced to ""drag"" European allies to take action against Russia for invading and annexing Crimea in 2014.

""I will say that, as someone who grappled with the incursion into Crimea and the eastern portions of Ukraine, I have been encouraged by the European reaction. Because, in 2014, I often had to drag them kicking and screaming to respond in ways that we would’ve wanted to see, from those of us who describe ourselves as Western democracies,"" Obama said.

The claim immediately drew criticism on social media.

Northeastern University professor Max Abrahms, an expert in international security, shared the video and said, ""Watch Obama’s self-serving revisionist history of how his administration responded the last time Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014.""

It was also pointed out that:

And of course, perhaps the most infamous incident of all, Obama dismissed Russia as a serious threat during a 2012 presidential debate with Mitt Romney, who earlier in the election season said Russia is America's ""number one geopolitical foe.""

""The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years,"" Obama told Romney in the debate.

Even James Clapper, who was director of national intelligence during the Obama administration, admitted in February that he wished the Obama administration had been tougher on Russia.

Report: Obama's ambassador to Ukraine may have lied under oath in impeachment inquiry,"Former President Barack Obama's ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who has become a key player in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, allegedly lied under oath during her closed-door testimony with House impeachment investigators on Oct. 11.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson broke the story Thursday night when his show obtained an email from a Democratic congressional staffer sent privately to Yovanovitch — before the whistleblower complaint became public — seeking to discuss ""delicate and time sensitive questions.""



""This show has obtained exclusively an email from that Democratic staffer for the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent by private email to the former American Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch,"" Carlson stated on-air. ""Yovanovitch, you know, is a key player in the Democrats' impeachment probe and was recalled from her post in Ukraine by President Trump in May 2019 following allegations of serious partisanship and political bias.""

The email Carlson obtained states:

I'm writing to see if you would have time to meet up for a chat — in particular, I'm hoping to discuss some Ukraine-related oversight questions we are exploring. I'd appreciate the change to ground-truth a few pieces of information with you, some of which are quite delicate/time-sensitive and, thus, we want to make sure we get them right.

The email was reportedly sent Aug. 14, Carlson said, ""two days after the whistleblower complaint was filed and a month before that complaint became public.""

""The whistleblower, however, went to Adam Schiff's team before filing the complaint,"" he continued.

The question then becomes, according to Carlson, whether Schiff's office told other Democrats in Congress what was in the complaint before alerting the public.

""In other words, how long did this effort play out in secret before the rest of the country learned of it?"" Carlson asked.

As for Yovanovitch, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) asked her about the email during her testimony with House officials, to which she reportedly answered that she never responded to the email.

""In fact, it turns out that she did respond,"" Carlson revealed. ""She said she 'looked forward to chatting with [the Democratic staffer].""

Zeldin tweeted transcripts from the testimony in response to the news, confirming that Yovanovitch's statement was indeed under oath.

""It appears Ambassador Yovanovitch did not accurately answer this question I asked her during her 'impeachment inquiry' deposition under oath,"" he said.

Yovanovitch was removed from her post by President Trump before her term was slated to end and believes it to be the result of a ""concerted campaign"" by Trump and Ukranian officials.

Yovanovitch is scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 15.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obamas-ambassador-to-ukraine-may-have-lied-under-oath,2019-11-08
"Obama's White House doc says 'incoherent,' 'confused' Biden not fit for president during historic Russia-Ukraine war crisis","Former White House doctor Ronny Jackson, who served in both the Obama and Trump administrations as well as that of former President George W. Bush, said that President Joe Biden is ""not fit to be our president right now"" amid the escalating war crisis in Europe.

What are the details?

Jackson, now a Republican U.S. representative from Texas, said during a Wednesday interview with Fox News Digital that Biden's deteriorating mental state is making the United States look weak in a time of what some people say could result in global war.

“The whole country is seeing his mental cognitive issues on display for over a year now, and there’s really no question in most people’s minds that there’s something going on with him, that he’s not cognitively the same as he used to be and, in my mind, not fit to be our president right now,” Jackson said. “Every time he gets up and talks to the American people, it’s not just the American people that are watching him speak, it’s the whole world, and that’s part of what the problem is here.""

Jackson added, ""He looks tired, he looks weak, he looks confused, he’s incoherent, and it sends a message of weakness all over the world, and they’re seizing up on that.""

Jackson — who is now calling for the president to undergo cognitive testing — pointed out that his recurring ""gaffes"" and ""missteps,"" which were formerly chalked up to Biden's sometimes bumbling personality, are increasing in both intensity and frequency and warned that something more nefarious might be afoot beyond just stumbles and mumbles.

“He’s got 40 years of tape, you can go back and look at this man, so it’s not like we don’t have anything to compare it to,” Jackson said. “You can go back and look, he’s always made gaffes, he’s always made missteps, but never like this. This is something different. These aren’t gaffes. ... This is something much more serious.”

What else?

White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital that Jackson's remarks were nothing but politcs.

""I honestly don’t care about Ronny Jackson’s ‘Look at me’ routine,"" Bates told the outlet via email. ""But if y’all get any mail from Nick Riviera please don’t be a stranger.""

Bates in his head-scratching statement was apparently referring to ""Simpsons"" character Dr. Nick Rivera — or Dr. Nick — who the outlet described as a ""quack medical doctor with shady credentials.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obamas-white-house-doc-says-incoherent-confused-biden-not-fit-for-president-during-historic-russia-ukraine-war-crisis,2022-02-24
'What a marvelous performance!': Observers react to Jussie Smollett's jaw-dropping courtroom outburst after he's sentenced to jail,"After Cook County Judge James Linn told Jussie Smollett he'd be starting 150 days in jail right then and there Thursday night for staging a hate crime against himself in 2019 and lying to police about the hoax, Smollett turned more than a few heads with a bizarre soliloquy of sorts.

'I am not suicidal!'

""I am not suicidal,"" Smollett said quietly to the judge. Then he repeated the phrase in a raised voice. Then Smollett said, ""I am not suicidal,"" once again, even more sharply.

""I am innocent, and I am not suicidal,"" he continued as he stood up, shaking his finger. ""If I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBTQ community!”

Image source: YouTube screenshot, composite

Smollett added, “I did not do this, and I am not suicidal. And if anything happens to me when I go in [jail], I did not do it to myself. And you must all know that ... I am not suicidal.”

Then the singer and ex-star of ""Empire"" offered a grand finale, raising his fist as he was led out of the courtroom and flat-out hollering in the process: ""I am not suicidal! I am not suicidal! And I am innocent! I could've said I was guilty a long time ago!""

Jussie Smollett has courtroom outburst after judge sentences him to jail | ABC7 youtu.be

How did observers react to Smollett's outburst?

As you might imagine, a number of notable individuals reacted strongly to Smollett's behavior after his sentencing.

Actor and comedian Terrance K. Williams posted a video of himself wide-eyed as he took in Smollett's outburst and then cracked up by the end of it.

""Oh Lord! ... What a marvelous performance!"" Williams bellowed, trying to catch his breath. ""Man! You do some really great acting, Jussie, Jessie, Juicy, whatever your name is. Listen, man. You're going to jail! [laughs more] Oh Lord ... Juicy, Jussie is goin' to jail! He's [gonna] be locked up, they won't let him out, they won't let him out! Listen, that's what you get. You're going to jail — na na na na, hey hey, goodbye!""

After a remark about soap we won't repeat here, Williams added that he was having a mediocre day — until the sentencing: ""I feel so much better! I just feel great! ... Now this is what you call justice right here, OK? He shouldn't have been lying. He shouldn't have been making up fake stuff about Trump supporters.""

After Smollett's dramatic outburst, Gregg Jarrett — legal and political analyst for Fox News — tweeted that it demonstrated ""his acting skills are no better than his lying skills.""

Siraj Hashmi — tongue fully in cheek — noted that Smollett is ""misunderstood. He’s not a liar, he’s just an incredibly talented method actor who cannot break character under any circumstances.""

Lawyer and YouTuber Viva Frei observed that Smollett ""appealed to the Ukraine war, the Holocaust, racism, homophobia… and in so doing, exploited all of those injustices for his own selfish & dishonest aspirations. He then raised his fist in defiance as he left the court room. Shameless narcissism to the bitter end.""

Breitbart's Alana Mastrangelo wondered if Smollett was ""auditioning for a new role?""

Social media pundit Gad Saad concluded after watching Smollett's outburst that ""the level of malignant narcissism that this grotesque cretin exhibited is astounding. He has zero sense of shame. He is a Munchausen psychopath.""

Anything else?

The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Smollett likely will serve only half the 150-day sentence since his jail term is eligible for “day-for-day” credit for good behavior. In addition to jail time, Smollett also will serve 30 months of probation and pay $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago as well as a $25,000 fine.

Smollett, 39 — who is black and gay — made national headlines for claiming a pair of supporters of then-President Donald Trump physically attacked him near his apartment in Chicago in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, 2019.

He claimed the two men wearing ski masks confronted him as he was leaving a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. in below freezing conditions and yelled, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before beating him up, putting a rope around his neck, pouring bleach on him, and hollering, ""This is MAGA country!"" — a reference to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But once a police investigation began, Smollett's story began to crumble.

Prior to issuing his sentence, Judge Linn eviscerated Smollett, calling him a ""charlatan"" and telling him ""your hypocrisy is astounding"" and ""you wanted to make yourself more famous"" through the elaborate, ""premeditated"" caper and then ""you threw a national pity party for yourself."" But the worst part, the judge said, was that Smollett lied to authorities about it all — and then committed perjury on the witness stand.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/observers-react-to-jussie-smollett-courtroom-outburst,2022-03-11
"Rep. Ocasio-Cortez says Democrats have to 'run with' Ukraine allegations to unify the House, prevent 'disastrous' 2020 outcome","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that Democrats have to move forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and his actions regarding Ukraine in order to unify the party.

That perspective from the freshman congresswoman fits with a criticism from the president's allies that the impeachment effort is more about weakening Trump and the Republican Party leading up to 2020 elections than it is about alleged abuse of power.

""At the end of the day, we have to be able to come together as a caucus and if it is this Ukrainian allegation that is what brings the caucus together, then I think we have to run with however we unify the House,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""We also need to move quite quickly because we're talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections. And so this is not just about something that has occurred—this is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.""

House Democrats took the impeachment inquiry public Wednesday with testimony from two Ukraine diplomats: Deputy Secretary of State George Kent and Ambassador William Taylor before the House Intelligence Committee.



The public hearing yielded almost no new information; witnesses scheduled to testify publicly have already had closed-door depositions and those transcripts are gradually being released. Democrats are hoping the public hearings will allow them to present the narrative of President Trump's alleged corruption in a way that is persuasive to voters.

Democrats are alleging that President Trump withheld promised security aid to Ukraine in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to open public investigations into potential 2016 election interference and alleged corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Republicans used much of their time Wednesday emphasizing the fact that the security aid was released to Ukraine even though no investigations were opened, and that Zelensky has expressed no concern about his exchanges with President Trump. They also pointed out that neither Taylor nor Kent had firsthand knowledge of the situation.

The next hearing is scheduled to begin Friday morning with testimony from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.

"Ohio Senate candidates Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel exchange blows in GOP debate, JD Vance earns massive lead in post-debate straw poll","A Friday debate between Republican Senate candidates in Ohio intensified primary rivalries as candidates exchanged jabs and confronted each other over their political bona fides.

Prior to the event, candidate Mike Gibbons, who is currently leading in the polls, implied that he was cautiously optimistic about his current lead over other candidates. He told TheBlaze, ""You never know until Election Day, but we feel confident.""

The event, sponsored by FreedomWorks, had more than 900 RSVPs, according to event staffers, and was intense from the outset as candidate Josh Mandel used his introductory remarks to attack Mike Gibbons's alleged business dealings with China.

The evening's first question — regarding the U.S.'s relationship with Russia and China — brought tensions to a boiling point as Mandel once again used his permitted time to speak to criticize Gibbons for doing business with China.

Gibbons's responded to Mandel by criticizing him for never having worked in the private sector.

""You may not understand this,"" Gibbons said, ""Because you've never been in the private sector in your entire life.""

Mandel responded by standing up and getting in Gibbons's face to tout his time in the military, saying: ""I understand fully, I've worked. Two tours in Iraq, don't tell me I haven't worked.""

The Gibbons campaign released a statement about the confrontation that said, ""Josh Mandel is unhinged, unfit and flailing – because he's losing. He is only a professional at one thing: running for office. He is hellbent on lying because he is failing.""



It continued, ""We can't leave this race to child-like candidates. We need an adult in the room, and Josh Mandel has proven that he is not capable of being that for Ohioans.""

After the brief kerfuffle, candidate JD Vance criticized Mandel for using his military service as a political credential.

Vance said, ""I think the way you use the U.S. Marine Corps, Josh, is disgraceful.""

Whereas the other candidates worked to propose policy solutions to the questions they were posed, Mandel appeared more focused on reducing Gibbons's lead in the polls by attacking his business record.

His attacks on Gibbons continued throughout the night as he appeared to be reading off a fact sheet containing information on Gibbons's financial dealings and FEC filings.

However, Mandel's strategy and Gibbons's subsequent rebuttals favored neither candidate as FreedomWorks's official post-debate straw poll overwhelmingly favored JD Vance's performance.

Vance believes that the poll's results are due to him focusing on issues that actually affect the average Ohio voter.

He said, ""While others made a mockery of themselves with their phony tough guy antics, I focused on engaging with the voters, honing in on the real problems that Ohioans face and providing true solutions that may make life better for working- and middle-class Americans. This clearly resonated with the crowd, and I am proud to have earned this kind of support from the attendees.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ohio-senate-candidates-mike-gibbons-and-josh-mandel-exchange-blows-in-gop-debate-jd-vance-wins-straw-poll,2022-03-19
Oil prices reach highest levels in more than a decade as Russian aggression intensifies,"As markets opened Wednesday morning, U.S. oil prices reached highs not seen in more than a decade.

Futures for the international benchmark Brent crude listed prices as more than $113.58 a barrel, CNBC said.

The Washington Examiner reported that futures for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate increased by 8% trading at $112 per barrel.

This is the highest that oil has traded since 2011.

The increase in oil costs come after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its oil-producing allies agreed to hold production rates steady.

OPEC and its allies will increase output in April by 400,000 barrels per day as Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine causes supply shortage fears.

John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital and former energy executive, said, “There’s no respite. This is a dramatic moment for the market and the world and supplies. It’s clear the world is going to have to stand up to Russia by foreclosing its oil exports.”

Ed Moya, a market analyst, said, “Crude prices can’t stop going higher as a very right oil market will likely see further risk to supplies as the War in Ukraine unfold. Brent crude could surge to the $120 level if the oil market starts to think it is likely that sanctions will be placed on Russian energy.”

In a move to reduce Western dependence on Russian and OPEC oil, members of the International Energy Agency announced plans to release 60 million barrels of oil reserves in an effort to combat the soaring price of oil.

The United States, in particular, will release 30 million barrels.

Nevertheless, this announcement did little to quell anxieties about soaring energy costs.

Goldman Sachs wrote, “We do not view this as sufficient relief. Demand destruction — through still higher prices — is now likely the only sufficient rebalancing mechanism, with supply elasticity no longer relevant in the face of such a potential large and immediate supply shock.”

WTI and Brent are both up more than 40% year to date as demand for oil remains the same, or rises, while supply grows increasingly constrained.

The energy investment group RBC said, “We think [OPEC] will likely stay the course with the current easing schedule and avoid wading into the deepening security crisis involving the group co-chair Russia.”

Russia is one of the world’s largest producer and exporters of natural gas. Despite allied Western nations issuing heavy sanctions on Russia, the country’s energy sector has largely been unaffected.

In 2014, oil prices rose to just over $100 a barrel as supply fears rose following the Russian invasion of Crimea.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oil-prices-reach-highest-levels-in-more-than-a-decade-as-russian-aggression-intensifies,2022-03-02
Oil prices surge to highest level since 2014 amid war in Europe,"The price of oil jumped Thursday to its highest level since 2014 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine, with the international benchmark Brent crude surpassing $100 a barrel ahead of expected disruptions in the global energy supply.

Crude oil reached a high of $105.79 per barrel Thursday morning, rising more than 8% since the hostilities began. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures increased more than 8% to trade at $99.46 — also the highest level in eight years.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack on Ukraine by land, sea, and air early Thursday after building up more than 150,000 troops along the country's borders. The invasion began days after Putin illegally recognized two rebel regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states, claiming Ukraine's government was committing ""genocide"" against ethnic Russians there as a pretext to send Russian soldiers to war.

Ukraine is now embroiled in war, and Western governments are preparing to impose severe economic sanctions on Russia to punish Putin.

President Joe Biden met with G-7 ministers Thursday morning and will deliver remarks sometime Thursday afternoon to announce the new actions the United States will take against Russia.

Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas and one of the largest exporters of oil. The impact of war, and of punitive sanctions against Russia, is expected to continue to drive energy prices up as the situation in Eastern Europe remains uncertain.

“At this stage it is anything but clear what could bring the Russian president to his senses, therefore the situation, the equity and oil markets will remain volatile,” PVM Oil Associates senior analyst Tamas Varga said Thursday, CNBC reported.

“Even if prices drop back below $100/bbl due to abating tension in Eastern Europe, the retracement might prove short-lived and product tightness could keep oil prices at elevated levels in months to come,” he added.

Increasing prices for crude oil will mean Americans are going to pay more for gas. Already the average U.S. price for a gallon of gasoline reached $3.53 this week, the highest average since 2014, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

Biden warned in a speech Tuesday that energy prices will continue to rise as the U.S. levies additional sanctions on Russia.

“As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs, for us as well and here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that. But as we do this, I'm going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oil-prices-surge-to-highest-level-since-2014-amid-war-in-europe,2022-02-24
Biden virtue-signals about climate change while omnibus bill is flown to his tropical vacation spot,"President Joe Biden virtue-signaled about climate change on Thursday, the same day the massive $1.7 billion omnibus bill was flown to the Virgin Islands for his signature.

""One of the reasons I ran for office was to confront the existential threat climate change poses to our nation and to the world. With the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act, we took the biggest step towards that goal in American history,"" Biden tweeted.

Ironically, the omnibus bill, which averts a government shutdown, had to be flown to St. Croix, where Biden is vacationing with his family.

The Bidens departed Washington on Tuesday, and Congress delivered the bill to the White House for Biden's signature on Wednesday. That means had Biden waited one more day before leaving, it would not have been necessary to transport the bill to the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The White House confirmed the bill's flight, but tried to save face by noting it was transported via commercial aircraft.

""The White House received the bill from Congress late afternoon on Wednesday. The bill was delivered to the President for his signature by White House staff on a regularly scheduled commercial flight,"" a White House official said.

Biden's holiday vacation has already generated criticism.

It comes as the border is overwhelmed by migrants, creating a serious humanitarian crisis, and tens of thousands of Americans were stranded after Southwest Airlines experienced a meltdown, resulting in thousands of canceled flights over the Christmas holiday.

Meanwhile, CNN reported, ""It’s at least the second time this year that an important bill has been flown to Biden for his signature. While on a trip to Asia in May, a bill authorizing about $40 billion in aid to Ukraine was carried by a staffer who was already scheduled to travel to the region. Biden signed the bill while overseas.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/omnibus-bill-flown-biden-vacation,2022-12-30
Trump lawyer reveals how Dems 'hid' a major piece of evidence that absolves the president,"If you only listened to the House Democrats' case against President Donald Trump, one could walk away thinking that freezing foreign aid to Ukraine was an unprecedented move by the administration.

But, as Townhall's Cortney O'Brien points out, the White House's top lawyer, Pat Cipollone, revealed to the nation and members of the Senate a major piece of evidence that Democrats have conveniently omitted from their presentations.

""They didn't tell you that burden sharing was discussed in the call,"" Cipollone said Saturday, referring to Trump's call with the president of Ukraine.

As Cipollone pointed out, in his July 25 call with Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky, Trump told the newly elected leader that Germany and other European nations do ""almost nothing"" for them. According to transcripts of the conversation, Zelensky said Trump was ""absolutely right.""

House Democrats ""didn't have time in 24 hours to tell you this [in their impeachment remarks],"" Cipollone said.

A ""legitimate"" point

Cipollone's argument even resonated with CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin who, in his analysis of the Trump defense team's remarks, acknowledged the president's lawyers raised a ""legitimate"" point by underscoring the president's longstanding concerns with foreign aid and burden-sharing among nations.



""They did make one good point about [the transcript], I thought, which was the president did about burden-sharing in that phone call, and the House managers didn't focus on that or even mention it. And fair is fair,"" he said, the Washington Examiner reported.

""He has talked about it before, and that was, I thought, a very legitimate good point made by the defense,"" he added.



Toobin also acknowledged that Trump is ""winning"" impeachment case against him.

The best defense is a strong offense

True to the adage, the president's counsel showed on Saturday that the best defense is a strong offense. In his remarks before the Senate, Deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura went on the offensive and highlighted ""six key facts"" that exonerate Trump of wrongdoing.

Among them, according to Purpura, is that the transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky ""shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything,"" In fact, ""the paused security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call,"" Purpura said.

""The Democrats' blind eye to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats' own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor,"" he explained. ""Those are the facts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pat_cipollone_democrats_hid_evidence,2020-01-26
Lefty economist Paul Krugman on why he was wrong about inflation: 'Nobody thought about logistic supply chains or any of that stuff',"During an interview on MSNBC on Thursday, left-wing economist Paul Krugman tried to explain why he and his fellow economists didn't see high inflation coming.

Krugman was explaining his latest New York Times op-ed entitled ""I Was Wrong About Inflation,"" which laid out why he incorrectly predicted that spending programs from the Biden administration would not lead to significantly higher inflation.

""What did you think you got wrong?"" asked ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski.

""Well, partly it's that, there's stuff that I didn't, that nobody saw coming. Nobody saw Putin invading Ukraine. I think nobody really thought about logistic supply chains or any of that stuff, until suddenly it became a big problem,"" Krugman claimed.

""But part of it is that we did, in fact, end up with what is clearly an overheated economy, and the effect of that overheating on inflation was bigger than past experience would have led us to believe,"" he added.

""So it's always dangerous to extrapolate from the past,"" he explained. ""And in this case, I thought it was possible that we would overheat. I didn't think, given the historic relationship, that there would be this much inflation.""

Krugman then tried to pivot from those mistakes to ""where do we go from here."" He also posited that there were signs that inflation was not going to continue in the long term.

He admitted in the op-ed that he was wrong about Democrat policies worsening inflation.

“Some warned that the package would be dangerously inflationary; others were fairly relaxed,"" Krugman wrote. “I was Team Relaxed. As it turned out, of course, that was a very bad call.”

Voters have made it clear in polling that they blame President Joe Biden and his policies for high inflation, and that they are voting in the pivotal midterm elections based on their anger over inflation.

Paul Manafort reportedly asked Ecuador to turn over Assange,"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort tried to get the Ecuadorian government to turn over Julian Assange to the United States government, according to a new report by the New York Times.

Here's what the report said

Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012. He fled there seeking political asylum after failing to block his own extradition to Sweden where he had been accused of rape. Authorities in both England and the United States plan to arrest Assange if he ever leaves the embassy and the U.S. has prepared charges against him.

Manafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 and became the chairman of the campaign in May. By August, he was forced to resign after questions emerged about whether or not he had lobbied in the U.S. on behalf of politicians in Ukraine without disclosing to the U.S. government that he was working as a foreign agent.

In late November, The Guardian had reported that Manafort had visited Assange in the embassy in 2013, 2015, and 2016. Both Manafort and WikiLeaks have denied that these meetings took place.

According to this latest report, Manafort met with then-newly elected Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in May 2017 to discuss a number of deals. Among topics discussed was the possibility of Ecuador giving up Assange to the U.S.

The Ecuadorian government has expressed a desire to have Assange leave their embassy. Since March, it has kept him from seeing any visitors. It has also cut off his access to the internet. Moreno's government had given Assange citizenship in December 2017, and looked into a way to send him to Russia as a diplomat on its behalf.

However, these plans quickly fell apart when British authorities stressed that they would arrest Assange the moment he left the embassy and stepped foot on British soil.

The Times said that they had not discovered any indication that Manafort had been briefing President Trump or his administration while he was meeting with Moreno. If that's true, Manafort could be in violation of the Logan Act, which states:

Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

A spokesman for Manafort, Jason Maloni, confirmed to the New York Times that this topic had been discussed, but insisted that Moreno was the one who first mentioned Assange. Maloni said that Manafort had ""listened but made no promises as this was ancillary to the purpose of the meeting.""

What else?

Manafort has been at the heart of several unresolved threads of the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and witness tampering on Sept. 14, almost a year after he was first charged and following his conviction by a jury in a separate but related case on eight tax and banking crimes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/paul-manafort-reportedly-asked-ecuador-to-turn-over-assange,2018-12-04
Pelosi says Trump can't be legitimately acquitted if Senate doesn't call impeachment witnesses,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that President Donald Trump ""will not be acquitted"" by the Senate in his impeachment trial unless the chamber goes along with Democrats' demands to call more witnesses.

During her weekly press briefing in the U.S. Capitol, Pelosi made the case that, even if the Senate does vote to acquit President Trump of the charges leveled by the House, it won't be a real acquittal unless the Senate does what Democrats have asked for and call for more witness testimony in the trial.

Asked whether she thought Trump would be ""chastened"" by Congress' impeachment efforts or ""emboldened because the Senate will have acquitted him,"" the speaker quickly responded that Trump ""will not be acquitted.""

The rationale of this prediction wasn't based on the potential final vote count, but on the perceived legitimacy of the trial if no more witnesses are called.

""You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial,"" Pelosi explained. ""And you don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation.""

Pelosi's statement comes against a backdrop of questions about whether Republican senators might break ranks to join their Democratic colleagues' calls to call witnesses and/or subpoena evidence.

Meanwhile, Republicans have grown optimistic that they have the votes to end the trial this week without having to call more witnesses following a meeting between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and moderate Republican Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) Wednesday.

The question of more witnesses — particularly former national security adviser John Bolton — has been the subject of intense discussion on Capitol Hill this week following reports of allegations about the president's withholding of Ukraine military aid contained in the manuscript of Bolton's forthcoming book, as well as a Wednesday statement by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) about a phone call the two had in September.

If Bolton does end up being called as a witness, Republicans have warned about the possibility calling former Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and others to testify about the Ukrainian corruption concerns underlying the impeachment efforts in return.

""If people want witnesses, we're going to get a lot of witnesses,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned Tuesday in reference to the possibility of a witness trade-off between Democrats and Republicans. ""I'll make a prediction: There will be 51 Republican votes to call Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the whistleblower and the DNC staffer [Alexandra Chalupa] at a very minimum.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-no-acquittal-if-senate-does-not-call-witnesses,2020-01-30
"New docs reveal the extent of Pelosi's CODEL travel abuses, how much taxpayer money she spent","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's use of military aircraft came under scrutiny last week after President Donald Trump cancelled her congressional delegation trip to Belgium, Egypt, and Afghanistan.

Pelosi's use of government aircraft is not new. In fact, documents obtained and released by government watchdog Judicial Watch last week reveal the extent to which Pelosi has used military aircraft in the past, costing taxpayers millions.

What are the details?

One trip in particular — to Milan, Rome, Naples, and Kiev — has received considerable scrutiny. The 2015 trip, from July 30 to Aug. 6, cost the Air Force $184,587.81, documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act show. Pelosi, along with several other Democratic members of Congress, made the trip with members of their families.

The exact purpose of the trip remains unclear. A Politico news story at the time alleged Pelosi's congressional delegation ""intended to underscore the U.S. commitment to security in that region.""

However, FOIA documents suggest the lawmakers treated the trip more like a vacation, even petitioning the Air Force for a specific flight clew for the duration of the trip, a laughable and arguably selfish request.

More from Judicial Watch:

The Italy trip included Milan, Rome and Naples with visits to the Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel, Duomo and viewing Da Vinci's ""Last Supper.""



The documents also show the Air Force's negative response to a Pelosi staff request for a specific crew for Pelosi's flight. An official notes that it: ""would be a disastrous precedent to set even if it were possible."" The Air Force further points out: ""Our ARC crews have plenty to balance already with military duties and their civilian employers.""

Indeed, Pelosi has a lengthy history of abusing special travel privileges afforded to lawmakers. In 2011, Judicial Watch exposed Pelosi's rampant use of luxury Air Force jets to travel between Washington, D.C., and her congressional district in California, a 5-hour, 3,000 mile journey each direction.

In just a two-year period, Pelosi accumulated $2,100,744.59 worth of travel expenses, which included $101,429.14 for in-flight conveniences, such as food and alcohol.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-travel-expense-abuse,2019-01-22
"Pelosi wants to spend another $45 billion in COVID-19 relief, double what Biden had asked for","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wants the federal government to spend $45 billion on yet another COVID-19 stimulus package, nearly double what President Joe Biden's administration had asked for in the last omnibus spending bill.

Biden had initially asked for $22.5 billion in new emergency funding for the pandemic and Democrats had compromised to a $15.6 billion figure after Republicans objected. But even that compromise amount was cut from the $1.5 trillion omnibus bill that Congress passed last week, averting a government shutdown.

On Thursday, Pelosi told reporters that she wants the Biden administration to ask Congress for even more COVID-19 funds. ""I think it should be double what they asked for, because even when they were asking for like 20-some [billion dollars] it was only going to get us to June"" she said during her weekly press conference.

She added that this additional spending will need to be ""offset"" but did not explain whether she meant by tax increases or by cutting government spending in other areas. ""We don't have it right now,"" she admitted.

Earlier Thursday, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders met with the Biden administration's top public health officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The Biden administration had requested additional funds ""to avoid disruption to ongoing COVID response efforts over the next few months."" The president said in a March 2 letter to Pelosi that $22.5 billion were needed for oral antiviral treatments, monoclonal antibody therapies and other pre-exposure prophylaxis, COVID-19 testing programs, new vaccine research, and global vaccination programs.

Biden requested $18.25 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services for domestic pandemic funds, while the other $4.25 billion would be sent abroad through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development.

Republicans opposed the president's spending request, arguing it was too costly and needed to be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. After negotiating with Democrats, a $15.6 billion compromise was reached that was partially offset by using more than $7 billion in unspent state COVID-19 funds from the American Rescue Plan passed in March 2020.

But the deal fell apart when rank-and-file Democrats opposed the spending offsets, forcing Pelosi to pull COVID-19 funding out of the stimulus package entirely.

Speaking Thursday, Pelosi vowed that new COVID-19 relief would be passed no matter the cost.

""What I've said to the administration is ... you must ask for more. Because we need more, and you can't expect money, this [bill], to turn around just like that because the legislative process takes time,"" she said. ""We want it to be bipartisan; we need it to be paid for. And so let's just go for a bigger chunk.""

The federal government has spent more than $5 trillion during the COVID-19 pandemic, growing the national debt to more than $30 trillion, a figure that is 25.6% larger than GDP — the estimated value of the entire U.S. economy.

'The ball is in his court': Pelosi says she can work with Trump on Democratic agenda despite impeachment push,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) says it's possible for her and her Democratic colleagues to work with President Donald Trump on a long list of political agenda items, despite the House Democrats' latest impeachment efforts.

At a Capitol Hill news conference alongside House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Tuesday, Pelosi was asked how she plans to work with the president on Democratic agenda items like prescription drug costs, trade, and gun control while conducting impeachment efforts against the man.

The speaker, who spent the first part of the conference discussing Democrats' policy goals, responded that political agenda items and House impeachment efforts ""have nothing to do with each other.""

""We have a responsibility to uphold our oath of office, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" Pelosi elaborated. ""We also have a responsibility to get the job done for the American people.""

As an example, Pelosi pointed to congressional consideration of the USCMA — the reworked trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

""The president has said he wants this U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to go forward, and we are awaiting the language on enforceability,"" Pelosi said. ""Does it mean that he can't do that? That's really up to him.""

""He says that he wants to lower the cost of prescription drugs; the American people want us to do that,"" Pelosi said, offering another example of possible collaboration. ""So if the president's saying, 'If you question my actions, I can't agree on any subject,' then the ball is in his court on that.""

The current impeachment firestorm centers on a late July phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, during which Trump asked his counterpart to look into a since-closed investigation of a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden — an investigation Hunter's father, former Vice President Joe Biden, reportedly bragged about getting shut down.

Last week, before the public release of the phone call transcript and an Intelligence Community whistleblower's complaint about the call, Pelosi publicly announced that the House would move forward with ""an official impeachment inquiry"" against President Trump. Since then, three House committees have sent subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-we-can-work-with-trump-on-democratic-agenda-despite-impeachment-push,2019-10-02
Vice President Mike Pence is about to punish vulnerable pro-impeachment Democrats in districts Trump won,"Vice President Mike Pence is planning a national tour during which he will target vulnerable, pro-impeachment Democrats in Trump-supporting districts with a simple message: Democrats care more about impeaching President Donald Trump than they do about meeting the needs of their constituents.

Politico reported that the tour will begin Wednesday with a trip to Rep. Cindy Axne's district in southwest Iowa, followed by trips to the districts of Reps. Angie Craig in Minnesota, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.

As Democrats try to impeach the president for allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, Republicans are trying to spin the controversy to their advantage both as a tool to win swing voters and districts, and as a way to boost fundraising.

""While the 'Do Nothing Democrats' attempt to distract with their endless investigations, the vice president and this administration are laser focused on policies that put Americans first and make our country great,"" Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman said.

Republicans aren't buying into the narrative demonstrated by some national polls showing that impeachment is gaining support nationally. Even if that is the case, they believe that the support isn't there for impeachment in places that will matter in 2020. From Politico:

While national surveys show growing support for impeachment, Republicans contend it's far lower in the Democratic-held swing districts they're targeting. The National Republican Congressional Committee released a polling memo last week that argued that two-thirds of voters in those districts ""agree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the president and should be working on"" other issues.



Roughly two dozen of the 31 House Democrats who hail from districts Trump won in 2016 have expressed support for the impeachment inquiry.

Politico reported that there are 226 House Democrats who support impeachment or the impeachment inquiry, nine who are undecided, and zero Republicans who support either.

Pence's office denies Sondland's testimony that he told Pence about Ukraine quid pro quo concerns,"Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified Wednesday that he raised concerns to Vice President Mike Pence that security aid to Ukraine was contingent upon Ukraine announcing investigations into 2016 election interference and Joe and Hunter Biden — but the VP's office is denying any such conversation ever took place.

Sondland, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee as a part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, said the conversation with Pence took place on Sept. 1, just before Pence met with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky.

""I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations,"" Sondland said. The ambassador said Zelensky raised concerns about the delayed aid during the meeting, and that Pence responded by telling Zelensky he would address the matter with President Trump.

Sondland's revelation was significant, as it was the first piece of testimony tying the vice president to the alleged bribery/extortion/quid pro quo scandal Democrats are using as the basis of their impeachment effort. But Pence, through his chief of staff, denied that the conversation occurred.

""The Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations,"" the statement read. ""Ambassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland. This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.

""Multiple witnesses have testified under oath that Vice President Pence never raised Hunter Biden, Crowdstrike, Burisma, or investigations in any conversation with Ukrainians or President Zelensky before, during, or after the Sept. 1 meeting in Poland,"" it concluded.

A spokesman for Energy Secretary Rick Perry also claimed that Sondland's sworn testimony was inaccurate.

""Ambassador Sondland's testimony today misrepresented both Secretary Perry's interaction with Rudy Giuliani and direction the Secretary received from President Trump,"" the statement read. ""As previously stated, Secretary Perry spoke to Rudy Giuliani only once at the President's request. No one else was on that call. At no point before, during, or after that phone call did the words 'Biden' or 'Burisma' ever come up in the presence of Secretary Perry.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pences-office-denies-eu-ambassadors-testimony-that-he-told-pence-about-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-concerns,2019-11-20
"Pentagon can't account for $220 billion in gov't property, fails fifth audit","A Tuesday report by the Government Accountability Office revealed that the Department of Defense failed its fifth audit in a row after it could not account for at least $220 billion in government-furnished property, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.



The DOD has been mandated by federal law to complete audits since 1994; however, the mandate was ignored for decades due to the agency's massive size, according to Military.com. Since launching its first independent audit in 2017, the Pentagon has never passed.

The Pentagon failed its fifth audit in November after the agency could not prove expenditures for 61% of its $3.5 trillion in assets. To perform this year's overall audit of the DOD, which was expected to cost $218 million, the agency aggregated 27 separate audits conducted by approximately 1,600 auditors. According to Military.com, the auditors performed 220 in-person site visits and 750 virtual site visits.

The GAO's study reported that auditors first alerted the DOD in 2001 that the agency failed to keep track of its government-furnished property.

""DOD's lack of accountability over government property in the possession of contractors has been reported by auditors for decades,"" the GAO report stated. ""This longstanding issue affects the accounting and reporting of GFP and is one of the reasons DOD is unable to produce auditable financial statements.""

In 2014, the Pentagon reported that the estimated value of its GFP was at least $220 billion. However, according to the GAO's study, that figure is likely ""significantly understated.""

""For example, in fiscal year 2016, we reported that the Army indicated the actual number of these GFP assets is unknown and that actual quantities may be greatly different than the Army's documented property records reflect,"" the GAO report noted.

The GAO claimed that the DOD is the ""only major federal agency that has been unable to receive an audit opinion.""

Pentagon comptroller Mike McCord stated that he is ""disappointed"" the agency only made slight progress toward a clean audit this year.

""I would not say that we flunked. The process is important for us to do, and it is making us get better. It is not making us get better as fast as we want,"" McCord said.

The DOD did not immediately respond to a request for comment, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.

Pentagon policy official who signed off on Ukraine aid resigns at President Trump's request,"Defense Under Secretary for Policy John Rood submitted his resignation on Wednesday at the request of President Donald Trump, after reportedly facing pressure from administration officials who expressed concern over his ability to carry out the president's agenda.

Rood is the official who initially told Congress in May 2019 that Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts were sufficient for the Pentagon to release $250 million in military aid earmarked for the country. The Trump administration's temporary hold on releasing the aid became the central focus of House Democrats' failed impeachment efforts against the president.

What are the details?

Bloomberg News reported Rood held a top position in the Pentagon and ""faced pressure to resign"" after ""some senior national security officials had lost confidence in Rood's ability to carry out Trump's agenda.""

In his resignation letter to President Trump, Rood wrote, ""It is my understanding from Secretary [Mark] Esper that you requested my resignation from serving as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. I leave with the utmost admiration for the outstanding team with which I worked at the Defense Department.""

According to CBS News, Sec. Esper issued a statement on Rood's departure, saying he ""played a critical role on a wide range"" of issues. Esper added, ""I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.""

President Trump offered his farewell to Rood on Twitter, saying, ""I would like to thank John Rood for his service to our Country, and wish him well in his future endeavors!""



Deputy Under Secretary James Anderson will replace Rood in an interim capacity until a permanent replacement is found for the role, Bloomberg News reported.

Prior to serving in the Pentagon, Rood held positions at several government agencies including the State Department, National Security Council, Defense Department, and Central Intelligence Agency. He is also a former senior vice president of Lockheed Martin and a former vice president of Raytheon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-policy-official-who-signed-off-on-ukraine-aid-resigns-at-president-trumps-request,2020-02-19
"In apparent push to funnel planes to Ukraine, Poland says it is prepared to place MIG-29s at America's 'disposal,' but the US says the plan is not 'tenable'","Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Tuesday that the country is prepared to dispatch its fleet of MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, placing the aircraft at the American government's ""disposal.""

The proposal appears to be aimed at funneling the aircraft to Ukraine as that country seeks to repel Russian invaders — but the U.S. has indicated that it is not on board.

""The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the statement of Poland's minister of foreign affairs declared.



""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies – owners of MIG-29 jets – to act in the same vein,"" the statement added.



U.S. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby poured cold water on Poland's plan, saying that it is not ""tenable.""



""The prospect of fighter jets ""at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America"" departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""

According to Reuters, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday that ""any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis.""

""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" Morawiecki said, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-pushes-back-after-poland-announces-plan-to-send-planes-to-ramstein,2022-03-09
Pentagon: Reluctant Russian troops are punching holes in their vehicle gas tanks to get out of fighting,"Hampered by logistics problems, including lack of fuel and food, some Russian troops in Ukraine are reportedly surrendering en masse and even sabotaging their own vehicles to get out of the conflict, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

In some cases, entire Russian units have laid down their arms and surrendered without a fight after encountering stiff resistance from Ukrainian troops, a senior Pentagon official said, according to the New York Times. The official indicated that a significant number of Russian troops are young recruits who have been poorly trained and were not prepared for the full-scale invasion ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. There are even reports that some Russian soldiers have deliberately punched holes in their vehicles' gas tanks, in what the U.S. official characterized as an attempt to avoid combat.

The Times reported that the Pentagon declined to say how military intelligence gathered this information, but it is presumed that statements from captured Russian soldiers or intercepted Russian communications played a role. There is no indication of how widespread these surrenders are.

But reluctant combatants may be one reason why Russia's advance into Ukraine has stalled, U.S. officials said.

Other reasons have to do with the reported shortages of fuel and food and with logistics problems that have prevented a nearly 40-mile long convoy of Russian tanks and armored vehicles from arriving at the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Pentagon officials said. Additionally, Ukraine's military is still organized and defending the country, and Ukrainian civilians have been armed and have joined the fight, engaging the Russians and attacking supply chains that are crucial to the war effort.

The U.S. officials indicated that Russian commanders leading the convoy may also be ""regrouping and rethinking"" their strategy, with a renewed push to put Kyiv under siege and capture the capital to come in the next several days.

“They have a lot of power available to them,” the Pentagon official said, noting that 80% of the more than 150,000 troops Russia had amassed along Ukraine's border over many months are now participating in the invasion.

Though Russia has vastly superior manpower and firepower, U.S. officials have been surprised by the apparent ""risk-averse behavior"" of Russia's forces, the Pentagon official said. The official noted, for example, that when the Russians launched an invasion from the Sea of Azov to capture the port city of Mariupol, they landed troops 40 miles from the city. The distance allowed the Russians more time to prepare their attack, but in turn gave the city time to mount a defense.

The Pentagon official also observed that Russia's reputably strong air force has yet to gain air superiority over Ukraine, as Ukrainian fighter jets, Stinger anti aircraft missiles, and other anti-air weapons are harassing the Russian warplanes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-russian-troops-punching-holes-in-gas-tanks-get-out-of-fighting,2022-03-01
Peter Doocy bluntly fact-checks Biden's claim that no one 'f***s' with him: OPEC+ has 'done just that',"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy swiftly fact-checked President Joe Biden's viral claim that no one ""f***s"" with him.

Wait, what did Biden say?

While visiting Florida on Wednesday to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Ian, Biden was caught on a hot mic telling Fort Myers Beach Mayor Ray Murphy that he is untouchable.

""No one f***s with a Biden,"" the president said.

""Yeah, you’re goddamn right,"" Murphy responded.

What did Doocy say?

Reporting on OPEC's decision to slash oil production, Doocy made it clear that Biden's declaration is flatly untrue. In fact, OPEC has ""done just that,"" Doocy explained.

OPEC+, the global oil cartel, is slashing oil production by 2 million barrels per day, a decision Doocy said ""could make inflation in America worse while giving Russia a way to minimize the impact of global sanctions.""

OPEC+ voted to cut production to better control global oil prices.

Specifically, OPEC's decision is a thorn in the Biden's side because he flew to Saudi Arabia this summer to personally petition officials there to increase oil production as the West faced record-high gas prices.

Some OPEC members agreed to increase production after Biden's trip, but Wednesday's vote obviously erases those promises.

Not only does the decision undermine Biden's foreign policy prowess and America's standing as a world leader, but gas prices could spike with less product on the global market — a possibility over which Democrats are panicking. If gas prices increase again, Democrats are likely to suffer heavy losses in the 2022 midterm elections.

The White House responded by saying Biden is ""disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.""

Now, Biden may be turning to Venezuela for help.

The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday the Biden administration is willing to ease sanctions on the Nicolás Maduro regime to allow Chevron to begin pumping oil in Venezuela.

The deal, which may ultimately fall through the cracks, is politically risky. Moreover, if it is successful, the deal ""would put only a limited amount of new oil on the world market in the short term,"" the Journal noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-biden-opec,2022-10-06
Fox News reporter unravels Biden's newest narrative on inflation with abrupt fact-check: 'That’s not true',"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy caught the White House in a clear falsehood on Thursday, as the Biden administration repeatedly deflects blame for the inflation crisis.

What is the claim?

The evolving position of the White House is that the inflation crisis is not really that bad because other countries are facing their own inflation problems.

In a speech on Tuesday, for example, Biden celebrated his policies and claimed they have ""put America in a position to tackle the worldwide problem that’s worse everywhere but here: inflation.""

And in an interview with the Associated Press, he defended himself from bipartisan accusations that his COVID relief bill exacerbated inflationary pressures. ""If it’s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I’m not being a wise guy,"" Biden said.

What happened with Doocy?

At the White House press briefing, Doocy confronted press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre over Biden's narrative — and quickly disproved it.

""Why is the president saying that inflation is worse everywhere but here?"" Doocy asked.

After blaming the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin for domestic economic problems, Jean-Pierre repeated Biden's claim.

""So if you look at globally, other countries, and if you look at where we are economically, when you think about the Group 7, the G-7, we are in a much stronger place than we are economically than the rest,"" she claimed.

06/16/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Doocy immediately called out the falsehood.

""I did look globally, though. He says that inflation is worse everywhere but here. That’s not true,"" Doocy explained. ""U.S. has worse inflation than Germany, France, Japan, Canada, India, Italy, Saudi Arabia. So why is he saying that?""

Jean-Pierre, however, did not even address Doocy's fact-check in response, but simply repeated what she had already said.

Well, I think what we are saying is that when you talk about inflation, it is a global thing. And it is not just about the United States, this is something that everyone is feeling — because of coming out of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, because of the war that Russia has started in Ukraine.

It is true, of course, that other countries are facing inflation problems. But inflation in the United States, just as Doocy explained, is outpacing other developed countries.

Here are the inflation rates of the developed countries that Doocy listed: Japan (2.5%), Saudi Arabia (2.2%), France (5.2%), Italy (6.8%), Canada (6.8%), India (7%), Germany (7.9%).

Meanwhile, the U.S. inflation rate hit 8.6% in May.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-calls-out-biden-narrative-inflation,2022-06-17
Fox News reporter catches WH press secretary in contradiction over admission by treasury secretary on the inflation crisis,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was confronted Wednesday over Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's admission that she was wrong about inflation.

What did Yellen say?

Yellen told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday what most Americans have known for months: The Biden administration's claim that inflation would be temporary was horribly wrong.

""I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,"" Yellen said. ""As I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn't — at the time — didn't fully understand, but we recognize that now.""

What happened with Jean-Pierre?

During the press briefing, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Jean-Pierre about inflation and Yellen's revealing admission.

""When are you guys going to admit that you were wrong about inflation?"" Doocy asked. ""The treasury secretary says that she was wrong, so why doesn't anybody here at the White House?""

Jean-Pierre responded by absolving the Biden administration of any responsibility for ongoing economic woes, like record-high gas prices and the inflation crisis.

Instead, Jean-Pierre blamed ""inflationary pressures which couldn't have been foreseen,"" Russia, and COVID-19 while simultaneously spouting talking points that would make it seem that no economic problems exist.

06/01/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

In response, Doocy highlighted the glaring contradiction in Jean-Pierre's response.

""Just that I understand: the treasury secretary says that she was wrong, but the White House was not wrong about inflation?"" Doocy followed up.

Jean-Pierre, however, was not interested in directly answering the question. ""Those are your words, not my words,"" she charged, before again absolving the Biden administration from any responsibility.



""We have achieved an historic recovery through an extraordinarily unprecedented economic moment. The president has consistently noted that the primary drivers of inflation are the pandemic and Putin's invasion of Ukraine,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""The twists and turns of both these monumental events have affected energy prices and also food prices that we have seen these past several months.""



""This is Putin's price hike, which the president refers to, and that is what Secretary Yellen was referring to if you — if you read the entire transcript. And that's what I'm trying to say to you,"" she added. ""Hopefully that lands.""

Unfortunately for the White House, Americans don't buy what Biden is selling.

Importantly, inflation and gas prices were a problem before the Ukraine war, and economists generally agree that a COVID relief package passed last spring, which injected more money into the economy, exacerbated inflation.

Bankers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in fact, have pointed out that while inflation has been a problem for developed countries post-COVID lockdowns, inflation in the U.S. far outpaced those countries, proving domestic policies drove our inflation problems.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-confronts-karine-jean-pierre-inflation-janet-yellen-admission,2022-06-02
Philadelphia Inquirer says Biden not to blame for high gas prices,"The Philadelphia Inquirer editorial board is telling people not to attribute soaring gas prices to President Joe Biden.

In a piece titled ""Don’t blame Biden for higher gas prices,"" the editorial board pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as supply and demand factors related to the COVID-19 downturn as reasons for the high cost of fuel.

""Current pump prices are due largely to the basic economics of supply and demand. Much of the global economy shut down during the pandemic, and oil prices plummeted as demand evaporated virtually overnight,"" the piece states. ""As demand dried up, oil companies cut back on production and exploration. When the economy bounced back, demand for oil increased but production has not been able to keep pace. With demand far outstripping supply, prices have skyrocketed.""

The piece said that Biden's Build Back Better spending proposal contained ""tax credits for wind and solar power"" and ""an extension of Biden’s child tax credit, which provided $300 in monthly payments to help struggling families, which could offset some of the pain they're feeling at the pump.""



""Voters wanting to cast blame might want to turn their attention to Sen. Joe Manchin (D.-W.Va.) and the Republicans in the House and Senate who opposed efforts to boost green energy and support the child tax credit. These high gas prices aren’t Joe Biden’s fault,"" the editorial board declared.

Biden has urged Congress to suspend the federal gas tax. Such a move would not lead to substantial savings for financially beleaguered drivers because the federal gas tax is a bit higher than 18 cents per gallon, while the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas was $4.94 as of Thursday.

""Make no mistake about it, President Biden's assault on our energy industry has caused gas prices to skyrocket in Pennsylvania and harmed thousands of jobs across the country,"" tweeted Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Republican who is currently running for a U.S. Senate seat in the Keystone State.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/philadelphia-inquirer-dont-blame-biden,2022-06-24
"Piers Morgan shreds 'shameless' liberal hypocrisy after Donald Trump Jr.'s appearance on 'The View,' praises his spirit: 'He gave as good as he got'","""Good Morning Britain"" co-anchor and former CNN host Piers Morgan blasted the women on ""The View"" for their liberal hypocrisy following last week's explosive interview with Donald Trump Jr.

What are the details?

In a lengthy diatribe published in the Daily Mail, Morgan called Trump Jr's appearance on the long-running daytime talk show ""ballsy,"" and highlighted ""barefaced lying liberal celebrity hypocrisy.""

Morgan pointed out that before Trump even appeared on the show, celebrities were foaming at the mouth over the president's son's appearance.

One such critic was ""Will and Grace"" actress Debra Messing, who has a history of spouting liberal platitudes from her Twitter pedestal. Messing tweeted, ""Why would you bring him on?"" and tagged the show. ""You trying to be 'balanced?'""

Messing added, ""He and his family have assaulted our country, our democracy, our environment, our national security, moral compass. Very very disappointing and irresponsible decision.""

""Nobody's allowed to be 'balanced' about President Trump anymore,"" Morgan quipped. ""There is, of course, no legitimate reason why Donald Trump Jr. should not be a guest on ABC's excellent and top-rated flagship daytime panel show.""

Morgan pointed out that in addition to being secure in his own right, Trump Jr. is a ""smart, amusing, and combative character"" who is good on television and performed well during last week's appearance on ""The View.""

""In fact, it was one of the wildest daytime talk show interviews I can ever remember watching, accompanied by constant raucous boos and cheers from the audience,"" he said. ""For Trump Jr. turned the tables on some of his family's most savage critics, and exposed their searing hypocrisy.""

Morgan pointed to Trump's decision to tweet out an article that named the alleged Ukraine whistleblower, which drew much more than raised eyebrows from the women of ""The View."" Trump insisted that he didn't commit a crime as a private citizen for sharing the article.

Calling out the behaviors

During the highly charged appearance, the panel of women also called out President Donald Trump's alleged behaviors contained on the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape, professing that he would grab women ""by the p***y.""

Trump Jr. responded by sidelining the remark, pointing out that ""we've all done things we regret."" He turned the tables once more and pointed out that co-host Joy Behar once dressed up in blackface as a ""beautiful African woman"" despite her protestations of being ""woke."" She insisted that she never did such a thing, but during a 2016 airing of the show, Behar admitted to dressing up in a Halloween costume and significantly darkened her complexion.

""Trump Jr. then turned to Goldberg and accused HER of downplaying fugitive child rapist Roman Polanski's criminal conduct,"" Morgan added. ""'Whoopi, you've said Roman Polanski.. it wasn't 'rape-rape' when he raped a child.'""

Morgan continued, ""By reminding Goldberg of her shocking statement, Trump Jr. also reminded us all of Hollywood's outrageous on-going support for Polanski, which is staggeringly hypocritical in this #MeToo era where liberals bay for blood at the slightest suggestion of sexual bad behavior.""

Morgan also pointed out that liberals don't often want to remove the plank from their own eyes before attempting to remove the speck from Republicans' eyes.

""[Liberals] don't want to give any attention to the increasingly suspicious-looking activities of Hunter Biden in the Ukraine, who, as Trump Jr. pointed out, was 'getting boards of companies and languages he can't speak, in companies he knows nothing about,'"" Morgan recalled.

""The fact liberal celebrities don't care about the Biden side of this scandal comes back to Debra Messing's fury at the b-word: balance,"" Morgan reasoned. ""Or lack of it.""

What about the book?

He also pointed out that while Trump Jr.'s appearance was supposed to be based on his new book, ""Triggered,"" none of the co-hosts even broached the topic of the new book, calling it an ""extraordinary discourtesy.""

""It took guts for Trump Jr. to go into the lionesses' den yesterday and he got the savaging he expected,"" Morgan added. ""But he gave as good as he got, and in doing so, he also exposed much of the shameless hypocrisy and selective outrage that pervades the liberal celebrity anti-Trump mindset.""

Morgan concluded by warning liberal celebrities that their antics will only further secure a 2020 win for Trump.

""The high moral ground is a very precarious place,"" he wrote. ""And as I keep warning, the higher hypocritical liberal celebrities try to mount it, the easier they make it for President Trump to get re-elected.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/piers-morgan-blasts-liberal-hypocrisy-of-the-view-after-donald-trump-jr-appearance,2019-11-11
"NATO to convene emergency session after suspected Russian missile lands in Poland, killing 2 citizens","Tensions were significantly heightened in eastern Europe after a suspected Russian missile landed in Poland and killed two Polish civilians as the war in Ukraine continued into its eighth month.

A senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed the lethal missile strike on Tuesday on the NATO ally.

The strike was reported in the city of Przewodów, on the border with Ukraine.

The Russian defense ministry issued a statement denying responsibility for the incident and calling it a ""deliberate provocation"" in order to escalate hostilities in the region.

President Joe Biden said in a tweet from his official social media account that he had met with the Polish president to discuss the incident.

""I spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland to express my deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland and offer our full support for Poland's investigation of the explosion,"" Biden tweeted. ""We will remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as it proceeds.""

When he was asked by reporters if he could say what he knew about the explosion, however, he simply responded, ""No.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded by issuing a forceful statement by video.

“Hitting NATO territory with missiles,"" he said. ""This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a really significant escalation. Action is needed.""

Poland convened an emergency national security meeting leading to some concern over whether the missile attack would trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all members.

Ukraine celebrated the retreat of Russian troops from the key city of Kherson in the last few days before the missile explosion. Some suspected the missile attack could be retaliation for the retreat.

Poland and other states bordering Russia have been on alert since the start of the Ukraine invasion. Putin has openly warned many of the former Soviet states that they historically belong to Russia, and those states have responded by significantly increasing their defensive war capabilities.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted about the incident in Poland.

""Concerning news from Poland tonight on at least two explosions. Keeping a close contact with our Polish friends. Lithuania stands in strong solidarity with Poland,"" Nauseda wrote.

""Every inch of NATO territory must be defended!"" he added.

Nauseda went on to refer to Russia as a ""terrorist regime"" in a Facebook post.

"Poland, NATO: Missile 'very likely' fired into Poland by Ukrainian forces in 'tragic incident'","American and European officials now believe the explosion that killed two people in Poland near the country's border with Ukraine was ""very likely"" caused by Ukrainian air defenses. Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that ""there is no evidence that it was launched by the Russian side.""

What are the details?

Amid a brutal Russian missile barrage targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure on Tuesday, an explosion rocked the Polish village of Przewodów, just five miles away from the Ukrainian border. Two farm workers were killed.

Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of a ""major escalation.""

While Polish combat planes were scrambled, Warsaw summoned Russia's ambassador.

A Russian attack on Poland would have been sufficient to trigger articles 4 and 5 of the NATO charter, potentially putting the U.S. into direct conflict with the nuclear power.

Duda, President Joe Biden, and the leaders of other allied countries held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to collectively determine their next steps. In the talks, Biden condemned the ""scores and scores of missile attacks in western Ukraine.""

Hours later, the Polish president indicated on Twitter that the explosion was instead an “unfortunate accident” caused by a ""S-300 rocket made in the Soviet Union, an old rocket and there is no evidence that it was launched by the Russian side.""

Barron's reported that the Russian defense ministry corroborated the Polish president's statement, stating, ""Photographs of the wreckage ... were unequivocally identified by Russian military experts as fragments of a guided anti-aircraft missile of a Ukrainian S-300 air defence system.""

""It is highly probable that it was fired by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defense,"" added Duda.



Duda noted that ""there are many indications that it was an air defense missile, which unfortunately fell on Polish territory.""



Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed the claim that the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile, calling it a Russian ""conspiracy theory.""

According to Kiev, Russia launched over 90 missiles into Ukraine on Tuesday, 77 of which the Ukrainian military allegedly shot down.

The Guardian reported that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg similarly suggested that, on the basis of preliminary analysis, it appears that ""the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks.""

""We have no indication that this was the result of a deliberate attack,"" said Stoltenberg, ""and no indication that Russia is preparing offensive military actions against NATO.""

While it may have been a Ukrainian missile, Stoltenberg stressed that the ""tragic incident"" is ""not Ukraine’s fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.""



This sentiment was also expressed by Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski, who indicated that ""we are dealing with a consequence of Russia's actions.""

In concurrence with Duda and Stoltenberg, Biden suggested Wednesday morning that it is ""unlikely in the lines of the trajectory that [the missile] was fired from Russia, but we’ll see.”

'Be calm'

In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a forceful statement, saying, ""Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died.""

Zelenskyy, keen on NATO's formal induction into the war, said, ""The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be to anyone within reach of Russian missiles. To fire missiles at NATO territory! This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a very significant escalation. We must act!""

The Russians also jumped to conclusions.

The Washington Post reported that the Russian defense ministry intimated that the explosion was a false flag attack, calling it ""a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation.""

Polish President Andrzej Duda did not, however, jump to conclusions. He indicated that an investigation was under way and advised people to ""be calm.""

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki suggested that it may not be necessary to invoke NATO's Article 4. Nevertheless, NATO is set to meet on Wednesday at the request of Poland.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poland-nato-missile-very-likely-fired-into-poland-by-ukrainian-forces-in-tragic-incident,2022-11-16
Poland will not take or pay for any more COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer,"Poland has informed the European Commission and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer that it will no longer accept nor pay for any more COVID-19 vaccines for now, Poland's health minister said Tuesday.

The decision to stop taking vaccine doses will set up a legal battle under a supply contract the European Union has negotiated with vaccine manufacturers.

Poland and other EU member nations have been paying for and receiving vaccine doses under agreements between the European Union and vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer is the chief supplier for Poland, Reuters reported.

Currently, the country has 25 million COVID-19 vaccines in storage and another 67 million to 70 million doses on order, according to the private news channel TVN24. But compared to other European nations, Poland has reported a below-average vaccine uptake. Just 59% of the country's 38 million people have been fully vaccinated, and only 31% have received a booster shot, below the EU average of 72.5% and nearly 53%, respectively.



As such, Poland's health minister said the country has a surplus of vaccine doses and does not intend to pay for any more.

""We asked both the European Commission and the main vaccine producing companies ... to spread these deliveries over 10 years and — most importantly — to pay when we receive vaccines,"" health minister Adam Niedzielski reportedly told TVN24 in an interview.

""Unfortunately, here we faced complete inflexibility on the part of the producers,” he said. “There was no way that we could seriously change the terms of this contract, and this contract was signed in a crisis situation.""

Niedzielski explained that Poland has triggered a clause in its legal agreement with the European Commission and Pfizer to stop taking additional vaccine doses.



""At the end of last week, we used the force majeure clause and informed both the European Commission and the main vaccine producer that we are refusing to take these vaccines at the moment and we are also refusing to pay,"" he said.



""Indeed, the consequence of this will be a legal conflict, which is already taking place,"" he added.



According to the health minister, Poland cannot directly terminate the contract with Pfizer because the agreement is between Pfizer and the European Commission.

Pfizer's contract to supply vaccine doses to Poland alone is worth more than 6 billion zlotys ($1.4 billion), with more than 2 billion zlotys spent on vaccines for 2022.

In a comment to Reuters, Pfizer said its contract to supply vaccines to EU member states is with the European Commission.

""Our discussions with Governments and the details of vaccine deliveries are confidential,"" Pfizer said.

European Commission health spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker said Tuesday that member states were bound by contractual obligations to continue purchasing vaccines, but that the commission understands Poland's ""difficult position.""

""We continue to facilitate discussion between the Polish government and the company in order to find a pragmatic solution to this specific situation the country is confronted with,"" he said.

Niedzielski said that Poland and 10 other EU countries have petitioned the EU to loosen regulations on COVID-19 vaccine contracts to allow for flexibility to spend money on health care for refugees from the war between Russia and Ukraine.

""We, in particular, and I am talking about Poland here, currently have financial pressures related to the influx of refugees, so we also feel that, on the EU scale, we have a certain right to expect special instruments that will give us ... greater flexibility in the contracts,"" Niedzielski said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poland-will-not-take-or-pay-for-any-more-covid-19-vaccines-from-pfizer,2022-04-19
"Polish national team refuses to play Russia in the World Cup playoffs, Swedish and Czech teams also boycott","Poland’s national soccer team is refusing to play Russia in a 2022 World Cup playoff match in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.



The president of the Polish football association, Cezary Kulesza, said that the Polish national team “does not intend” to participate in the playoff match, the BBC reported.

In a joint statement, members of the Polish team said, “We, the players of the Polish national team, together with the Polish Football Association, decided that as a result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, we do intend to play in the playoff match against Russia.”

“It is not an easy decision,” the statement continued, “But there are more important things in life than football. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian nation.”

Polish footballer Robert Lewandowksi said, “It is the right decision! I can’t imagine playing a march with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening.”

Cezary Kulesza, the current president of the Polish Football Association, said, “Due to the escalation of the aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine the Polish national team does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia.”



Polish President Andrezj Duda replied to Kulesza’s statement saying, “Rightly so, Mr. President. You don’t play with bandits!”



Poland’s Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also chimed in saying, “You cannot play a match against Russia under such circumstances … Thank you so much for this decision.”

National teams from Sweden and the Czech Republic joined Poland in a joint statement.

The Swedish and Czech teams are to play each other in a playoff match and whichever team wins would likely advance to play the Russian team in the World Cup tournament.

The Swedish team said on Twitter that they “will not play against Russia – regardless of where the match is played.” In a statement, the team said, “The Federal Board also urges FIDA to cancel the playoff matches in March in which Russia participates.”

On Saturday, Roman Abramovich, Russian billionaire and owner of the Chelsea Football Club, handed over the “stewardship and care” of the Premier League club to the trustees of its charitable foundation. Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, forfeited ownership of the team after the British parliament pressured him to do so in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported.



Abramovich said, “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/polish-national-team-refuses-to-play-russia-in-the-world-cup-playoffs-swedish-and-czech-teams-also-boycott,2022-02-26
Media outlet celebrates Vladimir Putin for speeding up the 'green revolution' — but makes ironic admission,"Politico Europe is celebrating Russian President Vladimir Putin for accelerating the ""green revolution.""

Wait, seriously?

The news outlet published its inaugural ""Green 28"" list of the ""power players"" driving Europe's push to fight climate change and transition to so-called ""green energy."" This year, the outlet named Putin the most influential figure.

""It took a war criminal to speed up Europe’s green revolution,"" Politico Europe said.

""By invading Ukraine and manipulating energy supplies to undermine European support for Kyiv, Russian President Vladimir Putin has achieved something generations of green campaigners could not — clean energy is now a fundamental matter of European security,"" the outlet added.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which forced Western countries to enact heavy sanctions on Moscow, indeed exposed Europe's over-reliance on Russian oil.

That dependence laid bare Europe's energy vulnerabilities, which has generated a ""green surge,"" according to Politico Europe.

""We will look back at this situation in 10 years time and see, OK, that was the moment where we really got serious about the green transition and we really had the big green acceleration,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, a climate and energy policy expert.

Ironically, the article even admitted that Europe's energy crisis has driven a new reliance on coal power, which will cause ""a surge in emissions.""

What was the reaction?

Celebrating Putin's ""achievement"" earned Politico Europe widespread mockery online, especially considering that Europe has increased its use of coal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politico-europe-vladimir-putin-green-energy,2022-10-13
Politico reporter verifies authenticity of Hunter Biden emails after outlet claimed they were Russian disinformation,"A new book from Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger reportedly confirms the authenticity of at least two emails from Hunter Biden's laptop, vindicating the New York Post's reporting from last October on the Biden family's business dealings with Ukrainian partners.

Politico's Playbook newsletter reports that in Schreckinger's new book, ""The Bidens: Inside the First Family's Fifty-Year Rise to Power,"" an independent source who had access to Hunter Biden's emails confirmed that he received a 2015 email from a top executive at Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, thanking him for a meeting with Joe Biden, who was vice president at the time.

A 2017 email detailing a ""lucrative"" deal with a Chinese energy company that included a proposed equity breakdown for the parties involved and included the line, ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" was also verified.

""Emails released by a Swedish government agency also match emails in the leaked cache, and two people who corresponded with Hunter Biden confirmed emails from the cache were genuine,"" Politico reported.

The contents of Hunter Biden's laptop were reported by the New York Post last October, ahead of the 2020 presidential election. At the time, the Donald Trump campaign alleged that Joe Biden had misused his office as vice president by pressuring government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma. His son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the company's board.

The emails reported by the Post suggested that Joe Biden had repeatedly lied about not being involved in Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and raised questions about Biden's conduct as vice president.

However, the Post's reporting was censored by social media companies like Facebook, which suppressed the articles distribution, and Twitter, which outright banned users from sharing the article. Facebook claimed that its fact-checkers needed time to review the accuracy of the Post's report while Twitter said the news story violated its Hacked Materials Policy.

Meanwhile, many mainstream media news outlets either refused to discuss the Post story or attacked the story as Russian disinformation. Politico in October 2020 reported a letter from more than 50 senior intelligence officials who accused the Hunter Biden emails of having ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""

After that report, Joe Biden's campaign insisted that videos, text messages, and emails from Hunter Biden's laptop were a Russian hoax. Biden claimed during one presidential debate that ""50 former national intelligence folks"" told him it was a ""Russian plant.""

Anything else?

Journalist Glenn Greenwald blasted ""Big Tech's censoring this reporting"" in a Twitter thread condemning journalists who had ignored the story because they wanted Joe Biden to win the election.

""People complaining about pre-election censorship by Google in Russia cheered Big Tech's censoring this reporting,"" Greenwald said.

He took his former employer, The Intercept, to task for writing articles that supported the claims from intelligence officials denouncing the Hunter Biden email story without investigating the accuracy of their assertions.

He also criticized Facebook for suppressing the Hunter Biden story, noting that ""life-long Dem operative"" Andy Stone serves as the company's policy communications director.

Greenwald also called out NPR's Public Editor for refusing to publish news stories on Hunter Biden's emails and CNN's Christiane Amanpour for claiming it wasn't a journalist's job to verify the emails.

""The pre-election joint censorship campaign by the media, Big Tech & CIA was always a gigantic story. The CIA spun an outright lie about these docs that helped these platforms censor the docs while *journalists* cheered that,"" Greenwald said. ""In light of this new book, it's time to re-visit it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politico-reporter-verifies-authenticity-of-hunter-biden-emails,2021-09-21
PolitiFact rates Fox host's claim about Russian oil as 'mostly false' even while admitting she was spot-on,"Fact-checking website PolitiFact recently engaged in some head-scratching analysis in an attempt to discredit a claim made by Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo — but ended up doing the exact opposite.

What are the details?

At issue were remarks made by Bartiromo during an appearance on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Feb. 22. While speaking with her fellow Fox host, Bartiromoargued that U.S. dependency on Russian oil was growing at exactly the wrong time: during unprovoked Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

At that time, the U.S. and other Western allies had, in Bartiromo's opinion, only tepidly responded to Russia's troop-building near the Ukrainian border, by refusing to curtail their imports of Russian energy resources.

As an example, Bartiromo said this: ""The United States is also reliant on Russian oil — we have doubled our imports from Russia in the last year. So, [there's] no question why President Biden is begging OPEC and others to pump more oil.""

Two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking a military conflict the likes of which mainland Europe hasn't experienced since World War II.

As of Wednesday morning, the Biden administration continued in its refusal to cut off U.S. imports of Russian oil, thereby enriching Moscow — despite harsh criticism from key members in Congress.

What did PolitiFact say?

In a Monday column, PolitiFact parachuted in to assess Bartiromo's claim that the U.S. doubled oil imports from Russia as ""mostly false.""

The fact-checker suggested that when crude oil imports and refined products imports such as gasoline and kerosene are combined, it shows the year-over-year increase to be 28%, not 50%.

But that's not how oil imports are typically categorized. Normally, oil imports and energy imports — which include refined products — are categorized separately. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which PolitiFact cites multiple times, shows as much by breaking down crude oil imports in a separate chart.

A spokesperson for Bartiromo evidently explained this to PolitiFact, resulting in the fact-checker admitting, ""The U.S. more than doubled its crude oil imports from Russia, to about 208,000 barrels a day in the first 11 months of 2021, from 76,000 barrels a day in 2020.""

Amazingly, that wasn't enough for the fact-checker to change its assessment, even while it openly admitted that Bartiromo's specific claim was accurate.

""But Bartiromo’s broader point was about the extent of U.S. reliance on Russian oil, which remains fairly modest,"" the article went on to say. ""Russia accounted for only about 3% of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021 — a 2 percentage point increase from 2020.""



It seems, to cover its tracks, the fact-checker switched gears to argue that Bartiromo's apparent broader point was overstated since Russian imports only make up a relatively small portion of U.S. oil imports as a whole.

But that wasn't the specific claim that PolitiFact was examining, and so its assessment should be changed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politifact-bartiromo-mostly-false-on-russian-oil,2022-03-02
"Poll: 7 in 10 Americans say the economy is in bad shape, divided on who is to blame","About 7 in 10 Americans say the nation’s economy is in bad shape, according to a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

According to the new poll, a majority of Americans do not blame President Joe Biden for high gasoline prices, but they hold his economic leadership in low regard as inflation continues to ravage their savings and spending power.

According to the poll, less than half of surveyed Americans view the jump in gas prices as Biden’s fault. Associated Press reported that this is a “reflection of how the [United States] is processing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting increase in oil costs.”

The Associated Press continued by saying that “the polls hint at a paradox in which the public views Biden as being in power without necessarily being in control. [Biden’s] hopes for a lasting economic renaissance have faded as Americans cope with higher food and energy costs. And the promise of a country no longer under the pandemic’s sway has been supplanted by the uncertainty of war in Europe.”

According to the poll, 65% of Americans currently disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy. 96% of Republicans and 36% of Democrats surveyed disapprove, and the overall number of people saying they disapprove is up from 57% in December and from 47% in July of 2021.

Overwhelmingly, the Americans surveyed were worried about the 40-year-high rates of inflation affecting the rising costs of living.

68% of people surveyed said they were “very concerned” about the rapidly rising cost of gasoline, while 59% said they were the same degree of worried about the rising cost of groceries.

Adam Newago, a 53-year-old truck driver from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, said, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.”

Newago said that he sees inflation as spiraling out of control as the rising cost of fuel spreads to other parts of the economy, affecting prices across the board for everyone, everywhere.

48% of Americans surveyed in the new poll think that the Biden administration’s policies are hurting the economy while 24% believe that the administration’s policies are helping; 28% of those surveyed think the administration’s policies haven’t made much of a difference.

80% of Democrats say that high gas prices are outside Biden’s control, while 79% of Republicans are specifically blaming his policies for rising costs and limiting energy production.

Generally, there is consensus among Republicans that Biden’s policies are hurting the American economy while Democrats are split between thinking the administration is either helping the economy or not making a difference.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-7-in-10-americans-say-the-economy-is-in-bad-shape-divided-on-who-is-to-blame,2022-03-26
"Poll: Democrats' abortion obsession not a top issue for most voters, now turning to Republicans over economic woes","According to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, Republicans now hold an advantage over the Democrats with the midterm elections just over twenty days away. Of likely voters, 49% indicated they would lean toward supporting the Republican candidate if this year's elections for Congress were held today, and 45% indicated they would support the Democrat candidate.

The poll was conducted October 9-12 and involved 792 registered voters across the United States. The New York Times noted that the margin of sampling error for the likely electorate is +/- 4.1 percentage points.

Party support

When support was broken down into age groups, the largest delta found was among likely voters ages 45 to 64, 59% of whom would lean toward voting Republican and only 38% of whom would vote Democrat. Democrats held a 12-point lead among voters ages 18 to 29 and a nine-point lead in the 30-to-44 grouping. The parties were tied in the 65+ age group.

Republicans led Democrats by 15 points with white voters, but were at a considerable deficit with black voters (with only 18% noting their support) and Hispanics (34%). Whereas 52% of college-educated white voters indicated they would vote Democrat, 63% of white voters without a college degree would support a Republican candidate for Congress.

51% of those in the southern region of the United States — adversely impacted by Democrats' lax illegal immigration enforcement measures — noted they leaned Republican.

The majority of registered independent voters and 3% of registered Democrats also suggested they would vote Republican.

The New York Times reported that women who identified as independent voters favored Democrats by 14 points back in September. That lead has dissolved such that they now back Republicans by 18 points.

The issues

Only 5% of respondents indicated that abortion — which has been an issue highlighted by Democrats — is the biggest problem facing the country today.

A plurality of respondents (26%) indicated that the economy was the top problem.

And 18% suggested that inflation, now near a four-decade high, or the cost of living was the most important.

Voters concerned with the economy and inflation preferred Republicans over Democrats 64% to 30%.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who serves as House Republican Conference chairman, recently told Fox News Digital that inflation was the ""top reason"" for what she projects will be a ""big Republican year ... because people want to stop the trillions of reckless spending that has happened under a single-party Democrat rule.""

Stefanik claimed that ""Bidenflation has been a tax on every American. ... It's more than just numbers. It's impacting the bottom line. It's a pay cut on every American.""

Notwithstanding the prospect of nuclear ""Armageddon"" raised by Biden and the ongoing war in Ukraine, only 1% of respondents claimed foreign policy to be the most pressing issue; 2% answered Russia/war in Ukraine was the top problem.



Disapproval



Of those likely voters polled, 18% indicated strong approval of Biden's performance and 21% answered they somewhat approve.

Broken down in terms of age, a standout among those who strongly approve of Biden is the 18-29 demographic, of which only 4% answered in the affirmative.

Whereas Biden's approval is lukewarm, 45% of likely voters strongly disapprove of the way he is handling his job as president. An additional 13% somewhat disapprove of the Democrat president.

Biden is also hemorrhaging previous supporters:19% of respondents who voted for Biden in 2020 now disapprove of his performance.

When asked who they would support in the 2024 presidential election if it were held today, 45% of respondents suggested they would support former President Donald Trump and 44% said they'd back President Joe Biden.

In terms of the direction the country is headed in, respondents offered a damning response: 64% of likely voters said the country was going in the wrong direction, with majorities in every age group, both sexes, all education levels, and in all regions. Nearly 40% of Biden voters held this bleak outlook.

New poll finds Dems' attacks are not hurting Trump while Elizabeth Warren collapses,"Republicans may have something else to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.

A plurality of Americans oppose impeaching President Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, according to a poll by Quinnipiac University. The study notes that two weeks of public hearings have not hurt the president's popularity with American voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents told the pollsters they oppose impeaching and removing Trump from office, while 45 percent said support it.

This is a five-point improvement from Quinnipiac's late October poll when the researchers found a net two-percentage point preference for impeaching and removing Trump, with 48 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed.

The study also found that it may be difficult to move public opinion on impeachment, as 86 precent of respondents told Quinnipiac their minds are already made up, while 13 percent said they may change their mind.

Job approval gains

The new Quinnipiac poll also showed voters are somewhat more favorable toward the job Trump is doing as president with 40 percent of all registered voters approving of the job he is doing, while 54 percent disapprove, a difference of 14 percentage points.

Although Trump may have a 14-point job approval deficit in this survey, it is a net six-point improvement for the president compared to the 38 to 58 percent approval rating, a 20-point gap, that Quinnipiac found in its October 23 poll. The pollsters note that Trump's current approval ratings are within the range of where his job approval rating has been over the past two years.

It should be noted that Trump's stable poll numbers come as the Media Research Center reported recently that 96 percent of nightly broadcast TV news coverage of the president has been unfavorable since the impeachment scandal broke in September.

Bad news for the left

The pollsters also found bad news for progressive Democrats.

Over the past month, support for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been cut in half as her campaign struggles to resonate with Democratic primary voters. In October, Quinnipiac reported that the progressive Democratic senator led the field with 28 percent support. However, Warren now finds herself in third place with only 14 percent support, behind former vice president Joe Biden (24 percent) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (16 percent).

The poll also found that ""Medicare for All has grown increasingly unpopular among all American voters."" Only 36 percent of voters say Medicare For All would be a good idea, compared to a majority (52 percent) who say it is a bad idea. This is a sharp decline in the popularity of progressive Democrats' signature healthcare proposal, which was favored by 51 percent of Americans as recently as August 2017.

Poll: Majority of Dems would flee the US during invasion,"As Ukrainians valiantly fight to defend their nation against a Russian invasion, a Quinnipiac University national poll of U.S. adults asked people whether they would fight or flee if they faced that situation — the poll found that while a whopping 68% Republicans said they would remain and fight, just 40% of Democrats said they would stick around and fight. Among independents, 57% said they would stay and fight.

Just 25% of Republicans and 36% of independents indicated that they would leave the U.S., while 52% of Democrats said they would depart, according to the poll conducted March 4 to March 6.

Overall, 55% of people in the poll said they would remain and fight, while 38% indicated they would depart the country.

A strong majority (71%) indicated that they would back a ban on Russian oil even if such a move would result in higher gas prices in America.



More than half (60%) in the poll thought that Russian President Vladimir Putin is mentally unbalanced, while just 21% thought that the Russian figure is stable mentally.

Russia has been wreaking death and destruction in Ukraine, killing many during the invasion, including civilians.

The Associated Press reported that at The Hague, Netherlands, and Ukraine urged the International Court of Justice to call for a halt of the Russian onslaught.

Russia ""is resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare, encircling cities, cutting off escape routes and pounding the civilian population with heavy ordnance,"" Jonathan Gimblett of Ukraine’s legal team said, according to the outlet.

Poll shows majority of voters think Hunter Biden's Ukrainian job was 'inappropriate' — and it's hurting Joe Biden's campaign,"A new poll aims to gauge voter attitudes about the controversy of Hunter Biden's job at a Ukraine energy company, and it is not good news for his father's presidential campaign.

The results from the Morning Consult/Politico poll were published on Thursday. More than half of voters, 52%, say that Hunter Biden's job at Burisma was ""inappropriate,"" while only 18% thought it was appropriate.

His tenure at Burisma came at a time when Joe Biden served as vice president in former President Obama's administration, prompting critics to accuse him of influencing U.S. policy to benefit his son and his company.

In the poll, 57% of voters also said that it amounted to a scandal, and only 19% said it did not.

Also, 30% said that the scandal would make them less likely to vote for Biden.

Hunter Biden is also embroiled in a paternity suit by a former stripper who worked at a Washington, D.C., bar he frequented.

Once considered the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary contest, Joe Biden's fortunes have fallen after his disastrous performance in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.

If he cannot recover with a strong showing in South Carolina, the focus in the primary contest will fall on socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).

Poll: Nearly three quarters of Americans agree Putin's invasion of Ukraine was unjustified,"If there is one issue that the vast majority of Americans can agree on, it's opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Nearly three quarters of Americans said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was unjustified, and 76% of those surveyed gave an unfavorable opinion of the warmonger-in-chief, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll.

This survey of 1.523 U.S. adults was conducted online between Feb. 24 and 27 and shows a large swing in public opinion against Russia and in favor of Ukraine.

Three weeks ago, before the invasion began, 49% of Americans said the U.S. should remain neutral while 46% said America should side with Ukraine in a potential conflict with Russia, Yahoo News reports. Now, after millions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the conflict and pictures and videos from the war have circulated on social media, U.S. adults are more than twice as likely to advocate for siding with Ukraine (57%) than remaining neutral (25%).

Strong majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and self-identified independents say that the invasion of Ukraine was unjustified. Overall, 74% of U.S. adults said Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine was not justified, 20% were not sure, and 6% said the invasion was justified. Nearly half of survey respondents (47%) agree that it is in America's best interests to stop Russia and help Ukraine. Just 26% overall said ""the conflict is none of America's business,"" though more Republicans (30%) and independents (33%) said so than Democrats (17%).

Americans also appear to be in broad agreement with how the U.S. should respond to the war, with 56% of survey respondents saying they favor the sanctions imposed on Russia by President Joe Biden. Even 53% of Republicans said they favor Biden's sanctions, which cut off Russia's government from accessing Western banks and financial markets. And most Americans are opposed to military intervention, with 56% agreeing with Biden's vow ""not to send troops to Ukraine""; only 15% disagree.

However, a plurality of those polled, 39%, said Biden was ""not tough enough"" on Russia, while 28% said Biden's response has been ""about right."" Just 4% said Biden has been ""too tough."" Only a third of Americans approve of how Biden has handled ""the situation with Russia and Ukraine."" Almost half of those polled (48%) said they disapprove, while 17% are unsure.

Slightly more respondents (40%) said that former President Donald Trump would have handled the situation in Ukraine better than Biden (38%).

Most Americans (62%) would like to see the U.S. take further action against Russia, either through ""more economic sanctions"" (33%), ""military force"" (3%), or both (26%).

The American public is paying attention to the war in Ukraine, with more than two-thirds (70%) saying they're following news updates about Ukraine at least ""somewhat closely."" The Russian-Ukraine war is now tied with inflation for what Americans think should be Biden's top priority as president. The president's response to war in Europe will be one of the defining moments of his legacy.

"Biden, poll, job approval, worse off","A recent Fox News national poll of registered voters found that 58% believe that the nation is worse off now than a year prior, and 56% disapprove of President Biden's job performance.

Just 35% felt that the nation is better off now than a year back, while only 43% approve of Biden's job performance.

The poll is bad news for Biden, who is slated to deliver his State of the Union address next week.

While 41% strongly disapprove of Biden's job performance, 15% somewhat disapprove, 25% somewhat approve, and only 18% approve strongly.



Biden is also underwater on specific issues, with a whopping 61% disapproving of how the president is dealing with the economy, 62% disapproving on immigration, 59% disapproving on crime, 58% disapproving on foreign policy, and 51% disapproving on COVID-19.

But not only has Biden earned poor grades on his job performance across the board, 53% felt that he lacks the mental fitness to effectively execute his role as president.

""Conducted February 19-22, 2022 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News national poll includes interviews among 1,001 registered voters who were randomly selected from a national voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones,"" the poll notes.

"Poll showing 'record support' for Trump impeachment was 'misrepresented' by polling agency, analysis finds","A Fox News poll published last week discovered ""record support"" for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

The survey found that 51 percent of voters want Trump impeached and removed from office, while just 40 percent of voters do not want the president impeached. The poll showed a significant jump in those who want Trump's impeachment from July. At the time, just 42 percent of voters said they want Trump impeached.

However, according to an analysis by the New York Post, the polling firm that conducted the survey — Braun Research — underrepresented Republicans and Independents, therefore skewing the poll's results.

A more accurate voter representation would have resulted in nearly identical results for pro-impeachment and anti-impeachment support, the Post found.

From the Post:

Princeton, New Jersey, pollster Braun Research, which conducted the survey, noted 48% of its respondents were Democrats. But the actual breakdown of party-affiliation is 31% Democrat, 29% Republican and 38% independent, according to Gallup.



A poll weighted for party affiliation would have concluded that 44.9% favored impeachment and 44.4% opposed it, a Post analysis has concluded.

In response to the poll, which received widespread attention in the media due to the significance of the results, Trump bashed the polling firm and Fox News.

""From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days,"" he wrote on Twitter last Thursday.

Still, other polling conducted in recent weeks suggests that support for Trump'simpeachment is on the rise.

In a statement provided to TheBlaze, Fox News vice president of public opinion research Dana Blanton said Fox News stands by the poll's results.

""Our polling unit has long been held in high regard for being a nonpartisan source of research. Under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), the latest FNC poll included interviews with randomly chosen registered voters and — as is our standard practice — we reported the partisan distribution we found among the electorate. Braun Research is solely our data collection partner,"" Blanton said. ""We stand by our latest poll.""

Poll finds bad news for Democrats in impeachment effort,"A new ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that while Americans are sharply divided over whether President Donald Trump should be impeached and removed from office due to his dealings with the Ukraine, they are generally distrustful of Democrats' handling of the investigative process.

The nationwide survey of 1,003 adults asked respondents: ""Based on what you know, do you think Congress should or should not impeach Trump and remove him from office?""

Forty-nine percent responded Congress should impeach and remove the 45th president from office, while 47 percent said it should not. Opinions were largely split along party lines.

Bad news for Democrats

The survey also shows significant vulnerabilities for Democrats. Despite Americans' mixed views on whether Trump should be impeached, 50 percent disapprove of how the Democrats in Congress have handled the process thus far, compared to 44 percent who approve. Meanwhile, 65 percent percent say initial hearings should be public, a rebuke of House Democrats who have held confidential hearings up to now.

The poll also sheds light on whether Americans believe the Democrats' investigation into Trump is in good-faith or politically-motivated.

Pollsters asked: ""In investigating Trump, do you think the Democrats in Congress are mainly interested in upholding the Constitution, or mainly interested in hurting Trump politically?"" To this, 51 percent of respondents said Democrats are more interested in hurting Trump, while 43 percent said their priority is to uphold the Constitution.

What else?

Of course, the poll is not all good news for Republicans. Similar to other studies, the ABC News/Washington Post survey found that 55 percent of Americans believe President Trump likely did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, compared to 35 percent who say he is innocent of wrongdoing. By a similar 60 to 31 percent margin, most Americans believe it was inappropriate for the president to involve his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in U.S. policy dealings involving Ukraine.

Given how sharply divided public opinion is over whether the president should be impeached, we can deduce that not all Americans who believe Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine believe it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Moreover, it is important to note that recent polls show Americans are turning on the Democrats' 2020 candidates.

For instance, an October 2019 survey by The Economist and YouGov found 51 percent of Americans view former Vice President Joe Biden unfavorably, compared to a 42 percent favorable rating. With voters skeptical of the nature and handling of the impeachment inquiry, President Trump could convince Americans the effort is merely a political stunt aimed at undoing an election and install an unpopular Democrat in the White House next year. In fact, this is precisely the case that House Republicans have been pressing for weeks.

Will it work?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll_finds_bad_news_democrats_impeachment,2019-11-02
Poll finds a tight presidential race and bad news for Democrats in key battleground states,"With one year to go to Election Day 2020, a New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday morning shows trouble for Democrats heading into next year.



Although President Donald Trump is ensnared in a major controversy regarding his dealings with Ukraine, the poll of registered voters finds him leading Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), tied with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and down two points from former Vice President Joe Biden in an average of the results across the key battleground states.

Among likely voters, the data is slightly more favorable for Trump showing him leading Warren by three points; up one point against Sanders; and down one versus Biden in the same states.

How do the numbers look?

The researchers interviewed 3,766 voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina. Democrats have to win at least three of these states to clinch the Electoral College.

Among Registered Voters:



Michigan: Trump tied with Biden; Trump +2 over Sanders; Trump +6 over Warren

Trump tied with Biden; Trump +2 over Sanders; Trump +6 over Warren Pennsylvania: Biden +3 over Trump; Sanders +1 over Trump; Trump tied with Warren

Warren seen as too radical

The Times notes that while Biden currently fares the best against Trump among the Democrats tested, the poll results do not necessarily bode well for him.

""His appeal to Democrats hinges on the view that he's a safe bet against the president, yet his lead against Mr. Trump is not nearly so comfortable that he could be considered a sure thing,"" wrote reporter Nate Cohn.

This study also found that swing state voters expressed concerns with the ideology and likability of Warren, who many consider the current front-runner of the race as she currently leads the Democratic field in the primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire:



The results suggest that Ms. Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, might face a number of obstacles in her pursuit of the presidency. The poll supports concerns among some Democrats that her ideology and gender — including the fraught question of ""likability"" — could hobble her candidacy among a crucial sliver of the electorate. And not only does she underperform her rivals, but the poll also suggests that the race could be close enough for the difference to be decisive.

Moreover, as the Times' analysis shows, there are a considerable number of voters who would be willing to back Biden but not Warren:

Dawn Marshall, an independent from Tampa, Fla., said that with the exception of Mr. Biden, the Democrats running for president are too left-leaning for her. ""They want to be socialists, and this is not a socialistic country,"" she said. ""This is a working country where people go out, do the best that they can do, find jobs. I am so sick and tired of having to support other folks. We can't be equal.""

The Times/Siena poll also points to exceptionally high voter turnout next year.

""More than 90 percent of registered voters say they're 'almost certain' or 'very likely to vote,'"" said Cohn in his analysis while noting this exceeds the 87 percent who told pollsters the same thing in the weeks leading up the 2016 election.

Democrats are also struggling to make inroads with the same kind of voters who were critical to Trump's 2016 victory, according to the Times:

The poll offers little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016, at least so far. All the leading Democratic candidates trail in the precincts or counties that voted for Barack Obama and then flipped to Mr. Trump.

The study also found that nearly two-thirds of 2016 Trump voters who backed Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections said they would support the president in his re-election effort.

This writer's perspective: Problematic for Dems

Certainly, some of the data cut both ways. For instance, 55 percent of 2016 third-party voters are indicating they would back Biden over Trump in 2020. However, overall, this poll has to raise red flags among Democrats. Consider that the president's approval ratings have been stable in the low 40s; 92% of the media coverage concerning him is negative; and he's in the middle of a major scandal. Yet, he is beating the Democrats' front-runner (Warren) and within striking distance of their most electable candidate, Biden.

Of course, we are one year out and things could change. A greater share of Americans could sour on the president due to the impeachment inquiry. Conversely, unsavory headlines about the Democrats could emerge and the Trump campaign has not ramped up its negative advertising against Democrats (though, as Biden strategist Steve Schale pointed out to me on Twitter Monday morning, Team #KAG has already begun taking shots at the former vice president).

Nonetheless, what this poll shows is that the president's coalition is largely sticking by him and a significant chunk of swing voters are turned off by Warren who is leading the pack in Iowa and New Hampshire. It is also worth noting that Biden enjoys nearly ubiquitous name recognition and is drawing support from constituencies that are not traditionally reliable Democrats. However, it remains to be seen whether these voters will stay with him throughout the next year should he win the nomination.

We have a long way to go to 2020 and by no means is President Trump in the clear, but this poll shows that if the election were held today, we could see a replay of 2016: Another long, bad night for Democrats — followed by calls to eliminate the Electoral College.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll_shows_bad_news_for_democrats,2019-11-04
"NPR reporter says Mike Pompeo 'screamed and cursed' at her, made her find Ukraine on a map","An NPR reporter claimed that her questions so angered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he ""screamed and cursed"" at her in private and demanded that she point out Ukraine on a globe.

The alleged interaction happened after Pompeo cut short an interview where Mary Louise Kelly pressed him on whether he supported Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

""I've defended every single person on this team,"" Pompeo said to Kelly. ""I've done what's right for every single person on this team.""

Yovanovitch is a central figure of the impeachment trial since the president's allies accuse her of standing in the way of investigations into corruption that could have implicated Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. She and other critics of President Donald Trump say he needed to sideline her in order to pursue politically motivated probes.

""I've said all I'm going to say today,"" Pompeo said when Kelly peppered him with questions about Yovanovitch. ""Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that.""

Kelly claims that after he cut short the interview that he leaned in and glared at her for several seconds. Pompeo then had her escorted to his private living room in the State Department where he berated her and cursed at her, according to her account.

She said that he asked her, ""do you think Americans care about Ukraine?"" with an expletive included, and also said, ""People will hear about this.""

Pompeo also allegedly demanded that Kelly point to Ukraine on a map, which she claims she did.

Critics of Pompeo were sharing the audio of the recorded exchange on social media.

New York Post opinion editor speaks out after Big Tech censors bombshell story on Hunter Biden & Ukraine,"New York Post opinion editor Sohrab Ahmari on Thursday defended the Post's reporting on Hunter Biden's emails, responded to the Joe Biden presidential campaign's denial of allegations in the Post's report, and spoke out about Facebook and Twitter censoring the story in a radio interview with BlazeTV host Glenn Beck.

On Wednesday, the New York Post published a story about a ""smoking gun"" 2015 email that appears to show Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, thanking Hunter Biden for setting up a meeting with his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic nominee for president. The story explained that this email and others were recovered from a computer allegedly connected to Hunter Biden. The Post also obtained from this computer personal photos of Biden using drugs and engaging in sex acts with an unidentified woman.

The Post's story was swiftly suppressed by both Facebook, which limited the article's distribution on its platform pending an independent fact-check, and Twitter, which outright banned users from sharing the story. After much public outcry over the censorship of the Post story, Twitter explained the rationale for preventing users from sharing the story.

""The images contained in the articles include personal and private information — like email addresses and phone numbers — which violate our rules. As noted this morning, we also currently view materials included in the articles as violations of our Hacked Materials Policy,"" Twitter said.

""Commentary on or discussion about hacked materials, such as articles that cover them but do not include or link to the materials themselves, aren't a violation of this policy,"" the social media platform added. ""Our policy only covers links to or images of hacked material themselves.""

Ahmari pushed back on Twitter's claim, defending the Post's sources.



It ""was very clear from the beginning, how we got a hold of this material,"" Ahmari said. ""It was reported deeply. Fairly. Meticulously. And it — it was based on much more solid sourcing than mountains of stories published in center left outlets over the past four years, that collapsed and were based on unalienable sources, telling unnamed sources, telling the reporter.""

""None of those got censored by the major — social media platforms, the way this story is,"" he added.

The Joe Biden campaign for president fiercely denied the allegations in the Post story.

""Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing. Trump administration officials have attested to these facts under oath,"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.

""The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story,"" Bates continued. ""They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani — whose discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported — claimed to have such materials. Moreover, we have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.""



Ahmari dismissed the denial, responding to three points in Bates' statement.

""The first element says, a bipartisan committee found that, you know, Joe Biden had done nothing wrong in Ukraine. Concluded that. That's a non sequitur. We have new evidence. Whatever the various congressional bodies found, fine, that's very nice, but we have new evidence. We have the smoking gun or the smoking crackpipe, if you will,"" Ahmari said.

""The second one was, the Post did not tell us that Rudy Giuliani was involved in obtaining this underlying material. Plenty of newspapers don't go around saying who their sources are. So that again is a non sequitur,"" he continued.

""The third thing they said was that the meeting, and this is — you know, if you know lawyers. You know PR people. They choose words very, very carefully,"" he said. ""They said, the meetings did not take place, as alleged by the New York Post. As alleged by the New York Post. So — OK. But then in a political story, they said, they couldn't rule out the possibility that an informal get-together took place.""



Ahmari pointed out that the Biden campaign's statement did not dispute the facts of the Post report.

""So Twitter and Facebook, are acting on a case, where even the person being accused in the story, isn't really denying the core facts,"" he said.

After discussing the actions Facebook and Twitter took to censor the Post story with Beck, Ahmari defended the legacy of the New York Post.

""We are talking about America's oldest continuously published newspaper, that was founded by one of our Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton. I get goose bumps when I say that about the Post,"" he said. ""So this is not some sketchy website, where they can do this to you, without consequences. This is an old newspaper. A beloved newspaper, in New York City. A paper that is a local paper. But also has a national and global voice and imprint.""

""The closest thing to an argument I saw from a Twitter safety thread they had put up, they said, this includes — you know, information that was unauthorized for release,"" Ahmari said. ""Well, my Twitter friends, let me tell you about the Pentagon papers. Let me tell you about the Trump tax story. All of journalism is practically built on disclosing things that people don't want disclosed. That's the line of work that you and I are in, Glenn.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/post-editor-big-tech-censor-biden,2020-10-15
Samantha Power says 'catastrophic' food shortages are an opportunity to implement left-wing policies,"A Biden administration member said that ""catastrophic"" food and fertilizer shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine are a great opportunity to implement left-wing policies.

Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, made the comments during an interview with ""This Week"" on Sunday.

""We're seeing global food shortages all around the world,"" said anchor George Stephanopoulos, ""as the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, what more can be done to address those shortages?""

""Thank you for posing that question, it is just another catastrophic effect of Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, I mean as if the harms in Ukraine weren't enough, you have countries like in subsaharan Africa and the Middle East who get maybe eighty, ninety percent of their wheat or their grain, overall, from Russia and Ukraine, and you see massive spikes in food prices,"" said Power.

""Food prices, right now George, globally are up 34% from where they were a year ago, aided substantially, again, by this invasion,"" she added.



Power said they were working to increase food production from farmers, but also wanted to use the opportunity to make farmers choose green energy alternatives to fertilizer.

""Fertilizer shortages are real now because Russia is a big exporter of fertilizer. And even though fertilizer is not sanctioned, less fertilizer is coming out of Russia. As a result, we're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost. And this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway,"" Power continued.



""So never let a crisis go to waste,"" she concluded.

She went on to defend the Biden administration against criticism that its policies led to high food prices.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is in its tenth week, with some estimates claiming civilian casualties as high as 2,685, and the U.S. State Dept. estimating that more than 10,000 Russian soldiers have perished in the brutal war.

Liberal Dems have egg on face over letter urging Biden to negotiate with Putin — then they take coward's way out,"The Congressional Progressive Caucus is blaming a staffer for releasing a controversial letter urging President Joe Biden to negotiate with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

What did the letter say?

The letter, signed by 30 liberal Democrats and sent by caucus chairwoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), urged Biden to make ""vigorous diplomatic efforts"" to end the Ukraine war.

The Democrats urged Biden to ""engage in direct talks with Russia, explore prospects for a new European security arrangement acceptable to all parties that will allow for a sovereign and independent Ukraine, and, in coordination with our Ukrainian partners, seek a rapid end to the conflict and reiterate this goal as America’s chief priority.""

The letter was sharply criticized by Ukrainian politicians and even some of its signatories, who claimed they endorsed it months ago but no longer support its message.

""Timing in diplomacy is everything,"" Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) said, for example. ""I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then. I wouldn't sign it today.""

But what is the caucus saying now?

On Tuesday, Jayapal withdrew the letter, noting its release committed the biggest transgression possible in Washington, D.C. — the appearance that they agree with Republicans, who want to stop sending billions of taxpayer dollars to Ukraine.

""The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine,"" Jayapal said.

Even worse, Jayapal blamed a staffer for releasing the letter without authorization.

""The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,"" she claimed. ""As Chair of the Caucus, I accept responsibility for this.

""Every war ends with diplomacy, and this one will too after Ukrainian victory,"" she went on to write. ""The letter sent yesterday, although restating that basic principle, has been conflated with GOP opposition to support for the Ukrainians’ just defense of their national sovereignty. As such, it is a distraction at this time and we withdraw the letter.""

Anything else?

Jayapal's excuse — that a staffer released the letter without approval — was summarily condemned.

""One of the more blatant attempts to throw your own staff under the bus I’ve seen since getting to Washington,"" said Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pramila-jayapal-blames-staffer-ukraine-letter,2022-10-25
Biden blames coronavirus and Putin for high prices,"As Americans continue to suffer under the heavy financial burden caused by rising prices, President Joe Biden is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and the COVID-19 pandemic for the problem.

""I know that families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it. Let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high right now: COVID and Vladimir Putin,"" a tweet on Biden's @POTUS account claimed.



The tweet comes as Americans witness the purchasing power of their savings rapidly eroded by soaring inflation.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted in a report released earlier this month. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment."" The all items index increased by ""8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March,"" according to the BLS.

Gas prices have already risen significantly since Biden took office in early 2021, and they have gone even higher since Russia started its invasion of Ukraine. As of Wednesday, AAA's national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $4.114. Biden issued an order to prohibit importing oil and other products from Russia, and Congress has also passed legislation to ban the importation of such products from Russia.



Many on social media pushed back against Biden's attempt to deflect blame for rising prices.

President Biden warned brother Frank about law firm ad,"President Joe Biden delivered a warning to his younger brother about business dealings. However, it appears that the younger brother didn't heed the warning because he recently appeared in an advertisement that touted his relationship with the commander in chief that has some raising ethics questions.

During the campaign trail, Joe Biden confronted his brother Frank Biden. Then-candidate Biden warned his younger brother about potential business dealings, ""For Christ's sake, watch yourself,"" according to Politico.

""Don't get sucked into something that would, first of all, hurt you,"" Joe allegedly told his younger brother, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation. The tone of the elder Biden was purportedly ""jocular and serious.""

""The intent of Joe Biden's initial conversation, according to the person with knowledge of the discussion, was to protect Frank from 'being hurt and vilified' in the event his big brother, 'Joey,' was elected to the most powerful position in the world,"" the report stated.

Fast forward to Inauguration Day, and Frank Biden appeared in an advertisement for Boca Raton-based Berman Law Group, where he is a non-attorney ""senior adviser.""

The ad, which appeared in the Jan. 20 edition of the Daily Business Review, features Frank Biden promoting his relationship with his brother, who is now the president of the United States.

CNBC wrote, ""The focus of the ad is to promote the firm's work on a class-action lawsuit against a group of sugar cane growers in southern Florida. The ad and Biden himself highlight the relationship to his brother, who is now the president, as a reason to work with the firm.""

""The two Biden brothers have long held a commitment to pushing environmental issues to the forefront; the president-elect has vowed to rejoin the Paris Agreement and wants to set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, for example,"" the ad states.

""My brother is a model for how to go about doing this work,"" Frank Biden says in the advertisement. ""One of his central tenets is that one should never question another man's or woman's motives or assign blame to them. That way, you avoid creating a disparity that prevents any kind of coming together. You can of course question someone's judgment, and that's what we're doing by bringing this to court.""

The ad, which promotes the firm's involvement in a class-action lawsuit against a group of sugar cane growers in southern Florida, implies that the law firm hired Frank because of the ""Biden reputation for and motivation to engage in philanthropic, social and environmental issues that presented themselves.""

Frank Biden responded to the ethics questions regarding the ad by telling CNBC, ""I have never used my brother to obtain clients for my firm. Our firm has long been involved [with] this lawsuit. Social justice is something I have been involved in for years. I will never be employed by any lobbyist or lobbying firm.""

Florida attorney and Democratic donor John Morgan defended Frank Biden. Morgan said Frank is a ""great guy,"" adding, ""I had my jet take him to the inauguration.""

Frank Biden previously had preliminary discussions about a potential business with Morgan, but reportedly ""pulled out after he was elected Palm Beach County clerk of the circuit court and comptroller.""

Morgan claims that there is a ""target"" on all of the Biden family members.



Hunter Biden has been scrutinized for his overseas business dealings. In December, there was a report that there were four federal investigations into Hunter Biden, specifically his business dealings with China and his relationship with Burisma Holdings in Ukraine.

Biden says battling inflation is his chief economic priority,"As Americans continue to get soaked by soaring inflation, President Joe Biden continues to describe inflation as his number one economic priority.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data on Friday which shows that inflation continues to fly high.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.0 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in April,"" according to the BLS. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.""

""The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981,"" the report said.

Americans have been facing skyrocketing gas prices — as of Friday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas has reached $4.986.

During a speech at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday, Biden reiterated that combatting inflation is his ""top economic priority.""

The White House has been pointing toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine as one of the main culprit's behind high inflation, and during his speech on Friday, Biden continued that practice by making a comment about Russian President Vladimir ""Putin's tax on both food and gas.""

President Biden Delivers Remarks at the Port of Los Angeles youtu.be

Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, and the U.S. has banned the importation of Russian oil and other products.

""I call on Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month, and get it to my desk, so we can lower the price of goods,"" Biden said in a statement about the consumer price index on Friday. ""And, I call on Congress to pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and complement the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring inflation down.""

President Trump calls for Mitt Romney's impeachment: 'Pompous a**',"President Donald Trump attacked Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and called for his impeachment on Saturday after the Republican lawmaker criticized Trump's request that China investigate Joe Biden.

""I'm hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats!"" the president tweeted Saturday afternoon.

He added the all-caps hashtag, ""#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.""

Trump's call for Romney's impeachment came hours after he unleashed on the Utah senator, calling him a ""pompous a**"" who ""never knew how to win.""

Trump said, ""Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!""

""Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn't give it to him). He is so bad for R's!"" he continued.

Trump's attacks come in response to Romney becoming one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize him.

On Thursday, Trump urged China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, while speaking to the media at the White House. Romney responded to Trump's comments Friday, calling them ""wrong and appalling.""

Romney was not the only Republican to break ranks to rebuke the president. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) have also condemned Trump's appeal to China.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-trump-calls-for-mitt-romneys-impeachment-over,2019-10-05
President Trump fires back over news that Rudy Giuliani is under investigation for Ukraine dealings,"President Donald Trump responded Saturday to news that his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is now under investigation for his Ukraine dealings.

""So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer,"" the president said.

The New York Times reported Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan have initiated an investigation into Giuliani to determine if the former New York City mayor ""broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine.""

The investigation also seeks to examine whether Giuliani or his associates sought to ""undermine"" Marie Yovanovitch, a top American ambassador who was recalled from Ukraine in May.

On Friday, Trump seemingly distanced himself from Giuliani, telling reporters that he was unsure if Giuliani was still his personal attorney.

The president walked back that statement Saturday during an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.

"Pro-Kremlin outlet reports nearly 10,000 Russian troops killed during Ukraine invasion — but later scrubs numbers from website, claims it was hacked","A pro-Kremlin tabloid report stated that nearly 10,000 Russians have been killed in Ukraine as a result of the ongoing invasion.

A Monday report from the New York Post stated that the figures were quickly removed from the report and that the outlet claimed that it had been hacked.

What are the details?

On Monday, Komsomolskaya Pravda, which cited the Russian Ministry of Defense, reported that at least 9,861 Russian troops were killed as a result of the incursion and that more than 16,000 soldiers had been wounded in Ukraine during the invasion.

The report, according to Insider, cited the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Later that day, the organization removed the figures from the website and later issued a statement noting that it had been hacked. According to the Post, the original version of the article was still ""accessible in the paper's online archives.""

Earlier this month, Russia released what it said was an official death toll and stated that just 498 troops had been killed in action and just 1,597 injured.

The New York Times last week issued a report stating that intelligence officials have estimated that approximately 7,000 Russian troops were killed during the war so far.

A Ukrainian spokesperson on Monday claimed that approximately 15,000 Russian troops had been killed. A spokesperson added that approximately 1,300 Ukrainians had been killed as of March 13. Neither number has been independently verified.

Anything else to know about this?

A Sunday report from the the Washington Post stated that Russian soldiers are being killed at a higher rate than Ukrainian troops.

""Russia’s attempt to conquer Ukraine could be headed toward a stalemate as heavy casualties and equipment losses take a toll on unprepared Russian forces that have failed so far to achieve any of their initial objectives, Western officials and military experts say,"" the report said.

Progressive activist locks down her social media account after backlash from bizarre Putin tweet,"A progressive activist shut down her Twitter account after receiving an avalanche of laughter and criticism over her claim about Russian President Vladimir Putin being aided by white supremacy.

Janel Forsythe identified herself as a ""communications specialist"" for non-profit organizations and for progressive causes, but her tweet about Putin had some unintended consequences.

""This isn't discussed much, but Putin very much benefits from white privilege,"" Forsythe tweeted.

""I just can't see a scenario in which a Black or Brown man running Russia would be allowed to invade Ukraine with no devastating consequences (see Crimea in 2014),"" she added.

Screenshots of the bizarre tweet was circulated among those who were amazed by her claim.

Others took to social media to mock and ridicule Forsythe.

""Incredible. Just incredible,"" replied Jason Whitlock of Blaze Media.

""We found it guys. The absolute worst Ukraine take, among stiff competition,"" responded commentator Inez Stepman.

""It is a cult. It doesn’t make sense but it doesn’t have to make sense,"" read one tweet.

""She needs inpatient therapy for this level of schizophrenia and paranoia,"" said another detractor.

""Black Putin is the answer to our problems,"" joked one user.

Forsythe protected her account so that no one could read her tweets or respond to them.

She also protected her Instagram account.

A full military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops is expected after Putin announced that they were recognizing the independence of two regions where his troops have been present for many years. The U.S. and its allies have responded with economic and financial sanctions against Russia and its leaders.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament voted to drop its restrictive gun laws in order to encourage citizens to arm themselves and defend their country.

"Project Dynamo, Ukraine, Afghanistan","Project Dynamo, which has been extracting people from Afghanistan, is also helping to get people out of Ukraine, where Russia has launched an invasion.

""We had a group of people that were on the ground we had identified that wanted to get out, especially if things went sideways,"" Project Dynamo spokesperson James Judge told Fox News. ""Bryan Stern, who is on our team, could feel the explosions in Kyiv and said, 'Alright, we need to go, we need to get out of here.'""

NBC News reported that the group's first bus of evacuees contained 23 people escaping from Ukraine. Fox News noted that the bus included U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.



President Biden indicated earlier this month that if Russia invaded Ukraine, he would not send U.S. troops in to rescue Americans.

Judge said that ""when the Biden administration said that they weren't going to do it, it was kind of like, 'Okay, here we go.'""

The Biden administration came under heavy criticism last year for presiding over a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and then announcing the completion of the withdrawal even as Americans remained stranded in the country.

Jen Psaki warns economic report will show 'extraordinarily elevated' inflation and puts the blame on Putin,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that the next economic report could contain ""extraordinarily elevated"" inflation because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Psaki made the comments during Monday's media briefing at the White House.

""So, because of the actions we've taken to address the Putin price hike we are in a better place than we were last month, but we expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin's price hike,"" said Psaki to reporters.

""And we expect a large difference between core and headline inflation reflected in the global disruptions in energy and food markets. Core inflation doesn't include energy and food prices, headline inflation does, and of course we know that core inflation, you know, energy, the impact of energy of course on oil prices, gas prices, we expect that to continue to reflect what we've seen, the increases be over the course of this invasion,"" she added.

Psaki went on to try to directly attribute increases in gas prices to the invasion of Ukraine.

""And just as an example since President Putin's military build-up accelerated in January, average gas prices are up more than 80 cents, most of the increase occurred in the month of March, and at times gas prices were more than a dollar above pre-invasion levels,"" Psaki continued, ""so that roughly 20% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow's inflation reading, and certainly, it's not a surprise to us, but we certainly think it will be reflected.""

The administration has been harangued by Republican critics and others who have pointed out that inflation had been spiking prior to the Russian invasion. The administration has tried to pin inflation on the pandemic, greedy corporations, and finally the Russians.

Unfortunately for the Democrats, an NBC News poll showed far more Americans blame high prices on Biden's policies rather than any of the other excuses the administration has made.

Jen Psaki dodges question on report Nancy Pelosi is upset about how Biden handled Title 42: 'There are many strong feelings',"White House press secretary Jen Psaki avoided commenting directly on a report that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was angry over the way the Biden administration mishandled the Title 42 immigration policy.

Psaki made the comments at Wednesday's media briefing at the White House.

""There has been reporting that Speaker Pelosi is unhappy with the way that the White House has handled Title 42 and worried that if it comes up for a vote as a part of a Ukraine package that Democrats wouldn't have the votes to defeat that,"" asked Jacqui Heinrich of Fox News. ""Does the White House share that concern and what do you make of Pelosi seeming to be kind of shaky on just how close she is to the White House on this decision?""

""Well, I would say we're incredibly close with Speaker Pelosi and the president has known her for many many decades,"" Psaki responded.

""I don't have more to spell out or explain what her meaning was, or what defeated means or doesn't mean. There are many strong feelings and points of view on Capitol Hill, in the House, and in the Senate about Title 42,"" she continued.

""It wasn't a decision made by the White House, it was a decision to lift it by the CDC,"" Psaki. ""The authority was given to them by Congress, and our efforts and our focus is on implementation, and the department, the secretary of Homeland Security is obviously testifying on that, so I don't have any more to explain on the particular comments but we obviously work with Speaker Pelosi on a range of issues including immigration.""

Title 42 is a policy meant to deter asylum seekers from entering the U.S. to await while their applications are being processed. It was implemented by the former Trump administration to curtail the spread of the coronavirus from migrants who might be infected.

On Monday, a judge ordered a temporary restraining order against the Biden administration ending Title 42 based on the legal challenge posed by several attorneys general of states that would be negatively affected by the expected wave of new migrants into the country.

A poll earlier in April found that the decision to end Title 42 was the most unpopular policy made by the Biden administration so far.

"Psaki's tough talk on Russia, China comes days after Biden admin reportedly got fleeced in Iran deal negotiations: 'This looks like plain ol’ stupidity'","The Biden administration this week rightly called out Russia and China as liars and cheaters that can't be trusted. Yet apparently, that notion did not occur to White House officials when they invited those officials to take part in Iran nuclear deal negotiations earlier this year.

The nearsightedness raises concerns once again that the Biden administration — despite its tough talk — remains woefully naïve regarding the nefarious intentions of two of America's greatest geopolitical foes.

What happened?

Serving as a mouthpiece for the administration on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki raked Russia and China over the coals in a lengthy Twitter thread. She brandished the nations' government officials as ""preposterous"" propagandizers and asserted that President Biden and his administration have ""[taken] note"" of their past transgressions while being on the ""lookout"" for more.

But that type of sober-minded vigilance seemed remarkably absent in recent days and weeks when the White House not only tolerated Russian and Chinese participation in Iran deal negotiations — but actually invited their involvement.

""U.S. seeks Russian and Chinese support to salvage Iran nuclear deal,"" a Guardian report in December said.

The negotiations reportedly ended in a disaster, with Russia's top negotiator, Mikhail Ulyanov, bragging publicly that his country, along with their Chinese partners, essentially fleeced the U.S., securing more for Iran's nuclear proliferation than previously thought possible.

""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" Ulyanov said in a victory lap following talks. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""

""Our Chinese friends were also very efficient and useful as co-negotiators,"" he added.

It's no wonder Psaki's words rang hollow.

What did she say?

The press secretary fumed at Russia for alleging that the U.S. was involved in biological weapons labs in Ukraine. The Kremlin, it seemed, pushed the propaganda as a pretext for invasion.

""This is preposterous,"" Psaki wrote, stating elsewhere that ""it’s Russia that has a long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons.""

Psaki went on to call the move ""an obvious ploy"" by the Russians, further noting, ""We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.""

One might ask, where was the ""lookout"" before Biden's White House called on Russia and China to assist in the revival of the Iran nuclear deal?

Anything else?

Reacting to Psaki's statements, Hot Air's Ed Morrissey wrote, ""So explain to me again why we invited Russia to negotiate a deal over illegal WMD development in Iran?""

""Having Mikhail Ulyanov on hand to negotiate Iran’s compliance on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is akin to having Ted Bundy mediate Jeffrey Dahmer’s sentencing,"" the conservative writer quipped. ""Were they really that naive?""

""Rather than naïveté, this looks like plain ol’ stupidity,"" he concluded.

White House warns of possible Russian 'false flag' attack in Ukraine involving chemical or biological weapons,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned of the possibility of a ""false flag"" attack by the Russians involving chemical or biological weapons after citing the proliferation of misinformation online.

Psaki released a statement Wednesday saying that the disinformation campaign might be preparing the way for a fake attack orchestrated to blame Ukrainians.

""We took note of Russia’s false claims about alleged U.S. biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine. We’ve also seen Chinese officials echo these conspiracy theories,"" said Psaki in the statement.

""This is preposterous,"" she added. ""It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent.""

She went on to say that the U.S. does not develop or possess biological or chemical weapons anywhere, and noted that there was a long record of Russia using such weapons to assassinate political opponents.

""This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,"" Psaki continued.

""Now that Russia has made these false claims,"" she concluded, ""we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.""

Russian officials claimed on Wednesday that their military forces had found evidence of a military biological program in Ukraine involving plague and anthrax. Ukraine has denied the allegations.

The warning from the White House was similar to one the administration made prior to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. State Dept. spokesperson Ned Price said in early February that it was likely that Russia would orchestrate a false attack to blame with Ukrainians in order to justify an invasion.

Later in February, Russia accused Ukrainian forces of firing back at them after Russian forces shelled a kindergarten school. They invaded soon after.

"Putin, calls for Ukrainian military to take power","As Ukrainians bravely fight to defend their country against a Russian invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for the Ukrainian military to seize power and make an agreement with Russia, according to reports.

""Take power into your own hands,"" Putin said, according to reports.

""It seems that it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis, who occupied Kyiv and took the entire Ukrainian people hostage,"" Putin said, according to Politico, which noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish.

Russia has been laying siege to Ukraine, but Ukrainians have been fighting back.

People around the globe have watched in horror as Russia began invading the sovereign country, wreaking death and destruction against the Ukrainian people.

The U.S. and other nations have condemned Russia and levied sanctions — President Biden has said that American troops will not defend Ukraine against Russia, but will defend NATO allies.

The president is slated to deliver a State of the Union address next week, but has been underwater on his job approval numbers in various polls for quite awhile. In addition to domestic issues like rapidly rising prices, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to cast a pall over his upcoming speech.

A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll of adults in the U.S. found that just 33% approve of how Biden is dealing with the Russia-Ukraine issue, while 47% disapprove, and 20% have no opinion on the matter.

Putin declares military invasion of Ukraine,"Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, announced a military invasion of Ukraine at about 5 a.m. Thursday local time.

He had previously said on Monday that Russia would recognize the independence of two regions where pro-Russian troops had held a presence for years.

In a video announcement, Putin claimed that the military operation was to demilitarize Ukraine because of the threat of it joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""All responsibility for the possible bloodletting will be on the conscience of the current Ukrainian regime,"" said Putin according to one translation. ""Truth and strength are on our side.""

He went on to claim that it was not Russia's intention to occupy the country.

Those comments are in contrast to his previous statements that Ukraine was an invention of Russia and his lamentations that the old Soviet republics should not have been allowed to leave Russia.

President Joe Biden issued a statement from the White House after the announcement from Putin.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" wrote Biden.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,"" he continued.

""The world will hold Russia accountable,"" Biden added.

He had previously called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but also ordered economic and financial sanctions against Russian leaders in response to the aggression against Ukraine.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament voted to ease gun restrictions in order to allow their citizens to arm up ahead of the expected attack.

CNN's Matthew Chance said that he could hear loud explosions near Kyiv, the capitol of Ukraine, just minutes after the announcement from Putin.

Putin doesn't want to host 'premature' diplomatic summit with Biden,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has opted not to have an in-person meeting with President Joe Biden, the New York Post reported.

Russian leadership believes that it is too early for the two countries to hold a summit to discuss the ongoing Ukraine crisis.

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, said, “It’s premature to talk about any specific plans for organizing any kind of summits.”

He added, “There is an understanding that dialogue should be continued at the level of foreign ministers” and that there are “no concrete plans in place” for the two presidents to attend a summit together.

Peskov said that the two men can continue to discuss diplomacy over the phone or through other means but that an in-person meeting currently isn’t in the cards.

He said, “If necessary, of course, the Russian and American presidents can decide to hold a telephone call or connect via other methods. A meeting is possible if the heads of state consider it appropriate.”

On Sunday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden had “accepted in principle” a meeting with his Russian counterpart.

She added that “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war.”

U.S. officials previously suggested that a presidential summit would follow an upcoming meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov.

The idea of a presidential summit has been championed by French officials and cautiously encouraged by the Ukrainian government as a way to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine and avoid armed conflict.

Dmytro Kuleba, a Ukrainian foreign minister, said “We believe every effort aimed at a diplomatic solution is worth trying. We hope that the two presidents will walk out from the room with an agreement about Russia withdrawing its forces from Ukraine.”

On Friday, Biden said he was “convinced” that Russian leadership had decided to invade Ukraine.

Despite the imminent threat their country is facing, Ukrainian leadership hope to avoid armed conflict by bringing Putin to the table.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said “I don’t know what the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting” and “Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris attended the Munich Security Conference along with a dozen other leaders from Western nations.

"Putin orders 'peacekeeping' troops to invade Ukraine, US to respond with sanctions","Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, ordered an invasion of Ukraine on Monday after declaring the ""independence"" of two separatist regions of the country.

Russia has accused Ukraine of oppressing Russian-speaking populations in Donetsk and Luhansk, two regions in southeastern Ukraine. Putin on Monday said Russia would send ""peacekeeping"" troops into the separatist areas, which critics say is a brazen excuse to invade a sovereign neighbor state.

Russian-backed rebels in regions of Ukraine have called for separation since 2014, but in recent months Russia has placed more than 150,000 troops on its border with the country. In response, Ukrainian citizens have armed themselves in anticipation of the expected invasion.

A senior Biden administration official reportedly told journalists that Russia sending ""peacekeeping"" troops into Ukraine didn't necessarily constitute an invasion.

""We will observe and assess what actions Russia actually takes and respond,"" the official said.

Biden also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call after the announcement from Putin.

President Joe Biden has warned that the United States would hit Russia with punitive economic sanctions if they invaded. Those sanctions are expected to be announced on Tuesday.

The United States agreed to defend Ukraine in 1994 after the country agreed to dismantle more than 5,000 nuclear weapons left over from the fall of the Soviet Union.

Putin has reiterated many times his belief that the fall of the Soviet Union was the worst geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. In his speech Monday, he said it was ""madness"" that former Soviet republics were allowed to leave the USSR.

Western officials have warned that Russia may use conflict in these regions as a pretext to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The announcement comes after Putin informed Germany and France of his decision, which was received with ""disappointment,"" the Kremlin said Monday according to Reuters. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Putin's decision to recognize the two separatist regions in Ukraine was ""plainly in breach of international law.""

""It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine,” Johnson added, according to the Guardian.

In a rambling, at times angry speech, Putin lamented the fall of the Soviet Union, twisted history, and essentially denied Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state.

""Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia, more precisely, Bolshevik, communist Russia,"" Putin inaccurately claimed, asserting that the country ""never had a tradition of genuine statehood.""

Putin characterized the current government of Ukraine as a corrupt oligarchy and accused western governments of supporting a violent coup d'état against the old pro-Russian government in 2014. He leveled numerous accusations against the Ukrainian government, claiming there is a ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people taking place in Donetsk and Lugansk and that Ukraine is attempting to develop nuclear weapons that pose a threat to Russian national security. He further claimed that Russia has ancient connections to territory in eastern Ukraine and that the Russian-speaking people there support independence

The Russian president also alleged that attempts by Ukraine to join NATO pose a threat to Russian national security, and that the United States' threat of sanctions in response to an invasion of Ukraine were policies designed to ""limit the development of Russia.""



""Russia has the duty to take all necessary measures to protect our security, which is what we'll do,"" said Putin.

As Putin delivered that ominous message, an estimated 150,000 Russian troops have amassed on three sides of Ukraine's eastern border. President Joe Biden on Friday said he is ""convinced"" that Russia has already decided to invade, including an assault on Ukraine's capital Kyiv.



By recognizing two independent states in eastern Ukraine, Russia has created an excuse to deploy troops there. The separatists do not hold all of the territory they claim. Should they request assistance from the Russian military, Putin will claim an invasion is an intervention to protect independent Russian allies from Ukraine's alleged tyranny. Analysts expect Russia to send ""peacekeeper"" forces into the area, Axios reported.

Though Russia has repeatedly denied having a desire to invade, it has claimed Ukraine is preparing for a major military offensive in the east, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials say is not true. Russia claimed on Monday that it killed five Ukrainian troops crossing the border, which Ukraine denied and which the U.S. said was one of several ""transparent, hackneyed plots to justify an invasion.""

Following Putin's speech, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the United Nations security council to ""discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine.""

Putin reportedly discloses conditions for ceasefire in call with Turkish president,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly revealed in full the conditions that would need to be met for a ceasefire to be ordered in Ukraine.

The Russian president is said to have disclosed the list of six priorities during a Thursday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, BBC News reported.

The demands come approximately three weeks after the launch of Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, an unprovoked land invasion that drew swift condemnation and harsh economic retaliation from the entire Western world.

According to BBC News, the demands fall into two categories. The first category, which includes four demands, was reportedly presented as less difficult. Chief among the four is a commitment from Ukraine to remain neutral and not join NATO, something that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already signaled an openness to.

In addition to a pledge of neutrality, Ukraine would then have to undergo a disarmament process to ensure it isn't a threat to Russia. Of course, any disarmament would leave Ukraine open to future attacks from Russia.

Next, there would have to be protections for the Russian language in Ukraine, and the country would have to undergo what Putin has called ""de-Nazification.""

The demands were passed along to the news agency by Erdogan's leading adviser and spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin.

The second category of demands, according to the BBC, is considered more difficult to satisfy. The outlet said Kalin was less specific on these points but noted they involved the status of Ukrainian territories in the eastern Donbas region.

It is ""assumed"" that Putin will require Ukraine to give up territory in the supposedly Russian-sympathetic region as well as formally recognize that Crimea, an area illegally annexed by Putin in 2014, is part of Russia.

BBC noted that Russia has no legal right to Crimea and even signed an international treaty after the fall of the USSR accepting that Crimea was part of Ukraine.

Putin's alleged demands appeared to fall in line with previous reporting on the matter.

Fox News reported that Putin's list of demands comes as more and more reports continue to surface indicating that morale among Russian forces is waning. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has indeed observed Russian forces stalling out in their advance but was careful to note that low morale was observed anecdotally and may not be indicative of the whole of the Russian military.

However, there continue to be concerns that Putin's negotiating is nothing more than a head fake to distract Ukraine as Russian forces continue to move on the capital.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-reportedly-discloses-conditions-for-ceasefire-in-call-with-turkish-president,2022-03-18
"Vladimir Putin will reportedly be 'undergoing medical procedures,' including cancer surgery","Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to undergo a cancer operation and will be handing the reins of power over to his deputy and espionage official Nikolai Patrushev, according to an insider from the Kremlin.



Putin’s health has been a topic of rampant speculation over the past several months since he launched his invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. Sun reported that there have been reports that Putin has been dealing with both a form of unidentified abdominal cancer and Parkinson’s Disease.

Putin, now 69-years-old, is expected to hand over power to the 70-year-old Patrushev who is believed to have been one of the leading advocates and thinkers behind the invasion of Ukraine. Reportedly, Patrushev was the man who convinced Putin that the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv was filled with neo-Nazis.

The neo-Nazi claim was reported on the Russian media outlet General SVR which first raised concerns over Putin’s health about a year-and-a-half ago.

The outlet quoted an anonymous former “high-ranking Kremlin military figure” who at the time said that “Putin has discussed that he will be undergoing medical procedures.”

The anonymous source also said, “Doctors insist that he needs an operation, but the date has not yet been determined.”

The source added that “[Putin] will have surgery” and that the Russian president would be incapacitated and that the leader “thinks it’ll be for a short time.”

While speaking on live television and using technology to disguise his voice, the source said that the decision to choose Patrushev came after a two-hour “heart to heart” with Putin and that selecting the spymaster to take over in his absence was the “worst option.”

The source also speculated that the Russian president’s health problems could get worse and his overall health could deteriorate.

He posed the hypothetical, “What if all of a sudden, Putin manifests particularly severe health problems?”

“We know very well that he has cancer, and Parkinson’s disease, as we have said many times,” the source continued. “It was possible to contain it for some time, but now the course of the disease is progressing.”

It is unclear when exactly when Putin will undergo surgery but it is believed that Putin won't go under the knife before May 9 as he intends to preside over Red Victory Day celebrations commemorating the role that the former-Soviet Union had in defeating Nazi Germany.

Ben Wallace, the United Kingdom’s Defense Secretary, said that he expects Putin to use the May 9 celebration to call for a final offensive in Ukraine.

Wallace said, “[Putin] is probably going to declare that we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilize the Russian people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-russia-cancer-surgery,2022-05-01
A superyacht believed to be Vladimir Putin's was just impounded by Italian officials,"On Friday, Italian authorities seized a giant superyacht that is said to be owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Italian government recommended that the ship be impounded as part of the West’s ongoing campaign of sanctions against Russia.

The Daily Mail reported that Italian authorities said that the $700 million mega-yacht named “The Scheherazade,” is more than 450 feet long and contains spas, swimming pools, and two helicopter pads.

The giant yacht has been the subject of an ongoing investigation by Italy’s financial police since the end of this past March and has been docked at Marina di Carrara near Pisa since this past September as it undergoes a refit.

The Italian government’s seizure of the ship came late at night as Italian officials grew increasingly concerned that The Scheherazade was going to slip away from their jurisdiction and into international waters to avoid Western sanctions.

Reportedly, in recent days there has been a flurry of activity around the yacht. In March, the ship's majority Russian crew had been replaced with a British staff overnight.

Indicating that the ship had connections to Russia, The Italian Financial Police released a statement that said, “After verification by the fiscal authorities, it has come to light that there is a significant economic connection between the owner of The Scheherazade and senior elements of the Russian government.”

The statement continued, “On the basis of these elements, it has been recommended that the yacht be placed on the current European Union sanctions list, and the Minister of Finance in Rome has agreed.”

Mariateresa Levi, a member of the Italian Financial police, said, “I am not in a position to tell you who the actual owner is, but we are satisfied that the yacht should be seized, and in the next few hours, officers will board and impound her.”

The ship's captain has denied that Putin is the owner of the superyacht while refusing to disclose who the real owner is.

There have been claims that the vessel might belong to Eduard Khudainatov, a Russian oil tycoon who has previously been able to escape Western sanctions, unlike many other Russian oligarchs.

Despite this, activists and investigative journalists linked to Alexei Navalny, the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, are adamant that the ship belongs to Putin.

Putin suspended as 'honorary president' of the International Judo Federation,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been suspended as the honorary president of the International Judo Federation.

On Sunday, the IJF released a statement saying that it was suspending Putin from his position as the “Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation,” Reuters reported.

The IJF’s statement said, “In light of the ongoing war conflict in Ukraine, the International Judo Federation announces the suspension of Mr. Vladimir Putin’s status as Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation.”

Putin, who is 69 years old, holds a black belt in judo and has even co-authored a book titled “Judo: History, Theory, Practice” and has previously trained alongside the Russian Olympic judo team.

Black belt Putin shows off judo moves with Olympic athletes www.youtube.com

He also holds the rank of grandmaster in taekwondo. He was granted this title in 2013 by the president of the World Taekwondo Federation.



Putin being stripped of this honorary title is just the latest, and the most benign, of the measures taken against him in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States released a joint statement that said the Western allies were committed to “ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed form the SWIFT messaging system.”

By removing Russian banks from the SWIFT network, the Western leaders committed to restricting Russia’s ability to manipulate its currency to reduce the immediate fiscal impact of Western sanctions and specifically targeting Russian officials and oligarchs who encouraged military aggression with sanctions.

Restricting Russian access to the SWIFT network will greatly damage the Russian economy and make engaging in international commerce extremely difficult. This move will isolate Russia and stands to prevent it from exporting natural gas and fossil fuels.

The British Petroleum Company plans to divest from state-owned energy firms in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, despite having done business with them for more than three decades.

BP Chairman Helge Lund said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

On Sunday, the leadership of the European Union announced that it would be closing Europe’s airspace to all aircraft of Russian origin.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians. We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered, or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the EU.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-suspended-as-honorary-president-of-the-international-judo-federation,2022-02-28
"poll, 70, troops should get involved, if Russia invades NATO","A Quinnipiac University poll of adults in the U.S. found that 70% believe U.S. troops should get involved if Russia mounts an invasion against a NATO nation, while 21% do not think U.S. soldiers should get involved if such a scenario unfolds.

The eyes of the world are on Ukraine as the people of that country bravely fight to defend their sovereign nation against a Russian invasion. The survey, which was conducted from Feb. 25 to 27, found that 63% are concerned that Russia might utilize nuclear weapons if NATO attempts to intervene, while 32% are not concerned.

The poll found that 66% believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to invade additional countries, while 20% do not think he intends to invade elsewhere.

President Joe Biden has said that American forces will not get involved in the Russia-Ukraine war, though he also declared that America will defend NATO territory.

Biden, who is underwater in various job approval polls, is slated to deliver a State of the Union address on Tuesday.

The recent Quinnipiac poll found that 52% disapprove of how Biden is handling in his role, while just 37% approve. The poll found that 43% disapprove strongly, 8% somewhat disapprove, 19% somewhat approve, and 19% strongly approve.

According to the poll, 49% of U.S. adults consider Putin to be mentally unstable, while 31% believe the man is stable.

"Rand Paul blasts nationwide lockdowns, says they’re ironically making US even more dependent on China","Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says the nationwide stay-at-home orders must cease if America is ever to get back on its feet.

What are the details?

Speaking on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom,"" the Republican senator said that states continuing to enforce lockdown measures are sabotaging themselves as well as the United States and its economy in the long run.

""We have no money, we have no rainy day account, we have no savings account,"" he said on Wednesday. ""The $3 trillion that we've already passed out is imaginary money. It's being borrowed, basically, from China. So the irony is we got the virus from China, and now we're going to be more dependent by borrowing more money from China.""

Paul explained that the only way to avoid such a pitfall is to reopen the U.S. economy.

""The only thing that recovers our economy is opening the economy,"" he reasoned. ""It's not a lack of money. It's a lack of commerce. If you let people have commerce, if you let them trade, if you take them out from forcible home arrest, our economy will recover.""

""But,"" he continued, ""if you keep everybody under home arrest, and you say you cannot practice your business, you cannot sell your goods, there will continue to be economic calamity.""

The Republican lawmaker said that Democratic governors are also contributing to the overall problem by refusing to open their states, and thus, their state economies.

“All these blue state governors who don't want to open their state, now they're clamoring for federal money to bail them out because no state revenue is coming in. We don't have any money,"" Paul insisted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-blasts-nationwide-lockdowns-says-theyre-ironically-making-us-even-more-dependent-on-china,2020-05-07
Rand Paul calls for investigation into Dem senators who wrote letter to Ukraine last year,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is calling for an investigation into three Democratic senators who are accused of threatening to withdraw aid from Ukraine last year if the country did not cooperate with Robert Mueller's investigation.

When asked by NBC ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd on Sunday whether he is ""disturbed"" by Rudy Giuliani's role in the Ukraine scandal, Paul highlighted how Democrats have also allegedly meddled in Ukraine.

""I think what's interesting about this is both sides seem to be doing the same thing. If anything is consistent here, it's that both parties have tried to involve themselves in Ukraine,"" Paul said. ""So for example, four (sic) senators, Democrats, wrote a letter to the Ukrainian government and said, 'If you don't keep investigating Trump we may reconsider our bipartisan support for your aid.' Both parties seem to be doing this.""

The Kentucky senator went on to say:

Here's the thing, if you're going to condemn Trump you need to condemn the Democrat senators. It shouldn't be just one-sided. Everybody's going after President Trump.



Someone needs to actually, in an objective way, evaluate a letter from four Democrats that said to Ukraine, ""If you don't keep investigating Trump we will reconsider our bipartisan support for aid."" That's a threat. And that's the same kind of stuff they're accusing Trump of. But nobody's talking about that the Democrats are doing exactly the same thing.

When asked again if he is ""comfortable"" with Giuliani's actions, Paul said the Hunter Biden story — that Biden earned $50,000 per month working for a Ukrainian natural gas company while his dad was vice president — ""doesn't pass the smell test.""

""And I hope we do get to the bottom of it,"" Paul said.

The letter that Paul referred to — sent by Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in May 2018 — expressed Democrats' ""great concern"" that Ukrainian officials might not cooperate with then-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference and the Trump campaign.

Since the Ukraine scandal became a national story, Trump allies, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), have asserted the letter threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine if they did not investigate Trump.

On ""Fox & Friends"" Monday, Paul doubled down on his call for an investigation into the senators.

""We can't have two standards,"" Paul said. ""Democrats get to threaten Ukrainian aid and nothing happens to them. Now they want to impeach a president over this?

Rand Paul corners Mayorkas over 'disinformation governance board' — and buries CNN in the process,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tore into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday, grilling him over the creation of the agency's ""disinformation governance board.""

What happened?

During a tense exchange at a Senate hearing, Paul asked Mayorkas whether the infamous anti-Trump dossier included ""Russian disinformation."" Mayorkas, however, declined to directly answer the question, triggering a heated back-and-forth about the scope of the highly controversial government office.

""Here's my question: The FBI concludes that the Steele dossier was full of Russian disinformation. CNN propagated this disinformation gladly for years and years,"" Paul said. ""The difference, I guess, between your opinion and our opinion is that as despicable as it is that CNN propagated this disinformation, I wouldn't shut them down, I wouldn't lecture them, I wouldn't put it on a government website that CNN is wrong for propagating disinformation.""

""The problem you have is you're not even willing to admit — I mean, we can't even have an agreement on what the FBI said was disinformation,"" Paul added, noting that failing to agree on what is and what is not ""disinformation"" is a serious issue.

In response, Mayorkas said the board would not be responsible for policing disinformation writ large, but only ""when there is a connectivity between disinformation and threats to security of the homeland.""

""Well, the Russians might be considered that. You mentioned the Russians the other day when you tried to pivot away from this being about censorship,"" Paul fired back. ""Let's just say ... you've discovered tomorrow Russian disinformation that is going to hurt our national security, and CNN is broadcasting it, what are you going to do?""

Mayorkas then presented an example of combatting immigration-related disinformation on social media. But what about Russian disinformation? After all, DHS said a key goal of the board is combatting Russian disinformation.

""Here's the problem: We can't even agree what disinformation is. You can't even agree that it was disinformation that the Russians fed information to the Steele dossier,"" Paul noted. ""If you can't agree to that, how are we ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation so you can police it on social media?""

Mayorkas responded that the board is tasked with ensuring there are ""guardrails, definitions, standards"" that protect civil rights, privacy, and free speech.

""I think you've got no idea what disinformation is,"" Paul shot back.

""Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is? The U.S. government.""

""Think of all the debates and disputes we've had over the last 50 years in our country. We work them out by debating them. We don't work them out by having the government being the arbiter. I don't want guardrails. I want you to have nothing to do with speech,"" Paul added.

""You think the American people are so stupid they need you to tell them what the truth is?""

""You can't even admit what the truth is with the Steele dossier. I don't trust government to figure out what the truth is,"" Paul said.

During the hearing, Mayorkas also admitted that he was unaware that Nina Jankowicz, the executive director of the disinformation board, called the Hunter Biden laptop story Russian disinformation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-mayorkas-disinformation-board,2022-05-05
"Rand Paul takes Joe Biden, Hunter Biden to task for 'corruption' that 'smells to high heaven'","Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) thinks Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, are corrupt — and he wants the world to know it.

Speaking with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Paul explained why he believes the ""corruption"" surrounding the Biden's — centering on Hunter's work with Burisma while his father, as vice president, oversaw U.S.-Ukrainian relations — needs further exploration during President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

""If the president is being accused of withholding foreign aid, and his argument is, 'Well, we were studying corruption, and we wanted to know about corruption in Ukraine,' and I think the Biden's are as corrupt as the day is long,"" Paul said. ""No young man who is the son of a politician gets $50,000 a month who has no experience, working for a Ukrainian oligarch. You know, for goodness sakes — it smells to high heaven. It smells like corruption.""

""Every day on the mainstream media, they say, 'Oh, there's no there there. This has been investigated. There is no corruption.' I think the American people don't buy it,"" Paul continued.

The Kentucky Republican explained that alleged corruption involving the Biden's is especially pertinent if both Republicans and Democrats call witnesses during Trump's trial.

""Here's the thing: Fair is fair. If they're going to put the president through this, they're going to have to have witnesses on both sides,"" Paul said.

Paul went on to explain that if Trump's impeachment trial looks like a ""kangaroo court"" then ""all hell is going to break loose,"" with Republican voters using their vote to ""punish"" Republican senators who allow Democratic witnesses, but block certain Republican witnesses, like Hunter Biden.

Paul vowed earlier in the week to force a vote calling on Hunter Biden to testify if Republicans allow Democrats to call their witnesses.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-takes-joe-biden-hunter-biden-to-task-for-corruption-that-smells-to-high-heaven,2020-01-18
"Rand Paul urges Trump to take immediate action against John Bolton, revoke his security clearance","Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) urged President Donald Trump on Saturday to immediately rescind John Bolton's security clearance.

As Trump's former national security adviser, Bolton holds a top security clearance, meaning he is privy to extremely sensitive intelligence that only a small number of senior-level government officials have authorization to see, hear, or access.

But Paul wants that privilege revoked.

""No one, especially not John Bolton, should be able to use their security clearance for profit! I say revoke his clearance now ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩,"" the Kentucky senator tweeted.

Paul linked to a RealClearPolitics news story that reported that Bolton's security clearance is in jeopardy of being revoked after Trump's impeachment trial concludes.

In fact, two government officials told RCP that revocation is an ""almost certainty"" for Bolton.

The development comes after the manuscript for Bolton's upcoming book was leaked this week. Some accuse Bolton of initiating the leak prior to submitting the manuscript to the White House for review, though he denies the allegation.

In his book, Bolton alleges that Trump told him last August that he wanted to continue freezing nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine if the Ukrainian government did not cooperate with investigations into the Bidens, the New York Times reported. The explosive allegation would corroborate allegations of a quid pro quo.

Trump was quick to deny Bolton's allegations.

Ruiz calls Biden to increase refugee admissions cap,"Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) is calling on President Joe Biden to raise the refugee admissions cap for this fiscal year in light of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine has created an escalating humanitarian crisis. The United States must respond by opening its arms to those seeking safety and security. I ask that you issue an Emergency Presidential Determination raising refugee admissions for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2022, expedite family reunification of Ukrainians in the United States, and do everything possible to rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admission Program,"" Ruiz said in a letter to Biden.

The refugee cap for fiscal year 2022, which runs through the end of September, is currently set at 125,000.

Ukrainians have been battling to defend their country against Russia's brutal onslaught. Many people have already fled Ukraine because of the chaos and carnage.

""While the headlines are currently focused the war in Ukraine, our country should strengthen its commitment to provide refuge to all people fleeing violence and oppression,"" the letter said.

""The CHC firmly believes that whether someone is fleeing for their life from a Russian dictator or a drug cartel, the United States should provide the safety and security that refugees need.

Adam Schiff blocks impeachment witness from identifying intelligence official he discussed Ukraine call with,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) prevented impeachment inquiry witness Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from disclosing the intelligence official with whom he discussed President Donald Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, citing a need to protect the anonymous whistleblower.

While Vindman was being questioned by the House GOP lawyer about who outside the White House he had discussed the call with, Vindman readily named Deputy Secretary of State George Kent (another impeachment witness), and then referred to an intelligence community official.

While he was being pressed for a name, or even the agency the person works for, Schiff jumped in and cut off the line of questioning.

""We need to protect the whistleblower. Please stop,"" Schiff interrupted. ""I want to make sure that there is no effort to out the whistleblower through these proceedings. If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower, that is not the purpose that we're here for. I want to advise the witness accordingly.""

Vindman has previously testified, and reaffirmed Tuesday, that he doesn't know who the whistleblower is, but that he had been instructed by his counsel not to be specific about who he has spoken to within the intelligence community.



Ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) appeared troubled by the idea that Vindman would be prevented from identifying an intelligence community official when testifying before the Intelligence Committee, but ultimately questioning proceeded without naming the official.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) did not drop the issue, however. He noted that Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, and Tim Morrison, former European affairs official on the National Security Council, fully disclosed who they discussed the July 25 call with in their testimonies. And, Jordan noted, Schiff allowed them to do so.

However, despite the fact that Schiff said he does not know the whistleblower, and Vindman said he does not know the whistleblower, Schiff is preventing Vindman from naming a particular intelligence community official out of concern that it would expose the whistleblower's identity.

House Democrats announce public impeachment hearings to begin next week,"House Democrats announced that the impeachment inquiry is moving to a new phase next week — public hearings. Starting Nov. 13, the public will be able to hear directly from witnesses who have already been interviewed behind closed doors, according to Politico.

The announcement comes as transcripts from the closed-door depositions are being released providing more detail about the perspectives or current and former officials about whether President Donald Trump improperly withheld aid to Ukraine in an attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky into investigating, or announcing an intention to investigate, Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden.

Who is set to testify? The first public hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 13. Top Ukraine diplomat William Taylor and deputy assistant secretary of state George Kent will testify. On Nov. 15, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will testify.

Who is running this show? These hearings will take place before the House Intelligence Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). Republicans on the committee will be allowed to participate in the hearings, although they will have less control over the nature of the proceedings as the minority party.



Why are they testifying publicly if we know what they'll say? For the Democrats, the impeachment inquiry is less about fact-finding than it is about presenting the existing information in a way that is persuasive to voters and, as a result, representatives who will likely be called eventually to vote on articles of impeachment.

Public hearings are more productive toward that goal than closed-door hearings and transcripts, which are unlikely to be read by most people in the general public. Schiff confirmed this motive.

""Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, to make their own determinations about the credibility of the witnesses, but also to learn first-hand about the facts of the president's misconduct,"" Schiff said, according to Politico.

Although the Democrats had enough votes to formalize the impeachment inquiry, it is less clear whether or not they have the votes to pass articles of impeachment with the current available information.

At a GOP leadership press briefing in the Capitol Building, McConnell explained that the upper chamber has two paths to pick from when dealing with an expected impeachment trial.

""It could go down the path of calling witnesses and basically having another trial or it could decide — and again 51 members could make that decision — that they've heard enough and believe they know what would happen and could move to vote on the two articles of impeachment sent over to us by the House,"" McConnell said.

McConnell went on to note that ""no decisions have been made yet; they'll be made later."" He also said that those decisions would be made after House managers — who function as prosecutors — and the president's legal team make opening statements to the body.

The decision matters because the Republican-controlled Senate could call witnesses with testimony concerning President Trump's case and/or witnesses blocked from being called to testify to the House's impeachment investigation, such as Hunter Biden — whose previous work at a Ukrainian energy company is at the heart of the entire impeachment controversy — or the federal employee whose whistleblower complaint triggered the impeachment probe to begin with.

McConnell's remarks came shortly after the Tuesday publication of a story by the Washington Examiner, which reported that Republican attitudes in the Senate were leaning more toward a speedy trial than one with new witnesses.

""At that point, I would expect that most members would be ready to vote and wouldn't need more information,"" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told the outlet. ""Many people have their minds pretty well made up.""

Earlier that morning, Senate Judiciary Committee member Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told BlazeTV host Glenn Beck that the president's legal team ought to be able to call their own witnesses for the trial, if they so choose.

""We will have a trial in the Senate unlike the House, where there was no due process and no fairness,"" Cruz told to Beck on the latter's radio show. ""We're going to allow the White House and the president to present their defense. I believe that means if the president wants to call witnesses, the president should be able to call witnesses.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-mcconnell-says-no-decision-made-yet-on-calling-senate-impeachment-witnesses,2019-12-10
"Mitt Romney questions legitimacy of Biden-Burisma investigation, claims Senate inquiry is a 'political exercise'","Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) questioned the legitimacy of the Senate investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine, calling the probe a ""political exercise.""



In remarks made Wednesday during a business meeting of the Senate Homeland Security & Government Affairs Committee, Romney said ""the Biden-Burisma investigation … I think, from the outset, had the earmarks of a political exercise, and I'm fearful that comments made in the media recently have only confirmed that perspective.""

The ""comments made in the media"" Romney referenced are likely comments made by the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). On Monday, Johnson told supporters on a call to ""stay tuned"" as ""in about a week we're going to learn a whole lot more of Vice President Biden's unfitness for office.""



""Obviously, it's the provenance of campaigns and political parties, opposition research, the media to carry out political endeavors, to learn about or dust up one's opponent, but it's not the legitimate role of government for Congress or for taxpayer expense to be used in an effort to damage political opponents,"" Romney said. ""Therefore I am pleased that our votes today do not include additional authorizations relating to the Biden/Burisma investigation.""

Earlier in Wednesday's meeting, Johnson canceled a committee vote that would have issued a subpoena to U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia Bridget Brink to testify in the Biden probe. Johnson is leading an investigation into allegations of corruption involving Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings with Ukrainian gas firm Burisma. Biden is accused by critics of using his position as vice president to influence U.S. policy toward Ukraine and benefit his son, who sat on Burisma's board.

Romney has been skeptical of the Burisma investigation since it began in March.

""There's no question but that the appearance of looking into Burisma and Hunter Biden appears political,"" he told reporters at the time.

""And I think people are tired of these kind of political investigations and would hope that if there's something of significance that needs to be evaluated, that it would be done by perhaps the FBI or some other agency that's not as political as perhaps a committee of our, of our body.""

Romney did, however, vote in favor of issuing new subpoenas as part of the Senate investigation into the FBI's conduct during the Russia investigation.

""With regards to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, I think it's also important, because this has such obvious political implications, that the committee's investigation focus on the specific wrongdoing alleged by the inspector general's report,"" Romney said. ""My vote today essentially is a reaffirmation of the subpoena authorization that was already approved by this committee with my support on June 4th, and I will continue that support as long as it does not fall into the realm of rank political undertaking.



""I do believe it's very important that the committees of Congress, and ours, in particular, not fall into an increasing pattern that we're seeing, which is using taxpayer dollars and the power of Congress to do political work. That's the role of campaigns.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-mitt-romney-questions-legitimacy-of-biden-burisma-investigation-claims-senate-inquiry-is-a-political-exercise,2020-09-16
NSC official tells impeachment probe: 'Nothing illegal was discussed' in Trump phone call,"In his opening statement to House impeachment investigators on Thursday, a top National Security Council official who listened to President Donald Trump's now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that he didn't believe at the time that the two discussed anything illegal during the chat.

""I listened to the call as it occurred from the Situation Room,"" NSC senior director for European affairs Tim Morrison said in prepared testimony reviewed by Blaze Media. ""I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.""

Morrison also testified that the transcript that the White House released last month ""accurately and completely reflects the substance of the call"" and that at the time he expressed concerns that information about the call would be leaked because of ""how it would play out in Washington's polarized environment,"" how a leak would affect the support of Ukrainian aid in Congress and ""how it would affect the Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.""

The July phone call is the incident at the heart of House Democrats' ongoing impeachment proceedings. The main question behind those proceedings — at least for now — is whether or not President Trump used the withholding of military aid to pressure Ukrainian officials into reviving an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who has bragged about being responsible for firing Ukraine's chief prosecutor.

Morrison, however, says that Ukrainian leaders weren't aware of an aid holdup until over a month after the phone call.

""I have no reason to believe the Ukrainians had any knowledge of the [funding] review until August 28, 2019,"" the statement reads. That was the same day that Politico reported on the holdup of military aid.

According to other testimony given to House investigators, President Trump was skeptical about providing aid to the Ukraine prior to the call, primarily as a result of the country's reputation for corruption. Morrison's statement speaks to this concern as well.

""I was aware that the President thought Ukraine had a corruption problem, as did many others familiar with Ukraine,"" the statement says. However, he adds, ""I was confident that our national security principals ... could convince president Trump to release the aid because President Zelensky and the reform oriented [Ukrainian parliament] were genuinely invested in their anti-corruption agenda.""

Morrison also contradicts testimony offered by top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine Bill Taylor about a proposed statement about the Burisma matter to be given by Zelensky. Where Taylor testified that Gordon Sondland told a Ukrainian official ""that security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,"" Morrison said that Sondland's proposal ""was that it could be sufficient if the new Ukrainian prosecutor general — not President Zelensky — would commit to pursue the Burisma investigation.""

Regarding the proposed August statement, Sondland testified that the draft language was primarily written by the Ukrainians with the guidance of former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker. Volker testified that the idea was ""shelved"" over concerns that mentioning Burisma or the Bidens would appear to be interference in a U.S. election.

Overall, Morrison said he was proud that the process was able to overcome the president's skepticism and allow for the release of the funding.

""I am pleased our process gave the president the confidence he needed to approve the release of the security sector assistance,"" he said. ""I am proud of what I have been able, in some small way, to help the Trump administration accomplish.""

The statement concluded with the announcement of Morrison's resignation from the NSC.

""I have not submitted a formal resignation at this time because I do not want anyone to think there is a connection between my testimony today and my impending departure,"" the statement reads. ""I plan to finalize my transition from the NSC after my testimony is complete.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-nsc-official-tells-impeachment-probe-nothing-illegal-was-discussed-in-trump-phone-call,2019-10-31
Pelosi promises to start 'a whole new stage of investigation' into Trump admin over whistleblower accusations involving Biden's son and Ukraine,"Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has threatened to open ""a whole new stage of investigation"" into President Donald Trump if Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire does not give congress the ""full complaint"" of the whistleblower who claimed that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter.

What about Biden?

Hunter Biden used to sit on the board of directors for a Ukranian natural gas firm called Burisma Holdings, a position for which he was paid $50,000 per month. Burisma is owned by a Russian oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky, who has been accused of both tax evasion and money laundering.

Joe Biden (joined by some additional members of the Obama administration) pressured the Ukrainian Parliament to remove Victor Shokin, Ukraine's prosecutor general who reportedly worried Zlochevsky. Since Shokin was also reported to be notoriously corrupt, other Western governments had also been hoping to see him removed from his role.

Shokin's replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, initially seemed to take a hardline stance against Burisma, but then closed the case against the firm less than a year after becoming prosecutor general.

Biden openly boasted of orchestrating the firing of Shokin by making it a condition of a billion dollar loan from the United States to Ukraine. He has also claimed that he had never talked with his son about Burisma.

What did the whistleblower say?

An anonymous whistleblower from within the U.S. government has claimed that Trump secretly asked the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani into investigating Hunter Biden.

While some of the information about what was in the whistleblower's complaint has been leaked, DNI Maguire has not allowed Congress to see it in full.

The current inspector general for the U.S. Intelligence Community, Michael Atkinson, told Maguire that he believed the whistleblower's complaint qualified as an ""urgent concern."" Maguire, however, disagreed.

The Trump administration has told Maguire not to turn over the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee.

In a tweet on Friday, Trump admitted to talking with the foreign leader from the complaint (without mentioning Zelensky or Ukraine by name), but insisted that it was a ""perfectly fine and respectful conversation"" and that ""there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!""

What did Pelosi say now?



On Sunday, Pelosi released a letter to all members of Congress, saying that she expects Maguire ""to obey the law and turn over the whistleblower's full complaint to"" the House Intelligence Committee when he testifies before it on Thursday.

Pelosi accused the Trump administration of violating a federal statute by preventing Maguire from giving the complaint to Congress.

""If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President,"" she wrote, ""they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

She ended the letter with ""[t]hank you for your patriotism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-pelosi-promises-to-start-a-whole-new-stage-of-investigation-into-trump-over-whistleblower-accusations-involving-bidens-son-and-ukraine,2019-09-23
Susan Collins announces she’ll vote to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment,"Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has announced that she will vote to acquit President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment put forward by the House of Representatives.

In a Tuesday speech from the Senate floor, Collins — who had previously been seen a possible GOP swing vote on impeachment — discussed both articles and gave her reasons for voting against them.

In regards to the first article — which accuses Trump of abusing his power in asking the Ukrainian government to help look into corruption allegations — Collins said that it was ""wrong for him to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival."" However, she said that the House failed to make the case that the president's conduct warrants removing him from office.

""As I concluded in the impeachment trial of President Clinton, I do not believe that the House has met its burden of showing that the president's conduct — however flawed — warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office,"" Collins said. ""Nor does the record support the assertion by the House managers that the president must not remain in office one moment longer.""

She then went on to explain her reasoning for voting for acquittal on the House's second article of impeachment, which alleges that Trump obstructed Congress by asserting privilege not cooperating with the House's investigation into the Ukraine matter. Collins argued, as several of her Republican colleagues have, that House investigators should have sought to resolve the inter-branch dispute in court rather than resorting to impeachment.

""At a minimum, the House should have pursued the full extent of its own remedies before bringing impeachment charges, including by seeking the assistance of a neutral third party: The judicial branch,"" the Maine senator said. ""In making these choices, the House substituted its own political preference for speed over finality.""

In conclusion, the senator said that ""this decision is not about whether you like or dislike this president, or agree with or oppose his policies, or approve or disapprove of his conduct in other circumstances. Rather, it is about whether the charges meet the very high constitutional standards of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Trump: China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Thursday, President Donald Trump said that China should open up and investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for their actions in the country while the former was in office.

Trump was asked by a reporter what he expected to see Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky do after asking him to look into the investigation of a Ukrainian national gas company that used to employ Hunter as a board member while his father was vice president.



""Well I would think that, if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,"" Trump answered. ""It's a very simple answer; They should investigate the Bidens.""

In 2018, Joe Biden bragged about getting the prosecutor in the case getting fired over a $1 billion loan guarantee while he was still in office.

""Likewise,"" Trump continued, ""China should start an investigation in to the Bidens, because what happened in China was just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.""

So what happened in China? Back in 2013, Hunter Biden's company struck a massive $1 billion investment fund deal with a government owned-bank that was later increased to $1.5 billion, according to the 2018 Peter Schweizer book ""Secret Empires."" The hangup was that the deal was announced just days after Hunter flew to China on Air Force Two with his dad and a U.S. delegation. A recent NBC report on the China deal also details that the business license for the fund was issued just 10 days later with Hunter Biden as a member of the board.

Last week, the Republican National Committee challenged former Vice President Biden to release transcripts of his phone conversations with Chinese leaders, as well as those of the Ukraine, as Trump had done with his July phone call with Zelensky.

The July phone call — and the resulting whistleblower's complaint about it — are the basis for Washington Democrats' latest efforts to impeach President Trump.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-trump-china-should-start-an-investigation-into-the-bidens,2019-10-03
Twitter locks account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany after she purportedly shares Hunter Biden story,"Twitter locked the account of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday, after she cited a New York Post story about Hunter Biden that the platform is working desperately to ban after it was published earlier in the day.

What are the details?

The New York Post published an exclusive story titled ""Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian business to VP dad,"" reporting that ""Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company.""

Within hours, Facebook suppressed the story on its platform, and Twitter completely locked the accounts of users who attempted to share the piece — including the New York Post's primary Twitter account.

The Post reported on all of the censorship following its story, too, including the notification to McEnany's account, which let her know her that she ""violated our rules against distribution of hacked material.""

Twitter explained, ""We don't permit the use of our services to directly distribute content obtained through hacking that contains private information, may put people in physical harm or danger, or contains trade secrets.""

The tweet for which McEnany was purportedly locked out read, ""**NEW** Email from Ukrainian executive to Hunter Biden asks Hunter to 'use his influence' on behalf of the firm paying him $50k/mo in email with subject 'urgent issue' obtained by @nypost Father @JoeBiden was in charge of Ukraine relations at time!!""

She allegedly included a link to the Post's story.

Politico reported:

The Post story included a screenshot of what the paper said was a 2015 email from Burisma adviser Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden, thanking him for ""the opportunity to meet your father."" But the email doesn't indicate whether Pozharskyi was describing a meeting that had already occurred or one intended to occur in the future. Nevertheless, the Post reported that the existence of such a meeting undercut Biden's long-held assertions that he had no involvement with his son's business dealings.

Biden's campaign said in a statement, ""We have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.""

However, Politico added that ""Biden's campaign would not rule out the possibility that the former VP had some kind of informal interaction with Pozharskyi, which wouldn't appear on Biden's official schedule. But they said any encounter would have been cursory. Pozharskyi did not respond to a request for comment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-twitter-locks-account-of-white-house-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-after-she-shared-hunter-biden-story,2020-10-14
"Watchdog group sues CIA and DOJ for alleged whistleblower's communications, decrying 'unprecedented cover-up'","A watchdog organization says that the American public has a right to know what alleged CIA whistleblower Eric Ciaramella has been doing while working for the federal government, and has filed a pair of federal lawsuits to find out.

In a news release issued Thursday, Judicial Watch announced Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department for communications made by Ciaramella over the past few years, noting a scope of inquiry that extends past the employee's alleged role in triggering the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump earlier this year and reaches back to the hotly contested FBI Trump-Russia probe.

""There is significant public interest, thanks to the Obama Spygate scandal and the related abusive impeachment of President Trump, in what Eric Ciaramella was up to,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said. ""CIA operative Ciaramella is documented to be involved in the Russia collusion investigation, and was a key CIA operative on Ukraine in the both the Obama and Trump White Houses. Our lawsuits are designed to break through the unprecedented cover-up of his activities.""

The lawsuit against the Department of Justice follows on the tail of unanswered requests between Ciaramella and former FBI employees Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page, the release explains, while the suit against the CIA follows requests for Ciaramella's emails from June 2016 to November of this year. Both of the FOIA requests, the organization says, were sent in November.

Ciaramella was named in a story at RealClear Investigations in late October as fitting the description of the federal employee behind the now-infamous whistleblower complaint about President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

According to the report, the CIA employee's name was ""raised privately in impeachment depositions, according to officials with direct knowledge of the proceedings, as well as in at least one open hearing held by a House committee not involved in the impeachment inquiry.""

Efforts to have the employee behind the complaint openly testify during the House's impeachment probe were blocked by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

In a November BlazeTV special, Glenn Beck dove into Ciaramella's professional past, saying that Congressional Democrats didn't want him to testify in an open forum ""because his fingers are on everything,"" namely a State Department-funded and George Soros-led ""shadow government"" effort in Ukraine conducted during the previous administration.

Rep. Devin Nunes files $435 million defamation lawsuit against CNN,"GOP Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) has filed a defamation suit against CNN, seeking $435 million in damages over an ""exclusive"" story the outlet published alleging the congressman met overseas with former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin ""to discuss digging up dirt on Joe Biden.""

What are the details?

The Washington Times first reported on the lawsuit Tuesday, quoting the complaint as saying ""Devin Nunes has never met Viktor Shokin. This meeting never took place. Viktor Shokin doesn't know and hasn't even heard of Devin Nunes.""

CNN's cited source for the piece was the lawyer for Lev Parnas — an associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Parnas, a soviet-born American citizen, was charged in October with four counts of campaign finance law violations. He pleaded not guilty.

""It was obvious to everyone — including disgraceful CNN — that Parnas was a fraudster and a hustler,"" Nunes's lawsuit states. ""It was obvious that his lies were part of a thinly-veiled attempt to obstruct justice and to trick either the United States Attorney or House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) into offering 'immunity' in return for 'information' about Plaintiff — a prominent United States Congressman and Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee.""

The Hill pointed out that ""CNN's article did not independently verify or disprove the claims made by Parnas's attorney."" The Washington Examiner reported that CNN stands by its written story, and argued, ""CNN will have a more serious problem"" with its television reporting, where the outlet presented the Parnas allegations as fact.

Nunes's lawsuit further states, ""Devin Nunes did not communicate with Parnas in December 2018,"" adding, ""CNN is the mother of fake news. It is the least trusted name. CNN is eroding the fabric of America, proselytizing, sowing distrust and disharmony. It must be held accountable.""

Anything else?

The same Parnas attorney, Joseph Bondy, who CNN cited as its source, publicly called out Nunes on Tuesday after Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee — on which Nunes is the ranking member — released phone records along with its impeachment report on President Trump showing Nunes spoke with Parnas a number of times.

""Devin Nunes, you should recuse yourself at the outset of the #HIC #ImpeachmentHearings,"" Bondy tweeted, adding the hashtag, ""LetLevSpeak.""



House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) defended Nunes during a press conference on Tuesday, telling reporters, ""I don't have a problem with Devin talking to individuals. What was claimed about Devin on CNN, on a national news media, is that he went to Vienna to meet with individuals.""

""He was not in Vienna,"" McCarthy continued. ""That was a lie, just like many lies before, and it seems like a perpetual thing of what he do,"" he added, speaking of Republicans' repeated pushback against the media.

Rep. Jerry Nadler says Dems 'prepared' for Hunter Biden to be called as impeachment witness but he hopes it doesn't happen,"New York congressman and newly-named House impeachment manager Rep. Jerry Nadler (D) said during a press conference Wednesday that he and his fellow Democrats are ""prepared"" for Hunter Biden to be called to testify before the Senate in the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, and admitted in a later interview that the decision is ""up to the Senate"" and he hopes it doesn't happen.

What are the details?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was asked Wednesday morning about the prospect of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden's son being called to testify about his dealings with Ukraine, a topic at the heart of the impeachment proceedings. According to the Daily Mail, Pelosi ""scooted away from the podium"" to allow Nadler to answer the question.

""We are prepared,"" Nadler said. ""In any trial, you call witnesses who have information about the allegations, about the charges.""

He continued, ""Any witness who has information about whether that is true or not true is a relevant witness. Anybody—like Hunter Biden—who has no information about any of that, is not a relevant witness.""

Nadler added, ""Any trial judge in this country would rule such a witness as irrelevant and inadmissible."" The outlet asserted that ""comment could mean Democrats will ask Chief Justice John Roberts to rule out the younger Biden as a witness.""

But speaking with MSNBC's ""The Beat"" later that day, Nadler admitted the decision is ""up to the Senate,"" and said the upper chamber has the power to call Hunter Biden as a witness even if Roberts were to determine Biden's testimony would be impertinent.

""The Senate can overrule the ruling of the Chief Justice by majority vote, and that's what, in effect, they're threatening to do,"" Nadler told MSNBC. ""Here, the Senate makes the ruling,"" the congressman said, adding, ""We hope it will be a fair ruling, and that's why I say the Senate's on trial.""

""I would certainly hope the Senate would not try to bring in irrelevant witnesses,"" Nadler reiterated, referring to his earlier statement regarding Hunter Biden.

Anything else?

Earlier this week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) threatened to force votes ""to call Hunter Biden and many more"" witnesses requested by President Trump in the Senate in the name of having a fair trial, after the House passed two articles of impeachment with only Democrats voting affirmatively.

Full speed ahead: Nancy Pelosi indicates that she's ready to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump,"After repeatedly urging her colleagues to put their plans to impeach President Donald Trump on hold, Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has announced that she will open a formal inquiry into impeaching the president. Her decision comes just hours after one of her House allies, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) also announced that he was for impeachment.

What did Pelosi say?

Speaking to the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldbert at the Atlantic Festival on Tuesday, Pelosi said regarding impeachment:

As soon as we have the facts, we're ready. Now we have the facts. We're ready.

Pelosi, who is far from being a fan of Trump, has until now opposed impeachment. This was likely because she believed that it was politically risky and unlikely to succeed.



But, now Pelosi seems to have come around too. On Monday, the Washington Post reported that Pelosi had been ""sounding out"" impeachment over the last few days. New accusations from a whistleblower who claimed that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, seems to have galvanized the pro-impeachment movement in the House.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Pelosi will announce at 5 p.m. ET that she plans to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.

What did Lewis say?



""Today I come with a heavy heart,"" Lewis said on the floor of the House on Tuesday, before Pelosi's comment, ""deeply concerned about the future of our democracy.""

He said that he had been approached by people who expressed fear in the U.S. government run by Trump.

""We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives, and the House alone, to begin an official investigation as dictated by the Constitution. The future of our democracy is at stake. There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to preserve and protect the integrity of our nation. I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come.""

What chance does impeachment have?

Even if all 235 Democrats join the impeachment process, their chances of removing Trump from office seem slim. If Trump is impeached, he would be tried in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be required to remove him from office. Given that Republicans currently hold a majority in the Senate, that seems — at present — to be an unlikely prospect.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-john-lewis-breaks-from-pelosi-endorses-impeachment-of-trump,2019-09-24
Rep. Marjorie Greene officially files articles of impeachment against President Biden,"Freshman GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia officially filed articles of impeachment Thursday against President Joe Biden on his first full day in office, following through on a promise she made Jan. 13 when the House voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump a second time.

What are the details?

Greene confirmed the filing on Twitter, telling her followers, ""We'll see how it goes,"" before releasing a written statement on her action.

In a news release, Greene's office stated that the Georgia Republican introduced articles of impeachment against Biden ""for his corrupt actions involving his quid pro quo in Ukraine and his abuse of power by allowing his son, Hunter Biden, to siphon off cash from America's greatest enemies Russian and China.""

""President Joe Biden is unfit to hold the office of the Presidency,"" the congresswoman wrote, arguing:

""His pattern of abuse of power as President Obama's Vice President is lengthy and disturbing. President Biden has demonstrated that he will do whatever it takes to bail out his son, Hunter, and line his family's pockets with case from corrupt foreign energy companies.



President Biden is even on tape admitting to a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government threatening to withhold $1,000,000,000 in foreign aid if they did not do his bidding. President Biden residing in the White House is a threat to national security and he must be immediately impeached.""

Greene went on to list allegations in what she referred to as the ""vast and detailed"" case against Biden.

Greene was asked by Newsmax prior to the filing if her impeachment efforts against Biden were merely symbolic, given that Democrats control the House of Representatives. Her office later told TheBlaze that ""Rep. Greene simply wants to be a voice for the voiceless,"" saying the congresswoman ""wants to defend [American conservatives] and represent the Silent Majority.""

Anything else?

Greene, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, won election on Nov. 3 in Georgia's 14th District and has already made a string of headlines since taking office.

The congresswoman was temporarily suspended from Twitter last week after the social media platform accused her of ""multiple violations of our civic integrity police."" But Greene argued in response that she was given no explanation for the suspension, and issued a statement saying that ""big tech is silencing Americans"" and that ""censorship has got to stop.""

Greene is also facing criticism after an unearthed social media post from 2018 showed that she referred to the Parkland, Florida, school massacre that killed at least 17 people as a ""false flag.""

As TheBlaze previously reported:

Critics of Greene, including other Republicans, have accused her of employing inflammatory rhetoric in order to raise campaign funds and to gain political prominence.

Report: Adam Schiff knew about the whistleblower's complaint before the whistleblower filed it,"Before filing a report about President Donald Trump to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, the whistleblower behind Washington, D.C.'s impeachment drama gave the bullet points of the complaint to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the New York Times reported Wednesday.

According to the report, the whistleblower's actions in this case demonstrate ""how determined he was to make known his allegations"" against the president related to a late July phone call with the president of Ukraine. The CIA officer, who did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, reached out to a staffer on the House Intelligence Committee about a complaint after talking with a top agency attorney, the Times said.

""In both cases,"" the paper reported, ""the original accusation was vague.""

The committee staffer then ""shared some of what the officer conveyed"" to Schiff, but did not share the identity.

""Like other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community,"" Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland told the newspaper.

This would mean that Adam Schiff was aware of the complaint that would be brought against the president of the United States before the Intelligence Community Inspector General — a complaint that would lead to the announcement of an impeachment probe in which Schiff is a key player.

Schiff's committee is one of three to send subpoenas to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani following the announcement of an ""official impeachment inquiry"" on the whistleblower matter by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Schiff's committee was also the setting for last week's hearing where the chairman made up a fictionalized version of President Trump's phone call and later defended it as ""parody.""

Shortly after the Times story broke, President Trump was asked about the story at a White House news conference.

""I think it's a scandal that he knew before,"" President Trump said about the report. ""I'd go a step further; I think he probably helped write it. OK? That's what the word is.""

The current impeachment firestorm centers on a late July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump asked his counterpart to look into a since-closed investigation of a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden as a board member despite a lack of professional energy experience. In 2018, former Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter's father, bragged about getting the prosecutor in the case fired over $1 billion while still in office.

""Look, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked and you know it"" Trump said later in the news conference when asked what he wanted the Ukranian government to look in to regarding the pair. ""His son walks out with millions of dollars, the kid knows nothing. You know it, and so do we.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-adam-schiff-knew-about-the-whistleblowers-complaint-before-the-whistleblower-filed-it,2019-10-02
Report: Biden admin gave China intelligence on Russia in bid for help — then China handed it off to Russia,"President Joe Biden's diplomatic strategy in Russia has been roundly criticized in recent days following Russian President Vladimir Putin's launch of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine over and against the U.S. president's wishes.

In the months preceding the invasion, Biden resolved to appeal to Putin's reason, urging him to ""return to diplomacy"" for the sake of Russia's ""credibility worldwide."" The strategy failed. Under threat of certain sanctions, but never military resistance, Putin went ahead with the unprovoked assault.

But Biden's mismanagement of the situation may have been worse than previously understood. According to an eye-opening new report from the New York Times published Friday, the Biden administration since late last year endeavored to enlist Chinese assistance, only to have its plan turned on its head.

What are the details?

Unnamed U.S. officials told the Times that over the past three months, senior administration officials arranged urgent meetings with Beijing during which they shared intelligence showing Russia's troop build-up on the Ukraine border in hopes that China would step in and tell Russia not to invade.

Each time, the officials said the Chinese rebuffed the Americans, playing coy about Russia's intentions — and at least one time, the Chinese turned around to hand over the intelligence to Moscow.

""After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions,"" the Times reported.

The account indicates that the Biden administration began its farfetched, if not foolhardy, Chinese outreach following a video summit held between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Nov.15. Over the course of the next few months, administration officials engaged China with similar diplomatic efforts as they did with Russia.

They warned that economic sanctions on Russia could hurt China, as well, and argued that because China was widely seen as a partner to Russia, its global image would suffer if it stood idly by while Russia invaded, the Times reported.

""But their entreaties went nowhere,"" the paper added.

The account raises concerns about the White House's naivety regarding Russia and China, the U.S.'s two strongest adversarial powers.

In a statement to the Times, Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said, “For some time, China has actively promoted the political settlement process of the Ukraine issue.”

What else?

Biden so far has been somewhat tepid in his response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, though that is not an assessment the president would give himself. In a press conference Thursday, Biden announced a slew of new sanctions on Russia that he said would be ""devastating.""

But when reporters questioned whether more could be done — such as personally sanctioning Putin and booting Russia from SWIFT, an international banking system — Biden suggested that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the current sanctions are ""working.""

Critics slammed the president for not meeting the urgency of the moment. The pressure may have worked because, on Friday, Biden reversed course on one of those items.

CNN reported that the U.S. would move quickly to freeze assets belonging to Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergeĭ Lavrov. Earlier in the day, the European Union and U.K. also announced sanctions against the two officials.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-biden-admin-gave-china-intelligence-on-russia-in-bid-for-help-then-china-handed-it-off-to-russia,2022-02-25
Report: Hunter Biden's new wife is pregnant,"Hunter Biden, 49, is about to become a father for the fifth time, according to an exclusive report from the Daily Mail.

The outlet published photos and a video of Biden's new bride, Melissa Cohen Biden, with a visible baby bump, and reported that a ""source"" close to Mrs. Biden confirmed the couple's news.

What are the details?

Melissa Biden, 33 — who married the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in May — was spotted in Los Angeles on Thursday and is reportedly well into the second trimester of her pregnancy,

The source who purportedly confirmed that the couple is expecting told The Mail that while Melissa and Hunter are ""thrilled,"" they are also experiencing stress and anxiety with the spotlight Hunter is currently under.

The Mail's report comes less than a month after a DNA test confirmed that Hunter Biden is the father of a 16-month-old child, whose mother is a 28-year-old former Washington, D.C., stripper with whom he had an affair while still allegedly dating his brother's widow. Biden is currently being sued for child support by the toddler's mother, Lunden Roberts.

As part of the lawsuit, Roberts is demanding Biden disclose the income he received from Ukrainian gas firm Burisma. Biden's position on the board of the company has come under intense scrutiny, after it was revealed that he landed the lucrative gig without any apparent qualifications while his father was vice president of the United States and the point-man for Ukraine.

Burisma has been under investigation for corruption for years, raising further questions about the Obama administration's meetings with the company's representatives and whether the conflict of interest with the Bidens played any role.

House Democrats passed articles of impeachment against President Trump claiming the president withheld aide to Ukraine in exchange for further investigation into the Bidens' dealings in the country. President Trump has repeatedly insisted there was no such quid pro quo.

Report: Source confirms 'the big guy' in alleged Hunter Biden-China email is reference to Joe Biden,"One person included in an email thread allegedly involving Hunter Biden and his business dealing in China has ""corroborated the veracity of the messages,"" Fox News reported late Friday.

What's more, the source told Fox News that a person referred to as ""the big guy"" in the emails was a reference to Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

What are the details?

Fox News reported:

One email, dated May 13, 2017, and obtained by Fox News, includes a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in a business deal with a Chinese energy firm. The email appeared to identify Hunter Biden as ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC,"" in an apparent reference to now-bankrupt CEFC China Energy Co.



The email includes a note that ""Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate."" A proposed equity split references ""20"" for ""H"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" with no further details. Fox News spoke to one of the people who was copied on the email, who confirmed its authenticity. Sources told Fox News that ""the big guy"" is a reference to the former vice president. The New York Post initially published the emails and other controversial messages that Fox News has also obtained.

The report came one day after the New York Post reported that it had obtained emails allegedly showing Hunter Biden ""pursued lucrative deals involving China's largest private energy company,"" CEFC China Energy Co.

The Post triggered a firestorm of controversy on Wednesday after obtaining a hard drive that allegedly belonged to Hunter Biden.

That hard drive belonged to a computer that was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair store in April 2019, but was never retrieved. The FBI reportedly seized the laptop last December, but the repair shop owner made copies of the hard drive before turning it over.

The initial story that set off the chain reaction of controversy — including social media companies censoring the story — claimed that emails from the hard drive showed that Joe Biden met with a top executive at the Ukrainian natural gas company at which Hunter Biden once worked.

What is Biden saying?

The Biden campaign has denied any wrongdoing took place, but acknowledged that Biden could have had an informal interaction with the Burisma executive.

Campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told Politico, ""Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing. Trump administration officials have attested to these facts under oath.""

Reporter confronts Psaki over Biden's own words promising Putin's days of intimidating US allies would be over with him in WH,"Fox News reporter Peter Doocy grilled White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday over the Biden administration's response to Russian aggression and the invasion of Ukraine.

What is the background?

While campaigning for president, Biden claimed several times that Russian President Vladimir Putin feared the possibility of him being elected president.

""Putin knows that if I am president of the United States his days of tyranny and trying to intimidate the United States and those in eastern Europe are over. I'm going to stand up to him — he's a bully,"" Biden said in 2019.

In February 2020, Biden also said, ""Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe to toe with him.""

What is the background?

During the White House press briefing, Doocy confronted Psaki with Biden's words and asked how they are consistent with the administration's current response in light of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

""It’s two and a half years later. [Putin] is intimidating the United States and those in Eastern Europe. What happened?"" Doocy asked.

In response, Psaki said Biden has ""rallied the world"" to push back against Putin, a claim that seems a bit disconnected from reality considering that Putin has thus far moved forward with his military operation in Ukraine.

""I’d hardly put it that way,"" Psaki said. ""I would look at it, actually, from the prism of: The United States and President Biden has rallied the world, rallied Europe to stand up against the efforts and the actions of President Putin.""

""You don’t think people who are totally strapped for cash,"" Doocy tried to respond as Psaki talked over him, ""right now are intimidated by $4 gas, $5 gas, however high you guys think it’s going to go? Something like that is not intimidating?""

""You asked me if we were intimidated by President Putin, and I think the evidence of that doesn’t exist,"" Psaki shot back before abruptly moving onto the next reporter.

Earlier in the briefing, Doocy also questioned whether the Biden administration still believes the biggest threat to the U.S. is climate change. Doocy was referring to remarks Biden made last June, when he claimed that top military commanders told him global warming is ""the greatest threat facing America.""

Psaki responded by pointing Doocy to the Pentagon, and she did not answer the question directly. Instead, she reiterated that Biden ""has no intention of sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight in Ukraine.""

Doocy also pressed Psaki on the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions against Russia, considering Biden administration officials have made it clear they believe Putin is determined to press forward with operations against Ukraine.

""Why do you guys think that sanctions are going to stop Putin if his goal ultimately is to redraw the map so it looks like it did 70 or 80 years ago? What sanction is going to stop him from doing that?"" Doocy asked.

Describing sanctions as a ""powerful tool,"" Psaki explained the Biden administration's ""intention is to have a deterrent effect"" and to ""prevent a large-scale invasion"" of Ukraine. She also said sanctions are ""not an end"" and claimed the sanctions are working.

She did not, however, address specifically how the sanctions will stop Putin from redrawing the eastern European map.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-confronts-psaki-over-biden-s-own-words-promising-putin-s-days-of-intimidating-us-allies-would-be-over-with-him-in-wh,2022-02-23
Reporter embarrasses Kamala Harris by exposing contradiction in Russia response: 'What leverage do you really have?',"A reporter exposed the contradictory messaging of the White House on Sunday upon confronting Vice President Kamala Harris over the Biden administration's response to looming war in Eastern Europe.

Harris — whom President Joe Biden dispatched to Germany last week to address Russia's seeming impending invasion of Ukraine — claimed on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has made his decision"" to invade Ukraine.

But on Sunday, Harris also claimed the Biden administration is prepared to authorize crippling economic sanctions that she alleged would devastate the Russian economy. The measures, according to Harris, would deter Putin from invading Ukraine and triggering the biggest European war since World War II.

What happened?

So, which is it, Madam Vice President? Has Putin made his decision to go to war, or can the U.S. deter him? That is the contradiction a reporter exposed on Sunday during a press conference with Harris before she returned to the U.S.

""If you believe Putin has made up his mind, what leverage do you really have? Why not put those sanctions in place now?"" the reporter asked.

Harris, however, failed to answer the question or address the glaring contradiction between her claims.

""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence,"" Harris responded. ""But let’s also recognize the unique nature of the sanctions that we have outlined. These are some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest that we’ve ever issued, as I articulated yesterday. It is directed at institutions — in particular, financial institutions — and individuals, and it will exact absolute harm for the Russian economy, and their government.""

""But if Putin has made up his mind, do you feel that this threat that has been looming is really going to deter him?"" the reporter asked again.

""Absolutely,"" Harris responded before engaging in word salad.

""We strongly believe — and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States, but a shared perspective among our allies. And the allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because — remember, also — we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment,"" Harris continued. ""And within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening — although it is absolutely narrowing — but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect, we believe, has merit.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that if the U.S. truly believes a Russian invasion of his country is imminent, then the U.S. should enact the economic sanctions immediately, Politico noted. The White House has not explained why sanctions have yet to be placed on Russia.

Biden extended an olive branch to Putin on Sunday, offering to hold a diplomatic summit with the Russian president in hopes of staving off war. But Putin rejected Biden's offer.

Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence indicates that Russia is moving forward with plans to invade Ukraine, CBS News reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-embarrasses-kamala-harris-by-exposing-contradiction-in-russia-response,2022-02-21
Reporter grills Psaki over admin refusing to stop buying Russian oil: 'Aren’t we financing the war?',"White House press secretary Jen Psaki was confronted Thursday over continued American dependence on Russian oil, which seemingly contradicts sanctions meant to deter Russia from continuing its war in Ukraine.



The Biden administration has repeatedly said that cutting off Russian oil imports will not be part of American sanctions against Moscow.

What happened?

During the daily press briefing, Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich asked Psaki plainly whether Americans are helping Russia finance its war against Ukraine by continuing to buy Russian oil.

""As long as we’re buying Russian oil, though, aren’t we financing the war?"" Heinrich asked.

In response, Psaki downplayed the seriousness of the issue and said what matters is minimizing the impact of sanctions on Americans.

""Well, Jacqui, again, it’s only about 10% of what we’re importing,"" she said. ""I’ve not made any announcement about any decision on that front, but our objective here and our focus is making sure that any step we take maximizes the impact on President Putin and minimizes it on the American people. And anyone who’s calling for an end to the carve-out should be clear that that would raise prices.""

According to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the U.S. imported about 700,000 barrels of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia per day on average in 2021.

That means the U.S. sends tens of millions of dollars to Russia each day, and by continuing to buy Russian oil, American tax dollars will undoubtedly help Putin wage his war to take over Ukraine.

'We Can Talk About It More Tomorrow When You Learn More': Psaki Has Tense Exchange With Fox Reporter www.youtube.com

Earlier in the press briefing, Heinrich grilled Psaki over America's energy problems, invoking several ways to increase American energy production and reduce reliance on Russia. But she was dismissed by Psaki.

First, Heinrich noted how President Joe Biden wants to increase domestic production of goods to reduce inflation. ""Why not apply the same logic to energy and increase domestic production here?"" Heinrich asked.

Psaki deflected and regurgitated an administration talking point that oil companies are not using 9,000 already-approved oil leases, thus dismissing the Biden administration's hostile posture toward fossil fuels.

""I would point that question to them,"" Psaki said of oil companies. ""And we can talk about it more tomorrow when you learn more.""

When Heinrich asked about the Keystone XL pipeline, which Biden canceled, Psaki correctly noted how the pipeline was never operational and would require years of work before it could benefit Americans.

When Psaki tried to positively spin the Biden administration's decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Heinrich quickly fact-checked her, noting how previous releases have not really lowered gas prices.

Then Psaki pushed ""clean energy,"" something that would not solve the current growing energy problem and skyrocketing gas prices.

""What we can do over time and what this is a reminder of, in the president’s view, is our need to reduce our reliance on oil,"" Psaki said. ""The Europeans need to do that; we need to do that. If we do more to invest in clean energy, more to invest in other sources of energy, that’s exactly what we can do to prevent this from happening in the future.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-grills-psaki-over-admin-refusing-to-stop-buying-russian-oil,2022-03-04
"Reports: Christian missionaries under fire for sharing the gospel, handing out Bibles while giving aid to Ukrainian refugees","Samaritan's Purse, Jews for Jesus, and other Christian groups aiding Ukrainian refugees in Europe and Israel are being criticized for ""weaponizing"" humanitarian aid by also sharing their faith, according to reports surfacing online.

What are the details?

The missionary groups have reportedly been coupling evangelistic efforts with the provision of humanitarian aid to the tens of thousands of Ukrainian residents who have fled the country amid Russia's unprovoked invasion.

They are routinely handing out Bibles and sharing the gospel message with the refugees while also providing them with food, shelter, medicine, and other physical needs.

""Ukrainian families are hurting and in desperate need of physical aid and prayer during this difficult time,"" Samaritan’s Purse president and evangelist Franklin Graham said to the Tribune Papers earlier this month. ""We are deploying life-saving medical care to aid people who are suffering. We want to meet the needs of these families in their darkest moments while pointing them to the light and hope of Jesus Christ.""

Susan Perlman, one of the founders of Jews for Jesus, an organization with a staff spread across Eastern Europe, told the Times of Israel in a statement, ""We give people food and medicine and Bibles and gas for their cars to get them moving. We see the Bible as just as practical as all these other things.""

For these groups and others, the efforts are an attempt to model Jesus' behavior and obey his commands to help the suffering and spread the gospel to all nations.

But not everyone sees the evangelistic efforts as appropriate.

What has been the reaction?

In a report published on OpIndia, a staff writer complained that ""preying upon the vulnerable has always been the standard modus operandi of the evangelist missionaries.""

""This very same strategy is back in action, this time in Ukraine, as millions fleeing the war are being targeted by American missionaries for conversion,"" the report said. ""As the refugees look to cross over to Poland and relative safety, they are being pestered by American preachers asking them to 'love Jesus.'""

The article specifically cited Samaritan's Purse as one of the missionary agencies supposedly doing more harm than good by sharing their religious beliefs.

Others took issue with Messianic Jewish groups sharing the gospel with specifically Jewish Ukrainian refugees.

Rabbi Tovia Singer, the head of Outreach Judaism, an organization set up to counter Christian missions to Jewish people, claimed Messianic groups were ""weaponizing humanitarian aid in order to share the gospel.""



Shannon Nuszen, who leads a nonprofit called Beyneynu that tracks Christian missionary activity in Jewish communities, added to the Times of Israel that such outreach efforts are ""disrespectful, offensive and sinister.""

“They are targeting vulnerable people who are looking for food and shelter to rob them of their faith,"" Nuszen said, adding that practices such as distributing Bibles are ""disrespectful, it’s crossing the line, it’s offensive. It’s not the way that a true friend would act.""

""They have their hands in any place where there are vulnerable Jews, whether it’s refugees, kids on college campuses, kids on summer vacation,"" she continued.

This disagreement holds special significance because Messianic Jews are ethnic Jews who believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah spoken of in Jewish tradition and literature, including the Old Testament. Practicers of Judaism believe the Messiah, or savior, is yet to come.

What else?

The Messianic groups, however, have responded to criticism by arguing the gospel is an essential part of their message and insisting that acceptance of Christ is in no way a prerequisite for receiving physical aid.

""We can’t help but pray for people, share the gospel with them. People are coming to know the Lord. It’s not in place of caring for their immediate physical needs, but it is a part of who we are,"" Perlman said. ""It’s not, 'You have to read this Bible in order to get help from us,' but we think that the Bible is a great source of help and encouragement and hope in times like these.""

Mitch Glaser, who runs New York-based Chosen People Ministries, a Messianic group helping care for around 230 people at a Christian camp outside Warsaw, shared a similar sentiment.

""We literally want to follow the model that Jesus set in the gospels, where he cared for people who were needy,"" Glaser said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reports-christian-missionaries-sharing-gospel-aid-ukrainian-refugees,2022-03-25
Republican lawmaker introduces bill saying no aid for Ukraine until the southern border is secured,"On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) introduced legislation that would prevent the United States from sending military aid to Ukraine until the U.S. southern border is secured.

Fox News reported that the Secure America’s Border First Act would prevent the United States from making any monetary obligations or commitments of personnel to assist Kyiv in staving off Russian invasion until there is “operational control” of the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I think it’s quite hypocritical if someone in the U.S. Congress is willing to expend the funds to secure a border overseas thousands of miles away while they’re not willing to secure our own border,” Rosendale said in an interview. “And we are witnessing not a threat, but we are witnessing an absolute invasion that is taking place right now.”

“We have war hawks on both sides of the aisle willing to go over there and spend American blood and treasure in Ukraine,” Rosendale continued, “What I’m saying is we’re not obligated and so at least the minimum we can do is secure our own border first if you are going to go over there and spend money.”

Rosendale’s bill stipulates that no funds are to be provided to Ukraine until the federal government finishes building the southern border wall and “operational control,” as defined by the 2006 Secure Fence Act, is achieved.

Noting the recent influx of illegal immigrants, Rep. Rosendale said, “We witnessed an invasion over the last year of two million individuals trying to get into the country, we’re not even sure how many of them have been successful, so let’s build the border wall system, let’s gain operational control of our southern border, and then we might be able to have a conversation about what we’re going to do overseas about securing someone else’s border.”

During the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Donald Trump made securing the southern border a core part of his campaign. Upon winning election, the former president signed an executive order to “secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall” and provide additional resources to officials on the southern border so they could effectively enforce the country’s immigration laws.

Since Joe Biden became president, the immigration crisis at the southern border has gotten significantly worse. In 2021, there were nearly 2 million illegal border crossings.

Many of the people entering the country illegally are given preferential treatment by the federal government. They are being transported into the country’s interior, given substantial sums of money, and can even commit violent crimes without being deported.

The Biden administration’s disregard for immigration law puts the health and safety of law enforcement officials at risk. Several Republican-led states formed a multi-state coalition seeking an injunction forcing the White House to secure the country’s southern border.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republican-lawmaker-introduces-bill-saying-no-aid-for-ukraine-until-the-southern-border-is-secured,2022-02-09
Republican lawmaker wants bust of Zelenskyy in US Capitol,"Long-serving Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina has put forward a resolution that calls for displaying a bust of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the U.S. Capitol.

""Resolved, That the House of Representatives directs the Fine Arts Board to obtain a bust of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for display in a suitable, permanent location in the House of Representatives wing of the United States Capitol,"" the resolution states.

Wilson has served as a House lawmaker for more than two decades.

The U.S. has spent billions of dollars backing Ukraine as that beleaguered nation strives to fight against a Russian invasion.

Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine ""fully understand the meaning behind the American Revolution mottos of Don't Tread On Me and Live Free or Die,"" Wilson said in a December tweet. ""The United States stands with Ukraine for victory.""

Last month, while addressing a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, Zelenskyy declared, ""Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.""

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky responded by tweeting, ""It is not charity. Charity would be given freely. The American taxpayers have been conscripted into making welfare payments to this foreign government."" Massie had previously tweeted, ""I'm in DC but I will not be attending the speech of the Ukrainian lobbyist.""

Last month, Congress passed an around $1.7 trillion omnibus package that ran thousands of pages long — the mammoth measure included billions of dollars in assistance for Ukraine.

""Congratulations to @GOPLeader on his election as the Speaker,"" Zelenskyy tweeted after Republican Kevin McCarthy of California secured the House speakership last week. ""U.S. support in all fields has been vital for [Ukraine]'s success on the battlefield. We're counting on your continued support and further U.S. assistance to bring our common victory closer.""

"Poll: Republicans stand to win big in the 2022 midterms, have massive lead in generic congressional ballot","Republicans currently hold the lead on the generic congressional ballot test for the first time in nearly a decade.

According to a new NPR/Marist poll, Republicans are well positioned to retake both chambers of Congress in the 2022 midterms, as they enjoy a healthy lead on the generic congressional ballot for the first time since 2014.

A press release from Marist said, “With the 2022 Congressional Midterm Elections a little more than six months away, U.S. registered voters give Republicans (47%) the advantage over the Democratic candidates (44%) nationally.”

The press release indicated the plurality of Americans believe the Republican Party is best fit to address the issues the country is currently facing.

“On the economy, controlling inflation, crime, national security, and gun policy, pluralities of Americans perceive the Republican Party to be the party who would be better able to handle these issues. Americans express these views as President Joe Biden’s job approval rating remains upside down, and his ratings on the economy and the crisis in Ukraine take on water.”

Polling cited by Marist indicated that registered independents substantially favor Republicans for the primary race, as well.

The Marist press release said, “Independents break 45% for the Republican candidate and 38% for the Democratic candidate on the generic congressional ballot. A notable 10% are unsure.”

Data gathered in the polling process indicates that notable pluralities believe Republicans can better handle issues affecting the everyday person's quality of life such as national security (43%), the economy (42%), controlling inflation (41%), gun policy (41%), and crime (39%).

The data indicated that the Democratic Party is perceived to have a tighter grip on handling social issues such as LGBTQ rights (48%), climate change (45%), and abortion (41%).

There appears to be little consensus, however, about which of the major parties could better handle immigration. Republicans were favored by 37% of respondents to address the issue, while Democrats were favored by 34%.

According to the poll, 57% of adults registered to vote disapprove of how President Joe Biden “is handling the economy.” When asked which party they “think would do a better job” in managing the economy, respondents favored the Republican Party (42%) over the Democratic Party (26%).

Currently, the GOP has an 85% chance of retaking the House of Representatives and a 73% chance of retaking the U.S. Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-democrats-midterms-ballot,2022-05-01
'The facts haven't changed': Republicans dismiss Bolton book's impact on Senate impeachment trial,"The Sunday night revelations about former White House national security adviser John Bolton's forthcoming book have threatened to upend the Senate's impeachment trial, but several Republican senators are saying that the news doesn't change anything for them.

The New York Times reported late Sunday that Bolton's new book claims that President Donald Trump admitted in August that he wanted to continue holding up military aid to Ukraine if the Ukrainian government did not cooperate with investigations into the Bidens. Trump responded that he ""NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.""

Naturally, the news prompted congressional Democrats to reiterate their longstanding calls for witnesses, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) asking, ""How can Senate Republicans not vote to call that witness and request his documents?"" at a Monday morning news conference.

In an appearance on CNN, Senate Judiciary Committee member Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said that not calling Bolton to testify ""will tell me that the Republicans are going right along with the president and Mitch McConnell in rigging this trial.""

Before the trial proceedings resumed Monday, some Republican lawmakers were dismissive of the report's overall effect on the case.

""I think we're going to have some new something that comes out every single day"" of the trial, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) told reporters, adding that it ""doesn't really change anything.""

Blackburn's fellow Tennessean, outgoing Sen. Lamar Alexander (R), said that he would withhold judgment on whether or not new evidence was needed until the White House's team finished their opening arguments and senators had asked written questions later in the week.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told reporters that the news ""doesn't change the underlying facts that a president is justified, has full authority and indeed a responsibility to investigate serious evidence of corruption."" He also said that he ""predicted at the outset of this proceeding that there would be breathless revelations day after day that would be turned into a frenzy.""

""There is nothing new here to what the House managers have been saying."" Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso (Wyo.) said about the Bolton news at a Monday news conference. ""Take a breath; let's listen to the President's lawyers today in the case they present.""

""Do not get distracted by the shiny objects of saying 'we need witnesses' or Bolton's new manuscript or anything else,"" House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-Ga.) told reporters. ""Don't lose sight of the fact that the facts haven't changed.""



Speaking to reporters in the basement of the Capitol Building, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) even questioned Bolton's credibility, saying that ""I wouldn't bet my house"" on him telling the truth, and said that new allegations would have more credibility if they were raised by someone else.



But not everyone in the Senate Republican conference was so dismissive of the report's allegations. GOP Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) said that the Bolton book news ""strengthens the case for witnesses"" in a statement, while Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) said it was ""increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton.""



The Senate's newest Republican member even went so car as to criticize Romney over wanting to hear from Bolton. In a Monday tweet, Sen. Kelly Loeffler (Ga.) said that her colleague ""wants to appease"" the left by calling witnesses with potentially damaging testimony to the trial. ""The circus is over. It's time to move on!""



Additionally, despite his previously stated desire not to draw out the length of the trial with more witnesses, Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said that he would want to see what's in the manucript in order to determine whether or nor he should be called.

""I want to see what's in the manuscript,"" Graham — one of Trump's top allies in the trial process so far — told reporters. ""Let's see what's in the manuscript, let's see if it's relevant, and if it is, I'll make a decision about Bolton.""

However, Graham also reiterated Monday that if the Senate calls Democrat-desired witnesses, then the chamber should also allow President Trump ""to call all relevant witnesses he has requested.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-dismiss-bolton-books-impact-on-impeachment-trial,2020-01-27
Republicans formally request to subpoena Hunter Biden and the whistleblower,"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have submitted a formal request to House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to subpoena Hunter Biden and the whistleblower in the House impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

In the letter request submitted Wednesday, Reps. Nunes and Jordan argue that despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's commitment that the whistleblower would ""speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law,"" their request that the whistleblower testify has been ""repeatedly rejected.""

The letter argues that the whistleblower's testimony is ""necessary for a full and fair understanding of all relevant facts.""

Reps. Nunes and Jordan cite reported revelations of the whistleblower's bias against President Trump, working relationship with former Vice President Joe Biden, and discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and closed-door testimony from witnesses as reasons they must testify – and consequently reasons the Democrats' are denying appeals to subpoena them.

To date, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they do not know the identity of the whistleblower – despite publishing his unredacted name in a closed-door testimony transcript – and ironically vow to make sure his, or her, identity is kept secret.

News also broke Wednesday that the alleged whistleblower was friends with a Schiff staffer while both were in the Obama White House.

""You have repeatedly refused to allow Republicans to fully examine the role of Vice President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a corrupt Ukrainian company, during Vice President Biden's term in office,"" the letter continues.



Reps. Nunes and Jordan argue that concerns over Hunter Biden's post at Burisma raised by witness testimony, the Obama administration, and President Trump in his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, make his testimony directly relevant to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.

While on the board at Burisma, Hunter Biden was reportedly paid roughly $1 million per year, more than 12 times the comparable pay for board members at similarly-sized companies. He was also paid as a consultant in addition to his paid work as a board member.

In addition to subpoenaing Hunter Biden and the whistleblower for sworn testimony, the letter states that Reps. Nunes and Jordan intend to subpoena Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, Hunter Biden's company, for records relating to his role at Burisma, and the Democratic National Committee for communications with Ukraine officials and for records relating to Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC contractor allegedly paid to dig up dirt on Trump in 2016 with help from Ukraine officials.

In closing, the letter claims that Schiff and the Democrats' failure to concur with the subpoenas would constitute evidence of ""denial of fundamental fairness and due process.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-request-subpoena-biden-whistleblower,2019-11-20
Republicans want greater oversight for weapon shipments to Ukraine — only 10% of U.S. weapons have been inspected in person,"The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in first-world weaponry to Ukraine since its invasion by Russia. House Republicans, poised to take control of Congress in January, are now pressuring the Biden administration for greater accountability and transparency about these weapons transfers as well about other aid packages sent to the embattled Slavic nation.

The push for greater oversight comes after it was revealed that there have only been two in-person weapons inspections conducted by U.S. monitors since February.



Some accountability at last

Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told CNN in early November that there ""has to be accountability going forward.""

Underlining his support for Ukraine, McCarthy said, ""You always need, not a blank check, but [to] make sure the resources are going where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.""

Another GOP lawmaker clarified to CNN, ""McCarthy was not saying, 'We wouldn't spend money.' McCarthy was saying, 'We're gonna be accountable to the taxpayer for every dollar we spend.' ... A 'blank check' means that people get whatever they ask for. What we're saying is there's going to be some thought, there's going to be accountability.""

The New York Post reported that Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, indicated that Republicans continue to support aid to Ukraine, but on the condition that it's clear where it's going and that there is accountability for how it's utilized.

""We have a voice now, and we're going to do this in an accountable way, with transparency to the American people,"" said McCaul. ""These are American taxpayer dollars doing in.""

Rep. Mike Turner, the ranking Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, indicated funding will no longer be included in ""Democrat bills,"" whereby assistance for the Slavic nation is contingent upon Democrats getting what they want in the way of domestic funding for their pet projects.

""We don't need to pass $40 billion, large Democrat bills ... to send $8 billion to Ukraine,"" Turner told ABC's ""This Week.""

Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) suggested that oversight has been long been regarded as necessary for weapons shipments to countries far less corrupt than Ukraine. According to Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked 122nd out of 180 countries.

Waltz said, ""With the volumes of goods that we're pushing, it's our responsibility to have third-party oversight. We do it all over the world.""

On Nov. 17, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and other Republican lawmakers held a press conference to discuss taxpayer funding to aid Ukraine.

Greene, who introduced a privileged resolution to audit the funds allocated to Ukraine by Congress, noted that ""Congress has appropriated $54 billion to aid in the Ukrainian conflict, and then our president, Joe Biden, has requested another $38 billion this week.""



""The American people, the taxpayers of this country, deserve to know where their money is going and how it's being spent,"" said Greene.

In the press conference, Greene said that of the aforementioned $54 billion, $44 billion ""is for aid to Ukraine and other affected countries. But what other countries? And how are they affected? And how did the American people's taxpayer dollars go to those countries? And to who? And to what organization? To their government? And in what way?""



Although Greene's resolution will likely be shot down by Democrats in the House sometime in the next two weeks, the Washington Post indicated that not all Democrats are opposed to clarity on how U.S. tax dollars are being deployed in Ukraine.

""The taxpayers deserve to know that investment is going where it's intended to go,"" said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.).



Crow reportedly led an initiative in the House Armed Services Committee to include in the defense bill instructions to the Pentagon inspector general to audit, investigate, and review the Pentagon's efforts to support Ukraine.

Although certain that various weapons will be inevitably be ""lost,"" Crow said, ""We're not trying to prevent every single piece from falling into the hands of the Russians, but we want to make sure it's not happening at a large scale.""

Unlike Greene and McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recommended that the House Republican caucus ""focus its oversight on ensuring timely delivery of needed weapons and greater allied assistance to Ukraine.""

By oversight, McConnell doesn't appear to be concerned about accountability but on faster and ""more proactive"" weapons deliveries to Ukraine.

Glaring lack of oversight

The budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development in 2021 was over $53 billion. It requested billions more for fiscal year 2022.



The Washington Post reported that despite these billions of dollars, the State Department allegedly cannot afford to have weapons inspectors in Ukraine check every incoming shipment.

As of early November, only two in-person inspections had been conducted by U.S. monitors since the war began. That means only 10% of the 22,000 U.S.-provided weapons requiring enhanced oversight, including Stinger surface-to-air missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, had been accounted for.

NBC News reported that it was only in October that Brig. Gen. Garrick Harmon, the U.S. defense attaché to Ukraine, had been dispatched to Ukraine to keep track of billions of dollars' worth of first-world weapons. Similar checks were terminated after Russia invaded on Feb. 24.

According to the State Department, included among the largely uninspected weaponry and systems committed to Ukraine are:

Over 1,600 Sting anti-aircraft systems;

Over 8,500 Javelin anti-armor systems;

Over 38,000 other anti-armor systems;

Over 700 Switchblade drones;

142 155mm Howitzers plus 924,000 155mm artillery rounds;

4,000 precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds;

36 105mm Howitzers plus 180,000 105mm artillery rounds;

1,500 tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided (TOW) missiles;

8 national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (MASAMS) and munitions;

4 Avenger air defense systems;

20 Mi-17 helicopters;

45 T-72B tanks;

200 MII3 armored personnel carriers;

Over 11,000 grenade launchers and small arms;

Over 84 million rounds of small arms ammunition;

58 coastal and riverine patrol boats; and

plenty of other defensive, offensive, protective, and explosive equipment, systems, and military vehicles.

While downplaying the possibility that unaccounted-for weapons might end up on the black market, the State Department conceded both that ensuring American weaponry makes it into the right hands can be ""difficult"" owing to the ""chaotic nature of combat"" and that Russia may be able to capture these weapons to ""develop countermeasures, propaganda, or to conduct false-flag operations.""



According to the Post, the Arms Export Control Act requires the Biden administration to provide ""reasonable assurance"" that the recipients of the billions of dollars' worth of weaponry are using them for their intended purposes.

With weapons going missing and so few incoming U.S. weapons inspected in Ukraine, it is unlikely a reasonable assurance can be given at the present time.

In April, one senior defense official told reporters, ""I couldn't tell you where [helicopters, cannons, and Switchblade drones] are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point. ... They're not telling us every round of ammunition they're firing and who and at when.""

National Security Council coordinator John Kirby suggested that weapons provided by the Pentagon were usually picked up by Ukrainian armed forces in Poland and then driven into Ukraine. Afterward, ""it's up to the Ukrainians to determine where they go and how they're allocated inside their country.""

On July 22, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation issued a statement, warning that ""the proliferation of firearms and explosives in Ukraine could lead to an increase in firearms and munitions trafficked into the EU via established smuggling routes or online platforms. This threat might even be higher once the conflict has ended.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-want-greater-oversight-for-weapon-shipments-to-ukraine,2022-11-28
Requirement for whistleblowers to have 'first-hand information' was scrapped ahead of complaint against President Trump,"The intelligence community secretly removed the requirement that whistleblowers must have ""first-hand information"" of wrongdoings in order to fast-track allegations to Congress prior to a CIA officer's complaint against President Donald Trump, reducing the threshold for informants to merely check a box stating, ""I heard about it from others.""

What are the details?

According to a report from The Federalist, the rule change was made sometime between May 2018 and August 2019 — the same month an unnamed CIA officer submitted a ""Disclosure of Urgent Concern"" form reporting allegations that President Trump violated the law.

The whistleblower's complaint noted that he or she was ""not a direct witness"" to the allegations made against President Trump. But prior to the new form changes, any whistleblower was required to have ""first-hand knowledge"" in order for consideration to be granted at all.

As The Federalist's Sean Davis wrote, ""This raises questions about the intelligence community's behavior.""

The form changes were first discovered by researcher Stephen McIntyre, who shared the before-and-after forms on Twitter. The previous ""Urgent Concern Disclosure Form"" had a paragraph noting in bold type: ""First-hand information required,"" spelling out that any ""credible"" complainant ""must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information"" — not ""second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions.""



Yet, the whistleblower admitted in their complaint against President Trump that they were ""not a direct witness to most of the events described,"" but thought the information leaked to them was ""credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another.""

Anything else?

The news of the rule change further complicates an already controversial impeachment inquiry into President Trump, which was based on the purported whistleblower's concerns. As of this writing, the whistleblower remains unnamed, and none of his or her sources have come forward to corroborate the claims.

President Trump did, however, release the transcript of a call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an effort to refute the accusations made by the anonymous informant.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/requirement-for-whistleblowers-to-have-first-hand-information-was-scrapped-before-ukraine-complaint,2019-09-28
'Resign — go to confession': Scaramucci urges Mick Mulvaney to step down and lawyer up,"Anthony Scaramucci — best known for his famously short-lived stint as White House press secretary — has offered some unsolicited advice to White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney: ""Resign — go to confession,"" and get ""a really good lawyer.""

What are the details?

""If I were giving Mick Mulvaney advice, [if I were him] I would resign, I would get myself a really good lawyer, because you're going to have to explain a lot of things,"" Scaramucci told CNN's ""New Day,"" prefacing his thoughts by saying that ""Mulvaney is a good guy"" who is ""working for a terrible person.""

He added, ""What I would say to Mick, is, 'you're a good Catholic. Resign — go to confession, OK, then let's rebuild your career from here.""



The former press secretary-of-10-days has been on a media blitz over the past few months since turning against his former boss, President Donald Trump, and took the opportunity to weigh in on the current pressure reportedly facing Mulvaney.

During a news conference on Thursday, Mulvaney caused confusion after appearing to suggest there was some sort of ""quid pro quo"" involved with the Trump administration withholding military aid to Ukraine.

""I have news for everybody: Get over it,"" the White House chief told reporters. ""There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.""

The administration and several top Republicans have consistently denied there was any such arrangement, and Mulvaney walked back his comments later that day.

Since the apparent flub, Mulvaney has sought to clarify his initial remarks while fighting back against rumors that he offered to resign. In an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace over the weekend, Mulvaney admitted that he could see how his words were misinterpreted, but emphasized that he ""never said it was a quid pro quo,"" Politico reported.""

Rick Perry tells Trump he's out as energy secretary amid increasing attention from Ukraine controversy,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry sent a letter announcing his intended resignation to President Donald Trump on Thursday, amid reports of disagreement between the two over the ongoing Ukraine controversy and related impeachment efforts.

""It has been a tremendous honor to serve our country in your administration in such a meaningful way,"" Perry wrote in his letter. He added that he ""will be forever grateful for this opportunity and I look forward to further supporting you and advancing American leadership in significant ways as a private citizen.



""Please accept this letter as my official notification that I plan to resign at a date later this year,"" Perry concluded.

In a video message to Department of Energy employees, Perry called the position ""the coolest job in the world.""

The resignation announcement comes as Perry has become a major figure in the narrative about President Trump's outreach to the Ukrainian officials, which is the basis of the Democrats' latest impeachment efforts. During a conference call with Capitol Hill Republicans earlier this month, Trump reportedly blamed Perry for the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""Not a lot of people know this but, I didn't even want to make the call,"" Trump said, according to an Axios report. ""The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquid natural gas] plant.""

A DOE spokesperson later said that ""Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development"" and that he ""continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security.""

Perry's role in the matter goes deeper than just the phone call, according to other Trump administration officials.

The secretary led an official May delegation to the Ukraine that Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland have both testified about to House investigators. It was after that trip, both men testified, that members of the delegation met with a President Trump to convince him of recently elected President Volodymyr Zelensky commitment to reform, and the importance of U.S. assistance to the country.

In both accounts, Trump was ""skeptical"" of the prospect, given the eastern European country's notorious history of corruption.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rick-perry-leaving-post-amid-ukraine-controversy,2019-10-18
CNBC editor tears into Biden over new sky-high inflation numbers: 'Maybe things would have turned out a bit different',"CNBC on-air editor Rick Santelli reacted in live time Friday as abysmal new inflation numbers dropped, blasting the Biden administration for its hostile energy policies.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed Friday the consumer price index jumped 1% from April, climbing to a year-over-year spike of 8.6%, the highest rate in more than 40 years.

What did Santelli say?

Santelli was speaking live on ""Squawk Box"" when the CPI data for May was published. After reading off the alarming numbers, Santelli unloaded on President Joe Biden.

""I will say that out of all of the above, energy, energy, energy,"" Santelli began.

""You know, there are so many comments here about, 'Oh, the administration can only do so much,'"" he continued. ""You know what? We all said that about the Fed. And then there's this thing called 'forward guidance.' So the Fed gets the market to do things long before it takes action by telling [people] what's in their head what lies down the road.""

Inversely, Santelli said the ""forward guidance"" from Biden has been to demonize the oil and gas industry.

“What was the forward guidance with this administration on energy? We know the answer,"" he said. ""Maybe they can’t get things to happen faster, but by giving positive forward guidance, by not closing pipelines, by not talking pre-election about how much they don’t like fossil fuel, maybe things would have turned out a bit different.""

What is Biden saying?

The president addressed the ongoing inflation problem Friday by once again turning to his trite scapegoats: Russian President Vladimir Putin and the oil industry.

""Putin’s Price Hike hit hard in May here and around the world: high gas prices at the pump, energy, and food prices accounted for around half of the monthly price increases, and gas pump prices are up by $2 a gallon in many places since Russian troops began to threaten Ukraine,"" Biden said in a statement.

The reality, however, is that gas prices have more than doubled since Biden took office last year. The average price of gas was $2.39 per gallon on Jan. 20, 2021. Today, the average price hit $4.99 per gallon, an all-time record.

Meanwhile, Biden also said, ""[I]t is also important that the oil and gas and refining industries in this country not use the challenge created by the war in Ukraine as a reason to make things worse for families with excessive profit taking or price hikes.""

But that is not true. While the Biden administration has repeatedly tried to blame oil companies for price gouging, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas made it clear that oil companies are not responsible for gas prices.

""Since only 1 percent of service stations in the U.S. are owned by companies that also produce oil, U.S. oil producers are in no position to control retail gasoline prices,"" the economists wrote last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rick-santelli-blasts-biden-energy-policies-inflation-crisis,2022-06-10
"Trump's lawyers 'kneecapped' Adam Schiff and the Dems' impeachment case, says Sen. Rick Scott","President Donald Trump's lawyers were so successful at dismantling the House Democrats' impeachment case on Saturday morning that one prominent Republican senator compared it to a mob hit.

When asked by Fox News host Neil Cavuto what he thought of the arguments laid out by the president's defense team, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott said it looked like Rep. Adam Schiff got ""kneecapped.""

""I think Adam Schiff got kneecapped,"" Scott said. ""I think the White House counsel showed three was no due process in the House. Just a fabrication what [Schiff] did.""

Scott, who was elected in 2018, went on to point out that Trump's defense counsel successfully highlighted the weaknesses in the Democrats' case against the 45th president of the United States.

""They explained there was no quid pro quo, no obstruction of justice. I think he did a great job,"" he added.

'Six key facts' exonerate Trump

As TheBlaze's Chris Enloe reported earlier on Saturday, in his remarks before the Senate, deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura pointed to ""six key facts"" that exonerate Trump of wrongdoing.

1. The infamous Ukraine call transcript

""The transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything,"" Purpura explained. ""The paused security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call.""



2. Ukrainian officials deny being pressured

""[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything,"" Purpura said.



3. Ukraine did not know about paused aid

""President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know — did not even know — the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call,"" Purpura explained.



4. No witnesses say Trump tied aid to Biden investigation

""Not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations in security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else,"" Purpura said.



5. Security Assistance aid continued after phone call

""The security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25, without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations,"" Purpura explained.



6. President Trump has been a strong ally of Ukraine

""The Democrats' blind eye to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats' own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor,"" Purpura said. ""Those are the facts.""

Indeed, Trump's lawyers spent much of Saturday morning emphasizing to senators a series of exculpatory evidence that absolves the president of any wrongdoing and contextualizing the president's decision to withhold aid to Ukraine.

The Democrats are the ones interfering with an election

Meanwhile, in his remarks, White House counsel Pat Cipollone turned the tables on Democrats by accusing them of being the ones attempting to undermine a democratic election, Fox News reported.

""For all their talk about election interference, they're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,"" Cipollone said in his opening statements. ""And we can't allow that to happen.""

""It would violate the sacred trust that the American people have placed in you and have placed in them. The American people decide elections. They have one coming up in nine months,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rick_scott_trump_lawyers_kneecap_schiff,2020-01-25
"Who's laughing now? CNN mocked Trump voters, now the joke is on them in a devastating new ad","Surely, when ""CNN Tonight"" host Don Lemon invited anti-Trump Republican Rick Wilson and New York Times writer Wajahat Ali on his program, the last thing that crossed his mind was that their appearance would boost Republicans' 2020 prospects. Yet, that's exactly what may have happened after the trio mocked supporters of the president as uneducated hillbillies.

On Tuesday evening, the Republican National Committee launched a new ad in response to Lemon, Wilson, and Ali ridiculing the 63 million voters who backed President Trump in 2016.

What happened?

Wilson began belittling Trump voters after he was asked by Lemon about reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo challenged an NPR reporter to point to Ukraine on a map.

""Look ... [Pompeo] knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it,"" Wilson said as Lemon and Ali began laughing uncontrollably.

""He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world, and so that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience,"" Wilson continued, describing the president's supporters as ""the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump, that wants to think that 'Donald Trump's the smart one, and y'all — y'all elitists are dumb.'""

Ali then joined in on the mockery with a fake southern accent: ""You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling ... your reading ... knowing other countries ... sipping your latte.""

'They Think You're a Joke'

The segment was heavily criticized by political observers, especially conservatives who said the trio's remarks exposed what elite Democrats truly think of rural Americans and could even bolster the president's re-election efforts. Even liberal commentator Soledad O'Brien blasted it as ""not being worthy of being on a newscast.""

Wilson and Ali's mockery of small-town conservatives as ignorant may have brought out tears of laughter in Don Lemon, but it seems like Republicans will have the last laugh at CNN's expense with the RNC turning the segment into a commercial.

The one-minute ad features clips of the three men laughing at conservatives, along with Hillary Clinton's infamous ""basket of deplorables"" comment and remarks from other prominent Democrats — namely Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden — disparaging supporters of President Trump.

"Roger Waters rips 'war criminal' Biden over Ukraine, declares 'Taiwan is part of China,' lauds Russia for 'almost' winning World War II","In a dizzying and contentious CNN interview focusing on world politics, Pink Floyd founder Roger Waters explained why he's calling President Joe Biden a ""war criminal"" as part of his current concert tour — and managed to declare that ""Taiwan is part of China"" and even that Russia ""almost"" won World War II.

What are the details?

As readers of TheBlaze know by now, Waters arguably has been more of a geo-political pundit in recent years than a musician and performer.

The bass player and songwriter behind iconic albums such as ""The Wall"" and ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" previously targeted former President Donald Trump and Israel, but with his current ""This Is Not a Drill Tour,” Waters has taken issue with Biden:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

When CNN’s Michael Smerconish recently asked Waters about his anti-Biden imagery at his concerts, Waters replied, “Well, he’s fueling the [war] in the Ukraine, for a start. That is a huge crime. Why won’t the United States of America encourage [Ukraine President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy ... to negotiate, obviating the need for this horrific, horrendous war ...”

When Smerconish told Waters he's “blaming the party who got invaded — c'mon, you've got it reversed,” Waters shot back with the following to the CNN host: ""Any war, when did it start? What you need to do is look at the history, and you can say, ‘Well, it started on this day.’ You could say it started in 2008 … This war is basically about the action and reaction of NATO pushing right up to the Russian border, which they promised they wouldn’t do when [Mikhail] Gorbachev negotiated the withdrawal of the USSR from the whole of Eastern Europe.”

Smerconish countered by asking Waters about the U.S.'s role as “liberators,"" particularly during World War II.

Waters wasn't having it: “You got into World War II because of Pearl Harbor. You were completely isolationists until that sad, that devastating, awful day in 1941 ... Thank God the Russians had already won the bloody war almost by then. Don't forget 23 million Russians died protecting you and me from the Nazi menace.”

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The back-and-forth didn't let up, as Smerconish argued that ""you would think that the Russians would've learned their lesson from war — and wouldn't have invaded Ukraine.""

With that Waters told the host — who was chuckling by this point — “I would suggest you, Michael ... go away and read a bit more, and then try and figure out what the United States would do if the Chinese were putting nuclear-armed missiles into Mexico and Canada.""

""The Chinese are too busy encircling Taiwan as we speak, OK?"" Smerconish chirped back at Waters.

""They're not encircling Taiwan! Taiwan is part of China! And that's been absolutely accepted by the whole of the international community since 1948,"" Waters hollered at the host. ""And if you don’t know that, you're not reading enough. Go and read about it! ... You're believing your propaganda, your side’s propaganda. ... You can’t have a conversation about human rights, and you can’t have a conversation about Taiwan without actually doing the reading.”

Then it was Smerconish's turn to get testy: ""Roger, Roger! If you're having a conversation about human rights, at the top of the list of offenders are the Chinese. Why is it always the Western world ...""

“The Chinese didn’t invade Iraq and kill a million people in 2003,” Waters interrupted, and soon wondered, ""Who have the Chinese invaded and murdered, slaughtered?”

“Their own,” Smerconish replied, presumably in reference to the Uyghurs, although Smericonish didn't clarify that in the moment. ""Their own.""

“Bullocks! That’s absolute nonsense! Complete nonsense! You should go away and read!"" Waters shot back before the interview ended on a surprisingly friendly note.

Romney decides not to block subpoena in Senate Biden-Burisma probe he previously criticized,"After saying that a Senate committee investigation into corruption questions surrounding Ukranian energy company Burisma — which formerly employed Hunter Biden as a board member — ""looks political,"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has said that he will not vote to block subpoenas in the effort.

According to a Friday statement from a Romney spokesperson, the Utah senator made his decision after receiving assurances from Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that interviewing the subpoenaed witness wouldn't happen in front of television cameras.

""Senator Romney has expressed his concerns to Chairman Johnson, who has confirmed that any interview of the witness would occur in a closed setting without a hearing or public spectacle,"" the statement read. ""He will therefore vote to let the Chairman proceed to obtain the documents that have been offered.""

Johnson announced his intention to issue the first subpoena of his Burisma-related investigation earlier this week. In a letter to his colleagues dated Sunday, the chairman said that he planned to hold a committee meeting to issue a subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko — a former Ukrainian diplomat who also used to work as a consultant for the public relations firm, Blue Star Strategies.

""Blue Star, a U.S.-based government and public affairs firm founded by Karen Tramontano (former deputy chief of staff to President Clinton) and Sally Painter (a former senior adviser for the Clinton administration), was a U.S. representative for a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings,"" the letter explained. ""As part of the Committee's ongoing investigation, it has received U.S. government records indicating that Blue Star sought to leverage Hunter Biden's role as a board member of Burisma to gain access to, and potentially influence matters at, the State Department.""

Johnson said the subpoena — the first of his committee's Burisma probe — was ""appropriate at this time"" because Blue Star had been uncooperative and Telizhenko claimed to be bound by a nondisclosure agreement.

Following Johnson's announcement, Romney — who sits on the Homeland Security Committee — signaled that he might vote against the subpoena.

""There's no question but that the appearance of looking into Burisma and Hunter Biden appears political,"" Romney told reporters on Thursday. ""And I think people are tired of these kind of political investigations and would hope that if there's something of significance that needs to be evaluated, that it would be done by perhaps the FBI or some other agency that's not as political as perhaps a committee of our, of our body.""

The committee is composed of eight Republicans and six Democrats, meaning that a single majority member voting with the minority would cause a 7-7 tie vote, thereby causing the subpoena effort to fail.

Countering claims that his investigative efforts are politically motivated, Johnson said Wednesday evening that he started looking into suspicions of Ukrainian election meddling with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) back in 2017.



""It's not our fault that Joe Biden, Hunter Biden got wrapped up in the whole Ukrainian story,"" Johnson said in an interview with Fox News' Martha McCallum. ""We are not closing our eyes to this; and I have no idea why anybody would object to us obtaining records from a U.S. consulting firm run by former Clinton administration officials that is basically using Hunter Biden's name to strong-arm the State Department to curry benefits for a corrupt Ukrainian oil company.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/romney-decides-not-to-block-subpoena-in-senate-biden-burisma-probe-he-previously-criticized,2020-03-06
Mitt Romney signals that he may kill Burisma subpoena,"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) made comments that many took to mean that he would vote against a subpoena in the investigation into Joe Biden's Ukrainian scandal.

""There's no question but that the appearance of looking into Burisma and Hunter Biden appears political,"" Romney said to reporters on Thursday.

""And I think people are tired of these kind of political investigations,"" he added, ""and would hope that if there's something of significance that needs to be evaluated, that it would be done by perhaps the FBI or some other agency that's not as political as perhaps a committee of our, of our body.""

Romney's skepticism presents a problem for the investigation, since he could be the deciding vote on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) issued the request for the subpoena on Monday for testimony from a witness about Hunter Biden's time on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

While Romney did not explicitly say how he would vote on the committee on the subpoena, if he voted against issuing it, the subpoena would not be approved.

Romney was also the lone Republican to vote in favor of convicting the president on the Democrats' articles of impeachment, which drew the ire of many Republicans and other supporters of the president.

Mitt Romney says Bolton book revelation makes it 'increasingly likely' GOP senators will vote to call witnesses,"Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said Monday that former national security adviser John Bolton's book excerpt, tying Ukraine military aid with investigations, makes it ""increasingly likely"" that Republican senators will vote in favor of calling witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, according to NBC News.

The New York Times reported on an excerpt from the unpublished book manuscript in which Bolton writes that Trump told him he wanted to withhold nearly $400 million in military security aid from Ukraine until Ukraine agreed to assist with an investigation into the Bidens — the very ""quid pro quo"" on which Democrats have built their impeachment case. From NBC News:

""I think, with the story that came out yesterday, it's increasingly apparent that it would be important to hear from John Bolton,"" Romney told reporters in brief comments. He said he hasn't fully made up his mind on calling witnesses, but what Bolton has to say is ""relevant"" and ""therefore I'd like to hear it.""

""I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton,"" Romney said. ""I've spoken with others who've opined upon this as well.""

Three other Republican senators are considered most likely to vote in favor of calling witnesses during the trial. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) issued a statement Monday morning saying she is likely to vote for witnesses.

""I've always said that I was likely to vote to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial,"" Collins said. ""The reports about John Bolton's book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.""

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said he will wait until after arguments are made and questions are asked to weigh in on whether witnesses should be called. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), took a similar stance.





For witnesses to be called, at least four Republicans would have to join all 47 Democrats when the vote is taken on the issue later in the trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/romney-says-bolton-book-revelation-makes-it-increasingly-likely-gop-senators-will-vote-to-call-witnesses,2020-01-27
Ron DeSantis signs curriculum transparency and school board term limit bill into law,"On Friday, Republican Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law establishing term limits for members of Florida’s school boards and giving Florida residents increased access to educational materials available to students.

Prior to signing HB-1467 into law, echoing his longstanding commitment to the rights of parents, DeSantis said, “We believe parents not only have a role, they have the fundamental role to be involved in the education of their kids, and that’s how it’s going to be in the state of Florida,” WFTV-ABC in Orlando reported.

A press release from the governor’s office indicates that the new law places 12-year consecutive term limits for members of school boards in the sunshine state and “requires school districts to be transparent in the selection of instructional materials, including library and reading materials.”

The press release stated that “As a part of the Year of the Parent, this legislation aims to preserve the rights of parents to make decisions about what materials their children are exposed to in school.”

DeSantis said, “In Florida, our parents have every right to be involved in their child’s education. We are not going to let politicians deny parents the right to know what is being taught in our schools. I’m proud to sign this legislation that ensures curriculum transparency.”

Wilton Simpson, the President of the Florida Senate, said, “While teachers, school administrators, and school board members have a tremendous amount of authority over what and how our kids are taught in school, at the end of the day, parents — not schools — are responsible for raising children.”

He continued, “Florida parents are seeking greater involvement in many aspects of our education system, and this legislation speaks to that effort. The books our kids are reading in schools need to have proper vetting. Parents have a right, and a responsibility, to be involved in that process. Not all books are appropriate for every grade level. This legislation makes sure that we have a transparent and consistent process for public participation in the review of books and other materials used in school lessons and in the school library.”

“Governor DeSantis has shown time and time again that he is not afraid to fight for the rights of parents and understands the importance that they have a seat at the table when it comes to their child’s education,” the Florida Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran said. “I’m grateful for the Governor’s guidance and the voices of many parents, who have come forward and demands that parents be seen as a partner in their child’s education.”

This new law requires school districts in Florida to hold public meetings for the purpose of selecting instructional materials and provide the public with ample notice of when and where the meetings will be held.

It also stipulates that the school districts must provide access to all materials no-less than 20 days before the school board takes official action on proposed instructional material.

The state Department of Education is also compelled by law to publish a list of materials that have been removed or discontinued by the school board and disseminate the list to school districts within the state.

'Baghdad Bob': WH chief of staff served humble pie after trying to spin poll called 'devastating indictment' of Biden,"White House chief of staff Ron Klain desperately tried on Sunday to positively spin a new poll that was described as a ""damning indictment"" President Joe Biden's presidency.

But his attempt completely fell flat.

What does the poll show?

The CBS News/YouGov poll shows that Biden's approval is under water 12 points; just 44% of respondents said they approve of his job as president, while 56% of respondents said they disapprove.

But it gets worse: Nearly three-fourths of respondents (74%) said things in America are going badly, 69% said the economy is bad, and an overwhelming majority of respondents expressed pessimism over the direction of the economy over the next several months. A majority of respondents (65%) also said Biden is ""slow to react"" to important issues.

What did Klain say?



The White House chief of staff turned the spin cycle on high and claimed the poll is actually good for Biden.

""I hate to spoil the narrative but this poll shows @potus approval rating moving up, and solid public confidence on the two biggest problems he inherited: COVID and jobs,"" Klain said.

I hate to spoil the narrative but this poll shows @potus approval rating moving up, and solid public confidence on the two biggest problems he inherited: COVID and jobs. https://t.co/OPrkWPZxYO

— Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) May 22, 2022





How exactly Klain defines ""solid public confidence"" is unclear. However, the poll makes clear that only a slight majority of respondents (53% to 47%) gave Biden positive marks on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, the poll found that only a narrow majority (52% to 48%) are optimistic about the trajectory of their local job market over the next several months. This difference, however, falls within the poll's +/- 2.5% margin of error.

What was the reaction?

Rudy Giuliani has been meeting with former Ukrainian officials in Europe to combat impeachment narrative,"Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer and a central figure in the impeachment inquiry, has been meeting with former Ukrainian officials in Europe as part of an effort to refute Democrats' impeachment narrative, according to the New York Times.

The former New York City mayor, who played a significant role in representing the United States to Ukrainian officials and pushing for investigations into Burisma, Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden, is working on a documentary presenting the alternative side of the impeachment saga.

Giuliani has met with former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, and as of Wednesday was in Kyiv seeking to meet with Viktor Shokin, and Kostiantyn Kulyk, all of who have some connection to impeachment and Ukrainian corruption.

Shokin was Ukraine's prosecutor general from February 2015 until March 2016. His firing was the result of consensus from the international community that he was corrupt, and pressure from then-Vice President Joe Biden. It has been alleged by Giuliani and others that Biden pushed for Shokin's firing to protect Burisma and Hunter Biden from investigation.

Lutsenko was prosecutor general from May 2016 until August 2019. He was referenced by President Trump as a ""very good prosecutor"" by President Trump during his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelensky, and was allegedly involved in the effort to have former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch recalled.

Giuliani is featured in a documentary series on One America News network. From the Times:

The series, the first two installments of which have already aired, is being promoted as a Republican alternative to the impeachment hearings, including Ukrainian ""witnesses"" whom House Democrats running the inquiry declined to call. Some of the Ukrainians interviewed by Mr. Giuliani were sworn in on camera to ""testify under oath"" in a manner that the network claims ""debunks the impeachment hoax.""

The House Judiciary Committee is considering whether to draft articles of impeachment charging Trump with abusing the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into publicly announcing investigations into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and their business dealings in Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rudy-giuliani-has-been-meeting-with-former-ukrainian-officials-in-europe-to-combat-impeachment-narrative,2019-12-04
"Rudy Giuliani is now under investigation over Ukraine dealings, report says","Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney for President Donald Trump, is now reportedly under investigation.

Manhattan federal prosecutors have launched an investigation to determine if Giuliani ""broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine,"" the New York Times reported. The probe includes an examination of Giuliani's alleged efforts to ""undermine"" Marie Yovanovitch, a top American ambassador who was recalled from Ukraine in May.

The investigation is related to the arrest of two Soviet-born businessmen, who were detained this week at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.

More from the New York Post:

The businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are accused of helping Giuliani dig for dirt on Joe Biden, and were arrested by the feds in New York on charges they funneled foreign cash to Republican politicians to advance their interests and those of a Ukrainian official who wanted then-US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch fired.



He told Fox News Friday that Parnas and Fruman ""logistically helped"" him collect evidence against Hunter Biden and connected him with two former Ukrainian prosecutors — but called the timing of their arrest ""suspect"" and said he would ""reveal relevant facts very, very shortly.""

According to the Times, it is not clear how far the investigation has progressed. There is also no current indication that prosecutors will file charges.

Giuliani denies wrongdoing.

On Friday, President Donald Trump seemingly distanced himself from Giuliani, the former New York City mayor.

When asked about the status of their relationship and whether Giuliani was still his attorney, the president said, ""Well, I don't know. I haven't spoken to Rudy.""

However, Giuliani told reporters that he is still the president's lawyer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rudy-giuliani-is-now-under-criminal-investigation-over-ukraine-dealings-report-says,2019-10-12
"Rudy Giuliani says Ukrainian officials' testimony would demolish impeachment narrative, implicate Bidens","President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said Monday that there is clear evidence that Joe and Hunter Biden were involved in bribery and money laundering in Ukraine and that there is documented evidence to prove it.

Giuliani posted a series of tweets laying out the accusations, accompanied by clips from One America News. Giuliani is working on a documentary series on Ukraine for the network.

According to Giuliani, the Democrats' impeachment effort is, in part, intended to obscure collusion between Democrats and Ukrainian officials to influence the 2016 election, as well as corrupt dealings by the Bidens during the Obama administration.

""After hundreds of hours & months of research, I have garnered witnesses & documents which reveal the truth behind this impeachment, which includes NO wrongdoing by @realDonaldTrump,"" Giuliani wrote.

Accompanying the tweet was a video clip in which he says Ukrainian officials who want to testify on the matter are being blocked from entering the U.S. by the State Department.

Giuliani's claims simultaneously serve as a defense of President Trump, who is facing impeachment for allegedly leveraging military aid to Ukraine to pressure President Volodomyr Zelensky into investigating 2016 election interference and the Bidens.

""Evidence revealed that corruption in 2016 was so extensive it was POTUS's DUTY to ask for US-Ukraine investigation,"" Giuliani tweeted. ""Impeachment is part of Dem cover-up. Extortion, bribery & money laundering goes beyond Biden's. Also, DNC collusion w/ Ukraine to destroy candidate Trump.""

One of President Trump's primary defenses against the impeachment accusations has been that there was legitimate corruption in Ukraine worthy of investigation before sending the country hundreds of millions of dollars in aid.

Giuliani also attempts to focus attention on the firing of former Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Trump asked Zelensky to investigate whether Joe Biden pushed for Shokin's firing to protect Hunter, and that request is central to impeachment. But, Giuliani argues, it was Biden who actually committed bribery in his dealing with Shokin, and that Shokin's testimony could break the case open.

""Witness Viktor Shokin: Holds docs proving money laundering by Burisma & Biden's,"" Giuliani wrote. ""Fired due to VP Biden's threat not to release $1B in vital US aid. Shokin's med records show he was poisoned, died twice, and was revived. Lots of heads will roll in Ukraine if this opens up.""

"Rudy Giuliani's son launches bid for NY governor, comes out swinging against Cuomo","Republican Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R), announced Tuesday that he is officially running to become the next governor of New York state — and he came out swinging against the incumbent, embattled Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

What are the details?

Giuliani, 35, told the New York Post, ""Giuliani vs. Cuomo. Holy smokes. Its Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier,"" referring to the 1971 bout for the heavyweight title. ""We can sell tickets at Madison Square Garden. It would be one of the epic showdowns in the state's history.""

He says, ""I know we can defeat Andrew Cuomo in 2022. I am going to be the 57th governor of New York.""

""It was Andrew Cuomo's actions that killed 9,000 senior citizens in nursing homes in New York,"" Giuliani said, referring to Democrat's order early in the pandemic to force nursing homes to accept COVID-19 positive patients, which Giuliani called ""the worst.""

""He should have resigned,"" Giuliani said of the governor. ""Cuomo didn't use the USS Comfort ship or the Javits Center to house seniors with COVID. He didn't want to give President Trump a political victory.""

Giuliani says he will run on a platform focusing on supporting businesses, law enforcement and school choice.

He previously worked as associate director of the U.S. Office of Public Liaison for four years during former President Donald Trump's administration. While he has never been elected to an office, he told the Post, ""I'm a politician out of the womb. It's in my DNA.""

Anything else?



Giuliani still has to make it through the GOP primary, but his announcement comes as both his Democratic opponent and his father are facing legal battles.

New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is currently conducting an investigation into several sexual harassment allegation against Cuomo, along with a second probe into whether the governor used state resources to complete and promote his memoir on COVID-19 leadership.

Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani's Manhattan apartment was raided by the FBI last month reportedly as part of ""a criminal investigation into Mr. Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine,"" according to The New York Times.

On the day of the raid, Andrew held a press conference defending his father and blasting the DOJ.

""This is disgusting,"" Andrew told reporters. ""This is absolutely absurd, and it's the continued politicization of the Justice Department.""

""If this can happen to the former president's lawyer, this can happen to any American,"" he continued. ""Enough is enough.""

He added, ""To all Americans out there, our Justice Department should be independent of politics. Enough is enough, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot stand for this anymore.""

Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk defend Russell Brand,"In the past week, two of Britain's most influential newspapers have launched attacks on comedian and YouTube personality Russell Brand. The condemnations caught the attention of billionaire Elon Musk and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson – who both defended Brand from the critical articles.

The Independent published an article this week titled: ""How did Russell Brand go from stand-up stardom to peddling YouTube conspiracy theories?""

The piece labeled Brand as ""Joe Rogan's British counterpart."" The article recalled how Brand was once married to Katy Perry and starred in the ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" movie.

""I know! I'm disappointed too. But such is the age we live in: One minute, a comedian is going about his life, building his career, and the next, he's peddling conspiracy theories on YouTube and quoting Glenn Greenwald's newsletter at length,"" wrote Louis Chilton, who covers video games and culture for the outlet. ""No, I don’t like it. Yes, I'm exhausted.""

Chilton claimed that Brand ""has leaned hard into a brand of pseudo-skepticism we've come to expect from the Joe Rogans of the world.""

The article dismissed Brand – who has more than 5.2 million subscribers on YouTube (The Independent has 338,000 subscribers) as a ""Twitter reply guy.""

The writer asserted that Brand's videos ""use the language of conspiracies"" and utilize his platform to ""share shaky conspiracy theories.""

""In Brand's world, there should be room for 'alternative opinions' such as Rogan's. Maybe the 'mainstream media' are just jealous that Rogan is so successful, Brand suggested,"" the article noted, and then admitted, ""Maybe we're jealous because Rogan's viewers trust him.""

The Telegraph published a piece titled: ""How Russell Brand became the ‘Mad Hatter of conspiracy theories.""

""In the age of online conspiracies, which have flourished since the onset of COVID, Brand's alarmist video headlines have found support among the frustrated and locked-down,"" the article purported. ""Now, with global restrictions lifting, Ukraine has become the natural next area for scrutiny.""

Both articles don't specify what conspiracy theories Brand has disseminated.

After reading The Independent article, Tesla CEO Elon Musk did his own research into whether or not Brand was peddling conspiracy theories by actually watching his videos and deciding for himself.

""With so many mainstream media companies saying @rustyrockets [Russell Brand] is crazy/dangerous, I watched some of his videos,"" Musk wrote on Twitter in a reply to The Independent. ""Ironically, he seemed more balanced & insightful than those condemning him! The groupthink among major media companies is more troubling. There should be more dissent.""

Jordan Peterson also defended Brand by saying, ""An appalling union of large corporations, media agencies and government. What did Mussolini call that again?""

Peterson is likely referencing this quote: ""Fascism should more properly be called corporatism, since it is the merger of state and corporate power."" This quote is commonly attributed to Benito Mussolini, but there doesn't seem to be any proof that the Italian fascist leader ever said it.

Brand released a video addressing the attacks on him by big media on his YouTube channel which has more than 630,000,000 views.

""We don’t claim to be a news channel. We're not sending out journalists going, 'Oh my god what’s happening over there?' We're looking at news and analyzing news. That's what we’re doing, just to be clear. We're not claiming to be a news channel.""

""So the idea of misinformation — this is opinion,"" Brand stated. ""This is obviously my opinion. We check our sources. We never say anything that can't be backed up.""

Brand disputed the accusation of being an ""anti-vaxxer,"" pointing out that he has not told anyone not to get vaccinated, but is empathetic to those who are vaccine-hesitant, especially from minority groups that have less trust of the government. He also stressed that the unvaccinated should not be treated as social pariahs.

Brand also questioned the ownership of The Independent. The British newspaper is owned by Evgeny Lebedev – son of KGB officer-turned-Russian oligarch. The paper is also owned by Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel – an investor ""associated with NCB Capital, the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank,"" according to the Financial Times.

Brand shared a 2019 article from the Guardian:

The Evening Standard and the Independent have been explicitly accused by the British government of being part-owned by the Saudi Arabian state, with a series of “unconventional, complex and clandestine” deals used to hide the sale of stakes in the London-based news outlets to a Saudi government bank.



The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, last month announced an investigation into the sales, warning that the ultimate investor may have ""strong links to the Saudi Arabian state"" and raising fears that a foreign government may have gained influence over the news direction of two major British publications.



Brand declared, ""The mainstream media is not your friend. The culture is not your friend. Government is not your friend. Big business is not your friend.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russell-brand-elon-musk-jordan-peterson,2022-03-20
"'Manipulation of elections': Liberal actor rips media, Big Tech for conspiring with Democrats to kill Hunter Biden story 'because they didn't want it to influence the election'","World famous liberal actor and comedian Russell Brand is calling out Big Tech, the mainstream media, and the Democratic Party for conspiring to kill the Hunter Biden laptop scandal in order to manipulate the presidential election and get President Donald Trump out of office.

What happened?

Just weeks before the 2020 election, the New York Post dropped its Hunter Biden laptop scandal bombshell revealing communications between then-presidential candidate Joe Biden's son and foreign business interests, including Ukrainian gas company Burisma and China's biggest private energy company.

The damning report also raised serious questions about Joe Biden's ties to his son's ventures — but only for readers of non-left-wing media outlets.

The Post's story didn't sit well with the Democratic Party, the mainstream media, and Big Tech — so they did what they could to suppress the story.

Left-wing outlets ignored it or tried to explain it away.

Facebook limited distribution of the report pending a so-called ""fact-checker review.""

Most famously, Twitter completely censored the story and locked the New York Post out of its own account.

What is Brand saying?

Now, Brand, a famously left-wing celebrity with a massive platform, is ripping into Big Tech and the media for working with Democrats to kill a story that voters should have been aware of.

Image source: YouTube/Russell Brand video screenshot

In a recent episode of his podcast, ""Under the Skin,"" Brand interviewed investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald about the Post's Hunter Biden story as well as Greenwald's own reporting on Joe Biden's connections to Chinese business interests, which led to Greenwald being fired by the media company he founded.



Greenwald noted that there was a trove of documents that allowed journalists to investigate not just Hunter Biden's activities, but also Joe Biden's connections. But most journalists were not interested.

If you don't want to dig into that kind of material as a journalist, Greenwald said, ""go do anything else.""

""There were a lot documents that raised serious questions about whether Joe Biden, the person at the time running for president and likely to become the most powerful politician on earth, was intervening in Ukraine for the benefit of the company that was paying his son $50,000 a month for absolutely no reason other than to have influence with Joe Biden,"" Greenwald said.

He went on to remind Brand that ""information monopolies"" Twitter and Facebook ""banned"" and ""censored"" the story, ""like you were in China.""

""This is like three weeks before the election,"" Greenwald added. ""Silicon Valley monopolies that were supporting one of the candidates were censoring authentic reporting about the candidate they were supporting.""

In a followup video about the Greenwald interview, Brand raised a number of questions and concerns.

""Look I'm not a pro-Republican person,"" he began. ""I don't see myself that way. I don't see myself as conservative ... or the kind of media establishments that were reporting on these [Biden] revelations. They are not my culture, social, or political allies.""

However, Brand added, it seems worth asking, ""What reason is Hunter Biden sat on the board of an energy company in Ukraine? What reason is James Biden sat on the board, or receiving payments from an energy company, in China?""

""For me, revelations that there are financial connections between energy companies in Ukraine, energy companies in China, and the Biden family are troubling,"" he continued. ""That should be public knowledge.""

Yet, those questions were censored by the media and Big Tech.

""It's even more troubling that Twitter and Facebook and the media at large deliberately kept it out of the news because they didn't want it to influence the election,"" Brand said.

""What is democracy, then?"" he asked. ""It suggests to me that democracy is, 'We want you to vote for this person. We don't want you to vote for that person.'""

Then Brand called out the fact that the national media, Twitter, Facebook, and other members of Big Tech ""conspired"" to kill the Hunter Biden story, which he called the ""manipulation of elections.""

""I'm sad to realize that I can no longer even claim to believe Joe Biden or the Democratic Party might be the answer, because look at how they behave,"" he said. ""And look at the relationships between media, social media, and that party. They conspired to keep information away from you because it was not convenient to their agenda. How does that make you feel?

""The fact is that this information was stymied, stifled, controlled because it didn't suit the shared agenda of these three pillars of power,"" Brand continued. ""That almost concerns me more than the nature of the revelations themselves.

""The idea that information is being controlled — that's not democracy, that's not freedom, that's manipulation of elections,"" he said. ""If it were the other side doing that, the companies that are here implicated would be ecstatically propagating and proliferating that data.""

Brand lamented that the U.S. is going to resemble the former Soviet Union when it comes to information suppression, saying ""our depiction of places like communist Russia, the Soviet Union, as these draconian, malevolent places where you're not free ... it is also true here. The same thing is happening.""

Russia and China agreed to a 'no limits' relationship at the Beijing Olympics,"The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing are off to a strong start for America’s enemies.

During the first day of the Winter Olympics, China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership. Chinese and Russian leadership agreed to support each other in their respective efforts to expand their borders to include the currently independent nations of Taiwan and Ukraine.

According to Reuters, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the two came to the consensus that their new relationship was “superior to any Cold War-era alliance” and that the two nations “would work together on space, climate change, artificial intelligence and control of the internet.”

Reuters reports that Xi Jinping supported Russia’s demands to exclude Ukraine from NATO and Vladimir Putin agreed to oppose any form of national independence for Taiwan. Both China and Russia have become increasingly aggressive as they seemingly prepare to invade sovereign nations they believe are theirs to reclaim.

Daniel Kritenbrink, the State Department’s leading East Asia diplomat, said, “If Russia further invades Ukraine and China looks the other way, it suggests that China is willing to tolerate or tacitly support Russia’s efforts to coerce Ukraine.”

President Putin endorsed China’s stance that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China.”

Whereas Russia continues to insist that it is not planning an invasion of Ukraine, Xi Jinping has made clear that it is a matter of “when” and not “if” China makes a move on Taiwan.

Xi Jinping condemned the membership of NATO and how its member states continually inflate their influence while excluding Russia. The Chinese President also supported Russia’s demands for security guarantees from its rivals in Western Europe.

In a joint statement, Russia and China said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” This new agreement pushes the two country’s friendship to new levels.

During the Xi-Putin meeting, China agreed to a natural gas deal with Russia estimated to be valued around $118 billion and Putin promised to increase exports to China.

This agreement marks the most detailed and aggressive statement of Russia and China’s efforts to recalibrate the global pecking order by unseating the United States as the hegemon.

"Nearly 2,000 arrested at anti-war protests across Russia; prominent Russians rail against Ukraine invasion, including daughter of Putin's spokesperson","Thousands of Russians have poured into streets across the country to participate in anti-war protests. Even prominent Russians have demonstrated their frustration with Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine, and some have purportedly faced retaliation from the Kremlin.

Massive anti-war protests across Russia

Russian authorities arrested at least 1,866 people in 60 cities who had been participating in anti-war protests since Thursday, according to OVD Info – a Russia-based human rights organization that monitors political persecutions.

There were huge protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg condemning Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

Prominent Russians rail against invasion of Ukraine

There were also prominent Russians dissenting against their president's decision to invade Ukraine.

Ivan Urgant – a popular talk show host on state-run Channel One, posted a black square on Instagram with the caption: ""Fear and pain. No to war.""

The Guardian reported, ""His show has not gone on air since. Channel One has claimed it is just a scheduling issue, although several reports in Russian media say that they have been blacklisted.""

A Channel One spokesperson told the Associated Press that the decision to remove Urgant's show from the schedule was not related to his anti-war post on social media. The television network said they had made a programming decision to replace entertainment shows with news and political shows ""because of the current situation.""

Rapper Oxxxymiron canceled six sold-out Moscow and St. Petersburg shows because of Russia's aggression.

""I cannot entertain you when Russian missiles are falling on Ukraine,"" Oxxxymiron, whose real name is Miron Fyodorov, said. ""When residents of Kyiv are forced to hide in basements and in the metro, while people are dying.""



""I know that most people in Russia are against this war, and I am confident that the more people would talk about their real attitude to it, the faster we can stop this horror,"" Fyodorov said, according to the New York Times. ""This is a crime and a catastrophe.""

Yuri Shevchuk, frontman of the Soviet-era rock band DDT, blasted Putin's decision by saying, ""We're being pulled like through an ice hole into the past, into the 19th, 18th, 17th centuries. And people refuse to accept it.""

Elena Chernenko, a veteran journalist for the Moscow-based Kommersant newspaper, published an open letter voicing her opposition to the war in Ukraine. More than 280 other journalists signed her letter, including some who are employed at state-run news agencies.

Despite not criticizing the government directly, Chernenko was expelled from the Foreign Ministry pool, which she had covered for more than 11 years. The Kremlin said she was removed from the pool for ""unprofessional"" behavior.

Chernenko told the Guardian that there was ""nothing complicated"" about writing the letter.

""It was a spontaneous reaction,"" Chernenko explained. ""My country has started a military operation against another … but we’re for diplomacy, we’re for the UN charter, moral values, brotherly nations, and all that. And I had the feeling that this is the wrong path.""



Daughters of influential Russians oppose Vladimir Putin's aggression

The daughter of billionaire and Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich posted an anti-Putin message on social media. The daughter of Abramovich, who has a net worth of $13.5 billion and owns the world's second-largest yacht, shared a post on Instagram that stated: ""The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin.""



Even the daughter of Putin's own spokesperson called for an end to the war with Ukraine. Yelizaveta Peskova, the 24-year-old daughter of Dmitry Peskov, posted an anti-war message on social media.

Newsweek reported, ""The 24-year-old posted 'HET BOЙHE' (or 'no to war' in English) to her Telegram account."" The post was later deleted.

Coincidentally, Dmitry Peskov attempted to pacify protesters by claiming that Putin ""hears everyone's opinion."" The spokesperson added that Putin also knows ""the share of those who have a different point of view and those who are sympathetic to such a necessary operation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-antiwar-protests-ukraine-invasion,2022-02-25
"Video: Russia attacks airports, hospitals, apartment buildings in Ukraine, is reportedly 'making a move on Kyiv' to overthrow government","The Russian military has attacked airports and damaged hospitals and apartment buildings amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to videos shared online and reports from multiple outlets on Thursday.

What are the details?

Despite claiming that the Russian military would target only military installations in a so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, it quickly became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in the neighboring country matched an all-out war, in which widespread civilian casualties are possible.

Footage obtained by the New York Times appeared to show a mass of airstrikes hitting an airport in Hostomel, just outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Subsequent reporting from CNN indicated that Russian forces had seized control of the facility, though Ukraine's military had apparently launched a counteroffensive.

More video of that attack was also posted online.

A hospital in southeastern Ukraine was also struck by ballistic missile fire Thursday in an apparently targeted attack. Amnesty International reportedly verified the attack and claimed it killed at least two civilians. The group noted that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law.

Ukraine's health minister, Viktor Lyashko, claimed that more hospitals are now being targeted by Russian forces.

Additionally, Russian rocket fire destroyed an apartment building near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The New York Times posted footage of firefighters and other first responders putting out flames and clearing debris from what remained of the building.

Video uploaded by the Daily Wire appeared to show a missile striking a building directly adjacent to a home with a woman and her children inside.

BuzzFeed News documented the extent of the devastation by posting a series of pictures online.

What else?



In all, the Russian military claimed Thursday it has overtaken 74 military installations, including 11 airfields. Ukraine has reported that at least 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians have been killed so far.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is focused on three main axes of assault: a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and a northeast-to-south approach near Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently happening.

The defense official, offering the information as part of an operational update, said Russia clearly intends is to overtake key population centers and is ""making a move on Kyiv,"" NBC News reported.

Russia has ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance,"" the defense official said.

They added that Russia's maneuvering so far is not surprising and ""is very much in line with what was expected."" U.S. intelligence predicted days ago that a full-scale invasion was imminent.

The defense official noted that this onslaught is only the first phase of the invasion and that many more may soon follow.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-attacks-ukrainian-hospitals-airports-apartment-buildings,2022-02-24
Russia bans comedian Jim Carrey and 99 other Canadians over their opposition to the invasion of Ukraine,"The Russian Federation banned comedian Jim Carrey and 99 other Canadians over their opposition to President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Also included in the ban was author Margaret Atwood, the creator of ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" and other prominent Canadian politicians, business people, and celebrities.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that the Canadian government would send another $500 million in military aid to Ukraine while adding 23 Russians to Canada's sanctions list.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the 100 Canadians of being ""directly involved in the formation of an aggressive anti-Russian course"" in its statement about the ban.

""In response to the ongoing practice of imposing sanctions by the regime of Prime Minister J. Trudeau against the Russian leadership, politicians and parliamentarians, representatives of the business community, experts and journalists, cultural figures, as well as anyone whom the Canadian Russophobic authorities consider objectionable,"" the statement read, ""entry is closed on the basis of reciprocity for 100 Canadian citizens.""

In April, Carrey posted an endorsement of a documentary about Alexei Navalny, a political opposition figure in Russia.

""Navalny himself exposes Czar Putin and his soulless minions in their fiendish conspiracy to poison him, suppress the truth and intimidate the Russian people,"" he tweeted.

Atwood was among more than 1,000 writers who signed an open letter in February condemning the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's invasion is in its eighth month and has suffered a major setback as Ukrainians have been able to push Russian soldiers out of the key city of Kherson. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy made a surprise visit to the city and condemned Russia for what he said was evidence of over 400 war crimes.

U.S. officials have reportedly pressed Zelenskyy to negotiate peace terms with Russia, but his list of demands is unlikely to be agreed upon by Putin, who has repeatedly claimed Ukraine belongs to Russia.

China provides rhetorical cover for Russia and their 'new model of international relations',"In recent days, China has amped up its rhetorical support for Russia in a direct slight to the U.S. and other nations who had hoped that Beijing would opt to condemn Moscow for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, “An important takeaway from the success of China-Russia relations is that the two sides rise above the model of military and political alliance in the Cold War era.”

Zhao suggested that China and Russia are able to collaborate so effectively because the countries and their leadership “commit themselves to developing a new model of international relations.”

Bloomberg reported that Zhao made this statement during a briefing Friday in Beijing.

Zhao emphasized that the “model” relationship between China and Russia is predicated on the two countries’ hesitance to cause confrontation between other nations and respecting the sovereignty of other states.

He added that this relationship broke with the “Cold War mentality” displayed by countries allied with the U.S. through geographic blocs like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

President Joe Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping in March that there would be “implications and consequences” if the Chinese government provided any form of material support to their Russian counterparts over the invasion of Ukraine.

To date there has been no indication that China has supported the Russian invasion or helped the country skirt the Western sanctions that torpedoed its economy, but the Chinese government has provided “rhetorical support” for Russia by repeating its propaganda.

The Chinese government also repeatedly states that it will stand by the “no limits” relationship agreement that Presidents Putin and Xi agreed to at a private meeting between the two heads-of-staet before the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

During this meeting, Xi and Putin agreed to support each other in their respective efforts to expand their borders to include the independent nations of Taiwan and Ukraine, respectively.

The very existence and basis of this dynamic calls into question the validity of claims recently made by Zhao that Russia and China avoid confrontation with other nations on the international stage.

The reality is that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Chinese government’s blatant hostility towards Taiwan indicate that both nations are, in fact, dedicated to the military conquest of sovereign nations while meddling in their affairs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-china-new-model,2022-04-30
Russia and China will hold talks about a future joint venture regarding the construction of lunar base,"Russia and China plan to engage in a “detailed dialogue” about how to move forward with the construction of a base on the moon.

The Washington Examiner reported that Dmitry Rogozin, the chief executive of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said, “Before the end of May, I plan to hold detailed dialogue with our Chinese colleagues on our cooperation in this direction.”

The expansion of Russia and China’s collaborative efforts in space indicate the strengthening of the two countries’ relationship as they continue to find themselves at odds with the U.S. and its Western allies.

In recent months, since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Western relations in space have deteriorated. In February, in response to Western sanctions on the Russian economy, the Russian government threatened to crash the International Space Station into the Earth by ceasing to provide the satellite with the propulsion technology and resources necessary to keep it in orbit. The saga concluded with the Russian government withdrawing its support from the International Space Station program so long as Western sanctions remained in place.

For years, even during the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, Russian cosmonauts and American astronauts worked side-by-side on the International Space Station, but the International Space Station serving as a symbol of geopolitical peace between a post-soviet Russia and the West may very well be at an end.

Despite this, Russia cosmonauts are currently still aboard the International Space Station and will continue conducting experiments on a timeline established by the Russian government.

Speaking with TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, Rogozin said, “We should not hustle now declaring our stance and will carry on with our work within the timeframe set by the government, which is until 2024. A decision regarding the [International Space Station’s] future will depend to a great extent on the developing situation both in Russia and around it.”

A crew of European and American astronauts arrived at the International Space Station earlier this week as Russia cosmonauts conducted a spacewalk lasting 7 hours and 42 minutes. The Russia cosmonauts used the spacewalk as an opportunity to display the Soviet era “Victory Banner” that first flew in Berlin at the end of World War Two.

Dmitry Strugovets, a Roscosmos spokesman, said, “Cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev voiced an idea several days ago to spread the Victory Banner in the open space and wrote about it to the Roscosmos press office. His initiative was supported at all levels. No one remained indifferent.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-china-space-station,2022-04-30
Russia debuts new hypersonic missiles in strike on Ukrainian munitions depot,"The war in Ukraine might be about to take a dark turn as Russian forces deploy the use of hypersonic missiles. This marks the first time Russian forces have used hypersonic missiles in combat.

The Kinzhal hypersonic missiles were used by Russian forces to destroy an underground ammunition storage facility in Delyatyn, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.

The Daily Star reported that information on the attack remains scant but that Russia has long boasted about its hypersonic weapons arsenal which contains missiles that can evade traditional anti-missile defense systems.

These missiles include the 3M22 Zircon missile which is a low-flying rocket that is able to speed past early detection technologies. It, and other similar weapons in the Russian arsenal, have a range of around 1,000 kilometers.

The state-owned Russian television network, TV Zvezda, said that “The Russian Zircon hypersonic missile’s stealth features have been disclosed” indicating that this missile was, in fact, utilized against the Ukrainians.

“The speed of the Zircon hypersonic missile is so high that it prevents the opponent’s air defense system from detecting its impact in time,” the state-owned network boasted.

It continued by suggesting that “[the missile’s] launch will be known only after the target has been hit” and that the missile has “variable trajectory” making it difficult for even advanced defense systems to detect it.

Igor Krokhmal, the launching frigate’s commander, said, “No one will see the missile launch or its flight. They will only see when the missile hits the target.”

The U.S. Sun reported that Krokkhmal said there won’t be anything that can counter the Zircon missile for years to come.

He said, “A surface target, a coastal target. I don’t think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years.”

In December, when the missile was being tested, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “Zircon are our newest missiles fired from the sea at sea targets, and land targets.”

He added, “The [missile] tests were carried out successfully, flawlessly” and said that “this is a big event for our country, a significant step in improving Russia’s security, in increasing [our] defensive capability.”

Similarly, last-October, the Chinese government launched a nuclear capable hypersonic missile into space that was able to circle the globe without being detected.

The Long March rocket, operated by the China National Space Administration, purportedly caught American intelligence agencies by surprise.

“We have no idea how they did this,” an anonymous U.S. official told the Financial Times.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-debuts-new-hypersonic-missiles-in-strike-on-ukrainian-munitions-depot,2022-03-19
Russian authorities detain Brittney Griner — one of America's most decorated female basketball players: Report,"Brittney Griner, WNBA star and former gold medal-winning Olympian, has reportedly been detained in Russia.

What are the details?

According to a Saturday report from The New York Times, Russian Federal Customs Service reportedly detained Griner in late February ""after finding vape cartridges that contained hashish oil"" inside her luggage at an airport near Moscow.

A statement from the customs service, obtained by CNN, read, ""'As a U.S. citizen was passing through the green channel at Sheremetyevo Airport upon arriving from New York, a working dog from the Sheremetyevo Customs canine department detected the possible presence of narcotic substances in the accompanying luggage.'""

""The customs inspection of the hand luggage being carried by the US citizen confirmed the presence of vapes with specifically smelling liquid, and an expert determined that the liquid was cannabis oil (hash oil), which is a narcotic substance,'"" the statement added.

Griner is still reportedly detained at the time of this reporting.

What else is there to know about this?

Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, did not dispute the reports of Griner's purported detention.

“We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA,” she told the Times for the Saturday report. ""As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern.""

It is not known at the time of this reporting why Griner was in the war-torn region.

On Saturday, the U.S. State Department released an updated advisory urging U.S. citizens to leave Russia immediately due to the ongoing escalation of war in neighboring Ukraine, and cited a ""potential for harassment against U.S. citizens by Russian government security officials.""

Former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Michael A. McFaul, told the outlet that the news should come as a concern to all Americans in the country.

“I obviously don’t know the circumstances of her detention, but Griner’s arrest should serve as a wake-up call to all Americans in Russia,” McFaul said. “Get out. Shut down your businesses now.”

The WNBA in a statement added that Griner “has the W.N.B.A.’s full support and our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-detains-brittney-griner-one-of-the-u-s-s-most-decorated-female-basketball-players,2022-03-06
Russian embassy in Ireland gets roasted over its outraged statement about a 'violation' of its territory,"The Russian embassy in Ireland faced mockery and ridicule on social media after it released a statement of outage against a ""violation"" of its territory.

The embassy released a statement from its official social media account Monday decrying an incident where a man drove a truck into the embassy gates.

""On March 7, 2022, 13:30pm, a large truck came over to the gates of the Embassy, pulled back and torn down the gates of the Embassy,"" the statement read in part.

""The Embassy strongly condemns this criminal act of insanity directed against peaceful diplomatic mission,"" the statement continued.

""The incident is cause of extreme concern. We believe that no people of sound mind could support such senseless and barbaric actions,"" the statement concluded.

Here's the statement from the embassy:

Many took to social media to excoriate the embassy for its outrage over such a small matter when Russia was accused of purposely shelling innocent civilians in Ukraine.

""It's not nice to have your home invaded and vandalised for no reason, is it?"" replied photographer Nicolas Chinardet.

""My Irish sources have informed me that the Russian Embassy gates attacked the lorry and it was forced to take special operations to save itself,"" joked another critic.

""You're gonna s*** when you see what your armed forces are up to in Ukraine,"" replied another detractor.

""After invading Ukraine and murduring innocent men, women, children and animals, the Russian embassy did in fact believe they could support senseless and barbaric actions,"" responded another user.

""I understand diplomacy, but expecting Irish to put up with Russians on their soil while Russians invade a country? Laughable,"" read another tweet.

""Wouldn’t be going about drawing too much attention to who is or isn’t violating international conventions at the moment, given the circumstances,"" said another user.

Others replied by posting scenes of horror from the invasion.

Still others pointed out that the embassy failed to tell the truth in its relatively short statement, since the driver of the bus had been arrested despite the embassy's claim that the Irish officers stood by and not intervened.

The man, later identified as Desmond Wisley, told onlookers that he had been overcome by photographs of a family that was killed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

""I want the Ambassador and his colleagues to leave this country, leave this free country,"" he said. ""It’s about time we stood up.""

Russia extends sentence of imprisoned WNBA star Brittney Griner,"Russia has extended WNBA star and former Olympian Brittney Griner's arrest and detention for at least another 60 days, the Daily Mail reported on Thursday.

Russian authorities took the basketball player into custody in February after it was reported that she had a cannabis-filled vape pen on her person while traveling in the country in February.

What are the details?

A Moscow court announced that it opted to extend Griner's arrest until May 19.

""The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention of the U.S. citizen Griner until May 19,"" CNN reported, citing Russian state news agency TASS.

According to the Daily Mail report, Griner — who was seen for the first time on Thursday — appeared at a Moscow courthouse after authorities extended her prison stay to at least May 19.

Video footage showed Griner walking through what appeared to be a courthouse and giving a backward glance to a stationary camera.

Griner, the outlet noted, pleaded not guilty to drug charges.

Ekaterina Kalugina — member of the Public Monitoring Commission, a human rights watchdog group with access to Russian prisons — said that Griner, who is 6'9"", has only complained thus far about small beds. She added that the jail facility — which remains unnamed at the time of this reporting — has not seen any visits from the U.S. consulate and can't fathom why the consulate has yet to schedule any visits with Griner.

""[F]or an unknown reason, the U.S. consul does not come to [see Griner], although the administration of the pre-trial detention center is ready to create all conditions for a visit,"" Kalugina stated, adding that Griner's current cellmates have no previous convictions and have also been charged with drug-related offenses.

Her English-speaking cellmates, Kalugina states, have helped her order books, including those by Fyodor Dostoevsky and more.

In an early statement on Griner's arrest, the athlete's wife — Cherelle Griner — called for the basketball star's release.

""I love my wife wholeheartedly, so this message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life,"" she said at the time. ""I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details. Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely. Your prayers, and support are greatly appreciated.""

Earlier this month, Eveyln Farkas, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, said that she has fears that Russia may try to use Griner as a ""high-profile hostage"" and insisted that if the U.S. wants Griner out of jail, ""Russia is going to have some terms.""

""It could be a prisoner swap,"" Farkas explained. ""They could also use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-extends-sentence-of-imprisoned-wnba-star-brittney-griner,2022-03-17
Russia claims Facebook and Meta is an extremist organization,"Russian authorities have called for Facebook's parent company Meta to be categorized as an ""extremist organization,"" according to an Interfax report.

Earlier this month, Russia reportedly banned access to Facebook. Now, Russia's prosecutor general's office is attempting to label Facebook's parent company as an ""extremist organization.""

Last week, Facebook temporarily allowed users to post threats to Vladimir Putin and the Russian military forces involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

Now, Russia has declared the parent company of Facebook to be an ""extremist organization,"" while also restricting access to the Instagram application.

Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor claimed, ""Messages shared on Instagram encourage and provoke violent actions toward Russians.""

On Monday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded to the social media block: ""This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong.""

Meanwhile, Facebook has enabled users to temporarily express violent posts calling for the death of Vladimir Putin and Russian military forces.

Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said, ""Our policies are focused on protecting people's rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country. The fact is, if we applied our standard content policies without any adjustments we would now be removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces, which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable.""

""We have no quarrel with the Russian people a d will not tolerate Russophobia or any kind of discrimination, harassment or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

Russia has begun a 'selective default' on foreign debts as it attempts to pay in rubles,"The S&P credit rating agency has said that Russia’s attempts to pay bondholders in rubles, not dollars, amount to defaults on the country’s foreign debt.

Russia has now attempted to pay holders of two dollar-denominated bonds that recently finished maturing with rubles, CNN Business reported. The S&P said that this amounted to a “selective default” because the people redeeming these bonds are likely unable to convert the rubles into “dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts.”

A “selective default” is declared when an entity has defaulted on a specific obligation but not on its entire debt.

The Russian government is currently in the middle of a 30-day grace period that began April 4 that will enable Moscow to make payments of capital and interest on the redeemed bonds. However, the S&P does not expect that Russia will be able to convert the bonds into dollars given the thoroughgoing sanctions placed on Russia by Western nations.

These sanctions undermine Russia’s “willingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions” of its financial obligations to bond holders.

If Russia issues a full foreign currency default, it will be the country’s first in more than 100 years. The last time Russian leaders issued a default was after the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin rejected bonds that were previously issued by the regime of Tsar Nicholas II.

Currently, the Russian government cannot access the more than $310 billion it has stored in foreign currency reserves as a result of Western sanctions aggressively isolating the Russian economy. Up until last week, the U.S. allowed Russia to continue using some of these frozen assets to pay back specific investors with U.S. dollars.

Since then, the U.S. Treasury has blocked Russian banks from accessing its financial reserves held in American banks in a deliberate effort to diminish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ability to finance his military.

JPMorgan estimates that Russia had around $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of 2021, and it believes that half of that was held by foreign investors.

The Russian government remains defiant in the midst of this default and intends to take legal action at the international level so that investors can receive what they are owed.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, said, “We will sue, because we undertook all necessary action so that the investors would receive their payments.”

He said, “We will show the court proof of our payments, to confirm our efforts to pay in rubles, just as we did in foreign currency. It won’t be a simple process.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-has-begun-a-selective-default-on-foreign-debts-as-it-attempts-to-pay-in-rubles,2022-04-11
Russia is holding nuclear drills in response to Biden sending rockets to Ukraine,"The nuclear forces of Russia are holding drills in a region just northeast of Moscow.

The decision to begin these drills comes just one day after President Joe Biden announced his decision to send advanced missile system to Ukraine, the New York Post reported.

According to an independent news agency in Russia, around 1,000 Russian soldiers are taking part in intense maneuvers using more than 100 military vehicles, including Yars intercontinental missile launchers.

These drills are taking place in the Ivanovo Oblast, which is just under 200 miles northeast of Moscow.

The drills, which are said to be aimed at preparing Russia’s intercontinental missile systems for combat, required Russian soldiers to march more than 60 miles, camouflage sophisticated military equipment, and practice posting guard.

The training exercises also involved Typhoon-M armored counter-sabotage vehicles, which are said to be equipped with remotely operated weapon stations.

Russia’s nuclear drills commenced after Biden published an op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday in which the president announced his administration’s intention to send anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and precision rocket systems to Ukraine.

In the editorial, Biden said, “We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.”

The president indicated that his administration’s priority of achieving a “sovereign and prosperous Ukraine” is more likely to be achieved if the U.S. provides the country with the weaponry and munitions required to dispel the invading Russian forces.

Biden wrote, “America’s goal is straightforward: We want to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression.”

The president continued, “That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.”

The Biden administration’s plans to send weapons are an about-face from a position just previously held by the president in which he insisted that the U.S. would not deliver any rockets to Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government does not trust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy not to fire rockets into Russian territory.

Peskov also accused the U.S. of escalating tensions and hindering peace talks by sending additional weapons to Ukraine.

He said, “We believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently adding fuel to the fire. The United States is adhering to the position of fighting Russia until the last Ukrainian.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-is-holding-nuclear-drills-in-response-to-biden-sending-rockets-to-ukraine,2022-06-01
Russia is requesting that China provide support for the ongoing invasion of Ukraine,"Russia asked China for assistance in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials warn.

The New York Times reported that Russian officials sought military equipment and support from their Chinese counterparts as the invasion of Ukraine — launched last month by Russian President Vladimir Putin — continues.

Russian leaders also sought economic assistance from China to help lessen the burden of sanctions issued by Western nations that have devastated the Russian economy.

American officials declined to describe the specific hardware requested by the Russian government.

Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, said that China will “absolutely” face consequences if it chooses to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fox News reported.

Sullivan said, “We believe China, in fact, was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something. They may not have known the full extent of it, because it’s very possible that Putin lied to them in the same way he lied to Europeans and others. We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support, or economic support to Russia.”

He went on to say, “I’m not going to sit here publicly and brandish threats, but what I will tell you is that we are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them. We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world.”

Sullivan would not say whether the U.S. would issue sanctions on China if it was found to be supporting the Russian invasion.

During the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted Vladimir Putin for a series of diplomatic discussions where the two leaders agreed to declare a “no limits” partnership.

This agreement committed China and Russia to support each other on the geopolitical stage as both countries grow increasingly aggressive.

At the time of the agreement, Russian leadership continued to deny that it had any intention of launching an invasion of Ukraine.

China is one of the few global powers to avoid condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government did call for a diplomatic peace to be brokered between Russia and Ukraine.

Russian police detain 5 children for trying to lay flowers at Ukrainian embassy in Moscow,"Russian police detained two women and five children who were trying to lay flowers at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow, according to a report on social media.

Alexandra Arkhipova said in the Facebook post Tuesday that the mothers and their children were held in a police van before being taken to a police station.

She posted photographs and video of the children in the detainment center behind bars in the Russian station. She also claimed that the police threatened to take away custody of the children from their mothers.

Initially, the parents were told they might be held overnight but eventually they were released the same day.

“The parents are in fear,” wrote Arkhipova, who added that they are facing a trial and a fine, but with unspecified charges.

Arkhipova said the children were aged from 7 to 11 years.

Protests against the invasion into Ukraine have grown in Russia despite a crackdown by law enforcement. One report from last week said that as many as 2,000 were arrested for joining in the demonstrations against the war, but that number has jumped to more than 6,840.

Arina Adju, an activist in Russia, told The Guardian that the opposition to the war has divided Russians between the older generations and the youth.

""To be honest, it's deep propaganda here that worked for almost 20 years I guess, so most of the older generation, they're looking to the TV, and there is total propaganda, not any word of truth,"" she explained.

Protests against the war are expected to grow as economic and financial sanctions take a toll on the Russian economy.

""It's impossible to forgive us, but I hope there will be peace again,"" Adju added.

Russia issues military threat if Finland or Sweden join NATO,"Russia has issued a veiled threat of ""military and political consequences"" if Finland and Sweden attempt to join NATO.

Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned the Scandinavian countries on Friday about joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""Finland and Sweden should not base their security in basing it on damaging security of other countries,"" Zakharova said during the press conference.

""Their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences,"" Zakharova cautioned.

""We regard the Finnish government's commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe,"" Zakharova said.

The scare tactic by Russia arrived a day after Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin declared that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine would force Finland – which shares an 833-mile border with Russia – to reconsider joining NATO.



""Finland is not currently facing an immediate military threat, but it is also now clear that the debate on NATO membership in Finland will change,"" Marin said on Thursday, according to YLE News.

In January, Marin discussed potentially becoming a NATO member, ""Finland retains the option of applying for NATO membership. We should uphold this freedom of choice and make sure it remains a reality, as this is part of every country's right to decide on its own security policies.""



Finland and Sweden – which are not NATO members but are NATO partners – are both attending NATO's virtual emergency summit regarding the Ukraine situation on Friday.

""It is important for Finland and Sweden to be involved in the NATO meeting, due to the situation in the Baltic Sea region, for example,"" Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Thursday.

Haavisto added, ""We consider it important that Nato continues its open-door policy and that we can apply for membership if we wish.""

Former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb reacted to the threat by saying, ""Russia is pushing Finland closer to NATO membership. Closer than ever before. Our security has been partially based on an option to join. At this rate, we have no other option but to join. Finland's accession would strengthen the alliance and help keep Northern Europe stable.""

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Finland on Friday for financial aid during the Russian invasion.



""Discussed with [Finnish President Sauli] Niinistö countering the aggressor,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter. ""Informed about our defense, insidious shelling of Kyiv. Grateful to Finland for allocating $50 million aid. It's an effective contribution to the anti-war coalition. We keep working. We need to increase sanctions & Ukraine defense support.""



Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson declared on Thursday that her country would help Ukraine.

""I have ... today given the Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist the task of immediately preparing a decision so that we, from the Swedish side, can support Ukraine with further ways to... to strengthen their resilience,"" Andersson said.

Putin had previously issued veiled threats if Ukraine attempted to become a member of NATO.

In the weeks leading up to NATO's 2008 Bucharest Summit, Putin told U.S. Undersecretary for Political Affairs William J. Burns, ""No Russian leader could stand idly by in the face of steps toward NATO membership for Ukraine. That would be a hostile act toward Russia.""

Russia-owned media member decries being labeled as Russian state media by Twitter and gets swift backlash,"A media reporter who works for Russian state-owned media angrily denounced Twitter for adding a label proclaiming the affiliation to her tweets, and she saw swift backlash online.

Rachel Blevins is a co-host for the financial new show ""Boom Bust,"" which is a subsidiary by Russia Today, a media company openly owned and run by the Russian government, but she denounced the injustice of being labeled accurately by Twitter on Monday.

""Twitter just added the 'Russian state media affiliated' label to my account,"" Blevins groused. ""I am asking for the immediate removal of this label, due to the fact that I am an individual journalist who does not speak for Russia or Russian media.""

Blevins later deleted the tweet after she was excoriated by many on social media platforms for the suggestion that she was being treated unfairly, but screenshots were widely circulated.

Many ridiculed her for suggesting the accurate label was a grave injustice.

""Well, being you, I wouldn’t complain. It could be 'blood on hands' label. And all your colleagues working for Russian state-funded media could have it as well. I would rather be homeless than work for Putin,"" replied Czech journalist Filip Horký.

""You literally host a show on RT - Russian state media,"" responded U.K. reporter Ben Bloch. ""Not entirely sure how you can complain that you don't speak for the Russian government when it literally pays your wages.""



""If you don't want to be identified as Russian state media, don't be Russian state media. Happy to help!"" said one detractor.

""It's going to blow your mind when you find out who you work for,"" joked another user.

Not all laughed at Blevins, however. One columnist who worked for Chinese state-owned media agreed with her claim of injustice.

""I just got my label last week too — Twitter is on a roll,"" tweeted Andy Boreham.

Twitter announced on Monday that they would be labeling tweets with hyperlinks to Russian state-owned media and also throttling their spread through Twitter's algorithm.

Blevins was also upset in April when Twitter suspended her account for posting a very graphic video of a U.S. military operation that she admitted would be upsetting to the families of the deceased.

Russia plans nuclear drills as tensions escalate with Ukraine,"Russia is escalating its military activity as Western officials are increasingly certain Russian President Vladimir Putin will launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the coming days.

The Russian military on Friday announced military drills involving the country's strategic nuclear forces, which will be personally overseen by Putin on Saturday, the Associated Press reports.

The exercises will involve multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said.

Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, said Putin would watch the drills from the Defense Ministry's situation room and supervise the practice missile launches in person.

Russia claims these exercises have been planned well in advance and are intended to check the readiness of Russia's military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons.

But the exercises are being conducted as Russia has placed an estimated 150,000 troops along the border with Ukraine. President Joe Biden and other Western leaders have indicated an invasion of Ukraine is imminent and have attempted to dissuade Putin from war through diplomacy and by threatening severe economic sanctions.

Moscow continues to deny it has plans to invade. But Russia has demanded that the U.S. and NATO withdraw their forces from Eastern Europe and make legally binding commitments that Ukraine will not become a NATO member, demands that have been rebuffed by Washington and Brussels.

The location of the nuclear drills is significant. According to the AP, the maneuvers will involve the Black Sea Fleet based on the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

While Russia holds annual strategic forces drills in the fall, U.S. officials say Moscow may have shifted the exercises to February to coincide with an invasion of Ukraine.

Officials also warn that the Russians are trying to execute a false flag operation to serve as a pretext to invade.

Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists are engaged in a second day of shelling after a kindergarten was hit by separatist artillery on Thursday. Western leaders warn that Russia may use the infighting in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region as an excuse to invade.



""Ukraine is not your enemy, but those who want to defend you against Ukraine are. Do not heed rumours about some offensive operation,"" Ukraine's defense minister said in a speech Friday, addressing the rebel faction. ""We have no intentions to conduct any force actions towards the ORDLO (Donbas) or the Crimea. At all. We will move by the political and diplomatic way. Because there are our citizens and we will not put them in danger.""

While Russia has claimed it is moving troops away from the border with Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Friday there is no evidence to support Russia's claim.

""Although Russia has announced it is moving its forces back to garrison, we have yet to see that. In fact, we see more forces moving into that region, that border region,"" Austin said at a press conference. ""We also see them going through, continuing to prepare, by doing things you'd expect elements — military elements — to do as they were preparing to launch an attack.""

President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak at 4 p.m. ET on Friday on the evolving situation in Eastern Europe.

"Russia says some troops will withdraw from border, but Ukraine demands evidence","Russia is pulling back some troops from military districts adjacent to Ukraine after completing drills, the Russian defense ministry said Tuesday, though Ukrainian officials are demanding to see evidence that this is true.

In a video statement Tuesday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that while large-scale military exercises across the country continued, some forces in the southern and western military districts near Ukraine have completed their drills and will return to base, Reuters reported.

The Russian government posted video showing some tanks and other armored vehicles being loaded onto railway flatcars.

But Ukraine isn't taking Russia's claims at face value. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would ""believe in de-escalation"" only after it witnesses Russian troops withdraw from the border, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency.

""We continuously hear different statements from the Russian federation, so we have a rule ... we believe what we see. If we see the pullout, we will believe in de-escalation,"" Kuleba reportedly said.

NATO officials echoed Ukraine's skepticism of Russia's intentions. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said there were no signs of de-escalation on the ground during a press conference Tuesday, according to Newsweek.



""Everything is now in place for a new attack, but Russia still has time to step back from the brink,"" Stoltenberg said.

Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders over several months, leading Western governments to believe President Vladimir Putin intends to invade. Western analysts have long suspected Putin has ambitions to expand Russia's borders and restore the perceived greatness of the Soviet Union as a superpower. Russia has deep historical ties to Ukraine, a former Soviet state, and Putin has described the collapse of the Soviet Union as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.""

While Putin has insisted there are no plans to launch an invasion of Ukraine, Russia previously annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has excused the buildup of troops along Ukraine's borders as an act of deterrence against alleged Western aggression. Moscow has demanded legally binding guarantees from the United States and its allies that Kyiv will not be allowed to join NATO. Washington and Brussels have so far rebuffed these demands.

The White House said Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent and could happen at any time this week. The United States has partially moved its forces out of Ukraine and ordered the evacuation of most embassy staff in expectation of war. State Department officials have warned any American citizens residing in Ukraine to flee the country before hostilities begin, emphasizing that the U.S. will not be able to extract them in the event of war between Russia and Ukraine.

Russia offers aid to Belarus in what could be an attempted takeover,"On Friday, the president of Belarus announced that the Russian government had offered his country a financial lifeline, in return for integrating more with Russia, a move that he said was a Russian plan to take over his country.

What's the situation?

Belarus is a former Soviet republic that gained its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It borders Russia, as well as Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine.

In 1999, Belarus and Russia signed an agreement to form a union that would share foreign policy, currency, and a legal system.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been in power since 1994. According to the CIA World Factbook, Lukashenko “has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian means and a centralized economic system. Government restrictions on political and civil freedoms, freedom of speech and the press, peaceful assembly, and religion have remained in place.""

While the Belarusian economy has improved in 2017 and 2018, it struggled in the five years prior to that.

What happened now?

On Thursday, Russian Prime Minister and former President Dmitry Medvedev announced that Russia would be willing to offer Belarus financial assistance in return for Belarus adhering to the 1999 agreement. This comes as Russian tax rules threaten to increase the cost of oil and gas entering Belarus. Belarus is dependent on Russia for these vital resources.

At a news conference Friday, Lukashenko said that Medvedev's offer was an attempt by the Russian government to reabsorb Belarus.

“I understand those hints: here's your oil, but you must destroy your country and join Russia,"" he said.

“Splitting us into separate regions and merging with Russia — that will never happen,"" Lukashenko told the Belarusian news outlet Belta, according to a translation by Bloomberg News. He told Belta that the Russian oil and gas policies could cost his country more than $10 billion over the next six years, but that this was not worth giving up Belarusian independence.

“Sovereignty is a sacred thing for us,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-takeover-belarus,2018-12-14
Russia threatens countries helping to arm Ukraine: 'Legitimate targets' for Russian attacks,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that any countries providing military equipment to aid Ukraine in its fight against the Russian incursion would be considered ""legitimate targets"" for any Russian strikes.

What are the details?

In a statement, Lavrov told the RT television channel that any cargo containing foreign supplies that Russia believes to include military equipment will be ""fair game.""

""We clearly said that any cargo moving into the Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game,"" he said. ""This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from the Ukrainian soil.""

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov made similar comments last week, the Financial Times reported.

At the time, Ryabkov said that ""pumping up [Ukraine] with weapons from a whole range of countries"" was ""not just a dangerous move,"" but ""something that turns these convoys into legitimate military targets.""

According to the Times of Israel, he added that Moscow had previously warned “about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defense systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on.”

What else?



Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday delivered remarks about the ongoing invasion during a jam-packed outdoor concert in Moscow.

According to reports, the slogan ""For a world without Nazism"" appeared on the stage on which Putin spoke.

Of the ongoing invasion — which the Russian president previously referred to as a ""special military operation"" — Putin reportedly said, ""It is precisely to save people from this suffering, from this genocide that is the main, main reason, motive and goal of the military operation that we launched in the Donbass and Ukraine.""

""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost,"" he was said to have added. ""And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-threatens-countries-helping-to-arm-ukraine-legitimate-targets-for-russian-attacks,2022-03-18
Russian state-owned media lays off most employees and shuts down operations in the US,"The U.S. arm of a Russian state-owned media outlet shut down on Thursday after being expelled from several platforms over the Russian invasion into Ukraine.

CNN first reported that Russia Today was ceasing operations and firing most of its staff in the United States.

The memo obtained by CNN from the general manager of T&R Productions blamed the shutdown on ""unforeseen business interruption events.”

“Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” wrote Misha Solodovnikov.

The media network had been an outlet for pro-Russian propaganda but was removed from DirecTV this week and then later from Roku streaming services.

On Tuesday, Google said that they had blocked mobile apps connected to Sputnik and RT from their app store and from their search tool. Apple made similar moves on its app store.

RT Deputy Editor-in-Chief Anna Belkina issued a statement angrily decrying the bans.

""This collective ‘establishment’ seems to be terrified of a mere presence of any outside voice for the fear of losing their historically captive audience, if that audience encounters a different perspective,"" she said.

CNN also detailed a personal meeting between Solodovnikov and the hosts, correspondents, and producers of RT American in the Washington, D.C., bureau on Thursday based on a source who attended it.

Solodovnikov told the employees that their jobs were being terminated with two months severance pay.

One RT host spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity about the somber meeting.

“I have never felt more heartbroken as they have nothing to do with this conflict and seriously were just trying to make a decent living to provide for their families,” the host said.

Another source told CNN that people were shocked and many cried after the announcement.

Russian leadership threatens nuclear escalation if the West continues to arm Ukraine,"During a Tuesday interview with state media, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said that if the U.S. and other Western allies of Ukraine continue to provide the country with weapons, the risk of the war escalating into a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”

CBS News reported that Lavrov said that by providing weapons to Ukraine, NATO countries were “pouring oil on the fire” and risking “World War III.”

Lavrov said that by providing weapons to Ukraine, NATO nations were already “in essence engaged in war with Russia.”

The Russian diplomat's warning came as U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with NATO allies in Germany to urge European nations to increase their military aid to Ukraine. Germany’s defense chief announced on Tuesday that Germany would soon start sending self-propelled armored anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine.

According to CBS News, foreign solidarity with Ukraine has “only grown over the course of Putin’s unprovoked two-month assault” that is now placing its focus largely on the eastern regions of Ukraine.

Last night, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said that it had hit roughly 90 more targets that it designated as “military” institutions. These included rail facilities around the northeastern city of Kharkiv that are crucial for getting supplies — including weaponry — into the city.

Austin told Ukraine’s allies in NATO that despite being significantly outgunned, Ukraine could manage to achieve victory if the country was provided with the “right equipment.”

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, dismissed the comments made by Lavrov and suggested that the bellicose rhetoric indicated that Russian leadership already “senses defeat in Ukraine.”

Despite this, the fighting in Ukraine’s eastern regions is far from over. Russian forces are reporting that their latest strikes in Kharkiv have killed 500 Ukrainian troops. CBS News says this claim cannot be verified but does substantiate the fact that front-line fighting in the region has only grown more intense.

Residents in Ukraine’s eastern regions are having their lives overturned as Russian forces continue to shell their hometowns. Many people have fled their family homes and taken shelter in shopping centers, where cafes are being converted into first-aid centers and refugee camps are being set up in parking lots.

Reportedly, Russian forces continue to abuse and claim the lives of civilians as they continue to push forward along their 300-mile-long front line in the east.

Fedor Zubkov, a 36-year-old man living near the eastern town of Zaporizhzhia, said that he was held captive for two days, handcuffed, and had a gun pointed at him by Russian forces.

He said, “I need to see the psychiatrist because, after the imprisonment and the loss of my beloved wife, I am slowly losing my mind. You can't even imagine what it is like to be tortured when 30 fully armored Chechen men stand in front of you, point the gun at you, and threaten to kill you again and again.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-ukraine-nuke-invasion,2022-04-26
Russia warns that Biden's sanctions could cause it to drop the International Space Station on the United States,"Russian leadership threatened to allow the International Space Station (ISS) to crash into the United States or one of its allies following President Joe Biden’s recently announced sanctions on Russia.

Biden issued sanctions on Russia that target the country’s “aerospace industry, including their space program,” the U.S. Sun reported.

In response to Biden’s sanctions, Dimitry Rogozin, the Director-General of Roscomos, suggested that the United States wants to “destroy our cooperation on the ISS.”

Russian leadership claimed that the United States needs to cooperate with Russia if they want to prevent the ISS from falling on the United States or Europe.

Rogozin said, “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the International Space Station (ISS) from an uncontrolled de-orbit and fall into the United States or … Europe?”

He added, “There is also the possibility of a 500-ton structure falling on India and China.”

NASA has sought to ease tensions with its Russian counterparts.



A spokesperson for the agency said, “NASA continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station.”

“The new export control measures will continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation,” the spokesperson added, “No changes are planned to the agency’s support for the ongoing in orbit and ground station operations.”

Brandon J. Weichert, a geopolitical and space expert, suggested that Russia has a “decade to 12-year advantage on the U.S. in the galaxies.”

Weichert said that the United States are in “no way fit” to deal with the challenges posed by Russia.

He said, “We are going to get hit very hard soon in space. It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America possibly ever. And, we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”

Weichert criticized politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. for not having the foresight to ward off rivals in space exploration after the Cold War.

He said, “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventive security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.”

Weichert added, “Here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-warns-that-biden-s-sanctions-could-cause-it-to-drop-the-international-space-station-on-the-united-states,2022-02-26
Russia will cease collaborating on the International Space Station until Western sanctions are lifted,"Russia announced on Saturday that it will stop collaborating with Western-led nations on the International Space Station (ISS) until these nations stop sanctioning Russia.

Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos wrote a lengthy thread on Twitter explaining the agency's decision to end its cooperation with the West, the Daily Mail reported.

In the thread, he said, ""I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions.""





Rogozin went on to say in the thread that he will submit a timetable for the completion of projects currently in the works to the Kremlin.



Russia's decision to end collaborative efforts on the ISS comes after weeks of threatening to do so and delaying and outright canceling projects on the ISS in response to Western sanctions placed on the Russian economy and Russian oligarchs.

Previously, Rogozin suggested that the Roscosmos would stop collaborating with the West and allow the ISS to crash into the Earth.

He asked, ""Who would save the ISS?""

This prompted Tesla CEO Elon Musk to offer the support of his spacefaring company SpaceX.

Historically, astronauts aboard the ISS return to Earth on the Russian Soyuz crafts. However, Elon Musk's SpaceX Crew Dragon has made four visits to the ISS since 2020 and is able to drop off and return astronauts aboard the station.

When asked if SpaceX would keep the ISS from falling onto the Earth, Musk replied: ""Yes.""

The United States supplies the ISS with life support technology while Russia provides it with propulsion, so without Musk stepping in to offer to keep the station afloat, Russia's threats to let it drop crash into the planet posed a tangible threat.

Rogozin previously said that Russia pulling out of the ISS would require either the US or one of its European allies to take on additional responsibilities for the station's maintenance. US officials, in the past, have said that it would be ""very difficult"" to operate the ISS independently.

Despite the ongoing and seemingly increasing diplomatic tensions between the US and Russia, the two countries were able to safely return three astronauts — two Russian, one American — to Earth from the ISS.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-will-cease-collaborating-on-the-international-space-station-until-western-sanctions-are-lifted,2022-04-03
Russian airlines and private jets are banned from European airspace,"Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said that the European Union would close its airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, ABC News reported.

In a press conference, Von der Leyen said, “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians. We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered, or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the EU.”

“So let me be very clear,” she continued, “Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane, and that includes the private jets of oligarchs too.”



Von der Leyen also announced that the European Union would be prohibiting media backed by the Russian government.

She said, “The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, and their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war. We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.”

Her press conference concluded with the von der Leyen issuing sanctions on the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.

The European Union also plans to purchase and supply weapons to Ukrainian forces.



Von der Leyen said, “For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack.”

These sanctions will further hurt the Russian economy, which has been in a freefall since Russian forces started their invasion of Ukraine. The Russian ruble is plummeting in value, and Western nations continue to barrage Russia with sanctions.

In response to the ruble’s freefall, the Russian central bank is intervening in the foreign exchange market and expanding the list of securities that it will accept as collateral. It is also offering banks 1 trillion rubles so that they have additional liquidity to keep them afloat.

On Saturday, Western leaders proceeded with excluding Russia from the SWIFT telecommunications network, which will prevent the Russian central bank from manipulating its monetary policy to avoid the economic impact of sanctions and make it virtually impossible for Russia to conduct business with its international trade partners.

In a joint statement, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to targeting Russian banks and oligarchs by blocking Russia’s access to the SWIFT network.

The Western leaders said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-airlines-and-private-jets-are-banned-from-european-airspace,2022-02-27
Russian and Cuban leadership reignite Cold War romance,"Tensions continue to rise across the world as Russian President Vladimir Putin rekindles his country’s relationship with the island nation of Cuba.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and Putin discussed their countries’ “strategic partnership” and how they might work together to pursue “actions in the international arena.” The two men chatted on the phone as NATO allies continued to worry about a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Stars and Stripes reported.

Earlier this month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, compared the Russian buildup of forces around Ukraine and the subsequent international tension to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the New York Post said.

Ryabkov continued by explaining that Russia fully intends to annex parts of Ukraine. He said, “We are not bluffing. ... The West’s awareness of this needs to be facilitated, and we are going to make every effort to achieve it.”

In mid-January, the Associated Press reported that Russia grew increasingly frustrated with NATO allies interfering with its plans and that Russia could consider deploying its military to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the United States escalated.

Minister Ryabkov said he could “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility of Russian military involvement in Cuba and Venezuela should the United States continue to increase pressure on Russia.

Ryabkov said that the decision to do so “depends on the action by our U.S. counterparts” in an interview with the Russian television network RTVI. Ryabkov noted that Putin is open to the possibility of using Russia’s military resources should the United States use its military to pressure Russian decision-making about Ukraine.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan dismissed this as “bluster in the public commentary,” the Daily Mail reported.

In preparing for a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States ordered family members of American embassy staff in Kyiv to leave the country. This decision frustrated Ukrainian leadership, with some diplomats calling it an “instance of excessive caution.”

On Monday, according to the New York Post, White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated that American citizens currently in Ukraine “should leave now” and that the United States government does not currently have intentions to evacuate them should an armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia occur.

Psaki said, “There is not an intention for there to be a departure or an evacuation. ... So we are conveying to the American citizens they should leave now.”

When asked whether or not Americans would be on their own should armed conflict begin, Psaki said, “There’s commercial airlines, you can depart over land.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-and-cuban-leadership-reignite-cold-war-romance,2022-01-25
Russian business tycoon places $1 million bounty on Putin's head as attacks in Ukraine escalate,"A U.S.-based Russian businessman and investor has announced that he's placed a $1 million bounty on Russian President Vladimir Putin's head.

In a Tuesday Facebook post, Alex Konanykhin called on Russian military officers to arrest Putin as a war criminal. Their reward? One million dollars.

In his post, Konanykhin wrote, ""I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws.""

""Putin,"" he continued, ""is not the Russian president as he came to power as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents.""

He concluded, ""As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia. I will continue my assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin's Orda.""

Konanykhin also added that Facebook removed his initial posting about the bounty and said that the original post contained a graphic of a ""dead or alive"" poster.

What else?

Konanykhin — a crypto investor — told Insider on Wednesday that the money will come from his personal funds.

""If enough other people make similar statements, it may increase the chances of Putin getting arrested and brought to justice,"" he told the outlet. ""Putin is known to murder his opponents. He has millions of them now.""

Konanykhin told the outlet that he has not set foot on Russian soil since 1992 and was granted political asylum in the United States in 1999.

A 1996 article from the Washington Post reported that Konanykhin studied at the Moscow Physics and Technical Institute before opening what was described as a student construction cooperative. He eventually opened more businesses and dabbled in banking, real estate, and trading.

By 1992, the Post noted, Konanykhin's companies were worth approximately $300 million.

In 2021, Konanykhin told the Sun that Putin would ""drown [Russia] with blood if need be"" rather than ever give up power.

""Such a regime cannot be removed through elections, he doesn't have any parliamentary opposition, he doesn't have media [against him], and every type of organized opposition is wiped clean,"" he said at the time. ""It would have to be removed by force — and there is no such force, domestically or internationally.""

Konanykhin added that he believes ""only a conflict within the ruling class"" would be able to unseat Putin.

""I would love to be wrong, I really hope in a year I will be able to say 'Jesus, how wrong I was in this interview' — but 29 years ago I saw what has happened now,"" he said. ""I saw no scenario in which the KGB would not regain power and would hold it for the foreseeable future — so at that time I made the decision to leave the country.""

"Top Russian UN diplomat resigns, pens scathing letter against Putin: 'Never have I been so ashamed of my country'","A top Russian diplomat to the United Nations resigned in style on Monday, writing a scathing letter that sharply criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine.

What did the letter say?

Boris Bondarev, counselor at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, circulated a letter among his colleagues in Geneva explaining why he decided to resign.

In the letter, Bondarev held nothing back.

""For twenty years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24 of this year,"" Bondarev explained in the letter.

""The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country,"" he continued.

Bondarev worked for the Russian Foreign Ministry for 20 years. Over his tenure of service, the professionalism of the Russian Foreign Ministry, he said, has devolved from ""unbiased information, impartial analysis and sober forecasting"" to ""propaganda clichés in the spirit of Soviet newspapers of the 1930s.""



""Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,"" Bondarev said. ""It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy.""

Speaking directly about Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Bondarev wrote:

Minister Lavrov is a good illustration of the degradation of this system. In 18 years, he went from a professional and educated intellectual, whom many my colleagues held in such high esteem. to a person who constantly broadcasts conflicting statements and threatens the world (that is, Russia too) with nuclear weapons!

Is he defecting?

Bondarev told the Associated Press that he has no plans to leave Geneva. However, when asked whether he would defect, Bondarev told the news outlet that he ""didn’t think so far"" ahead.

Meanwhile, the career diplomat also said he is concerned about Moscow's reaction. He is now the highest-ranking Russian official to publicly criticize the war.

""If my case is prosecuted, then if other people want to follow, they would not,"" Bondarev told the AP.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-diplomat-boris-bondarev-resigns-letter-against-putin,2022-05-23
"Top Russian diplomat brags about new Iran nuclear deal and suggests US taken to cleaners by China, Russia, and Iran","Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov celebrated the forthcoming new Iran nuclear deal in a recent interview, essentially saying the United States was taken to the cleaners by Iran, China, and Russia.

What is the background?

The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was originally negotiated under the Obama administration. But then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the controversial deal in May 2018.

President Joe Biden, during his campaignand after his election, expressed willingness to re-enter the JCPOA and lift sanctions on Iran that were imposed by the Trump administration.

Diplomats officially returned to negotiation last year in hopes of reviving the plan.

What did Ulyanov say?

Ulyanov, the top Russian diplomat working on JCPOA negotiations, boasted in a recent interview that Iran received more in the forthcoming deal than even he expected.

""Iranian clerics are fighting for Iranian nuclear national interests like lions,"" Ulyanov said. ""Indeed, I’m very serious. They fight for every comma, every word, and, as a rule, quite successfully. I must recognize that.""



""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" he added. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ulyanov said that Beijing and Moscow worked together to achieve their goals within the JCPOA.

""Our Chinese friends were also very efficient and useful as co-negotiators,"" Ulyanov said. ""We could rely on each other on many, many points. And on many, many points of joint differences we succeeded. I can recollect dozens of such cases, when on rather serious, significant questions, we managed together to get positive results close to what we wanted to achieve.""

The totality of concessions made by the U.S. and western allied powers will not become clear until the deal is finalized.

However, the Jerusalem Post reported:

Among the concessions to Iran that Israel has been concerned about are allowing Iran to keep its advanced centrifuges even when they are out of use, and lifting the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization by the US, as well as rescinding all sanctions placed by the previous US administration, including those put in place due to terrorism and human rights violations.

Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, corroborated on Monday that a finalized deal is nearing completion as long as the Biden administration makes the concessions that Tehran demands, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What is the US saying?

State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter said last week that ""significant progress"" had been made and a final deal is imminent.

""We are close to a possible deal, but a number of difficult issues still remain unsolved,"" she said. ""We will not have a deal unless we resolve quickly the remaining issues. If Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding of mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days.""

In a nod to Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken admitted Sunday that sanctions imposed by Washington on Moscow because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will be totally disconnected from the Iran nuclear deal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-diplomat-brags-iran-nuclear-deal-us-taken-to-cleaners-by-china-russia-iran,2022-03-07
"Russia, espionage, expelled","A dozen diplomats from the Russian Mission to the United Nations are being kicked out of America, according to the U.S. Mission to the U.N. which said that the 12 individuals perpetrated espionage, and the move to expel them has been in the works for months.

""The United States has informed the United Nations and the Russian Permanent Mission to the United Nations that we are beginning the process of expelling twelve intelligence operatives from the Russian Mission who have abused their privileges of residency in the United States by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security. We are taking this action in accordance with the UN Headquarters Agreement. This action has been in development for several months,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. said in a statement.



The announcement comes as Russia continues to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine, wreaking death and destruction as Ukrainians bravely fight to defend their country.

While President Biden has declared that the U.S. will defend NATO territory, he has said that American forces will not get involved in the battle between Russia and Ukraine.

But while the U.S. has ruled out military intervention in Ukraine, it is providing military and humanitarian assistance to the embattled nation — the U.S. has also levied sanctions to target Russia economically.

""Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the President, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a press statement last week. ""This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1 billion.""

""This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing. It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation,"" Blinken said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-diplomats-expelled-espionage,2022-03-01
"Report: Russian forces firing rockets at Kharkiv physics institute, which houses a nuclear reactor","Russian invaders have reportedly fired rockets at a Kharkiv, Ukraine, physics institute — a building that is said to house a nuclear reactor and more.



What are the details?

According to a Sunday report from The Independent, Ukraine's national security service has claimed that forces have been firing rockets at the institute, which they say could prompt a ""large-scale ecological disaster.""

The outlet reported that Russian forces are firing missiles from Grad launchers, which reportedly do not have precise targeting.

The facility, which houses a nuclear research division called Neutron Source, and is said to store at least 37 nuclear fuel cells.

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether the inside of the building — and more particularly, the area in which the reactor and other nuclear materials are stored — sustained any damages from the rockets.

This week, Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzheppar said that the embattled country “continues to collect evidence of [Russian] war crimes for the Hague.”

What else?

The disturbing news comes on the heels of a near-miss at a Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, nuclear power station in which Russian forces stormed the facility and took over at gunpoint.

According to The Independent's report, Malcolm Grimston — honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London's center for energy policy — said that the level of artillery necessary to destroy a nuclear power station would be immense, and beyond mere bullets and fire, indicating that Russian forces want to overtake the facility, and not trigger a large-scale disaster.



“So it’s much more consistent at least at this stage with them wanting to take a facility that happened to be a nuclear facility in that area, but not to cause a radiological incident,” he reasoned. “These power stations are an enormous asset; Ukraine gets more than half of its electricity from nuclear power. You would expect the Russians to want to maintain that because if they’re going to run it as part of Russia, it will still need energy.”

According to the Evening Standard, Linda Thomas-Greenfield — U.S. ambassador to the United Nations — on Saturday warned that Putin’s forces were closing in on a third plant in the Yuzhnoukrainsk area.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that nuclear power stations ""cannot become part of this conflict.""

“Reliable electricity is vital for the nuclear facility, as are back-up diesel generators and fuel,"" she continued. ""Safe transit corridors must be maintained. Russia must halt any further use of force that might put at further risk all 15 operable reactors across Ukraine — or interfere with Ukraine’s ability to maintain the safety and security of its 37 nuclear facilities and their surrounding populations.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-forces-firing-rockets-at-kharkiv-institute-a-dangerous-move-considering-there-s-a-nuclear-reactor-inside-the-building,2022-03-06
'My life is being taken away from me': Russian influencers burst into tears over their country's Instagram ban — but the reaction is swift and harsh,"Several Russian influencers were moved to tears over the weekend after their country decided to ban Instagram, lamenting that their lives and livelihoods are being taken from them.

The Kremlin officially blocked use of the popular social media platform on Monday to restrict the flow of negative information surrounding its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

What are the details?

Business Insider reported that Russian reality TV star Olga Buzova who boasts 23 million followers on the platform, posted a nearly seven-minute video to fans crying over her new reality.

""I am not afraid of admitting that I do not want to lose you,"" the 36-year-old reportedly said in Russian.

""I do not know what the future holds. I don't know,"" she continued. ""I just shared my life, my work, and my soul. I did not do this all as a job for me, this is a part of my soul. It feels like a big part of my heart, and my life is being taken away from me.""

Buzova ended her video by saying she was ""going to go and continue crying.""

Another influencer, reportedly a Russian beauty blogger, posted a message to fans in which she broke down in tears over the loss of her lifestyle, saying she is in the ""first stage of grief.""

""Do you think that for me, as an Instagram influencer, this is [a] source of income?"" she asked, according to video posted on Twitter by NEXTA.

""To me, it’s all life, it’s the soul. It’s the one with which I wake up, fall asleep, f**king five years in a row,"" she said.

Other influencers, including Valeria Chekalina and Karina Nigay, also lamented their country's Instagram blackout while urging followers to join them on Telegram or Russian state-controlled social platform VK.

""Instagram is no more,"" Chekalina said, Insider reported.

""This is my work,"" Nigay said in a live video, according to the Washington Post. ""Imagine you were just fired completely from work and you aren’t receiving any income at all, but at the same time you have expenses for your family, for your team if you have subordinates, and then all of a sudden you have nothing to pay your team.""

What was the response?

While the tearful influencers received pity from some of their Russian followers, several critics on social media slammed the privileged stars over their insensitivity.

""In Ukraine, people are dying, children are in the subway, there is nowhere to sleep, they have lost everything, and you are crying because of Instagram,"" one person reportedly commented in response to Buzova's post.

""Wow, those are some problems you have,"" another commenter wrote after Nigay’s video.

""I’m shocked, we have air sirens on here,"" another follower said.

In the caption of its Twitter post, NEXTA alleged, ""[The influencer] does not care at all about the thousands of dead people, including her compatriots. Obviously, her biggest worry right now is that she won’t be able to post pictures of food from restaurant.""

That influencer's comments came as the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol entered its 13th day without food, water, and electricity, the Daily Mail noted.

Anything else?

Russia’s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced on Friday that it would ban Instagram, giving users 48 hours to say goodbye to the app.

In announcing the ban, the regulator cited parent company Meta's decision to allow posts calling for violence against Russian invaders in Ukraine.

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri decried the ban, saying in response that it would ""cut 80 million [people] in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-influencers-cry-over-instagram-ban,2022-03-14
Russian journalist interrupts live broadcast with brave anti-war protest: 'They can't lock us all away',"Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova bravely protested the Ukraine war on Monday during a live broadcast on Russian media.

What happened?

During a live broadcast on Channel One, Russia's most popular TV network, Ovsyannikova disrupted the broadcast by walking onto the set and holding a sign to protest the war in Ukraine. Ovsyannikova is reportedly an editor at the network.

The woman chanted, ""Stop the war, no to war."" Her sign said in English, ""NO WAR"" and ""Russians against war."" In Russian, the sign said, ""Stop the war! Don’t believe propaganda! They are lying to you!""

Producers quickly cut away from the live shot, and the anchor whom Ovsyannikova disrupted raised her voice in an attempt to drown out Ovsyannikova's protests.

Before her protest, Ovsyannikova recorded a video explaining her motive for speaking out against Putin and his war and said she is ""ashamed"" of helping spread Kremlin propaganda as a journalist.

""What is happening in Ukraine is a crime. And Russia is the aggressor here. And responsibility for this aggression rests on the conscience of a single man: Vladimir Putin,"" Ovsyannikova said, according to a translation of the video.

She continued:

My father is Ukrainian. My mother is Russian. And they’ve never been enemies. And this necklace I’m wearing is a symbol of that fact that Russia must immediately end this fratricidal war. And our fraternal peoples will still be able to make peace.



Unfortunately, I’ve spent many of the last few years working for Channel One, doing Kremlin propaganda, and I’m deeply ashamed of this. Ashamed that I allowed lies to come from the TV screen. Ashamed that I allowed the zombification of Russian people. We were silent in 2014 when all this had just started.



We didn’t protest when the Kremlin poisoned [Russian opposition leader Alexi] Navalny. We just silently watched this anti-human regime at work. And now the whole world has turned its back on us. And the next 10 generations won’t wash away the stain of this fratricidal war. We Russians are thinking and intelligent people.



It’s in our power alone to stop all this madness. Go protest. Don’t be afraid of anything. They can’t lock us all away.

What is happening now?

Lawyers initially said they could not locate Ovsyannikova after she was detained. However, the BBC reported that Ovsyannikova appeared in court Tuesday.

She has reportedly been charged with ""organizing an unauthorized public event.""

Still, Ovsyannikova and other Russian journalists who protest the war could be hit with severe prison sentences after Russian lawmakers passed a law earlier this month criminalizing ""fake"" news, which is defined as essentially anything that contradicts the Kremlin's narrative. Journalists can be imprisoned for 15 years under the law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-journalist-interrupts-live-broadcast-with-brave-anti-war-protest-they-cant-lock-us-all-away,2022-03-15
Russian official apologizes for unjustified invasion of Ukraine at UN climate meeting,"The head of the Russian delegation to a major United Nations climate conference offered an apology for his country's unjustified invasion of Ukraine on Sunday, according to a report.

Russia's Oleg Anisimov told delegates from 195 nations at the closed-door virtual meeting of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that ""those who know what is happening fail to find any justification for the attack,"" according to AFP.

""Let me present an apology on behalf of all Russians not able to prevent this conflict,"" he told the government ministers and scientists participating in the meeting.

Anisimov spoke in Russian after the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Svitlana Krakovska, spoke passionately about Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion.

""We will not surrender in Ukraine, and we hope the world will not surrender in building a climate resilient future,"" she reportedly said in English.

""Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots — fossil fuels — and our dependence on them,"" she added.

A source who attended the meeting told AFP ""everyone 'in the room' was really moved"" by Krakovska's message.

Delegates were surprised when the Russian Anisimov expressed ""huge admiration"" for the Ukrainian delegation.

""He knows that there is a risk for him, it was a very sincere message,"" said another participant, according to AFP.

Reached for comment, Anisimov told AFP his statements ""expressed my personal opinion and attitude,"" and should not be taken as an ""official statement of the Russian delegation.""

U.N. delegates on the IPCC had gathered to finalize a major assessment of how climate change could impact the world over the next few decades. Anisimov, a scientist and longtime Russian delegate to the IPCC, has previously been the lead author on many IPCC climate reports.

Anisimov's dissenting comments on the unprovoked war come as hundreds of anti-war activists in Russia are protesting against Putin's government, often at risk of arrest. The protests began Thursday, when Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, sea, and air.

Russian police have begun to crack down on the protests in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to the Associated Press. The Kremlin is issuing propaganda to downplay opposition to the war, but in addition to street protests, tens of thousands of people have endorsed open letters and signed petitions condemning the invasion. Celebrities, athletes, and famous TV personalities have spoken out against the war too.

Russian government officials have attacked opponents of the war. The speaker of Russia's lower house of Parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said recently that the anti-war position of ""certain cultural figures"" was ""inappropriate"" and ""nothing short of betrayal of your own people.""

It is difficult to ascertain the extent of the anti-war sentiment in Russia because Putin's tyrannical regime has restricted access to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, police are swiftly ending anti-war demonstrations, and state-run Russian media propagandizes for the government.

Russian oil revenues up 50% as Western sanctions on oil exports prove ineffective,"Russian oil revenues have risen by 50% since the beginning of the year despite Western nations attempting to isolate and weaken the Russian economy.

The Epoch Times reported that a new report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that the Russian Federation had earned about $20 billion each month in 2022. Russian oil producers sold roughly eight million barrels of oil per day.

Russian oil companies were able to achieve this feat largely because Western nations were unable to come to a consensus on isolating Russia’s oil industry in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

While the U.S. sanctioned Russian oil in early March, the European Union (EU) and its member states were unable to reach a unanimous agreement to ban the import of Russian oil by member nations. About two-thirds of the oil imported by EU member states comes from Russia, so the continued import of this oil, despite thorough sanctions on other sectors of the Russian economy, continues to provide Russia with a vital lifeline.

The European bloc continues to be the largest consumer of Russian oil. Despite the EU member nations presenting themselves as united in diplomatic and economic opposition to the Russian regime, they account for roughly 43% of all Russian oil exported in April.

Last March, economist Elana Ribakova suggested there might be a latent paradox that could arise should Western nations move to sanction Russian oil. Ribakova indicated that, in theory, imposing sanctions on Russia, which is one of the world’s leading exporters of natural gas and petroleum, would cause a scarcity of oil-based resources, causing prices to rise. These rising prices would in turn present Russia with an opportunity to collect higher revenues through exporting the products to countries not sanctioning the industry, thus rendering any sanctioning regime’s attempts counterproductive.

In early March Ribakova said, “10$ on oil price gives Russia [about] $20 [billion] of current account inflows per year. With imports collapsing[,] Russia’s 2022 current account could exceed $200 billion. Despite ~40% of $640 [billion] [Bank of Russia] reserves arrested, Russia could rebuild buffers from the current account surplus.”

Countries like China and India have not shied away from purchasing Russian fuel since the Ukraine invasion commenced, and with some EU member states continuing to import Russian oil, Russia will likely survive any current and future sanction packages that don’t affect its ability to export oil.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-oil-revenues-up-50-as-western-sanctions-on-oil-exports-prove-ineffective,2022-05-17
Russian president turned Putin aide issues ominous warning to US: We possess the might to put you in your place,"Former Russian president turned Putin aide Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia has the ""might"" to put the U.S. in its place after accusing the Western country of trying to stoke ""disgusting"" Russophobia amid the ongoing Russian invasion.

What are the details?

According to a Thursday report from Reuters, Medvedev, who served as president of Russia from 2008 to 2012 and who currently serves as deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said that the U.S. was guilty of spreading Russophobia in an apparent attempt to cause strife in the communist country.

""It will not work,"" he warned. ""Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place.""

What else?

In February, Medvedev took a swipe at President Joe Biden and said that weak U.S. sanctions only demonstrated the country's ""political impotence,"" prompting an overall anti-Western sentiment.

“We are being driven out of everywhere, punished and threatened, but we don’t feel scared,” he said according to reports, going on to mock the sanctions as weak theater to make up for previous ""shameful decisions"" such as the U.S.'s ""cowardly retreat from Afghanistan.""

Russia has insisted that despite sanctions against the country, it can rise up and form alliances with other world powers — including China. China, however, has thus far avoided publicly committing military aid to Russia.

Russian forces continue to march toward Ukrainian capital Kyiv as the invasion enters its fourth week, ushering in a relentless barrage of violence and destruction.

According to a Thursday report from CNN, the head of the Chernihiv region — which is northeast of Kyiv and near the Russian border — said that Chernihiv city continues “suffering great losses.”

The U.N. Security Council is set to hold a meeting on Thursday concerning the ongoing humanitarian crisis that is continuing to develop across the war-torn country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday also addressed German lawmakers, pointing out similarities between the Cold War's Berlin Wall and the current climate in Ukraine and blasting the country for what he said was a failure to help Ukraine.

Zelenskyy added that Berlin needs to stop buying Russian oil and gas in order to help drain the Russian government's access to war money, but the country has said that it has no alternative but to continue relying on Russian energy sources.

“After 80 years, something like this happens and I am telling you: Every year politicians repeat the words ‘never again’ and now we see that these words are simply worth nothing,"" he said in his address. ""In Europe a people is being destroyed. There is an attempt to destroy everything that is dear to us.""

He added, “The world may not have seen so clearly yet, but you are separated from us by a kind of wall. Not a Berlin Wall, but a wall in the middle of Europe between freedom and a lack thereof. And this wall is getting taller with every bomb that falls on Ukraine. With every decision that is not made for peace.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-president-turned-putin-aide-issues-ominous-warning-to-us,2022-03-17
Russian prosecutors reportedly threaten to arrest executives and seize the assets of Western companies seeking to leave Russia,"Russian prosecutors are threatening to arrest executives and seize the assets of Western companies in Russia.

Companies with corporate leaders who criticize the Russian government or threaten to withdraw their business from the country in accordance with Western sanctions run the risk of coming into conflict with Russian prosecutors.

American corporations including Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, IBM, and Yum Brands received stern warnings from prosecutors in Russia. They received phone calls, letters, and physical confrontations where prosecutors threatened to seize company assets, including trademarks, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin also expressed support last week for a new law that would nationalize the assets of foreign companies that leave Russia in response to Western sanctions levied upon the country after it invaded Ukraine.

The Russian government’s approach to preventing businesses from leaving has led to some companies limiting communications with their Russian counterparts out of concern that their communications were being monitored.

Other companies have begun working to move their executives out of Russia.

The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., took to Twitter to refute the claim that its government was either seizing assets or arresting executives.

The embassy said, “The decision whether to continue entrepreneurial activity in our country is entirely up to the Americans. As well as the right to ignore Russophobic hysteria that encourages foreign businesses to suffer huge losses in order to hit Russia.”

The alleged threats to arrest company executives and seize assets reportedly came in response to Western sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions have debilitated the Russian economy.

In late February, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement calling for the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT telecommunications network.

In doing so, Western leaders committed to “imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”

This and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT network make it incredibly difficult for Russia to participate in international trade and keep its economy afloat.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent Western sanctions, compelled many international corporations to reconsider their business relationships and practices within Russia.

Financial sector giants Visa and Mastercard severed their ties with the Russian market, subsequently making all Russian-issued Visa and Mastercard bank and credit cards useless; the British Petroleum Company liquidated its holdings in the Russian energy sector and ended its long-standing business relationships; McDonald’s and PepsiCo proceeded to end their operations in Russia; and Disney opted to halt film releases in the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-prosecutors-reportedly-threaten-to-arrest-executives-and-seize-the-assets-of-western-companies-seeking-to-leave-russia,2022-03-14
"Russian ruble craters to less than 1 US cent, stock market freezes after Russia's removal from global banking system","New financial penalties levied on Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine appeared to hit the country's economy hard on Monday as Russia's currency cratered to a record low value and its stock market froze.

What are the details?

The Russian ruble's value plummeted to less than one U.S. cent on Monday, Time reported, dropping more than 25% to 105.27 per U.S. dollar, down from approximately 84 per dollar late Friday.

After initially declining to do so, the U.S., Japan, and several European nations on Saturday agreed to enact more severe sanctions on Russia as its forces continued an assault on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in an attempt to overthrow the government.

The group of nations went after central bank reserves that underpin Russia's economy and removed several key Russian banks from SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a vital international banking system.

Time noted the ruble's calamitous decline would likely send inflation soaring, a development that would hurt all Russians and not just the elites who were targeted in earlier sanctions.

Critics had called for the forceful move to be enacted immediately upon Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Western leaders initially balked. Even now, Time noted that the disconnection from SWIFT is ""partial,"" leaving room for the U.S. and Europe to escalate penalties.

Yet the effects are reportedly being felt already, as Russian residents rushed to ATMs to withdraw cash amid the ruble's free fall.

What else?

In addition to the currency plunge, the Russian stock market also took a major hit on Monday. According to the New York Times, officials closed the Moscow stock exchange for the day, citing the ""developing situation.""

""The economic reality has, of course, changed,"" the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reportedly told members of the press while announcing that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an emergency meeting with top finance officials.

Western restrictions effectively have placed a chokehold on the Kremlin's ability to access its war chest of financial reserves and sent to the country careening towards an economic crisis. At the very least, the world intends to financially isolate Russia in a way not experienced since the Cold War.

""Putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy Ukraine, but what he is also doing, in fact, is destroying the future of his own country,"" European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday.

Anything else?

Yet even as Russia's economy faced significant distress and delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Belarus for peace talks, the Russian offensive showed no signs of letting up.

Ukrainian officials claimed Monday that an air raid on residential areas in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, left dozens of people dead, including several civilians.

Russian star soprano won't repudiate support for Vladimir Putin.

What are the details?

“It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,” Met General Manager Peter Gelb said in a statement Thursday, the AP noted. “Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward.”

Gelb said Sunday that the Met would not engage artists who back Putin, the outlet added.

The Met made repeated efforts to convince Netrebko, 50, to repudiate her support for Putin but couldn't persuade her, according to an individual familiar with the situation who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because that detail wasn't announced.

Netrebko was to perform in Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot” in the spring and Giuseppe Verdi’s “Don Carlo” next season, the New York Post reported, adding that Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska is slated to replace her in both productions.

The developments followed the international career implosion of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who has been close to Putin as artistic and general director of the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, the AP said.

Russia's invasion has resulted in a striking show of solidarity with Ukraine among members of the arts and culture world, as well as those in thesports world; it also has resulted in backlash against Russia and those who won't denounce Putin, the AP said.

Netrebko, who hails from Krasnodar, received the People’s Artist of Russia honor from Putin in 2008, the outlet noted.

Anything else?

Netrebko withdrew from all her upcoming performances, the AP said, adding that her next listed performance was April 3 at Barcelona’s Gran Teatre del Liceu followed by three concerts with her husband — Azerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov — and an April 13 concert with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

“I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression, and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now, to save all of us. We need peace right now,” Netrebko said, according to the AP. “This is not a time for me to make music and perform. I have therefore decided to take a step back from performing for the time being. It is an extremely difficult decision for me, but I know that my audience will understand and respect this decision.”

The outlet said Netrebko didn't immediately respond to Gelb’s announcement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-star-soprano-wont-repudiate-support-for-vladimir-putin-now-shes-gone-from-ny-metropolitan-opera,2022-03-04
Russian troops enter Ukrainian capital; officials tell residents to stay indoors and 'prepare Molotov cocktails' to defend the city,"Russian troops moved into Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, on Friday as officials urged residents to stay indoors and ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend against the advancing enemy force, the New York Times reported.

What are the details?

Kyiv entered into a defensive phase on the second day of fighting since Russia's unprovoked invasion of its neighboring country. Air raid sirens continued to blare as Russian missiles pounded the city and residents took cover in subway stations and other makeshift shelters, Reuters reported.

Russia claimed to have captured an airport in Hostomel, just northwest of the capital, on Thursday, after fierce fighting. The airport will likely serve as a strategic staging post to launch attacks on the city.

In a tweet, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense indicated that a Russian ground presence had reached Obolon, a northern district of Kyiv. It is the closest the Russian military has been to Ukraine's capital thus far. In an attempt to stymie the advance, the Ukrainian government reportedly destroyed three bridges to the north of the capital.

The Ukrainian government has urged its residents on numerous occasions to stand fast against the encroaching enemy. In a pair of tweets on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared that he would ""give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country,"" adding, ""Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

But at the same time, Ukraine is eager for an end to the bloody conflict, the likes of which Europe hasn't seen since World War II.

As its forces advanced, Russia surprisingly signaled it may be open to talks with the Ukrainian government, though the reported conditions are strict. The Kremlin said it would agree to send a delegation to Minsk for negotiations, but warned that any agreement would be based on ""demilitarization"" and neutral status for Ukraine — both of which have previously been red lines for Zelenskyy.

What else?

Ukraine reported that 137 citizens died and another 316 were wounded during the first day of fighting. Based on earlier reports, at least 40 of those who died were soldiers, while up to 10 were civilians.

Early Friday morning, Zelenskyy appeared to criticize Western nations for their military inaction.

""This morning, we are defending our country alone,"" the leader lamented in recorded remarks. ""Just like yesterday, the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance. Russia was hit with sanctions yesterday, but these are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.""

""Who is ready to fight with us?"" he asked. ""Honestly, I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO?""

""Today, I asked the 27 leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer,"" he continued.

President Biden on Thursday joined a host of NATO allies in announcing further sanctions against Russia for its military assault. But it remains unclear when, or even if, the economic penalties will force Russia to back down.

In response to pressing from reporters on the need for more urgent action, Biden insisted that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the sanctions are ""working.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-troops-enter-ukrainian-capital-prepare-molotov-cocktails,2022-02-25
Russian TV channel condemns war as staff walk out while live on air,"Staff at an independent Russian television station signed off their final broadcast by decrying war and walking out of the studio in protest.

According to a report from Newsweek, Russian authorities ordered the station to cease broadcasting over its coverage of the country's invasion of Ukraine. The reported noted that Russian authorities demanded media refrain from referring to President Vladimir Putin's invasion as a ""war"" and instead insisted they use the term ""special military operation."" Those in violation of the newly authorized law face up to 15 years in prison.

Station staffers signed off their final show on Thursday and walked out of the studio

""No to war,"" Natalia Sindeyeva, the station's general director, said on Thursday as staff left the studio and made the decision to air Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake,"" which according to the report, ""was aired on Soviet state TV during the collapse of the Soviet Union.""

""We need strength to exhale and understand how to work further,"" Sindeyeva said in a statement shared on the channel's website. ""We really hope that we will return to the air and continue our work.""

Ukraine News UK tweeted video footage of the walkout and captioned it, ""The Entire staff of the Russian TV channel 'the rain' resigned during a live stream with last words: 'no war' and then played 'swan lake' ballet video (just like they did on all USSR tv channels when it suddenly collapsed).""

Independent Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy this week also shut down.



""The Ekho Moskvy board of directors has decided by a majority of votes to liquidate the radio channel and the website of Ekho Moskvy,"" editor in chief Alexei Venediktov said in a statement on the closure.

Russia's prosecutor general in a statement said that such ""fake news"" — or ""information known to be false regarding the actions of Russian servicemen"" as ""part of a special operation to protect the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic"" is illegal and will not be tolerated.

"Russian vodka boycott in Texas, Ohio and Canada","Numerous countries, including the United States, have launched sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Now, there will be local and state boycotts on one of Russia's most iconic exports – vodka.

In Canada, Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy ordered the provincial Liquor Control Board of Ontario to have stores remove vodka and other alcoholic products from Russia.

""Ontario joins Canada’s allies in condemning the Russian government’s act of aggression against the Ukrainian people, and will direct the LCBO to withdraw all products produced in Russia from store shelves,"" tweeted on Friday with the hashtag #StandwithUkraine.

""Ontario and the LCBO can’t say it’s truly standing with Ukraine while continuing to be Putin’s customer,"" said Steven Del Duca, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, according to Fox News.



Russian products will be removed from nearly 700 stores across Ontario.

Canada's Newfoundland Labrador Liquor Corporation (NLC) also declared that it would yank Russian products off the shelves.

""The Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation, along with other Liquor jurisdictions throughout Canada, has made the decision to remove products of Russian origin from its shelves. These include Russian Standard Vodka and Russian Standard Platinum Vodka,"" the NLC Liquor Store wrote on Twitter.

In the United States, liquor stores and bars in Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, and Vermont plan on removing bottles of Russian vodka from their shelves as a ""protest against the aggression,"" according to The Hill. The stores also planned on promoting Ukrainian vodka more prominently.

Virginia State Sen. L. Louise Lucas (D) called on Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) to ""order the removal of all Russian vodka and any other Russian products from our ABC stores immediately.""

On Saturday, Gov. Mike DeWine (R) directed the Ohio Department of Commerce to ""cease both the purchase and sale of all vodka made by Russian Standard, the only overseas, Russian-owned distillery with vodka sold in Ohio.""

The Ohio Division of Liquor Control estimates that there are roughly 6,400 bottles of vodka made by Russian Standard currently for sale in Ohio's 487 liquor agencies across the state.

DeWine also said that retailers had been asked to immediately take Russian vodkas from their shelves.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested retailers in the Lone Star state to voluntarily remove all Russian products from their stores as a protest against Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

""I've asked the members of the Texas Restaurant Association, Texas Package Stores Association & all Texas retailers to voluntarily remove all Russian products from their shelves.

Report: Sky News reporter ambushed and shot by Russian troops while covering Ukraine invasion,"A Sky News correspondent was shot while covering Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to reports.

What are the details?

Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsey said that Russian attackers fired on him and his team as they tried to leave the Kyiv area on Monday.

According to a report from the New York Post, Ramsey said that he and his team of five heard an explosion and felt a tire on the vehicle they were traveling in begin to pop and sag.

As the vehicle rolled to a stop, he said, bullets began raining down on the vehicle's windshield, forcing the team to cower in fear.

""We were under full attack,"" he said. ""Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel and dashboard had disintegrated. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car — they didn't miss.""

Ramsey said that he and his team screamed that they were journalists, but the bullets kept on coming.

The report added that Ramsey attempted to flee from the vehicle, and began running toward a nearby embankment for shelter when he was struck in his lower back by a bullet.

One of Ramsey's camera operators, too, was struck by gunfire.

""Our world turned upside down,"" Ramsey said of the incident. ""I do recall wondering if my death was going to be painful.""

Ramsey said that he and his team were able to make it to the embankment despite the injuries and were able to gain entry to a nearby building where they awaited rescue.

""The five of us were alive,"" he recalled. ""We couldn't believe it.""

Ramsey added, ""We were very lucky. But thousands of Ukrainians are dying, and families are being targeted by Russian hit squads just as we were, driving along in a family saloon and attacked. This war gets worse by the day.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russians-targeting-on-scene-journalists-with-their-bullets-report,2022-03-05
"Sally Field rails against abortion laws, DeSantis, Abbott","Hollywood actress and activist Sally Field is so upset with recent abortion laws passed in Texas and Florida that she is warning the governors of those states to steer clear of her because – in her own words – she said, ""I cannot be responsible for what I would do."" Field gave an interview to Variety last week, and claimed that states like Texas and Florida have passed ""criminal"" legislation on abortions.

The interviewer asked Field about her ""social activism"" and how she is ""politically engaged."" The interviewer brought up how Field has been an ""advocate for LGBTQ rights, speaking up about the AIDS crisis, climate change, nuclear weapons,"" and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Field noted she is an activist to a ""degree,"" but said she is not as die-hard of a political activist as her friend and far-left actress Jane Fonda.

The two-time Academy Award-winning actress recalls how Fonda and she participated in a climate change demonstration on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol and was arrested, which Field described as ""fun.""

During the interview, Field's 2018 memoir ""In Pieces"" was mentioned.

When the autobiography was released, The Hollywood Reporter said of the memoir, ""Fields writes that she had her own 'sexual awakening' in high school, leading to a secret abortion she got in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old.""

Field had an abortion in 1964 — nine years before the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.

The Variety interviewer asked the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" star, ""In your autobiography, you wrote about going to Tijuana when you were 17 to get an abortion. What do you think of these abortion bans in Texas and other states like Florida?""



Field responded, ""Those men who are doing that, and they're mostly male governors who are doing it, are so backward, so ignorant and really just power-hungry. I think it's criminal.""

""They're so wanting to roll back the achievements and important progress for women, for Blacks, for the LGBTQ community,"" the ""Forest Gump"" actress claimed. ""I can't say enough horrible things about what I feel about those men.""

Field then took aim on the governors of Texas and Florida for recent abortion laws.

Last May, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law the pro-life Texas Heartbeat Act that prohibits physicians from ""knowingly perform[ing] or induce[ing] an abortion on a pregnant woman if the physician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child ... or failed to perform a test to detect a fetal heartbeat.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis plans to sign a ban on abortions after 15 weeks to protect unborn babies.

The 75-year-old actress issued a veiled threat to the governors of Florida and Texas.

""If you see them coming toward me, those two governors specifically [Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis], lead me out of the way because I cannot be responsible for what I would do. Heidi [she addresses her publicist, who is in the room], do you hear me?

Sam Harris responds to online furor over his argument that the media should have covered up Hunter Biden laptop story,"An atheist podcast known for criticizing Christianity and Islam responded to a social media furor over his comments, arguing that the media should have covered up the Hunter Biden laptop story.

Harris made the comments while a guest on the ""TRIGGERnometry"" show, which is sponsored by the Epoch Times. He argued that the media created Trump and that news outlets had a responsibility to help keep the former president from power, even to the point of obscuring the truth.

""Listen, I don't care what's in Hunter Biden's laptop, I mean, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in his basement, I would not have cared,"" he declared.

""Whatever scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, if we could just go down that rabbit hole endlessly and understand that he's getting kickbacks from Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine or wherever else, right, or China, it is infinitesimal compared to the corruption we know Trump is involved in,"" Harris explained.

""It's like a firefly to the sun, right?"" he added.

Harris went on to say that that the media trying to shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story was a ""leftwing conspiracy to deny the presidency to Donald Trump,"" and added, ""Absolutely it was, absolutely, right. But I think it was warranted.""

When one of the show's hosts pressed him about his statement, Harris said it didn't matter because Trump was such a great threat.

""If there was an asteroid hurdling toward Earth, and we got in a room together with all of our friends and had a conversation about what we could do to deflect its course – is that a conspiracy? Some of that conversation would be in public, some of it would be in private. We have a massive problem. We have an existential threat, right?"" Harris explained.

""Politically speaking, I consider Donald Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy,"" he concluded.

Many saw the admission as an insight into the thinking of many in the media and popular culture when it comes to feigning objectivity about political stories that might be damaging to President Joe Biden.

'I was speaking narrowly'

Harris later explained on Twitter that he thought people were misunderstanding his claims.

""There is a podcast clip circulating that seems to be confusing many people about my views on Trump (which is understandable because I wasn’t speaking very clearly). So, for what it’s worth, here is what I was trying to say,"" tweeted Harris.

""I was essentially arguing for a principle of self-defense (where there’s a continuum of proportionate force that is appropriate and necessary to use). I’ve always viewed Trump as a very dangerous person to elect as president of a fake university,"" he argued, ""let alone the US, and when he became a sitting president who would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, I viewed him as more dangerous still. (However, I’ve never been under any illusion that he is Orange Hitler.)""

He went on to tweet that he was speaking narrowly about whether the media should have ignored the laptop story until after the election.

""Nothing I said on that podcast was meant to suggest that the Democrats would have been right to commit election fraud or take other illegal measures to deny Trump the presidency (nor do I think they did that),"" he concluded.

Harris spoke on other topics during the podcast, including tribalism and how many people on the left exaggerate how many white officers shoot and kill unarmed black men in the United States.

"San Francisco Federal Reserve undercuts Biden's narrative on inflation — and no, it's not Putin's fault","The San Francisco Federal Reserve published a study this week that appeared to contradict President Joe Biden's narrative about inflation.

What is the background?

Americans are battling historic inflation and growing economic woes that appear to have no end in sight. In fact, the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the consumer price index has increased 7.9% over the past 12 months.

Unfortunately, the buck does not stop with Biden. The president has blamed inflation and other economic problems on COVID-19, the supply chain, and even Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.

What does the report say?

The study sought to understand why U.S. inflation is increasing at a much higher rate than other advanced economic countries.

The reason? The economists pointed toward COVID-19 relief bills, which pumped the economy, and Americans' pockets, full of income. In fact, they argued the stimulus bills account for about 3% of inflation.

""Since the first half of 2021, U.S. inflation has increasingly outpaced inflation in other developed countries,"" the study said.

""Estimates suggest that fiscal support measures designed to counteract the severity of the pandemic’s economic effect may have contributed to this divergence by raising inflation about 3 percentage points by the end of 2021,"" the bankers explained.

Without the massive COVID relief bills, the economists suggested the U.S. could have experienced deflation, which has benefits and drawbacks. Still, they argued the impacts of deflation ""would have been harder to manage,"" a comment that should be taken with a grain of salt considering the government is having a difficult time managing the inflation crisis.

Importantly, the study failed to conclude that Putin is to blame for inflation.

Anything else?

Because of inflation, Americans will spend approximately $5,200 more than last year, Bloomberg reported.

Inflation will mean the average U.S. household has to spend an extra $5,200 this year ($433 per month) compared to last year for the same consumption basket, according estimates by Bloomberg Economics. The excess savings built up over the pandemic, and increases in wages, will cushion those costs, and allow spending to expand at a decent pace this year. But accelerated depletion of savings will increase the urgency for those staying on the sidelines to join the labor force, and the resulting increase in labor supply will likely dampen wage growth.

According to a recent NBC poll, a ""plurality of Americans"" blame Biden and his policies for inflation, while they overwhelmingly reject Russia's culpability for America's economic woes, NBC News reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-fran-federal-reserve-undercuts-biden-s-narrative-on-inflation,2022-03-30
Saudi oil giant Aramco reported record first-quarter profits as oil prices soar around the globe,"The Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported more than an 80% jump in net profit on Sunday setting a new quarterly earnings record for the company.

The oil producing behemoth said that its net income rose 82% to $39.5 billion in the first three months of 2022. CNBC reported that this is up from $21.7 billion over the same period in 2021.

The company’s income to date obliterates forecasts by economic experts, as well. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast Aramco’s income to be $38.5 billion.

The record quarter income for Aramco comes as companies throughout the oil industry are experiencing windfall profits from sharp rises in oil and gas prices. Aramco said that its earnings were largely driven by higher crude oil prices which in turn caused increasing volumes of product to be sold as downstream margins improved.

In the Sunday earnings release, Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser said, “During the first quarter, our strategic downstream expansion progressed further in both Asia and Europe, and we continue to develop opportunities that complement our growth objectives. Against the backdrop of increased volatility in global markets, we remain focused on helping meet the world’s demand for energy that is reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable.”

Now with a market cap around $2.43 trillion, Aramco has surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company in the world.

Aramco’s stock is up more than 15% so far in 2022 amid widespread market selloffs. In March, the oil giant reported that its full-year profits from 2021 more than doubled due to the ongoing rise in global oil prices that has now been greatly exasperated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

As member states in the European Union and the United States look for alternatives to Russian oil Aramco has the opportunity to corner the Western oil market.

In early May, the European Union planned on moving forward with issuing additional sanctions against Russia. In order for the European Union to implement sanctions, all of its 27 member states must agree to enforce them in their respective nations.

An embargo of Russian oil by the European Union would dramatically increase tensions between the European Union’s member states and Russia as the member nations would subsequently isolate the nation from which they import almost two-thirds of their oil.

Ultimately, the European Union member states failed to reach a unanimous consensus on banning the import of Russian oil. Hungary was the sole dissenter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-reported-record-first-quarter-profits-as-oil-prices-soar-around-the-globe,2022-05-15
"Schiff claims that if President Trump is not removed from office by impeachment, Americans can't trust the results of the 2020 election","During opening arguments of the Senate's impeachment trial on Wednesday, lead House manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said that, without impeachment, Americans would not be able to trust the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

""The House did not take this extraordinarily step lightly,"" Schiff told the Senate of the decision to impeach President Donald Trump. ""Impeachment exists for cases in which the conduct of the president rises beyond mere policy disputes to be decided otherwise, and without urgency at the ballot box.""

Schiff then accused President Trump of ""an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election"" in the dealings with Ukrainian officials described in the House's impeachment articles.

""For precisely this reason, the president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won,"" Schiff added.



""In corruptly using his office to gain a political advantage,"" Schiff continued, ""in abusing the powers of that office in such a way to jeopardize our national security and the integrity of our elections, in obstructing the investigation into his own wrongdoing, the president has shown that he believes that he is above the law.""

Last month, the House approved two articles of impeachment against President Trump, one accusing him of abusing the power of his office with the suspension of military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine, and the other accusing him of obstructing Congress' investigation into the former matter.

Schiff also pushed back on the idea that the House's obstruction claims — which stem from the White House's refusal to cooperate on providing witnesses and documents the investigation — should be decided in the courts because the time necessary for litigation ""would provide the president with an opportunity to continue his misconduct.""



Elsewhere in his remarks, Schiff said that if Trump were not convicted by the Senate and removed from office over the impeachment articles, the ""abuse of his office and obstruction of Congress will permanently alter the balance of power among our branches of government.""

Schiff's remarks Wednesday about the legitimacy of the upcoming election echo comments he made in December when he said, ""The president's misconduct goes to the heart of whether we can conduct a free and fair election in 2020.""

"Schiff, Democrats release impeachment probe report accusing Trump of misconduct","On Tuesday afternoon, the House Intelligence Committee released its report on the impeachment probe that's dominated much of the discussion in Washington for months now.

The 300-page document — which was publicly released on the same day the Intelligence Committee was scheduled to vote on it and a day before the House Judiciary Committee's first public impeachment hearing — accuses the president of engaging in misconduct with regard to Ukrainian foreign aid, that he obstructed the subsequent House investigation of his conduct, and that he ""publicly attacked and intimidated witnesses"" who came forward to testify in the probe.

In a statement accompanying the release of the report — which was prepared by Democratic congressional staff — Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), along with Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Elliot Engel (D-N.Y.), said that the ""evidence is clear"" that the president ""used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations"" that were ""designed to benefit his 2020 presidential reelection campaign,"" that he ""conditioned official acts on the public announcement of these investigations,"" and that he ""engaged in categorical and unprecedented obstruction in order to cover-up his misconduct.""

The trio's statement went on to say, ""It will be up to the Congress to determine whether these acts rise to the level of an impeachable offense, whether the President shall be held to account, and whether we as a nation are committed to the rule of law.""

At a Tuesday press conference about the report, Schiff declined to say whether or not he supports impeaching the president, but did say that he is ""gravely concerned that if we merely accept this, that we invite not only further corruption of our elections by this president, but we also invite it of the next president.""

Much of the report deals with information already publicly known from the course of the investigation, with the notable exception of records of April phone calls between House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Guiliani, as well as the Guiliani's associate, Lev Parnas, who has since been indicted on campaign finance charges. Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, responded to the released records on Twitter saying that Nunes should have recused himself from the investigation.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham responded to the release of the report with a statement, saying, ""Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump. This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff's report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.""

"Schiff makes up fictional version of Trump-Ukraine call at hearing, later says it was 'parody'","A day after President Donald Trump released the transcript of a phone call with the president of the Ukraine at the center of Washington's latest impeachment drama, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) decided to offer his own version of events.

As part of his opening statement at a House Intelligence Committee hearing regarding the whistleblower's complaint behind the phone call controversy and featuring testimony from Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, Schiff offered a fictional version of a conversation of the July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Schiff said that the transcript of the July phone conversation between the two world leaders ""reads of like an organized crime shakedown."" He then attempted to offer a summary of the conversation that was ""Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words"":

We've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what, I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though, and I'm going to say this only seven times so you better listen good.



I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it. On this and on that. I'm going to put you in touch with people, and not just any people: I'm going to put you in touch with Attorney General of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr. He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him and I'm going to put you in touch with Rudy [Giuliani]; you're going to love him, trust me.



You know what I'm asking, so I'm only going to say this a few more times in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again; I'll call you when you've done what I've asked.

Schiff went on to call his characterization ""in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate.""

Here's video of the statement:

The transcript of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky was released Wednesday amid a flurry of calls for impeachment from Democrats. The document outlined a conversation in which the two world leaders discussed a variety of issues but did not show Trump making any quid pro quo offer or demand on investigating matters related to former Vice President Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden.

The current controversy centers on President Trump's request that Zelensky look into an investigation of a Ukrainian natural gas company that employed Hunter Biden as a board member.

Here's the transcript section where Trump discusses the Bidens:

Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great … The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

Later in the hearing, Schiff's opening statement was criticized by Republican committee member Mike Turner (Ohio), who said that, while the transcript of the Ukrainian phone call was ""not OK,"" it was also ""not the conversation that was in the chairman's opening statement.""

Schiff responded to Turner's criticism that his ""summary of the president's call was meant to be, at least part, in parody"" and added ""the fact that that's not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.""

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, conceded Sunday that he should have been ""more clear"" about his committee's contact with the whistleblower who raised concerns about President Donald Trump's July 25 call with the president of Ukraine.

Last month, Schiff said neither he nor his committee had contact with the whistleblower. He also said that he might never have found out about the whistleblower complaint if the Intelligence Committee inspector general had not brought it to the committee's attention.

These two statements, were, of course, not true at all.

In reality, the whistleblower spoke with Intelligence Committee staff before filing the complaint, seeking advice on how to proceed, and Schiff was made aware of the nature of the complaint before it was filed.

Schiff's defense for the falsehoods is essentially that everyone else simply misunderstood his answer.

""Do you regret saying that we—the committee—weren't in touch with the whistleblower?"" asked ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan.

""I should have been much more clear,"" Schiff replied. ""I said so the minute it was brought to my attention that I was referring to the fact that, when the whistleblower filed the complaint, we had not heard from the whistleblower. We wanted to bring the whistleblower in at that time, but I should have been much more clear.""

Rep. Adam Schiff says he ""should have been more clear"" about staffer's contact with whistleblower youtu.be

It wasn't that we hadn't heard from the whistleblower at all, Schiff is saying, it's just that we hadn't literally brought the whistleblower in for a face-to-face.

The revelation that the House Intelligence Committee knew about the complaint before it was filed has led to accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that Schiff influenced, or even helped write, the complaint upon which the Democrats' are basing their impeachment inquiry.

""It shows that Schiff is a fraud. ... I think it's a scandal that he knew before,"" Trump said, according to Fox News. ""I'd go a step further. I'd say he probably helped write it. ... That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It's a scam.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/schiff-on-second-thought-i-shouldnt-have-misled-everyone-over-our-contact-with-the-whistleblower,2019-10-13
Schiff says calling Hunter Biden would be 'an illegitimate abuse' of the Senate's impeachment trial,"The House's top impeachment prosecutor said this week that calling in Hunter Biden to testify as a witness during the Senate's impeachment trial would constitute ""an illegitimate abuse"" of the process.

In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" that was posted Tuesday morning, House Intelligence Committee Chairman and lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said that, while it would only be fair for the president to be able to call witnesses, calling Biden would be a political effort immaterial to the case.

""It would certainly be fair for the president and his team to be able to call witnesses that can provide material information on the charges,"" Schiff told the network. ""It would not be appropriate for the president to seek to call witnesses merely to try to perpetuate the same smear campaign that was foiled when his plot was discovered.""

The scandal that precipitated the impeachment process, however, initially began with questions of Hunter Biden's employment as a board member at the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, while his father, Joe Biden, was vice president and handling Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

In case anyone forgot, Joe Biden once admitted to pressuring Ukraine's former president to fire the country's Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was leading an investigation into Burisma Holdings. That vignette came up during the now-infamous July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which was the subject of the whistleblower's complaint that triggered the House's impeachment probe.

But despite the role of his business dealings in the origins of the trial, Schiff told CBS that Hunter Biden ""can't tell us anything about whether the president withheld military aid, whether he withheld that aid to coerce Ukraine to conduct political investigations. Or why he wouldn't meet with the president of Ukraine.""

He added that the ""only purpose in putting him on their list is they wish to trade material witnesses ... for immaterial ones that will allow them to continue to attack a political opponent.""

As to which witnesses are actually relevant to the impeachment case, Schiff said, may end up falling to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial.

""That's an illegitimate abuse of the trial,"" Schiff said. ""And the chief justice, who may have an opportunity to rule on materiality of witnesses, as well as the senators, should not permit that kind of abuse.""

Bombshell report: Schiff may have hidden 'potentially exculpatory' evidence from Trump's lawyers,"According to President Donald Trump's legal team, Democrats are concealing the testimony of a major witness the House questioned during its investigation into the Ukraine matter.

Alex Swoyer and S.A. Miller at the Washington Times reported that House Democrats are refusing to disclose the testimony of Michael Atkinson, the intelligence agency inspector general with firsthand knowledge of the origins of the whistleblower complaint that resulted in Trump's impeachment.

'It raises credibility issues'

At least one Republican who was present during Atkinson's testimony says the reason why Democrats are not sharing the information is because it does not advance House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's impeachment case against the president.

""The reason it hasn't been released is it's not helpful to Adam Schiff. It is not helpful to the whistleblower,"" Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) said. ""It raises credibility issues about both of them.""

The Times also noted that the evidence may be ""potentially exculpatory"" for the president. However, members of the House Intelligence Committee who conducted the interview are not allowed to disclose the details of the discussion, as it could reveal potentially sensitive intelligence information.

Should be part of the Senate record

Republicans on the committee believe that Atkinson's testimony should be part of the Senate trial record.

""It addresses the issue about contacts between Schiff, his staff and the whistleblower, and what the inspector general knows about that. So those are material facts that should be talked about, but Adam Schiff has prevented that,"" Ratcliffe told The Washington Times.

Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst agrees with Ratcliffe and maintains that House Democrats should have submitted the transcript to the Senate for its impeachment trial.

""We should be allowed to take a look at that, but again they have stated numerous times in their brief they had overwhelming evidence — it would be so clear to everyone — and I haven't seen that yet,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/schiff_hid_evidence_michael_atkinson,2020-01-26
School district ends requirement that CNN be played in homeroom classes,"Pennsylvania's Norwin School Board released schools from being required to play CNN in district homerooms after some parents argued that the news network was not unbiased in its news delivery.

Enacted, the new policy will permit teachers to use their own discretion and broadcast patriotic videos if they so desire.

What are the details?

On Monday, the board voted 5-4 to end the requirement that district homeroom teachers show students CNN 10 — ""compact on-demand news broadcasts ideal for explanation seekers on the go or in the classroom"" — during the daily 10 minutes of homeroom.

In a statement on the vote, a representative for Norwin School District told Fox News that the formerly mandatory viewing was being sidelined for different homeroom broadcast viewing.

""On February 14, 2022 the Norwin School Board voted and approved the following: To remove watching TV during homeroom at the Middle School unless it is either student, teacher or administrator driven to allow students to socialize and interact with each other,"" the spokesperson said. ""It was further clarified that the board will allow teachers to use discretion and broadcast videos from all sources, including videos pertaining to patriotic holidays.""

According to a report from Norwin Star, such broadcasting includes that which pertains to Veterans Day and more.

What else?



One mother told the Star hat she was concerned that her school was teaching her child that CNN is a ""label you can trust.""

The district mom, the Star reported, said there are ""numerous references by speakers on CNN 10 that recommend the students 'visit our friends on CNN.com.'""

“That is not unbiased,” she added.

According to a recent report from the Washington Free Beacon, recent topics covered by CNN 10 include what is described as ""chimpanzee empathy"" as well as ""Crude oil, gas prices, and inflation are rising: Are they connected?""

During one recent episode, CNN 10's host, Carl Azuz, attributed rising inflation to Russian aggression.

""One big reason is uncertainty about the situation in Ukraine, which we discussed on yesterday's show,"" Azuz said during the broadcast, adding that what ""remains to be seen is whether things will stay that way or normalize in the days ahead.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-district-ends-requirement-that-cnn-be-played-in-homeroom-classes,2022-02-17
‘Off the table’: Schumer torpedoes idea of Biden-Bolton impeachment witness trade,"The Senate's top Democrat said that the prospect of a trade-off agreement on calling Hunter Biden and former White House national security adviser John Bolton as impeachment trial witnesses is a no-go.

Amid the heated Senate debate over calling witnesses Tuesday night, the Washington Post reported that ""several Senate Democrats are privately discussing"" the prospect of such an arrangement and were ""sounding out colleagues on whether to back a witness deal that could lead to testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton or other administration officials with possible firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine controversy.""

However, while briefing reporters during a break from opening arguments in the impeachment trial on Wednesday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that deal just wasn't going to happen.

""That's off the table,"" Schumer said flatly in response to a question posed by Blaze Media. ""First of all, the Republicans have the right to bring in any witness they want. They haven't wanted to and that trade is not on the table.""



Elsewhere in his remarks, Schumer said he hoped that the roughly 2 1/2-hour opening argument given by lead House impeachment manager and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), as well as public pressure on members would motivate Republicans to call for more evidence during the course of the trial.

Republicans have tried to call Hunter Biden — whose past work with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father, Joe, was vice president is at the heart of the impeachment controversy — as an impeachment witness since the matter was being investigated in the House last year. However, those calls were rejected by Schiff, who said this week that calling Biden at this stage of the process would be ""an illegitimate abuse of the trial.""



Like Schumer, Schiff also dismissed the idea of a Biden-Bolton witness compromise on Wednesday, telling reporters, ""This isn't like some fantasy football trade.""

""This isn't 'We'll offer you this if you'll give us that; we'll offer you a witness that is irrelevant in material, who has no relevant testimony, but a witness that will allow us to smear a presidential candidate if you want to get a legitimate witness,'"" Schiff continued. ""That's not a trade. Trials aren't trades for witnesses,""

Similarly, Democrats have repeatedly demanded that Bolton be called to testify in the Senate trial, given the possibility that his testimony from his time at the White House could prove damaging to the president's case. However, he ultimately wasn't compelled to testify during the House investigation after Democrats decided not to take the White House's immunity claims to court on the matter.



Earlier this month, Bolton said that he was prepared to testify if called by the Senate, saying that he had to ""resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/schumer-torpedoes-biden-bolton-impeachment-trade,2020-01-22
'Your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war': Arnold Schwarzenegger appeals to Russian people against the invasion of Ukraine,"Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a video message to the Russian people to appeal to them to not believe war propaganda and reject the invasion of Ukraine.

The video went viral online with more than 11 million views on Twitter.

""I'm speaking to you today because there are things that are going on in the world that are being kept from you, terrible things that you should know about,"" said Schwarzenegger.

He went on to relate his personal ties to Russia and how he grew to respect and love the country since he had been 15 years old.

""I know that your government has told you that this is a war to denazify Ukraine. Denazify Ukraine? This is not true! Ukraine is a country with a Jewish president, a Jewish president I might add, whose father's three brothers were all murdered by the Nazis,"" Schwarzenegger continued.

""You see, Ukraine didn't start this war. Neither did nationalists or Nazis. Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people's war,"" he added.

Schwarzenegger praised the thousands of Russians who risked imprisonment and worse to protest in the streets against the war. He then addressed the Russian soldiers and told them they were being told lies by the Russian government.

""Your lives, your limbs, and your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world,"" Schwarzenegger said.

He also compared the lies of the Russian government to that of the Nazis and talked about how his father felt guilty for fighting on the side of the Nazis.

""He lived the rest of his life in pain,"" Schwarzenegger explained. ""Pain from a broken back. Pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years. And pain from the guilt that he felt.""



22 days since the initial invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military continues to bomb major cities in the former Soviet republic. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the fighting.

Schwarzenegger successfully ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2003 after gaining fame as a Hollywood actor.

Scientists hope to sell vodka made from grain grown in Chernobyl's exclusion zone,"Would you drink anything distilled from crops grown within the exclusion zone surrounding a nuclear waste site? A group of scientists hope so and have created the first bottle of ""Atomik,"" a vodka made from grains cultivated from the Chernobyl disaster area.

What are the details?

The researchers from Britain and Ukraine have launched what they call an ""artisanal"" spirit, which they claim is ""radioactive-free"" or, at least, ""no more radioactive than any other vodka.""

According to the scientists, the purpose of their project is to help restore the region surrounding Chernobyl, which was abandoned following the 1986 meltdown of a nuclear power plant. They say they will give ""75 percent of profits back to the affected community.""

Professor Jim Smith of the University of Portsmouth is part of the effort, and issued a statement in announcing Atomik's launch, saying, ""I think this is the most important bottle of spirits in the world because it could help the economic recovery of communities living in the Zone of Obligatory Resettlement where new investment and use of agricultural land is still forbidden.""

Through the development of the scientists' social enterprise, ""The Chernobyl Spirit Company,"" Professor Smith says, ""We aim to make a high-value product to support economic development of areas outside the main Exclusion Zone where radiation isn't now a significant health risk.""

Sec. Mike Pompeo hits back against House Dems' efforts to 'bully' and 'intimidate' State Dept. officials,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decried a subpoena sent to his department from the House Foreign Affairs Committee as an effort to ""intimidate, bully, & treat improperly"" State Department officials on Tuesday.

In a letter responding to the committee's subpoena, Pompeo told chairman Elliot Engel (D-N.Y.) that he had ""been made aware that Committee staff has been sending intimidating communications to career Department professionals who have specifically asked for Committee communications to be channeled through the Bureau of Legislative Affairs.""

The letter was sent Tuesday in response to the ongoing controversy about President Donald Trump's July phone call with the president of Urkaine.

House Democrats from three committees — Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight — sent the subpoenas for Pompeo and five other State Department officials on Friday, following Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) announcement of an ""official impeachment inquiry"" in the lower chamber. The subpoenas are for documents related to how the State Department worked with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and records involving the phone call. They also notified multiple officials of scheduled depositions.

""Let me be clear,"" Pompeo continued in his letter Tuesday, ""I will not tolerate such tactics and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside the Department of State.""

The letter goes on to list other problems with the committee's request, including the lack of a notice of deposition for its requests, ""a woefully inadequate opportunity for the Department and the requested witnesses to prepare,"" and the committee's apparent intention to not allow State Department legal counsel to participate in the depositions.

Pompeo also suggested that officials currently employed at the State Department would not be testifying, despite the scheduled depositions.

""Your letter implies that you have sought to compel Department officials to appear for depositions on the identified dates,"" the secretary wrote, ""yet the committee has not issued any subpoenas for depositions, and we are not aware of any authority by which the committee could compel appearance at a deposition.""

Pompeo has come under increased scrutiny in the Ukraine call controversy, especially after Monday's report that he was actually on the July 25 phone call himself.

The House Oversight Committee's top Republican, Jim Jordan (Ohio), followed news of Pompeo's letter with a statement citing ""serious concerns about Democrats' targeting of our career foreign policy professionals, which would put our diplomatic interests at risk.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sec-pompeo-hits-back-against-house-dems-efforts-to-bully-and-intimidate-state-dept-officials,2019-10-01
Second intel official may file whistleblower complaint against Trump containing firsthand info,"A second intelligence officer who was alarmed by President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine may soon file a second whistleblower complaint and testify to Congress, the New York Times reported Friday.

The official reportedly has more direct information about Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky than the first whistleblower, two officials briefed on the matter told the Times, which may bolster the credibility of the complaint.

The official was also among those interviewed by Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson to corroborate the claims made by the first whistleblower, the Times reported.

However, the new potential whistleblower may not have to file an official whistleblower complaint because he has already met with Atkinson's office. Government officials who meet with inspectors general are ""protected by federal law that outlaws reprisals against officials who cooperate with an inspector general,"" according to the Times.

The first whistleblower, a registered Democrat and career CIA officer, did not have firsthand knowledge of the president's alleged inappropriate activities. Rather, he filed his complaint based on information relayed to him by numerous government officials with direct knowledge of Trump's phone conversation.

Still, despite potential political bias and lack of firsthand knowledge, Atkinson has said neither factor impacted the legitimacy of the whistleblower's complaint.

The development comes as House Democrats escalate their impeachment inquiry against the president.

On Friday, House Democrats issued a subpoena to the White House for documents related to the Ukraine scandal as well as a documents request to Vice President Mike Pence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/second-intel-official-may-file-whistleblower-complaint-against-trump-containing-firsthand-info,2019-10-05
"Second whistleblower comes forward after speaking with inspector general, attorney reveals","The attorney representing the whistleblower who filed a complaint against President Donald Trump revealed Sunday that he is now representing a second whistleblower with ""firsthand knowledge"" of some of the allegations against the president.

Attorney Mark Zaid confirmed to ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos that the second whistleblower has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the first complaint. Like the first whistleblower, Zaid's newest client is also an intelligence official.

Zaid also confirmed the whistleblower has already spoken to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.



The development is significant particularly because a second whistleblower could cast further doubt on Trump's denials that he did anything wrong.

The New York Times first reported Friday that a second whistleblower was weighing whether to file his own complaint. According to the Times, the official had firsthand knowledge that corroborated information contained in the first complaint.

In all, the first whistleblower said more than a half dozen U.S. officials had knowledge of Trump's alleged wrongdoing.

Zaid told the Washington Examiner on Sunday that the second whistleblower has not filed an official complaint because he ""doesn't need to."" Indeed, the Times reported that government officials who meet with inspectors general are ""protected by federal law that outlaws reprisals.""



However, Zaid told ABC News he was unsure if his new client is the same person mentioned by the Times.

Democrats have used the whistleblower's complaint as the springboard for an impeachment inquiry against Trump. A second whistleblower, especially one with more direct knowledge of the allegations, could help bolster their case against the president.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that Joe Biden didn't mean what he said when he appeared to call for regime change in Russia,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent Sunday reassuring American allies in the Israeli Knesset that the US is not seeking regime change in Russia despite recent statements made by President Joe Biden that might indicate the opposite.

The New York Post reported that Blinken said, “I think the president, the White House made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.”

The US’s top diplomat went on to say that the American government’s official stance on Russia did not include Biden’s alleged insistence of regime change.

“As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia — or anywhere else, for that matter,” Blinken added.

Blinken suggested, instead, that the Russian people should oust their president through democratic processes.

“As in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It’s up to the Russians,” he affirmed.

On Saturday, during a speech in Poland, Biden raised eyebrows when he appeared to make an explicit call for regime change in Russia.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden proclaimed.

“A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love of liberty,” Biden said. “Free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.”

Biden also called his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, a “butcher.”

Many of Biden’s statements were quickly walked back by White House officials who implied the president’s words did not accurately relay US foreign policy.

A White House official said, “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”

This past weekend, Biden also suggested to US troops who were stationed in Poland that they would witness the bravery of the Ukrainian people “when you’re there” explicitly insinuating that American troops would be deployed to Ukraine.

Biden said, “You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle in front of a dammed tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground.’”

"Sen. John Kennedy to Nancy Pelosi: 'I don't mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb'","Sen. John Kennedy had some terse words for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a raucous Trump rally Wednesday night in Kennedy's home state of Louisiana.

""In three short years, President Trump has doubled the growth in the greatest economy in all of human history,"" Kennedy boasted before asking, ""and do you know what our Democratic friends have done for him?""

""Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him.""

""I don't mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb,"" Kennedy exclaimed to a laughing crowd.

Kennedy's comments came amidst Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump for allegedly pushing Ukraine to investigate former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, over allegations of corruption related to Hunter Biden's work with a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.

On Wednesday, House Democrats announced that the impeachment inquiry will move to a new phase — public hearings — which are expected to begin on Wednesday.

The usually jovial senator is well known and liked for his ""homespun and folksy comments,"" but apparently not everyone found this insult amusing.



Sen. Claire McCaskill threw an insult back at Kennedy, saying, ""It would take someone dumber than a rock to think that was not disrespectful. Talking to you John.""

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said in an interview on CNN, ""[Kennedy] plays to the crowd. I guess when you stand next to Donald Trump and you have that kind of crowd reaction, you play to it.

""I'm disappointed because I like John, and for him to say that about Nancy Pelosi is so off the mark,"" Brown said.

Host of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Joe Scarborough went on a lengthy tirade against Kennedy for the comments, saying, ""Yeah, he actually does mean disrespect and he has degraded himself.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, because the name of the alleged whistleblower was included.

What are the details?

Politico reported that Paul has composed questions including the name of the whistleblower, despite Justice Roberts telling senators that he would not read the person's name out loud. According to the outlet, Paul had opened up a ""behind-the-scenes fight"" with his effort.

A Fox News reporter also reported the block by Roberts, and The Federalist added that ""sources say Roberts, at Democrats' urging, had previously vowed to ban any questions about the whistleblower whatsoever, named or not.""



Paul has called for the media to expose the alleged whistleblower for months, and several of his Republican colleagues joined him last fall in calling for the purported Obama holdover to testify.

""I think he is a person of interest in the sense that he was at the Ukraine desk when Joe Biden was there when Hunter Biden was working for the Ukrainian oligarch. So simply for that alone, I think he's a material witness who needs to be brought in,"" Paul said in November.

According to Politico, Paul ""has complained that he is being prevented from asking a question about the origin of the Ukraine investigation, although he didn't get into specifics.""

Sen. Ted Cruz aligns himself with Elon Musk's demand to increase American oil and gas output: 'Unleash American energy now!',"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced his support for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's viral social media post calling for America to immediately increase its domestic energy source output.

What's a brief history here?

Musk on Friday took to Twitter to speak out about the necessity of increasing domestic oil and gas output to combat the dramatically surging energy prices under the Biden administration and as Russia continues to invade Ukraine.

Musk wrote, ""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports.”

At the time of this reporting, Musk's tweet has been liked more than 197,000 times.

Cruz took to Twitter on Saturday to support Musk’s statement, saying, “Couldn’t agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!”



""Couldn't agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!"" he tweeted.

What else?

Cruz on Friday issued a statement regarding the Energy Freedom Act, which would effectively release the U.S. from reliance on foreign energy sources.

“I’m introducing the Energy Freedom Act to reverse Biden’s actions so we can restore American energy independence,"" he said in a statement on the proposed legislation. ""This bill won’t cost taxpayers a dime, but it will provide the United States billions in revenue in the coming years by expediting permitting, leasing, safe new pipelines, and exports, and providing much needed regulatory certainty. It would create new jobs, lower energy costs, and because modern energy production in the United States is far cleaner than in any other country’s by every measure, it would help the environment.""

Senate Democrats prioritize radical abortion bill over aid for Ukraine,"The United States Senate has returned from recess, and the first major item on the legislative agenda is not humanitarian and security aid for Ukraine's war against Russian invaders. Instead, Democratic leadership has scheduled a procedural vote for a radical abortion bill that would essentially codify Roe v. Wade into federal law.

Democrats will attempt to advance the Women's Health Protection Act Monday, a bill that advocates say will enshrine the right to an abortion into United States law and protect abortion rights in case the Supreme Court overturns Roe later this year.

Pro-life activists warn the bill would severely undermine state laws to protect pre-born children and prevent pro-life legislation from being passed in the future.

The Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to abortion in its 1973 decision in Roe. In addition to establishing a statutory right to an abortion, the Women's Health Protection Act would erase ""medically unnecessary restrictions, limitations, and bans that delay, and at times, completely obstruct, access to abortion,"" according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

State laws banning abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, 20-week bans, mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods, and requirements that women seek counseling before obtaining an abortion would be struck down if the bill were enacted into federal law.

The legislation is co-sponsored by 48 Senate Democrats. President Joe Biden also supports the bill, which would fulfill his campaign promise to ""pass legislation making Roe the law of the land."" The Democratic majority in the House of Representatives passed the bill in the fall, but it is not expected to pass the Senate, where Democrats do not have enough support to meet the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.



Given the reality of an evenly split Senate, the decision to bring up the Women's Health Protection Act for a procedural vote today is largely symbolic, and even advocates are admitting as much.

""I think it's going to be very important that the senators are on the record,"" said Nancy Northup, the CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in an interview with Reuters. Knowing the bill won't pass, she said the vote itself will be a win for abortion rights, adding, ""The voters can judge them on that record when they make their decisions at the polls.""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a pro-choice Republican, criticized Democrats for bringing the bill up for a vote Monday instead of considering an aid package for Ukraine requested by the White House on Friday,

""The Senate must focus on that growing crisis as we return to session tomorrow. A substantial and bipartisan package with aid for Ukraine and penalties for Russia cannot wait,"" Murkowski tweeted late Sunday.

""The measures currently on the Senate’s schedule – the Women’s Health Protection Act and a postal reform bill – are important issues. But WHPA lacks the votes to proceed and is set up to fail, so we should work to find a path that actually protects women’s right to choose,"" she said.

She concluded: ""The world is watching. The Senate must agree on a package with humanitarian and defense aid for @Ukraine, while imposing sweeping sanctions and penalties on Russia—including strict embargoes on their energy and seafood. Countless lives and a budding democracy are at stake.""

The White House on Friday asked Congress to approve a $6.4 billion aid package for Ukraine, including $2.9 billion in security and humanitarian assistance and $3.5 billion for the Department of Defense.

Senate passes $1.5 trillion spending package,"The U.S. Senate passed a massive $1.5 trillion spending package on Thursday, sending it to President Biden even as Americans suffer under the financial strain caused by skyrocketing inflation.

The package passed in a bipartisan 68 to 31 vote. It will fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which runs through the end of September. It increases defense and nondefense spending compared to fiscal 2021. It also includes funding related to Ukraine.

The spending package also includes earmarks — the Wall Street Journal performed a review which discovered that around $9.7 billion is going toward earmarks. An amendment from Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) to cut the earmarks from the package failed to pass — the vote on the amendment was 64-35.

The Senate cleared the spending the very same day that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data that showed prices continuing their disturbing upward trajectory. According to BLS, the consumer price index climbed 0.8% in February.

""The all items index rose 7.9 percent for the 12 months ending February. The 12-month increase has been steadily rising and is now the largest since the period ending January 1982,"" BLS reported.

Americans are feeling pain at the pump as gas prices skyrocket, and the situation could get even worse in the days ahead.

President Biden recently signed an executive order banning the importation of Russian oil into the U.S. The order prohibits importing ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products"" from Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-passes-15-trillion-spending-package,2022-03-11
"Senate passes bill to fund the government, including another $12 billion for Ukraine","The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would fund the government through mid-December, sending a bill that would avert a government shutdown to the House of Representatives.

The Senate voted 72 to 25 in favor of a continuing resolution to fund the government, including $12 billion in additional aid for Ukraine and hundreds of billions of dollars for the executive agencies carrying out President Joe Biden's agenda. Twenty-two Republicans voted for the bill, which conservative lawmakers had pointed out would fund COVID-19 vaccine mandates for federal employees, Biden's preferred green energy policies, the administration's immigration policies, the Internal Revenue Service funding that Republicans say will add an additional 87,000 IRS agents to the federal workforce, and more.

Biden is expected to sign the bill on Friday, assuming it passes in the House, where Democrats hold the majority. His signature would keep the government open through Dec. 16, when Congress will meet in a lame-duck session after the midterm elections to consider another spending bill. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) unsuccessfully urged his colleagues not to support a Democratic spending bill that would kick the can to a lame-duck Congress.



But neither party wants to be blamed for a government shutdown so close to the November elections. The bill passed and the Senate will not resume session to consider legislation until after the elections, freeing up lawmakers to go home and campaign.

There was a minor controversy earlier this month as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) wanted to include language in the continuing resolution that would speed up the permitting process for both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects. But Manchin was forced to ask Schumer to remove his language from the bill when it became apparent Republicans would not support him. Though some Republicans also wanted faster permitting, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not rally support for Manchin's bill in what was largely seen as retribution for Manchin helping Democrats pass the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Senate Republicans have made it very clear they will block legislation to fund the government if it includes bipartisan permitting reform because they’ve chosen to obstruct instead of work in a bipartisan way to achieve something they’ve long claimed they wanted to do,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday as he announced Manchin's language would be removed from the bill.

Manchin said it was ""unfortunate that members of the United States Senate are allowing politics to put the energy security of our nation at risk,"" in a statement released Tuesday.

The spending bill also included an additional $18.8 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is assisting Florida after Hurricane Ian devastated the state's southwest coast.

Senate rejects Democrats' attempt to subpoena White House for documents on Ukraine,"Democrats were hit with a denial in their first attempt to amend the rules dictating the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on Tuesday, when the GOP-led Senate rejected an effort by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to demand the White House hand over documents and other records related to Ukraine.

What are the details?

Sen. Schumer put forth a pair of amendments that would have required the Trump administration to provide documentation of conversations and records among top administration officials and the president relating to Ukraine and the timing of military aid released to the country.



According to The Hill, the first amendment offered by Democrats requested documents related the President Trump's phone calls with the Ukrainian government and any communication between White House aides regarding Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden..

The second amendment sought records from top officials at the State Department, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It also sought communications with Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump.

Both amendments were tabled in separate 53-47 party-line votes.

Ahead of the votes, Democratic impeachment managers sent to the Senate by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged senators to support the two amendments to the rules resolution released Monday night by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

""The Senate should act on this subpoena now, at the outset of the trial,"" impeachment manager Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) argued, according to the Washington Examiner. ""Documents that are directly relevant to evaluating the president's scheme. If it won't even ask for this evidence, this trial, and your judgement, will be questioned.""

Sen. Schumer told reporters prior to amendment votes, ""No one can argue that these documents are not directly related...People should understand that the documents can shed as much light on why the aid was cut off, who did it.""

What's the background?

House Democrats approved two articles of impeachment against the president over allegations that he withheld aid to the country in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden, whose son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president and former President Barack Obama's point man on Ukraine. The firm, Burisma, has been the subject of multiple corruption probes by Ukrainian prosecutors.

President Trump has repeatedly denied there was any quid pro quo related to the Ukrainian aid.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-rejects-democrats-attempt-to-subpoena-white-house-for-documents-on-ukraine,2020-01-22
Senate rejects resolution to block Trump from lifting sanctions on Russia,"The Senate failed to advance a bill to prevent President Donald Trump from lifting sanctions on three Russian businesses. Eleven Republicans joined 46 Democrats to vote for cloture on the bill, but they fell three votes short of the 60 votes needed to end debate.

Congress has the power to reject any lessening of sanctions on Russia, but only if it has enough votes.

What sanctions?

In April, the Trump administration placed U.S. sanctions on three businesses connected to an oligarch associated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

This oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, had also been cited by prosecutors as a financial supporter of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's alleged criminal activity in Ukraine. Deripaska accused Manafort and Rick Gates (Trump campaign's former deputy chairman) of disappearing with $26 million of his money.

In December, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was lifting sanctions on these three businesses. Sanctions on Deripaska will remain.

""Treasury sanctioned these companies because of their ownership and control by sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, not for the conduct of the companies themselves. These companies have committed to significantly diminish Deripaska's ownership and sever his control. The companies will be subject to ongoing compliance and will face severe consequences if they fail to comply,"" Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in the department's news release.

The U.S. Treasury Department has argued that leaving these sanctions in place could hurt the global aluminum market or cause the Russian government to take over the company.

What happened Wednesday?

Democrats in the Senate were hoping to be able to get enough votes to prevent these sanctions from being lifted.

In 2017, Trump signed a bill granting Congress the power to halt the weakening of any sanctions on Russia by his administration within 30 days of announcement. The 2017 bill had a veto-proof majority before it ever reached Trump's desk.

The 30-day window for the current attempt to lift Russian sanctions closes Friday, the Washington Post reported. The House will likely vote on a similar resolution Thursday, but it will be purely symbolic following the Senate's action Wednesday.

The motion to end debate on the resolution earned 57 votes but needed 60 to move forward. Eleven Republicans — Sens. John Boozman (Ark.), Susan Collins (Maine), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Kennedy (La.), Martha McSally (Ariz.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), and Ben Sasse (Neb.) — broke with their party and voted to advance the measure.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had dismissed the resolution as a ""Democratic stunt"" and urged members of his party to vote against it.

The House of Representatives will vote on a similar measure Thursday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-rejects-resolution-to-keep-trump-from-lifting-sanctions-on-russia,2019-01-16
"New Senate report purportedly 'confirms' Biden family's business ties to Chinese, Russian governments","Two top Republican senators who have been investigating Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings have released additional findings that they say ""confirm"" troubling connections between the Biden family and the Chinese and Russian governments.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) published the findings Wednesday in a ""supplemental"" to their September report, which was titled, ""Hunter Biden, Burisma and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.""

In the new five-page report, Grassley and Johnson disclosed new evidence of ties between Hunter Biden and a business partner, Rob Walker, who they said ""appears to have been associated with at least three companies connected to Hunter Biden: Oldaker, Biden and Belair LLP; Seneca Global Advisors; and Rosemont Seneca Advisors.""

The senators connected the dots based on information provided to their committees by former Hunter Biden associate Tony Bobulinski. In the report, they said WhatsApp messages between Bobulinksi and Walker, which were handed over to their committees, purportedly show a close working relationship between Walker and the Biden family, including Hunter and his uncle, James Biden.

""The new information is consistent with other records within the Committees' possession which show millions of dollars being transferred from a Chinese entity linked to the communist party to Robinson Walker LLC,"" the senators noted before detailing the transactions.

In the report, two separate wires are cited, each totaling $3 million, which were sent by a Shanghai-based company called State Energy HK Limited to a bank account for Robinson Walker LLC in 2017. The senators noted that State Energy HK Limited was at the time associated with another Chinese company with ties to the communist government, CEFC China Energy.

""These transactions are a direct link between Walker and the communist Chinese government,"" the senators stated.

""These new records confirm the connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese government, as well as the links between Hunter Biden's business associates and the Russian government, and further support the Committees' September 23, 2020 report's finding that such relationships created counterintelligence and extortion concerns,"" they concluded in the report.

They added that ""to date, the Committees have requested records from Hunter Biden, James Biden, James Gilliar, Tony Bobulinski, and Rob Walker. At this time, only Bobulinski has cooperated with the Committees.""

The senators' September report purportedly concluded that Hunter Biden, among other things, ""received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""

Prior to the election, several Democratic lawmakers and members of the media claimed that reports about the Biden family's overseas business dealings were part of a Russian disinformation campaign. But Grassley and Johnson have vehemently denied the accusation, arguing their reporting has been based on documented evidence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-report-biden-china-russia-connections,2020-11-19
"Senate report levels serious allegations against Hunter Biden over Burisma 'corruption': Chinese money, payments to women linked to trafficking, millions from wife of ex-Moscow mayor","The Senate Republican majority of the Homeland Security Committee and the Finance Committee released a joint report Wednesday revealing powerful allegations against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.

The investigation of the younger Biden's actions connected to his time on the board of Burisma in Ukraine, which he joined in May 2014, uncovered damning new details of possible corruption, hindering of U.S. foreign policy, and assisting Moscow's effort to spread disinformation.

The report's ""key findings"" list a number of concerning areas when it comes to Biden and his international work and potential conflicts of interest.

KEY FINDING 1: ""In early 2015 the former Acting Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, George Kent, raised concerns to officials in Vice President Joe Biden's office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board. Kent's concerns went unaddressed, and in September 2016, he emphasized in an email to his colleagues, 'Furthermore, the presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine.'""

The report states that Kent raised concerns to Vice President Biden's staff, but that he never heard anything back from Biden's office. Kent also recommended that Hunter Biden step down from his role on the board at Burisma in order ""to avoid the perception of a potential conflict of interest."" However, none of his recommendations were followed.

According to the committees, Hunter Biden's continued presence on the Burisma board the President Barack Obama's State Department repeatedly felt it had to ""manage"" when attempting to implement and execute the White House's Ukraine policy.

More than a year after Kent reported his concerns to the vice president's staff, he wrote to his superiors that Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board was “very awkward"" to those on the front lines pushing anticorruption efforts in Ukraine on a daily basis. Kent testified that he felt the need to “prepar[e] everybody for 'what about-ism,' because we're pushing what's right … and we have to be prepared for people who are critics, are opponents, to say, 'Well, what about? What about Hunter Biden?''"" Indeed, Kent testified further that he “would have advised any American not to get on the board of [Burisma owner Mykola] Zlochevsky's company.""

Kent also raised concerns to State Department higher-ups, making clear that it was ""very awkward"" for Bidens to be on the Burisma board while U.S. officials were trying to implement an anti-corruption agenda for Ukraine.

KEY FINDING 2: ""In October 2015, senior State Department official Amos Hochstein raised concerns with Vice President Biden, as well as with Hunter Biden, that Hunter Biden's position on Burisma's board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.""

The report revealed that more than just Vice President Biden's staff had been informed of the State Department's concerns. The vice president himself had been told.

Then-U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein spoke directly to Vice President Biden about Hunter's ties to Burisma.

Hochstein said he raised the issue with the vice president because he was worried the Russians were using Hunter's Burisma duties to ""sow disinformation,"" the report states.

Hochstein said he also discussed the situation with Hunter Biden himself.

""I shared with [Hunter Biden] that the Russians were using his name in order to sow disinformation — attempt to sow disinformation among Ukrainians,"" Hochstein testified to the committees.

KEY FINDING 3: ""Although Kent believed that Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board was awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anti-corruption agenda in Ukraine, the Committees are only aware of two individuals — Kent and former U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein — who raised concerns to Vice President Joe Biden (Hochstein) or his staff (Kent).""

Despite the many people purported aware of and concerned about Hunter Biden serving on the Burisma board, Kent and Hochstein were the only people who said anything to Vice President Biden or his staff. And their concerns were apparently ignored

Yet even though Hunter Biden's position on Burisma's board cast a shadow over the work of those advancing anticorruption reforms in Ukraine, the Committees are only aware of two individuals who raised concerns to their superiors. Despite the efforts of these individuals, their concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears.

KEY FINDING 4: ""The awkwardness for Obama administration officials continued well past his presidency. Former Secretary of State John Kerry had knowledge of Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board, but when asked about it at a town hall event in Nashua, N.H. on Dec. 8, 2019, Kerry falsely said, 'I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No.' Evidence to the contrary is detailed in Section V.""

Former Obama Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC's Amanda Golden on Dec. 8, 2019, that he had had no idea that Hunter Biden had joined the board of Burisma.

Golden asked Kerry, ""[W]hen Hnger Biden joined the board of Burisma, were you aware of, did you know about it at the time and were you comfortable with the arrangement giving [sic] you were secretary of state at the time?""

Kerry answered, ""I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No.""

""Why would I know about any company or any individual. No. The answer is no,"" he added. ""No communication. No nothing. I don't know who they are. I don't know what they were doing to this day, actually.""

However, evidence shows Kerry did know.



In May 2014, Kerry's then-chief of staff, David Wade, briefed Kerry about inquiries about his stepson, Christopher Heinz, Hunter Biden, and Burisma.

Wade testified to the committees that Kerry learned about the Biden-Burisma connection from him.

Also, the report says, Secretary Kerry's adviser, David Thorne, sent press clippings and articles about Biden joining Burisma directly to Kerry.

KEY FINDING 5: ""Former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland testified that confronting oligarchs would send an anticorruption message in Ukraine. Kent told the Committees that Zlochevsky was an 'odious oligarch.' However, in December 2015, instead of following U.S. objectives of confronting oligarchs, Vice President Biden's staff advised him to avoid commenting on Zlochevsky and recommended he say, 'I'm not going to get into naming names or accusing individuals.'""

According to testimony, State Department officials clearly saw Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, as corrupt. But despite Vice President Biden being viewed as ""a leading U.S. figure who pushed for anticorruption measures in Ukraine,"" his staff was encouraging him to not link Zlochevsky to Ukrainian corruption.

The committees allege that it's ""clear that members of Vice President Biden's staff wanted to distance him from an individual whom the State Department clearly believed was corrupt and an individual who employed his son.""

KEY FINDING 6: ""Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board (supposedly consulting on corporate governance and transparency) when Zlochevsky allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine's prosecutor general, Vitaly Yarema, to 'shut the case against Zlochevsky.' Kent testified that this bribe occurred in December 2014 (seven months after Hunter joined Burisma's board), and, after learning about it, he and the Resident Legal Advisor reported this allegation to the FBI.""

Kent testified that Zlochevsky allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to Ukraine's prosecutor general got get him to close the cases against him. That alleged bribe came in December 2014, not May 2014. Which would put the alleged crime as occurring months after Hunter took the job with Burisma.

KEY FINDING 7: ""Hunter Biden was a U.S. Secret Service protectee from Jan. 29, 2009 to July 8, 2014. A day before his last trip as a protectee, Time published an article describing Burisma's ramped up lobbying efforts to U.S. officials and Hunter's involvement in Burisma's board. Before ending his protective detail, Hunter Biden received Secret Service protection on trips to multiple foreign locations, including Moscow, Beijing, Doha, Paris, Seoul, Manila, Tokyo, Mexico City, Milan, Florence, Shanghai, Geneva, London, Dublin, Munich, Berlin, Bogota, Abu Dhabi, Nairobi, Hong Kong, Taipei, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Johannesburg, Brussels, Madrid, Mumbai and Lake Como.""

Hunter Biden was afforded Secret Service protection as the son of the vice president. While a protectee, he scheduled at least six trips to China, including a trip to Beijing in May 2014, just before he officially joined the Burisma board.

The report reveals that Biden took at least seven trips under Secret Service protection while a Burisma board member.

KEY FINDING 8: ""Andrii Telizhenko, the Democrats' personification of Russian disinformation, met with Obama administration officials, including Elisabeth Zentos, a member of Obama's National Security Council, at least 10 times. A Democrat lobbying firm, Blue Star Strategies, contracted with Telizhenko from 2016 to 2017 and continued to request his assistance as recent as the summer of 2019. A recent news article detailed other extensive contacts between Telizhenko and Obama administration officials.""

Democrats have repeatedly claimed that Telizhenko is key to a Russian disinformation campaign to attack Hunter and Joe Biden. However, Telizhenko had a history of working with the Obama administration and the Democrat lobbying group Blue Star Strategies, the report states.

KEY FINDING 9: ""In addition to the over $4 million paid by Burisma for Hunter Biden's and [Hunter Biden's business partner Devon] Archer's board memberships, Hunter Biden, his family, and Archer received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds.""

Committee investigators found that Hunter Biden and his family and business associates pursued ""financial arrangements"" with other foreign nationals besides Burisma.

The Treasury records acquired by the Chairmen show potential criminal activity relating to transactions among and between Hunter Biden, his family, and his associates with Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh and Chinese nationals. In particular, these documents show that Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from foreign sources as a result of business relationships that he built during the period when his father was vice president of the United States and after. In addition to providing new and descriptive details about the nature, origin and extent of payments from Burisma Holdings to Hunter Biden, the documents acquired by the Committees also shed light on a much broader array of questionable financial transactions involving Hunter Biden, other members of the Biden family, and their associations with foreign nationals.

KEY FINDING 10: ""[Devon] Archer received $142,300 from Kenges Rakishev of Kazakhstan, purportedly for a car, the same day Vice President Joe Biden appeared with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsemy Yasenyuk and addressed Ukrainian legislators in Kyiv regarding Russia's actions in Crimea.""

On April 22, 2014, Vice President Joe Biden appeared with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsemy Yasenyuk and addressed Ukrainian legislators in Kyiv regarding Russia's actions in Crimea. The same day, Novatus Holding PTE. LTD. (Novatus Holding), a private holding company in Singapore, used a Latvian bank to wire $142,300 to Archer's company, Rosemont Seneca Bohai. The currency transaction report states, “For Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, … For a Car.""

According to the committees, the payment raises ""serious questions"" — especially considering that Archer's Rosemont Seneca Bohai ""does not deal in vehicles.""



KEY FINDING 11: ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""

Baturina is a Russian businesswoman and the country's only female billionaire. Her riches came when her husband, the late Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, orchestrated a number of municipal contracts with her company. Luzhkov was fired in 2010 by then-President Medvedev over corruption allegations, the report says.

Baturina wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's investment firm for a ""consulting agreement,"" the committee states.

KEY FINDINGS 12 & 13: ""Hunter Biden opened a bank account with Gongwen Dong to fund a $100,000 global spending spree with [Vice President Biden's brother] James Biden and [James Biden's wife] Sara Biden."" ""Hunter Biden had business associations with Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People's Liberation Army. Those associations resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow.""

According to the committees, Hunter, James, and Sara Biden were authorized users of credit cards connected to an account set up by Hunter and a Chinese national named Gongwen Dong. The cards were used to purchase $101,291 worth of ""extravagant items"" from airline tickets to items from Apple stores, pharmacies, hotels, and restaurants.

The report also reveals:

Hunter Biden and Devon Archer engaged in numerous financial transactions with Chinese nationals who had deep connections to the Communist Chinese government. These Chinese nationals included Ye Jianming, founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC) and chairman of the board for its subsidiary, the China Energy Fund Committee (CE Fund). They also included Gongwen Dong, who was Ye Jianming's associate and reportedly executed transactions for his companies. Ye's connections to the Communist government are extensive and ... he has been previous affiliations with the People's Liberation Army. Based on the information received by the Committees, Ye was also financially connected to Vice President Biden's brother, James Biden. Thus, there exists a vast web of corporate connections and financial transactions between and among the Biden family and Chinese nationals.

KEY FINDING 14: ""Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an 'Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.'""

The committee reports contains a very disturbing footnote about Hunter Biden's payments to women connected to prostitution.

Biden is already known to have had issues before with his relationships with women. The committees' investigation uncovered something that is potentially even uglier:

There is extensive public reporting concerning Hunter Biden's alleged involvement with prostitution services. Records on file with the Committees do not directly confirm or refute these individual reports. However, they do confirm that Hunter Biden sent thousands of dollars to individuals who have either: 1) been involved in transactions consistent with possible human trafficking; 2) an association with the adult entertainment industry; or 3) potential association with prostitution. Some recipients of those funds are Ukrainian and Russian citizens. The records note that it is a documented fact that Hunter Biden has sent funds to nonresident alien women in the United States who are citizens of Russia and Ukraine and who have subsequently wired funds they have received from Hunter Biden to individuals located in Russia and Ukraine. The records also note that some of these transactions are linked to what ""appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.""

Senate Republicans want to compel the whistleblower to testify in trial,"Senate Republicans plan to compel the alleged whistleblower in the ongoing Ukraine scandal to testify in a Senate trial if House Democrats vote to impeach President Donald Trump.

According to the Washington Examiner, ""Republican members are arguing that [the alleged whistleblower's] past position as Ukraine director and his current work on Ukraine issues makes him a relevant witness, whether or not he is the whistleblower.""

Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) reportedly told the Examiner, ""You need to know the person who started the complaint. Without this, there would be no, there'd be no case.""

Graham added,""The whistleblower statute was never meant to allow somebody to not come forward and confront the person they're accusing.""

As the Examiner previously reported, the alleged whistleblower was once a guest of Vice President Joe Biden at a 2016 State Department reception. He is also reported to currently work closely with Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified it was ""improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.""

Republican senators consider him 'a fact witness'

Numerous Senate Republicans confirmed to the Examiner that they would be interested in hearing from the alleged whistleblower.

""I'm prepared to listen to any witness they would bring forward, but it's clear that the individual named by some members of the media...worked closely with the [former] vice president on issues dealing with Ukraine,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. ""And he may know something about the allegations with respect to Mr. Hunter [Biden].""

Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said: ""I think he is a person of interest in the sense that he was at the Ukraine desk when Joe Biden was there when Hunter Biden was working for the Ukrainian oligarch. So simply for that alone, I think he's a material witness who needs to be brought in.""

Are they sure it's him?

The alleged whistleblower has been identified as a 33-year-old former intelligence operative who is currently working for the National Intelligence Council.

However, Republicans are not entirely sure if the man in question is indeed the whistleblower. The Examiner spoke with three congressional GOP sources who said while they could not confirm the former intelligence operative was the whistleblower, they believe he played an important role in the accusations against the president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate_republicans_whistleblower_testify,2019-11-25
Senators are reportedly considering a Biden-Bolton witness trade-off in impeachment trial,"While the Senate continues to fight over which witnesses — if any — might be called to testify in its impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, some of its Democratic members are reportedly discussing a potential trade: Hunter Biden for former White House national security adviser John Bolton.

According to a Tuesday night story at the Washington Post, ""several Senate Democrats are privately discussing"" the prospect of such an agreement:

Publicly, most Democrats have scoffed at the growing GOP clamor to hear former Vice President Joe Biden's son testify, dismissing him as irrelevant to the charges against Trump and accusing Republicans of trying to distract from the allegations against the president.



But behind closed doors, a small group of Democratic senators and aides has begun to question that logic, sounding out colleagues on whether to back a witness deal that could lead to testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton or other administration officials with possible firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine controversy, according to multiple Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions.

The story was published as the first substantive day of the Senate's impeachment trial lasted late into the night due to debates and votes on several Democrat-proposed amendments to the proposed trial rules having to do with subpoenaing witnesses and evidence. Those efforts were ultimately defeated, putting off the question of calling witnesses until later in the trial process.



Republicans have tried to call Hunter Biden — whose past work with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father, Joe, was vice president is at the heart of the impeachment controversy — as an impeachment witness since the matter was being investigated in the House. However, those calls were rejected by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is now the House's lead impeachment manager and has said this week that calling Biden at this stage of the process would be ""an illegitimate abuse of the trial.""

Similarly, Democrats have repeatedly demanded that Bolton be called to testify in the Senate trial, given the possibility that his testimony from his time at the White House could prove damaging to the president's case. However, he ultimately wasn't compelled to testify during the House investigation after Democrats decided not to take the White House's immunity claims to court on the matter.

Earlier this month, Bolton said that he was prepared to testify if called by the Senate, saying that he had to ""resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study.""

On Wednesday, President Trump said that he would like to have Bolton testify at the trial, but that doing so would present ""a national security problem,"" explaining that his former adviser ""knows some of my thoughts, what I think about leaders, what happens if he reveals what I think about a leader and it's not very positive.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senators-are-reportedly-considering-a-biden-bolton-witness-trade-off,2020-01-22
"Republicans, plan to skip, State of the Union, Biden","Multiple Republican lawmakers have announced that they will not attend President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.

""I'm healthy, so I won’t be taking a test for COVID… so I won’t be attending the #SOTU,"" GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted on Tuesday.



Individuals who plan to attend are required to undergo COVID-19 testing.

HuffPost's Igor Bobic reported on Monday that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said that he will not attend the speech. ""I don't have time to go take a COVID test today. I only take a test if I’m sick,"" Rubio said, according to Bobic.

Rep. Chip Roy of Texas responded to Bobic's tweet by saying, ""Same. I will not attend.""

""We’re still being forced to test, a fence is up, & Americans can’t visit the Capitol. While I have an obligation to be present to vote for my constituents (vs. 'proxy' voting), I don’t have an obligation to be there for political theater,"" Roy had also tweeted on Monday.

GOP Reps. Mary Miller of Illinois, Bob Good of Virginia, Matt Rosendale of Montana, and Andrew Clyde of Georgia also will not attend the speech, according to the Daily Caller.

""I will not submit to an unnecessary COVID test to attend a State of the Union only to hear this President whisper through a speech that will inevitably fail to take responsibility for the tremendous damage he has and continues to cause to our country,"" Good told the outlet.

""I am boycotting the State of the Union on behalf of the American people who were fired because Joe Biden's White House strong-armed private employers to institute illegal vaccine mandates,"" Miller tweeted.

President Biden heads into the address as he continues to face sagging job approval numbers across various polls and as Americans continue facing rapidly rising prices.

Several top Bernie Sanders aides bail on campaign over 'creative vision' conflicts,"Three senior staff members on Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign quit Tuesday because they couldn't get on the same page with Sanders on creative issues.

Tad Devine, Mark Longabaugh, and Julian Markey worked as media consultants on Sanders' 2016 campaign, and announced their departure on NBC News. Before leaving, they produced Sanders' 2020 announcement video.

Who are they? Devine was Sanders' chief strategist, Longabaugh worked closely with the Democratic National Committee and led the strategy to secure delegates, and Mulvey helped create the campaign's ads.

The three men's consulting firm, DML, earned $5.3 million from the 2016 campaign, which opened them to criticism by some Sander supporters.

What do they say about it? ""The entire firm has stepped away,"" Longabaugh said on NBC News. ""We just didn't have a meeting of the minds.""

""We are leaving because we believe that Sen. Sanders deserves to have media consultants who share his creative vision for the campaign,"" the three men said in a statement.

What does the Sanders campaign say about it? ""The campaign appreciates all the good work DML has done and wishes them well,"" said Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir.



What else might be going on here? Sanders recently told The Young Turks in an interview (before this staff change) that he wanted to have a more diverse staff this time around.



""We have been criticized, correctly so, for running a campaign that was too white and too male-oriented, and that is going to change,"" Sanders said.

Devine has attracted some negative attention for having worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort consulting in Ukraine. Manafort pleaded guilty last year to financial crimes including tax fraud and violations of foreign lobbying laws.

While the cited reason for the change was creative disagreement, a source told CNN that the departure wasn't necessarily unexpected in light of the things Sanders wants to do differently in 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/several-top-bernie-sanders-aides-bail-on-campaign-over-creative-vision-conflicts,2019-02-26
Sinema calls for increased US oil production,"Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona called Tuesday for raising U.S. oil production to offset the loss of imported Russian oil, according to the Associated Press.

""The reasonable way to address what is going to be an oil shortage in America is for us to responsibly increase our own domestic oil production,"" the senator remarked during a luncheon for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, according to the outlet.



Americans have been getting slammed by high gas prices — as of Tuesday, the AAA national average for a gallon of regular gas was $4.098.

Last month, President Joe Biden issued an executive order banning the import of crude oil and other products from Russia, a country that has been waging a devastating invasion in Ukraine.

""We can help our European allies do the same, but it is incumbent on us to help fill that gap,"" Sinema said, according to the AP.



High fuel costs directly hurt American drivers each time they fill up their vehicle, but the financial pain does not necessarily stop there since high gas prices can also drive up the costs associated with transportation and lead to higher prices across the board.

On March 31, President Biden announced plans to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the rate of one million barrels each day over the span of six months.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data on Tuesday which showed that rising prices are continuing to hammer Americans hard. ""The gasoline index rose sharply in March, increasing 18.3 percent after rising 6.6 percent in February. (Before seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices rose 19.8 percent in March.),"" the BLS noted.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin issued a statement about the nation's rapidly rising inflation.

""Here is the truth, we cannot spend our way to a balanced, healthy economy and continue adding to our $30 trillion national debt. Getting inflation under control will require more aggressive action by a Federal Reserve that waited too long to act. It demands the Administration and Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, support an all-the-above energy policy because that is the only way to bring down the high price of gas and energy while attacking climate change,"" Manchin said in the statement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sinema-calls-for-increased-us-oil-production,2022-04-13
Small businesses post skyrocketing electricity bills to social media as European energy crisis worsens,"Some small businesses in Europe are posting their skyrocketing electricity bills to social media as the worsening energy crisis threatens to cripple their economies.

""My mum owns a small café in Leicester. Her electricity bill has just jumped from £10k ($12k) a year to £55k ($64k) a year,"" claimed one Twitter user.

""She is working out her options but more than likely she will be forced to close,"" he added.

Energy prices have spiked due to governments trying to shift to green energy sources as well as the lack of energy imports from Russia due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Another user posted a message from a local restaurant in the U.K. that said they were closing because of electricity costs.

""It has been a very difficult few years with Covid but the last few months with the loss of business due to the cost of living crisis, the huge increase in our costs, and the completely ridiculous energy prices that companies are charging — there is no price cap for businesses!! — have meant it is no longer sustainable for us to continue. We have tried so hard to make it work and we are devastated that it has ended this way and so abruptly,"" the message read.

A user identifying herself as Helen Panton posted a similar story.

""We closed our tearoom/cafe we’ve run for 7 years due to increasing costs in food/ petrol/ utilities back in the spring. We can’t sustain the hikes and thought we would wait until the economy perked up again in the summer but obviously we will never open again,"" she tweeted.

Another business from Ireland showed its electricity bill spiking to nearly €10,000, or about $10,025.

The cost of electricity in Germany and France has soared tenfold over the last year, according to one report.

Tracy Shuchart of Intelligence Quarterly told CNBC that Europe was headed into a recession partly due to the energy crisis.



""Europe is headed into a recession. If you look at power prices across Europe, not just the EU,"" said Shuchart, ""we're not even at winter yet and they're hitting an energy crisis, so they're definitely heading towards a recession.""

"State Dept. officials monitored Trump Jr., Giuliani, Fox News hosts' social media in early days of Ukraine scandal","Officials at the United States Embassy in Kyiv may have broken federal law by launching an effort to monitor the social media accounts of 13 prominent Americans at the start of the Ukraine scandal in 2019, newly released State Department memos show.

According to a Just the News report by journalist John Solomon — who worked for The Hill at the time and was among the individuals monitored — the memos were made public Tuesday under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch.

Other individuals listed as targets for monitoring in the memos included President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; the president's personal attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; Fox News hosts Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Lou Dobbs; conservative political commentator Dan Bongino; and Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra.

The memos show that Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. ambassador in Ukraine at the time, along with former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, were aware of the monitoring efforts.

The officials apparently used CrowdTangle, a popular social media monitoring product, to round up the accounts and log online posts about Yovanovitch, Hunter Biden, nefarious Ukrainian gas company Burisma, and liberal megadonor George Soros.

Here's more from Solomon's report:

""Key thing is to get up to ramming speed from the get go,"" Kent wrote in a March 27, 2019 email that discussed the social media monitoring efforts, which appear to have been prompted by early stories about the embassy's activities with Ukrainian prosecutors and the Bidens at The Hill newspaper (written by this reporter) and on Fox News.



The same day, Yovanovitch received an email updating her on the social media monitoring.



""Thanks Ambassador — I just wanted you to be aware as we are really trying to help them and recognize how hard everyone is working in this especially trying time,"" an official whose name was redacted wrote Yovanovitch. ""The good news is our social media team back here is now helping to provide them with the reports they want when Kyiv is asleep/offline — through existing PD tools — so this should greatly help.""



By April 1, 2019, the embassy appears to have been instructed to cease the social media monitoring by officials in Washington.



""Thank you so very much for alerting everyone to this issue. We appreciate you shutting down the automated report,"" an email entitled ""Ukraine Twitter report"" read.

Then in May, a digital media associate for EUR/PD Keniya-Trusant Group told the embassy officials that they would ""unfortunately"" need to go about monitoring social media posts the ""old school way"" so as to not violate a little thing called the Privacy Act of 1974.

""Going to chime in here — so regarding the influencers, there are some legal implications of making a list of Facebook influencers of Twitter influencers since they are technically private citizens (even though they're publicly on the internet) and we cannot compile them into a list and monitor what they are saying using a third-party application without their knowledge,"" the associate, whose name was redacted, wrote in an email. ""To see what they're saying, you unfortunately need to use the old school way and manually go to their feeds and view that way. Cumbersome but it's in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974.""

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton responded Tuesday to the release of the memos, arguing they prove that embassy officials essentially ""set up an enemies list"" for illicit monitoring.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-media-monitoring-ukraine-scandal,2020-09-02
Ambassador Sondland testifies of quid pro quo linking investigations and a WH meeting; Republicans push back on claims,"In his opening statement Wednesday during a House impeachment inquiry hearing, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that there was a quid pro quo for Ukraine to announce investigations into Burisma and 2016 election interference that came from Rudy Giuliani at the guidance of President Trump.

""Was there a 'quid pro quo?'"" Sondland asked. ""The answer is yes.""

Sondland said that Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, communicated to the Ukrainians that a White House meeting between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was conditioned on a public statement announcing the launch of investigations, and that Giuliani was acting at President Trump's behest.

""Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians,"" Sondland said. ""Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us. We all understood that these prerequisites for the White House call and White House meeting reflected President Trump's desires and requirements.""

Later in the hearing, GOP counsel Stephen Castor pressed Sondland on his claim that the prerequisites for the meeting originated with President Trump.

""Did the President ever tell you personally about any pre-conditions for anything?"" asked Castor, to which Sondland responded, ""no.""

Castor then questioned Sondland on his assertion that Giuliani was expressing Trump's desires and requirements — ""How do you know that?"" Castor said. In response, Sondland admitted that he ""assumed"" that by referring him to Giuliani, Trump was directing the pre-conditions.

Sondland also claimed that the quid pro quo for a White House meeting was ""no secret,"" but was open knowledge among Trump's inner circle.

He cited a July 19 email copied to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and several other senior officials in saying that ""everybody was in the loop.""

Sondland's testimony marks the first time since the public hearings began that several of Trump's senior officials have been named as being directly involved in the events surrounding the impeachment probe.

What about the military aid?

Regarding the allegation that $400 million in military aid was withheld as part of the quid pro quo for pressuring the launch of investigations into Trump's political opponents, Sondland provided a less air-tight confirmation.

Sondland testified that ""in the absence of any credible explanation"" for the aid not being released, he ""later came to believe"" that the military aid would not be delivered to Ukraine without a public announcement of investigations into Burisma and 2016 election meddling.

Sondland said that he told Vice President Mike Pence before his Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky that he ""had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations.""

It should be noted that Vice President Pence's office has officially denied that this conversation ever took place.

On the specific issue of military aid, Sondland's testimony could provide Republicans the space to argue that military aid being tied to investigations is an allegation still based on hearsay and assumptions rather than any substantive evidence.

Why won't the State Department let Sondland see relevant documents?

In his opening statement, Sondland lamented the fact that during the impeachment inquiry process he has not been permitted access to all of his ""phone records, State Department emails, and other State Department documents.""

""I was told that I could not work with my EU staff to pull together the relevant files,"" he stated, before acknowledging that having all of the relevant materials would have been ""very helpful"" in recalling the details for his testimony.

Despite repeated requests to the State Department, Sondland said the materials have still not been provided to him, and that, in fact, the State Department has also ""refused to share these materials with the [House Intelligence Committee].""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sondland-testifies-quid-pro-quo,2019-11-20
Canadian energy official is 'frustrated' Biden is looking to Venezuela and Iran for oil: 'We're right next door! We're here!',"A Canadian energy official expressed frustration with the Biden administration for seeking to increase oil production from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia instead of looking to its neighbor to the north.

Sonya Savage, the energy minister for Alberta, made the comments in an interview with Lisa Fletcher of WJLA-TV.

""What did you think when President Biden called on OPEC and other oil drilling nations like Saudi?"" asked Fletcher.

“I thought ‘what?’ ‘We're right next door. We're here!’"" Savage responded.

""It's extremely frustrating when we see the United States administration reaching out to Saudi Arabia to ask for more oil production, to ask OPEC for more oil production, to look at Iran, to look at Venezuela when we're right next door here in Alberta,"" she explained. ""They should be looking at us as the solution to energy security, not around, not Venezuela.”

Savage said that Canada could more than make up the lack of oil imports resulting from the ban on Russian imports over its invasion of Ukraine.

She has previously criticized the Biden administration from her official social media account.

""US now looking to replace Russian barrels with Venezuelan? You can’t make this stuff up - desperate times require desperate measures,"" she tweeted.

""A reminder of the folly of energy policy over the past decade. Canada, with the 3rd largest reserves, could have supplied the US and the world,"" Savage added.

Republicans and other critics have assailed Democrats for seeking to increase oil production from unfriendly countries while seeking to restrict domestic oil production that could have curbed the skyrocketing price of gas.

""The result of Biden's presidency has been that the enemies of America, countries like Russia, like Iran, like Venezuela are all getting stronger, getting richer, getting more aggressive, getting more hostile,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), ""because the president is simultaneously weakening our own ability to produce energy and strengthening their ability to produce energy.""

Source: Ukrainian sniper reportedly kills highly decorated Russian general,"A highly decorated Russian general was killed Wednesday, the Daily Mail reported, adding that a military source said a Ukrainian sniper did the job on Major Gen. Andrey Sukhovetsky.

What are the details?

Sukhovetsky was deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of Russia's Central Military District, the outlet said, adding that Russia's Ministry of Defense had not confirmed his death.

However, Sukhovetsky's colleague Sergey Chipilyov announced his death on social media, and several Russian and Ukrainian news outlets reported the general's demise, the Daily Mail said.

The post from Chipilyov — who's with the Airborne Forces Union of Russian Paratroopers — reads as follows, the outlet said: ""With great pain, we received the tragic news about the death of our friend, Major-General Andrey Aleksandrovich Sukhovetsky, in Ukraine during a special operation. We express our deepest condolences to his family.""

The Daily Mail said it wasn't clear where Sukhovetsky was killed. The military source also told the outlet a funeral will be held Saturday in Russia, the outlet said.

Sukhovetsky would be by far the most senior Russian figure to have have died since the invasion of Ukraine commenced last week, the Daily Mail said.

The 47-year-old was a highly decorated veteran who was appointed deputy army commander of the 41st division in October 2021, the outlet said, adding that he previously commanded the 7th Airborne Assault Division in Novorossiysk for three years, completed several combat deployments in the Chechen war, Abkhazia, and the intervention in Syria, and received special commendation for his participation in Russia's annexation of Crimea.

The Daily Mail said Sukhovetsky's death would be seen in Ukraine as another encouraging sign that the Russia's invasion isn't going well.

What else?

The Kremlin on Wednesday acknowledged that nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and another 1,600 have been injured in Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, the outlet said, adding that the real numbers are ""almost certainly higher.""

Ukraine's armed forces said Thursday that Russia's army had suffered 9,000 casualties, the Daily Mail added, although noting that the military's statement said the actual death toll ""is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.""

A Ukrainian defense official also announced this week that a kill squad sent to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was ""eliminated"" by the country's armed forces.

What's more, some Russian troops in Ukraine reportedly are surrendering en masse and even sabotaging their own vehicles to get out of the conflict, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

Zelenskyy on Thursday lauded the fight his fellow citizens are waging against Russian's military and claimed ""all lines of defense are holding"" in the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv, the Daily Mail reported.

""They wanted to destroy us. They failed. We've been through so much. And if anyone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken, or surrender, they know nothing about Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the outlet: ""We will restore every house, every street, every city, and we say to Russia: learn the word 'reparations.' You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.""

He added, ""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy. They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment,"" the Daily News reported, and also said Russian soldiers ""are not warriors of a superpower. These are confused children who have been used.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/source-ukrainian-sniper-reportedly-kills-highly-decorated-russian-general,2022-03-03
Sparks fly on live TV as Donald Trump Jr. throws fiery barbs at 'The View' co-host and Joy Behar shames audience: 'This is not a MAGA rally!',"Donald Trump Jr. and ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar squared off on Thursday's show after Behar attempted to trip up Trump Jr. in his father's presidential controversies.

But Trump Jr. had apparently done his homework on the pop political show and dished it right back out.

What are the details?

Trump Jr. appeared on the hit show to promote his book ""Triggered,"" sitting alongside his fellow guest, girlfriend and Trump adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle.

Before laying into the president's son for tweeting about the federal whistleblower, Behar highlighted some of the president's more controversial moments.

""[President Donald Trump] called some Mexicans rapists, he attacked the handicapped, he bragged about it,"" she spat. ""We heard the 'Access' tape, where he bragged about grabbing women by their genitalia.""



Trump Jr. fairly defended his father, responding, ""We've all done things that we regret. I mean, if we're talking about bringing a discourse down, Joy, you've worn blackface.""

Behar insisted that she did not, despite a widely recognized photo segment from 2016 which featured a young Behar dressing up for Halloween as a ""beautiful African woman,"" complete with a darkened complexion.

Trump Jr. then turned his sights on co-host Whoopi Goldberg, who he called out for her previous quasi-defense of director Roman Polanski. In 2009, Goldberg said that his crimes against child rape weren't ""rape-rape.""

""You said that Roman Polanski – it wasn't 'rape-rape' when he raped a child,"" he said.

What else?

Earlier, Behar admonished the audience for cheering and clapping after the panel discussed Trump Jr. releasing the name of the whistleblower whose anonymous complaint ultimately led to the president's impeachment hearings.

""The whole point of releasing a name is to intimidate someone, to threaten someone and to scare other people from coming out. That's something that dictators do,"" co-host Abby Huntsman reasoned. ""I've lived in China, I've seen that firsthand. That's not what America does, that's not what we do.""

Trump Jr. said that he did absolutely nothing wrong, as the identity of the whistleblower was widely known for days prior to his tweet, which caused the audience to respond with uproarious applause.

""[I wish] the outrage would be equal,"" he added. ""There was no outrage when my family got an exploding letter with white powder substance in it. It's not a level playing field in terms of outrage.""

As the audience shared its approval over Trump Jr.'s later remarks, Behar snapped, ""This is not a MAGA rally!""

Squad and Bernie Sanders willing to spend $40 billion for Ukraine war,"There were 57 Republican House members and Sen. Rand Paul (R-K.Y.) to oppose the massive foreign aid package to Ukraine. Every Democrat in Congress voted in favor of the $40 billion war package to supply aid to Ukraine. Every member of the so-called ""Squad"" and other progressive Democrats voted for the gargantuan payout to Ukraine despite condemning military spending in the past.

President Joe Biden initially requested $33 billion for Ukraine, but Congress tacked on another $7 billion. The $40 billion is in addition to $14 billion in Ukrainian aid that Congress just approved in March.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) voted for the $40 million military package for Ukraine. However, AOC called for an amendment to cut the budget of the Pentagon by 10% to ""prioritize the very needs of our communities here at home"" in September 2021.

""I rise today to offer Amendment 40, to reduce the Pentagon budget by 10%, Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor. ""During a time when our country is withdrawing from foreign wars, when COVID 19 and its fallout is one of the greatest threats that we face, when record levels of unemployment, housing, and healthcare crises are among us, the United States should be reducing its military spending by at least 10% and prioritize the very needs of our communities here at home.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) voted in favor of the package, but had a very different viewpoint in March.

""A lot of progressives, I feel, have abandoned their principles of being anti-war, anti-broad-based sanctions, anti-harmful policies that not only impact us here in the United States, but inadvertently impact the civilians of our adversary regime,"" Omar told Insider in March.

Progressive Caucus co-chairs Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) previously declared that there was ""no military solution out of this crisis"" and the ""flood of hundreds of millions of dollars in lethal weapons will only raise tensions.""

""We continue to watch Russia’s threatening behavior towards Ukraine with alarm. There is no military solution out of this crisis — diplomacy needs to be the focus. We support the Biden administration’s efforts to extend and deepen the dialogue, allowing for robust negotiations and compromise,"" the progressive Democrats proclaimed in January. “We have significant concerns that new troop deployments, sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions, and a flood of hundreds of millions of dollars in lethal weapons will only raise tensions and increase the chance of miscalculation. Russia’s strategy is to inflame tensions; the United States and NATO must not play into this strategy.""

Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald points out in a Substack article, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) discussed the Russian invasion of Ukraine during a ""Democracy Now"" appearance on Feb. 8. Khanna asserted that sending lethal aid to Ukraine ""will only inflame the situation.""

I certainly join [House progressives] in the concerns of having increased aid, lethal aid, into that area. That will only inflame the situation. I also join them in the concern that we need restraint, that the last thing the American people want is an escalation which could lead us to some long war in Ukraine with Russia, that that’s a very dangerous situation, and no one in this country — or, very few people in this country would want that. There’s a reason President Obama didn’t send lethal aid into Ukraine and had a greater restraint in his approach. So, I do think we should do everything possible not to escalate the situation, while having the moral clarity that Putin is in the wrong in this case.

In October 2020, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) proclaimed that she is going to ""defund the Pentagon.""

However, this week, Bush bizarrely attempted to justify her vote by highlighting that billions of dollars in military equipment will be sent overseas to private defense contractors.

“Additionally, at $40 billion, this is an extraordinary amount of military assistance, a large percentage of which will go directly to private defense contractors,"" Bush said in a statement. ""In the last year alone, the United States will have provided Ukraine with more military aid than any country in the last two decades, and twice as much military assistance as the yearly cost of war in Afghanistan, even when American troops were on the ground. The sheer size of the package given an already inflated Pentagon budget should not go without critique. I remain concerned about the increased risks of direct war and the potential for direct military confrontation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/squad-ukraine-war-spending-billion,2022-05-15
"Democrat senator brags about driving her pricey electric car past gas stations, and gets nailed with furious backlash","A Democrat senator bragged about driving her pricey electric car past gas stations, and many people online lashed out at her over the insensitive comment.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan laughed as she noted how high gas prices were as she zoomed past on her way to the U.S. Capitol. She made the comments at her opening statement for a hearing at the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday.

""I just have to say just on the issue of that at gas prices, after waiting for a long time to have enough chips in this country to finally get my electric vehicle, I got it and drove it from Michigan to here this last weekend and went by every single gas station. It didn’t matter how high it was,"" said Stabenow.

'I'm looking forward to the opportunity for us to move to vehicles that aren't going to be dependent on the whims of the oil companies,"" she added.

Given how Americans are suffering from record high inflation and record high gas prices, many saw the gleeful comments as insensitive and tone-deaf.

""To everyone who can afford a $60,000 EV this statement by Stabenow is a rollicking, on-point, fun-filled messaging!"" read one popular tweet.

""Nothing shows how out-of-touch Democrats are like saying people should just buy an expensive electric car they can't afford in the middle of record high inflation,"" replied commentator Dan Eberhart.

""Ms. Stabenow is a typically clueless, arrogant, smug, sheltered Democrat politician,"" read another tweet.

""What self-righteous shrills like these don’t care, is that 90% of the American population will never be able to afford an electric car,"" said another detractor.

Stabenow's comments mirrored those of President Joe Biden in March when he blamed gas prices on the war in Ukraine and said the answer was investing in electric cars.

While the Biden administration has tried to take steps in the short term to lower gas prices, they have made it clear that their long-term goal is phasing out of fossil fuels and into green energy sources.

"Stacey Abrams says Americans should 'legitimately question systems,' referring to elections — then condemns Trump","Stacey Abrams, a star in the Democratic Party, admitted in a new interview that she believes questioning the legitimacy of systems, in the context of elections, is a necessary part of being an American.



What is the background?

Abrams is running to become the next governor of Georgia in 2022 after losing election to Gov. Brian Kemp (R) four years ago.

After losing in 2018, Abrams refused to concede and claimed that she had “won.” In the more than three years since the election, Abrams has maintained that the election was not fair — even describing it as ""rigged"" — and even reiterated last year that the election “was stolen from the voters of Georgia.”

Abrams believes that Kemp — who oversaw the election because he was secretary of state at the time — took actions prior to the election that ultimately changed the outcome. However, Abrams has also admitted, ""I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes.""

What did Abrams say now?

Speaking with Axios, Abrams was asked whether refusing to concede an election ""emboldens former President Trump and his allies.""

In response, Abrams endorsed questioning the legitimacy of ""systems,"" a clear reference to elections in the context of the interview — but added a positive spin.

""I don't ever want us to be in a place as Americans where we cannot legitimately question and critique systems and try to make them better,"" she said.

The Georgia Democrat explained that she ""will acknowledge the victor"" of the 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election, then claimed, ""I will always acknowledge the legal outcome of an election. I have never failed to do that.""

In her interview with Axios, Abrams even claimed that her rhetoric about the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and former President Donald Trump's rhetoric about the 2020 presidential election are different.

""What Trump has done is invalidate systems because he didn't like the personal effect,"" said Abrams after just admitting she believes questioning the validity of systems is important. ""And he's provided no information or proof of his allegations.

""I should be held accountable for everything I say, be able to tie it to evidentiary facts. And that's what I've been doing. And that's what I'll continue to do,"" she claimed.

Anything else?

While mainstream media outlets like Politico publish stories drawing contrast between Abrams and Trump, Republicans in Georgia are already using Abrams' own words against her in the upcoming gubernatorial election.

Ryan Mahoney, an adviser to Brian Kemp's campaign in 2018, explained why ads against Abrams will prove effective.

""We've seen so many TV ads, so many digital ads, where candidates are stretching the truth. And I think the electorate realizes that. They know that not everything they see or hear now is fact checked or is valid,"" Mahoney told Politico.

"Report: State Department defied White House, released Ukraine aid before President Trump says he authorized it","Although President Donald Trump said he released aid money to Ukraine on Sept. 11 without a public statement from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky about investigating the Bidens, Bloomberg reported that the State Department actually released the aid days earlier, and Trump may not have released it at all otherwise.

President Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, over which Democrats are attempting to impeach him, included references to promised aid money and desired investigations that Democrats are framing as extortion and an abuse of presidential power.

One of the defenses by Republicans against these accusations is that because President Trump released the aid money on Sept. 11 without getting the investigations, or even public statements about investigations, that there could be no quid pro quo.

Bloomberg's report, which cites five sources and a memo allegedly sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, paints a different picture.

According to Bloomberg, State Department lawyers had determined that the neither the president nor the Office of Management and Budget had authority to withhold the congressionally apportioned aid. So, on Sept. 9 (two days before Trump said he authorized the release) the funding was released, reportedly on the order of former national security adviser John Bolton.

Two questions immediately arise from this new information, if it is proven true: Did Bolton do this with President Trump's blessing, or did he go over the president's head to release the aid? And, would Trump have released the aid on his own had Bolton not done so?

OMB denies the characterization that Bolton defied the president to release the aid, and also disagrees with the State Department that OMB doesn't have the authority to withhold apportioned aid. Trump has said he released the aid Sept. 11 after persuasion from GOP Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio).

Bolton, who has been referenced in impeachment inquiry depositions, has not yet testified — but that could change as the process progresses. He was fired by Trump on the night of Sept. 9.

That may explain a cryptic letter that Bolton's lawyer sent to Congress on Friday saying the former national security adviser has ""new details"" about the Ukraine matter that they don't know about, without elaborating. Bolton has declined to testify against White House orders unless a judge rules he should and didn't respond to multiple emails seeking comment.

US State Department requires Americans fleeing Ukraine to show proof of vaccination to enter Poland despite Poland not requiring proof of vaccination for travelers,"The U.S. State Department announced Saturday that Americans fleeing Ukraine may enter Poland, but U.S. citizens must present proof of vaccination against COVID-19. This appears to be a U.S. State Department requirement since Poland does not require vaccinations against COVID-19 to enter the country.

""The security situation in Ukraine continues to be unpredictable due to the increased threats of Russian military action and can deteriorate with little notice,"" the announcement reads. ""U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately using commercial or other privately available transportation options.""



""Poland has indicated to the U.S. government that U.S. citizens may now enter Poland through the land border with Ukraine,"" the State Department bulletin notes.

According to the State Department, ""U.S. citizens must present a valid U.S. passport and proof of COVID-19 vaccination"" in order to gain entry into Poland.

""Travelers are also encouraged to present a negative test result from a PCR or antigen COVID-19 test,"" the notice states.

However, Poland doesn't require U.S. citizens to be vaccinated to enter the country.

The official website of the U.S. embassy in Poland restrictions for Americans traveling to Poland:

Starting December 15, every person arriving in Poland from outside the Schengen area has to present a negative test result from a PCR or antigen COVID-19 test to enter the country. Children who are under 5 years of age are exempt from the testing requirement. There must be no more than 24 hours between obtaining the test result and crossing the border into Poland. Vaccination does not exempt an individual from the obligation to test. These regulations will be in place until February 28, 2022.

The official government website for the Republic of Poland:

Until February 28, 2022, travelers crossing the Polish border as an external EU border are required to present to a Border Guard officer a negative diagnostic test result for SARS-CoV-2, in Polish or in English, performed within 24 hours before crossing the border and counting from the time the test result was generated (the test can be performed either in the country where the person begins his/her journey, at the airport in Poland before the border check or within 3 hours after crossing the border). Any person who fails to present a negative test result to a Border Guard officer will be required to undergo a compulsory quarantine. In the event that a test is performed after crossing the border, the procedure for releasing a traveler from quarantine rests solely with the health inspection authorities, and as such, the traveler does not have to return to the border control area.

The Polish Border Guard (Straż Graniczna) COVID-19 restrictions for travelers:

In accordance with the regulations of the Regulation of the Council of Ministers of May 6, 2021 on the establishment of certain restrictions, orders and bans in connection with the outbreak of an epidemic by February 28, 2022 - every person crossing the border of the Republic of Poland, constituting the external border (as a rule) is obliged to present a negative result of the diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 (in Polish or English) to a Border Guard officer (in Polish or English) performed, mainly before crossing the border, within 24 hours, counting from the moment of obtaining this result test.

The New York Times detailed the COVID-19 restrictions for Americans traveling to Poland:

Tourists coming from the United States may enter by air only. They can avoid a mandatory quarantine by presenting a negative test result (either P.C.R. or antigen) administered no more than 24 hours before arrival. The U.S. Embassy notes that on-arrival testing is also available at Warsaw Airport. Children under 5 are exempt from the test requirement. Anyone who fails to present a negative test result must quarantine for 14 days; however, this can be shortened if the traveler obtains a negative result on a P.C.R. test that is administered no sooner than seven days after their arrival.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/state-department-ukraine-poland-vaccination,2022-02-13
State Dept. retaliates against NPR after blowup with Mike Pompeo,"The Department of State is being accused of retaliating against National Public Radio over a report that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blew up at one of its reporters over questioning about Ukraine.

The president of the State Department Correspondents' Association released a statement criticizing the State Dept. for shutting out NPR reporter Michele Kelemen from the press pool for a trip with Pompeo to Europe.

""We can only conclude that the State Department is retaliating against National Public Radio as a result of this exchange,"" Shaun Tandon said.

""Michele is a consummate professional who has covered the State Department for nearly two decades,"" Tandon added. ""We respectfully ask the State Department to reconsider and allow Michele to travel on the plane for this trip.""

Pompeo reportedly blew up at NPR's Mary Louise Kelly after she pressed him on whether he ever put out a statement of support for the former ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post.

Kelly claimed that Pompeo cursed and screamed at her and that he demanded that she point out Ukraine on a map.

Pompeo later criticized Kelly for reporting what he said was off the record, but he did not dispute her account of their interaction.

A spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union also criticized the State Dept. for its action against NPR.

""The State Department cannot retaliate against a news outlet because one of its reporters asked tough questions. It is the job of reporters to ask the tough questions, not be polite company,"" read the statement.

Lindsey Graham says FBI lied to Senate about Steele dossier,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sunday that newly declassified FBI documents from 2018 show that the bureau lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee about Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier.

""This document clearly shows that the FBI was continuing to mislead regarding the reliability of the Steele dossier,"" Graham said during an interview on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""The FBI did to the Senate Intelligence Committee what the Department of Justice and FBI had previously done to the FISA court: mischaracterize, mislead, and lie.

""The characterizations regarding the dossier were completely out of touch with reality in terms of what the Russian subsource actually said to the FBI,"" Graham told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. ""What does this mean? That Congress, as well as the FISA court, was lied to about the reliability of the Russian subsource. I will be asking FBI Director Wray to provide me all the details possible about how the briefing was arranged and who provided it.

""Somebody needs to go to jail for this,"" Graham declared. ""This is a second lie. This is a second crime. They lied to the FISA court. They got rebuked, the FBI did, in 2019 by the FISA court, putting in doubt all FISA applications ... a year before, they're lying to the Senate Intel Committee. It's just amazing the compounding of the lies.""

Graham argued that the newly released eight-page briefing document, which was obtained through the Department of Justice, shows that the FBI did not disclose any of the dossier's red flags in the Senate Intelligence briefing document.

The memo, dated Feb. 14, 2018, summarizes what Steele's primary subsource told the FBI during three days of interviews in January 2017. Igor Danchenko, a Ukraine-born, Russian-educated researcher and Brookings Institution analyst, was Steele's primary subsource who provided information to the former British spy. That information was used to create the Steele dossier, which eventually enabled the investigation into Donald Trump's possible ties to Russia before the 2016 presidential election.

""Several reports appeared to be derived from multiple sources, to include the information he provided to Steele as well as information that he had not collected,"" the memo said of the primary subsource. ""He did not cite any significant concerns with the way his reporting was characterized in the dossier to the extent he could identify it.""

Danchenko admitted to FBI agents that he ""did not know the origins"" of some claims attributed to him and ""did not recall"" other information that was included in the dossier.

Danchenko claimed that he was unaware that former MI6 officer Steele was going to include conversations into official reports, The Washington Examiner reported.

""Actually, the subsource said it was all bar talk, hearsay, speculation and conjecture, and the whole sexual activity of the president was made in jest,"" Graham said. ""So they completely misrepresented to the Senate Intel Committee in 2018 what the subsource had told the FBI in 2017.""

Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz said FBI interviews with Danchenko ""raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele election reporting"" and cast doubt on some of its most damning claims.

Horowitz also claimed that FBI interviews of Steele and Danchenko ""revealed potentially serious problems with Steele's descriptions of information in his reports.""

""I'm gonna find out who did that briefing, and whoever it is, they're in trouble,"" Graham said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/steele-dossier-fbi-trump-graham,2020-08-09
"'Excuse me, what?': Top Democrat bemoans GOP's criticism of Biden because US is 'in a time of war'","House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) sparked outrage Friday after claiming the United States is ""in a time of war"" while rebuking Republicans for criticizing President Joe Biden.

What did Hoyer say?

During a diatribe in which Hoyer chided Republicans for criticizing Biden's hostility toward oil as the U.S. experiences a gas price crisis, Hoyer suggested lawmakers' energies should be focused on the ""enemy"" because we are ""in a time of war.""

""It is unfortunate that in a time of war, that we spend all the time blaming our own president,"" Hoyer said.



Later in his speech, the No. 2 House Democrat exclaimed, ""I wish we'd get off this and really focus on the enemy— I know there's a lot of politics, but we're at war, and we need to produce energy.""

Hoyer also defended Biden's administration, claiming ""[the] Biden administration approved more drilling permits in 2021 than the Trump administration approved in the first three years they were in office."" While that is true, the number of approved drilling permits has plunged significantly this year, according to Politico.

Meanwhile, Hoyer also claimed that blame for the gas price crisis lies partially at the feet of oil companies, accusing them of focusing on profits despite the energy crisis. However, economists with the Federal Reserve of Dallas have debunked this Democratic talking point.

What was the reaction?

Republican lawmakers expressed concern over Hoyer's remarks because Congress has not declared war on Russia.

In fact, the last time Congress formally declared war came in December 1941 when the U.S. declared war against the Axis powers of World War II.

""Which country are we at war with, @LeaderHoyer? I don't remember a Declaration of War coming up for a vote recently,"" Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-N.M.) said.

""'In a time of war.' — did we vote on a declaration of war? Asking for a friend,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) asked.

""'In a time of war.' — did we vote on a declaration of war? Asking for a friend,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) asked. ""*checks notes* Excuse me, what?"" Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) reacted.

""Congress has not voted to go to war. What is wrong with you, @LeaderHoyer?"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) asked.

Outgoing-White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about Hoyer's comments Friday afternoon, but she did not offer any real clarification.

""I did not see the full context of his comments. What I'm betting he was referring to was the war in Ukraine with Russia that obviously the U.S. has a stake in given the amount of military, humanitarian, economic assistance we've provided,"" Psaki said.

Stephen Colbert suggests Fox News reporter should be slapped over his question to Biden,"Late night television host Stephen Colbert suggested that a Fox News reporter should be slapped over his questions to President Joe Biden during his latest media briefing.

Colbert made the comments during the opening monologue on this show Tuesday.

""Yesterday, President Biden held a press conference, and he was asked a ridiculous question by a ridiculous man, Fox News reporter and that one kid in high school who wears a suit to gym class, Peter Doocy,"" said Colbert before running video of the exchange between Doocy and Biden.

""You said a chemical weapon used by Russia would trigger a response in kind,"" said Doocy in the clip.

""It will trigger a significant response,"" Biden replied.

""What does that mean?"" asked Doocy.

""I'm not gonna tell you. Why would I tell you? You gotta be silly!"" Biden responded.

""Remember how on last night's who I said that slapping is never ever the answer?"" Colbert continued. ""I'd like to file a one time exemption on behalf of the president of the United States.""

Colbert's audience applauded the notion that Doocy deserved to be slapped. He went on to joke that Doocy might ask Biden what the nuclear launch codes were, and he received tepid laughter from the audience.

The liberal late night host was referring to the controversial slap movie star Will Smith gave to comedian Chris Rock during the Oscars awards ceremony.

The clip was a part of a longer exchange where Doocy challenged Biden on several recent gaffes that have put his competency into question. Among those was the claim that the U.S. would use chemical weapons in Ukraine if Russia used them first. The White House clarified that they would not use chemical weapons, but said a significant response would be made if Russia did first use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Doocy has faced many rhetorical slings and arrows from the left because of his combative and challenging exchanges with Biden and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki over the policies of the administration.

Stock market crashes in worst day since pandemic over fears of a recession,"The stock market crashed in the worst day since the pandemic outbreak in 2020 over fears that the economy was heading into a recession after several companies reported weak earnings.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,136 points, or 3.5%, while the S&P 500 dropped by 4% and the Nasdaq composite fell by 4.6%.

Wednesday's losses added to investors' woes over a month of declining values.

Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, explained that earnings from retail companies set off the market collapse.



“Today’s broad-based market selloff concerns the ability of companies to pass along higher costs, something that was questioned but which found somewhat of an answer with the retailer’s earnings reports,” wrote Krosby.

“To be sure, consumers continue to spend, but many of the top retailers are unable to pass along the higher labor costs and higher prices wrought by a still constrained supply chain,"" he added.

Among those were Target, which reported lower earnings despite having an increase of sales because inflation had made its expenses grow at a larger rate. Target's stock dropped by more than a quarter as a result.

""Higher costs coupled with more cautious consumers have the market worrying about the prospect of a recession,"" Krosby added.

The market also appeared to respond to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday that the Fed was willing to hike up interest rates even more in order to battle inflation.

On Monday, a Morgan Stanley analysis said that the ""excessive"" fiscal stimulus spending from the Biden administration was to blame for ""turbocharged"" consumption and surging inflation.

""In other words, we created too much demand for the supply chains to handle. The fact that the supply chains had been impaired to some degree only exacerbated the shortages and inflation, especially for consumer goods,"" the analysis read.



Voters said in a recent poll that they blame Biden's policies for inflation more than any other cause, including the invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and supposed corporate greed.

New poll shows a crucial voting demographic is unimpressed with the impeachment hearings,"A new poll shows that the crucial swing demographic of independents appears to be unimpressed with the impeachment campaign by Democrats against President Donald Trump.

According to the Politico-Morning Consult poll, independent voters increased their opposition to the impeachment inquiry by 10 percentage points after several days of contentious impeachment hearings.

The poll was released on Tuesday.

It also marked that among independents the support of the impeachment inquiry dropped by 7 percentage points, from 47 percent to 40 percent.

Independent voters are considered a key demographic because those voters are easier to sway to one side and determine the winner of an election.

Overall, support for impeachment among all respondents fell by 2 points to 48 percent, while opposition increased from 42 percent to 45 percent.

Congressional hearings conducted by the Democrats aim to substantiate the claims from a government whistleblower that the president inappropriately withheld military support from Ukraine in order to pressure the opening of an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Republican supporters of the president have accused the Democrats of inventing charges and abusing their political power in order to damage Trump ahead of the 2020 election.

A separate Ipsos-Reuters poll found that more Americans who saw the impeachment hearings grew supportive of the inquiry than those grew in opposition to it.

"Support for impeachment rising, majority of Americans believe Ukraine phone call a 'serious' problem","Recent polling conducted in the aftermath of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump shows Americans are concerned about Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Nearly two-third of Americans believe the communications between Trump and Zelensky constitute a ""serious problem,"" according to an ABC News/Ipsos Poll released Sunday.

Nearly half of the respondents — 43 percent — told ABC/Ipsos the communications are a ""very serious"" problem, while another 21 percent said they are a ""somewhat serious"" problem. Only 17 percent said the communications are ""not serious at all.""

During the conversation, which took place in July, Trump allegedly pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Although Ukraine denies Trump pressured Zelensky, the White House released the call transcript last week, solidifying in the minds of many that the president is indeed guilty of pushing Ukraine to conduct an investigation into the Biden's.

While the poll found Americans are concerned about Trump's conversation with Zelensky, a majority — 83 percent — told ABC/Ipsos they are not surprised about what Trump allegedly did.

Meanwhile, support for impeachment is also rising.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggests biased senators shouldn't participate in impeachment trial,"Liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said senators need to be impartial in carrying out their role as the ""jury"" in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

Ginsburg, 86, was asked during a BBC interview about Republican senators who have already said they will vote to acquit Trump, before the trial has even started.

""The House indicts, and the Senate tries. Should a trier be impartial? Of course, that's the job of an impartial judge,"" Ginsburg said.

BBC News' Razia Iqbal pressed further, saying that it's ""problematic"" that senators have already made up their minds.

""Well, if a judge said that, a judge would be disqualified from sitting on the case,"" Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg is correct — in a perfect world, jurors would hear a case and make an impartial decision. It's also true that, in this perfect world, prosecutors would primarily be motivated to press charges due to the strength of the evidence, rather than a desire to take down a political opponent.



In the case of this impeachment, Democrats decided years ago that they would like to charge President Trump with a crime, then they set out looking for things that might possibly rise to that level of wrongdoing. Whether one believes Trump's behavior toward Ukraine is impeachable or not, the motivations behind the impeachment are undeniably politically biased.

It becomes pointless to long for an environment in which impeachment is free of political bias. There were Democratic ""prosecutors"" declaring their intention to charge Trump long ago, before the transgression in question was even committed. And, senators from both parties on the ""jury"" have publicly made up their minds from the start about whether the evidence warrants a conviction.

If biased senators were not allowed to participate in the impeachment trial, there might be no senators involved at all, and maybe no trial — which might be best for everyone involved. And there's still, apparently, some hope for that outcome.

Susan Rice blasts Trump for keeping transcript on top-secret server — then admits Obama did the same,"Former national security adviser Susan Rice slammed President Donald Trump for storing the notes from his phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a top-secret server — then admitted the Obama administration stored communications on the same server.



Speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, Rice tore into the Trump administration for ""unprecedented"" actions, claiming officials have attempted to ""bury"" information.

""What [the Trump administration] did instead of storing it in the normal system, which is protected and classified, even though there was no classified substance in that actual discussion,"" Rice said. ""Instead of putting it where it normally resides, they hid it on a very highly sensitive, highly compartmented server that very few people in the U.S. government have access to in order to bury it.""

Then Rice was asked by the moderator how often the Obama administration did what she is criticizing the Trump administration for doing.

""We never moved them over unless they were legitimately, in the contents, classified,"" she admitted

Despite admitting the phone conversation transcript was not a verbatim transcript — therefore acknowledging the exact contents of the call have not been publicized — Rice claimed the conversation between Trump and Zelensky did not meet the standard to be stored on the top-secret server.

""It's rare that a presidential conversation would be classified to that highest level — it's not impossible, it's very rare — even when two leaders are discussing classified information,"" she said. ""Here's a case where there was nothing classified and it was moved to the most secure, sensitive server.""

However, ABC News reported the White House has stored conversations between Trump and foreign leaders on secure servers since 2017. A source who spoke to ABC News called the practice ""basically standard operating procedure.""

The White House reportedly began storing the conversations on secured servers after two calls — one between Trump and the leader of Mexico and another between Trump and the leader of Australia — were leaked in 2017.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/susan-rice-blasts-trump-for-keeping-transcript-on-top-secret-server-then-admits-obama-did-the-same,2019-09-28
"Suspected arson levels Trump supporter's garage, vehicles. Graffiti at the scene reads 'Biden 2020,' 'BLM.' (UPDATED)","UPDATE, July 18, 2022: The Trump supporter staged the arson, prosecutors said.

Original story below

A Trump supporter's garage was set ablaze in what authorities are saying could be an act of arson.

What are the details ?

According to WCCO-TV, Minnesota officials are investigating a fire that demolished a family's garage and three of their vehicles.

The fire broke out Wednesday morning at Dennis Molla's residence in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.

Molla, an immigrant from Ukraine, told the Star Tribune that he's in disbelief that someone could target another person in such a way for differing political beliefs.

""I think things have gotten way out of control,"" he told the outlet. ""I'm not one of those confrontational people. ... I just feel very sorry for my parents, just because they wanted to leave the USSR for us to have a better future and life in America. ... For them to see me express my beliefs as a Republican, it's crazy to think it came down to this.""

The family, in a since-deleted Facebook post, wrote, ""This morning, at 3:48am our house was supposedly targeted by BLM/Antifa. We woke up to a loud explosion, and saw that our camper was on fire, along with both of Dennis's trucks, his garage, and our entire back yard. Thank God our main house is safe. We are safe. Our children are safe. Thank you so much to the Brooklyn Center Police Department, Minnesota for helping us get our family out of the house, and a special thanks to officer C. Jordan and another officer and firefighters for saving our dogs. He said it was so ht they almost had to leave them. Thank you God we are alive and safe, and pray that justice is served.""

The family's garage also had graffiti sprayed on it, reading, ""Biden 2020"" and ""BLM"" as well as what appeared to be an anarchy symbol.

'My son smells like smoke'

Dennis' wife, Deana, told the outlet that when the family heard the explosion, Dennis ""climbed out of a basement window in his boxers and T-shirt, and saw three people running and picked up a box of matches.""



She said that two of the vehicles that burned had an American flag and a Trump 2020 flag on them.

She also added that the timing of the fire seemed rather suspicious.

""She recalled a troubling experience her husband had about 10 days ago while working in downtown Minneapolis on a construction site,"" the Star Tribune reported. ""His pickup with the Trump flag was parked nearby, when someone 'drove by slowly and took pictures,' she said, and feces was later left at his vehicle when he went on a water break.""

""[The suspects] saw that we have a jungle gym and toys in the backyard,"" she told the outlet. ""To put our babies in harm's way because you don't agree with our politics; just don't put our kids in danger. My son smells like smoke.""

'This fire is considered suspicious and our investigation remains extremely active'

In a Wednesday statement, the Brooklyn Center Police Department said:



Just before 4:00 am, Brooklyn Center police officers and firefighters were dispatched to the report of an explosion and fire in the area of 69th Ave N and Morgan Ave N in Brooklyn Center. Officers located a fire at a residence in the 6900 block of Morgan Ave N. Firefighters quickly extinguished the fire, but not before a detached three car garage and three vehicles were destroyed. There was minor damage to the house. There were no injuries during this incident. Officers and firefighters were able to save the three dogs in kennels and four puppies located in the garage.* This fire is considered suspicious and our investigation remains extremely active. The home occupants had a fairly large “Trump 2020"" sign that was destroyed, and our officers observed what appeared to be fresh spray paint on the garage before it burned down. The spray paint included “Biden 2020"", “BLM"" and capital letter “A"" with a circle around it.

The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also investigating the fire. A reward of $5,000 is being offered for information on the case. Tips can be called in to 1-800-723-2020.

"Norwegian fishermen find beluga whale, suspect it of being a Russian spy","Norwegian fishermen discovered a beluga whale affixed with Russian gear last week, sparking fears that the Kremlin is further weaponizing sea mammals to assist in its naval operations.

What are the details?

Last week, a fleet of commercial vessels was ""harassed"" by a suspected ""spy"" whale in the waters of Arctic Norway, The Washington Post reported. The animal repeatedly nudged up against the boats, when one crew noticed the beluga was wearing a tight harness.

A team from Norway's Directorate of Fisheries — trained to release sea animals from netting and other foreign objects — responded to the scene and helped a local fisherman free the whale. According to the Daily Mail, the harness was branded with a logo which read, ""equipment of St. Petersburg,"" and had a camera mount.

Martin Biuw of Norway's Institute of Marine Research reportedly told local outlet NRK, ""If this whale comes from Russia — and there is great reason to believe it — then it is not Russian scientists, but rather the navy that has done this.""

The Guardian reported that in 2017, state-owned Russian media outlet TV Zvedzda revealed the Kremlin paid for research and training to measure the effectiveness of beluga whales, seals, and dolphins for military purposes. The navy wanted to determine whether the whales, in particular, could be used to ""guard entrances to naval bases"" and ""assist deepwater divers and if necessary kill any strangers who enter their territory.""

But researchers reportedly discovered dolphins and sea lions made better weapons than beluga whales.

According to the Mirror, Russia President Vladimir Putin has bolstered his fleet of operatives from the animal kingdom in recent years. In 2014, Russian military commanders boasted of taking control of Ukraine's ""13 highly-trained military dolphins and sea lions it claimed were trained to hunt underwater mines, attack enemy divers with special knives and pistols attached to their heads, and plant bombs on boats.""

Anything else?

Russia shares a 120-mile border with NATO ally Norway, and in the past three years has stepped up what CBS News called the Kremlin's ""mounting belligerence in the region.""

In regard to the beluga discovered last week, CBS reported, ""If what the Norwegian fishermen found is evidence of a current program by Russia's military, the Norwegians and their NATO partners might need to start looking for much smaller weapons of war, too — weapons with flippers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/suspected-spy-whale-with-russian-harness-found-by-norwegian-fisherman,2019-04-29
Bad sign for Pelosi and Schiff: Swing state Democrat just changed her mind on impeachment,"Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) told a Michigan radio show Monday morning that she now favors censuring President Donald Trump, rather than impeaching him, over his dealings with Ukraine.

According to the Washington Examiner, Lawrence told ""No BS News Hour"" show host Charlie LeDuff that she does not favor impeaching and removing the president from office.

'I want to censure'

""We are so close to an election. I will tell you, sitting here knowing how divided this country is, I don't see the value of taking him out of office,"" she said. ""I do see the value of putting down a marker saying his behavior is not acceptable.""

The representative added, ""I want to censure. I want it on the record that the House of Representatives did their job and they told this president and any president coming behind him that this is unacceptable behavior and, under our Constitution, we will not allow it.""

The Examiner also noted that Lawrence told the radio program host that she would have a ""discussion with the party and with the caucus"" to make her current sentiments known on impeachment, which apparently, have changed over the past month.

On Oct. 4, Lawrence appeared in a different radio program and seemed to back impeachment at the time.

Washington Post: House Democrats are getting 'cold feet'

Lawrence's change of heart comes as Washington Post reporter Rachel Bade said that some House Democrats are increasingly hesitant to impeach Trump.

""We are hearing behind the scenes there are more moderate getting cold feet and it all comes back to these [anti-impeachment] ads and people being afraid of being punished for voting to impeach the president,"" Bade told CNN.

At least one poll taken in Lawrence's neighboring state of Wisconsin showed voters opposed to impeaching Trump. A survey released last week by Marquette University found that 40 percent of Wisconsinites back impeaching the president while 53 percent oppose. Several national polls have also found public opinion moving in Trump's favor.

Also, there has been significant movement among independents who, according to a comparison of Emerson College surveys taken in November and October, have swung 24 points against impeaching the president over the last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/swing-state-democrat-just-changed-her-mind-on-impeachment,2019-11-26
Washington Post analysis confirms Dems are losing impeachment argument in key swing states,"An analysis by the Washington Post's polling experts has bad news for Democrats hoping the Ukraine scandal would weaken President Trump.

After months of bad headlines and two weeks of public testimonies, voters in key battleground states are not buying the Democrats' impeachment case against the president. The Post's average of a dozen polls conducted since October in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Wisconsin found that 51 percent of voters are opposed to impeachment and 44 percent support it.

Pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin also noted: ""Battleground state polls show a more negative reaction to the impeachment inquiry, signaling more risk to Democrats and potential benefit for Trump,"" adding that ""support for impeachment in key 2020 states lags the country overall.""

Nationally, voters remain divided



As TheBlaze has pointed out, support for impeaching Trump spiked nationally on or around October 14, just a few weeks after the Ukraine scandal broke in late September. However, public opinion began turning on the Democrats the more voters learned about their case.

Clement and Guskin looked at the polls before and after the House Intelligence Committee's public hearings and found little movement:



The Post's average of nationally representative polls conducted since the start of the House's public hearings on Nov. 13 finds 47 percent of Americans support impeaching and removing Trump, while 43 percent are opposed. That level of support is little different from the 47 percent support in the two weeks before hearings began and 48 percent support earlier in October.

The two analysts noted that Independent voters are also divided on impeachment: 42 percent in support and 44 percent opposed.

Trump's popularity has 'barely moved'

Additionally, the Post examined Trump's job approval ratings, which are a baseline indicator of how voters feel about his performance, and found they have ""barely moved"" since the Democrats initiated their impeachment inquiry.

The stability of Trump's approval ratings affirms just how locked-in Americans are in their views toward Trump, even as some independents and Democrats changed their opinion on whether Congress should impeach and remove him from office. The lack of movement in this essential measure of Trump's political standing also indicates that while most Americans think Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, news and congressional testimony about this issue have not shifted how people feel about the president.

According to Gallup's polling over the past 10 weeks, the percentage of voters who say they approve of the job Trump is doing as president has remained within the range of 39 to 43 percent. Quinnipiac University polls show similar numbers with 38 to 41 percent of registered voters approving of Trump's performance during the same period.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/swing_state_polls_impeachment,2019-12-03
Taiwan reports Chinese aircraft in its air defense zone after Russia invaded Ukraine,"Nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone, Taiwan's defense ministry said Thursday, on the same day that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Tawian reported eight J-16 sorties and one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft flying over an area to the northeast of the Pratas Islands, at the top end of the South China Sea, which prompted the island nation to scramble its air force. According to Reuters, the number of aircraft involved in the incursion is smaller than the last large-scale incident, when 39 Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwanese territory on Jan. 23.

China claims Taiwan, the seat of the exiled Republic of China government, as its own territory, and over the past two years it has regularly conducted fly-over missions in Taiwanese air space.

Taiwanese fighters were deployed to warn the Chinese aircraft to back off and air defense missiles were set up to ""monitor the activities,"" the defense ministry said, according to Reuters.

The government in Taipei is paying close attention to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the response from Western governments over concerns that China may use the situation to move against the island.

Chinese officials have dismissed comparisons between the situation in Ukraine, where Russia has claimed historical ties to the region as a pretext to invade, and China's relationship with Taiwan.



On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry said that Taiwan is ""not Ukraine"" and claimed the territory has always been part of China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made those remarks responding to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have widespread consequences, including for Taiwan, if the western nations failed to rally to support Ukraine.

""Taiwan is not Ukraine,"" Hua said while speaking in Beijing. ""Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact.""

After Russia began its attack on Thursday, Hua refused to condemn Putin's actions and urged western nations to refrain from intervening.

""We are closely following the situation and we need more information to make our judgement, isn't that enough?"" Hua said.



U.S. defense officials have previously warned there is an ""urgent"" need to strengthen Taiwan's defenses against the ""real and dangerous"" possibility of an attempt by China to invade the nation.

""Bolstering Taiwan's defenses is an urgent task,"" Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said in December. ""We are modernizing our capabilities, updating U.S. force posture and developing new operational concepts.""

Reacting to U.S. policy in the region, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said Thursday that Taiwan remains a ""core issue"" for China and that foreign interference will not be tolerated, Reuters reported.

""We urge the U.S. side to recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue,"" Tan said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taiwan-reports-chinese-aircraft-in-its-air-defense-zone-after-russia-invaded-ukraine,2022-02-24
'What world do you guys live in?' — Jake Tapper to top Democrat after Nancy Pelosi's stalling gambit fails,"CNN's Jake Tapper pressured Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) on the Democrats' impeachment stalling gambit failing after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced that Republicans had enough votes to set their own trial rules.

""With all due respect, this leverage gambit does not seem to have worked!"" said Tapper.



""Well, he should still just do the right thing,"" responded Swalwell, who is on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee.

""You know, having the votes is one thing, but if you have a key witness that the House was not able to obtain who is now saying he is willing to come forward, the right thing seems to be, well, let's hear from this witness,"" he added, referring to John Bolton, the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump.

Swalwell would not answer if the House should subpoena Bolton if the Senate refuses to call to him to testify. He also would not answer if Pelosi should send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.

""I guess I wonder just like what world do you guys live in, if you think that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is gonna get his robe dirty with the political tenor of this, or Mitch McConnell is gonna feel in any way pressured to do the trial the way House Democrats want to do it, when this is a guy that wouldn't even have a hearing for Merrick Garland,"" Tapper pressed.

""I understand you live in a world where things should be in a certain way but that's not the world that I live in!"" he added.

""Yeah, well, I live in a world where these Senators have constituents to answer to, and my hope is that they will be calling their senators and saying in any trial when you have a witness come forward who has seen a lot, who called this Ukraine scheme a drug deal, you should allow that person to testify,"" Swalwell responded.

""I hope the phones are ringing right now, and senators are still persuaded by what their constituents actually think,"" he concluded.

Pelosi has not indicated if she will sent the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but many Democrats called for her to do just that after McConnell announced he had the votes to run the trial without their demands.

""I think the speaker should send the articles regardless. I think the time has passed,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on Tuesday. ""She should send the articles over.""

"Student records teacher ranting about vaccines, 2020 election, Hunter Biden. Mom melts down, says son is 'damaged,' 'hurt,' and 'scared' over pro-Trump remarks.","A Ventura, California, middle school history teacher has sparked outrage after reportedly making politically charged comments in the classroom, which were, in turn, covertly recorded by a student and released.

One mother was so moved by the reported discussion that she told a local TV station that her relationship with her son — who she said is ""hurt"" and ""scared"" — has been damaged.

What are the details?

KCAL-TV reported Monday that an unnamed female middle school history teacher at Anacapa Middle School was caught discussing vaccines, the 2020 presidential election, and other politically charged topics.

One parent, Sarah Silikula, told the station that she's always told her son that if he ever found himself uncomfortable in the classroom, he should pull out his cell phone and begin filming whatever was making him uneasy.

He did just that — and Silikula said that her eighth-grade son came home from school with the recording and was ""very upset"" and confused.

""He got in the car and he was very upset,"" she said. ""He announced, 'I'm never getting vaccinated. I'm never getting any more shots of any kind. Did you know Trump's still president?'""

On the seven-minute recording, the unnamed teacher can be heard saying, ""People need to wake up and see the government has way too much power right now.""

The teacher reportedly added, ""Hunter Biden, for example, is doing deals with China and Ukraine where he was funneling money illegally. He also had child pornography on his laptop. He was having sexual intercourse with his own niece.""

Elsewhere, the teacher reportedly discussed vaccines.

""If you have a baby in the hospital, they don't want to give it back if you're not vaccinated,"" the person on the recording said. ""This is a complete power control threat.""

According to KCAL, the teacher also made remarks about the U.S. justice system as well as the 2020 presidential election.

The district in a statement said that it conducted an investigation into the incident and announced that it does not condone the discussion that took place. The district, according to the station, is following the ""progressive discipline policy"" outlined with the teachers' union and moved Silikula's son to another class.

What else did the parent say?

Silikula was so outraged that she was moved to tears and demanded that the school take greater action against the teacher.

Weeping, she told KCAL, ""I mean, why? Why does that need to be said in this classroom full of children?""



""I trusted her to teach him the facts about history, and she went off on this rant like a preacher on a pulpit,"" she insisted and said that the incident damaged her relationship with her son.

""When he first got in the car and said, 'Dad, teachers know everything. She's right, Dad. You're wrong.' He's damaged. He's hurt. He's scared. He doesn't trust his parents now. He thinks we lied to him,"" she said. ""Whatever anybody's political belief is, I respect. It's their belief. Don't impose it on my child who I trusted in your care.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-vaccines-election-hunter-biden-mother-upset,2021-11-03
Ted Cruz hammers Biden for claiming the Russian invasion is solely to blame for high gas prices: 'This is a flat-out lie',"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ripped into President Joe Biden (D) for attempting to pin all of the blame on higher gas prices on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Cruz was referring to comments from Biden to reporters on Tuesday saying that gas prices would get worse, but he was powerless to do anything about it.

""They're going to go up,"" said Biden about gas prices.

""Can't do much right now. Russia's responsible,"" he added.

Cruz took to Twitter to refute the claim from the president.

""This is a flat-out lie. Gas prices have increased 48% under Biden—BEFORE RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE. Biden did that,"" Cruz tweeted.

He went on to list the policies that Biden pursued which have led to higher gas prices prior to the Russian invasion, including his opposition to the Keystone pipeline, freezing federal oil leases, and shutting down drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Cruz explained his criticism in a guest appearance on CNBC Tuesday morning where he hammered away at Biden's energy policies.

""It really is striking, in 2019 the United States became a net energy exporter, we are an oil and gas superpower, and yet under Joe Biden last year, for the first time since then America stopped being a net energy exporter, as our production went down,"" Cruz said.

""And the result of Biden's presidency has been that the enemies of America, countries like Russia, like Iran, like Venezuela are all getting stronger, getting richer, getting more aggressive, getting more hostile,"" he continued, ""because the president is simultaneously weakening our own ability to produce energy and strengthening their ability to produce energy.""

NBC reported that the shift in messaging was purposeful by the White House after taking the blame for gas prices and increasing inflation before the invasion.

Ted Cruz calls for American energy independence in proposed legislation,"Republican Senator from Texas Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to restore American energy independence as the global energy sector experiences ongoing difficulties in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Fox Business reported that Cruz announced the “Energy Freedom Act” in a Friday press release that he also used to criticize President Joe Biden for allowing America to fall behind on its ability to export fuel.

Cruz said that the Biden administration has caused America to lose its “status as a net petroleum exporter.”

In the press release, Cruz said, “These policies have poured billions of dollars into countries such as Russia and Iran, which use those funds to attack our allies and undermine the national security of America.”

“President Biden has imposed more restrictions on U.S. oil companies than he has on Russian oil,” Cruz said, “With Iran, he has looked the other way as the regime busted through sanctions and raised their exports to more than one million barrels per day for the first time in almost three years.”

Cruz said that should his legislation pass, it would provide an economic boon for the country while enabling the United States to reduce trade with countries it hopes to punish on the international stage.

Cruz said that his bill is focused on “[reversing] Biden’s actions so we can restore American energy independence” and that it “won’t cost taxpayers a dime” While creating “Billions in revenue in the coming years’ For the United States “by expediting permitting, leasing, safe new pipelines, and exports, and providing much needed regulatory certainty.”

He said, “It would create new jobs, lower energy costs, and because modern energy production in the United States is far cleaner than in any other country by every measure, it would help the environment. The Energy Freedom Act would put a stop to the Biden administration’s sabotage of the American energy industry, and Congress should take it up without delay.”

Cruz also recently amplified statements made by tech CEO Elon Musk calling for American energy independence.

Musk took to Twitter and said, “Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil [and] gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.”

Responding emphatically, Cruz said that he “couldn’t agree more.”

Some of the Biden administration’s first actions in office were to restrict American oil drilling. Upon entering the White House, Biden revoked the Keystone XL pipeline’s permit to transport fossil fuels and moved to prevent the issuing of new leases to drill for oil and gas on federal lands.

These steps considerably reduced the amount of energy being domestically produced and has led to American leadership considering the purchase of oil from hostile nations like Iran.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-calls-for-american-energy-independence-in-proposed-legislation,2022-03-06
VIDEO: Ted Cruz rips Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over New York Post censorship,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Wednesday grilled Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Twitter's censorship of the New York Post at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on tech companies and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

At the hearing, the CEOs of Twitter, Google, and Facebook testified on whether Big Tech's immunity from lawsuits under Section 230 has enabled ""bad behavior.""



""Of the three players before us, I think Twitter's conduct has by far been the most egregious,"" Cruz said.

Cruz began by asking Dorsey if Twitter has the ability to influence elections, which Dorsey denied.

""So you testify to this committee right now that Twitter, when it silences people, when it censors people, when it blocks political speech, that has no impact on elections?"" Cruz asked.

""People have choice of other communication channels,"" Dorsey responded.

""Not if they don't hear information,"" Cruz responded.

Turning to Twitter's censorship of the New York Post, Cruz said the company had ""crossed a threshold that is fundamental in our country.

""Two weeks ago, Twitter made the unilateral decision to censor the New York Post in a series of two blockbuster articles, both alleging evidence of corruption against Joe Biden, the first concerning Ukraine, the second concerning communist China,"" Cruz said. ""And Twitter made the decision, number one, to prevent users — any user — from sharing those stories. And number two, you went even further and blocked the New York Post from sharing on Twitter its own reporting. Why did Twitter make the decision to censor the New York Post?""

Dorsey explained that the Post articles appeared to violate Twitter's hacked materials policy by publishing screenshots of emails while it was unclear how the emails were obtained. He said that the decision to block users from sharing the Post story was ""incorrect"" and that Twitter ""changed it.""

But Cruz interjected, noting that the Post is still locked out of its Twitter account. Dorsey explained that if the Post logged into its account and deleted the original tweet that fell under Twitter's enforcement actions, the account would be restored and the Post would be able to share the same material without censorship. But Cruz wasn't having it.

""So Mr. Dorsey, your ability is you have the power to force a media outlet — let's be clear, the New York Post isn't just some random guy tweeting ... and your position is that you can sit in Silicon Valley and demand of the media that you can tell them what stories they can publish and you can tell the American people what reporting they can hear,"" Cruz said.

Cruz said Twitter's hacked material policy claims were ""highly dubious and clearly employed in a deeply partial way.""



""Mr. Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear, and why do you persist in behaving as a Democratic super PAC, silencing views to the contrary of your political beliefs?"" Cruz demanded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-jack-dorsey-new-york-post,2020-10-28
'Stop playing the nasty Washington game!' — Ted Cruz slaps down reporter over question about his children,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) got into a heated interaction with a reporter after a pointed question that involved his two daughters.

The exchange happened during a media briefing about the impeachment trial in the Senate on Monday.

Cruz was criticizing Democrats for arguing that President Donald Trump had only sought to investigate corruption in Ukraine in order to damage his political rival.

""We've just seen two hours of evidence. And at a minimum, it was not only reasonable and justified, but the president, I think, had an obligation to investigate corruption that potentially extended to the very highest levels of the government,"" said Cruz.

A reporter interrupted.

""Hunter Biden got a job. His dad was vice president,"" the reporter interjected. ""If that's a crime, shouldn't half your children be in prison?""

""My children are 9 and 11, so I'm sorry you want to throw a 9-year-old in prison,"" Cruz responded, to some laughter.

""But at this point, my third-grader plays basketball and softball at her school, so stop playing the nasty Washington game!"" he added.

""I'm sorry, it's not a nasty Washington game,"" the reporter objected.

""Attacking a 9-year-old?"" Cruz shot back.

Hunter Biden has become embroiled in the scandal surrounding Ukraine because of his employment at a Ukrainian energy company during his father's tenure in the Obama administration.

Ted Cruz nails the lawyers' trick that 'deceptive' Democrats are using in the impeachment trial,"With the precision of a highly trained attorney, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz dismantled on Saturday some of the major fallacies in the Democrats' impeachment case.

In an episode of ""Verdict with Ted Cruz,"" the Cuban-American Republican senator from the Lone Star State broke down the old lawyers' trick that Democrats employed in their closing statements before the Senate.

Asked by Daily Wire host Michael Knowles if the Democrats' arguments were deceptive, Cruz's answer was unequivocal: ""Yes ... and they were deceptive using lots of different tools.""

Cruz continued, ""Here's a particular logical construct that the House managers use to be deceptive. They used this several times, and it's a logical construct of 'X, not Y.'""

The Democrats' tools of deception

The Texas senator went on to explain what he means by ""X, not Y"" and illustrate the different rhetorical tools that Democrats are using to deceive senators and the American public:

They say, for example, that ""President Trump and Republicans bought the narrative that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election."" Now, X is right, Ukraine did interfere in 2016. The lie, the deception, is the ""not Y."" ... It is obvious that Russia ... did interfere in 2016 ... that happened, and anyone who looks at the evidence recognizes that. The fact that Russia did [interfere] doesn't mean no other country did.



Knowles noted, ""It's true that the Republicans are saying that Ukraine interfered, but it's not true that Republicans are also saying, 'Therefore, Russia did not interfere.'""

""And it would be false,"" Cruz responded. ""If we said 'Russia did not interfere,' that's a false statement.""

Cruz then delivered another example of how the House managers are using misleading arguments.

What the House managers said over and over and over again is: ""The president wanted the announcement of an investigation and not an actual investigation."" X, and not Y. There's lots of evidence Trump wanted an investigation announced. There is zero evidence that Trump didn't want an actual investigation. And the House managers asserted over and over and over again ""an announcement, and not an actual investigation."" They've never cited any evidence whatsoever. By the way, think about it, in what universe would Trump not want an investigation?

A 'lawyerly sleight of hand'

The Daily Wire host observed the notion that Trump only wanted an announcement of an investigation ""makes no sense.""

""The Democrats' trick here is that they're making a true statement, and they're using the true statement to cover up for the false statement that they say immediately afterward? Knowles asked,

""Yes, and the media does this all the time,"" Cruz stated, adding, ""That logical construct, 'X and not Y,' is a real giveaway that they're engaging in lawyerly sleight of hand.""

Cruz also noted that ""X and not Y"" is a go-to trick used by House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

""By the way,"" he added, ""Adam Schiff says it very smoothly, he says it smiling, and to date, I haven't seen anyone actually contradicting it and pointing out that half of that sentence is total deception.""

Knowles, who was noticeably impressed by the senator's analysis, observed, ""That's an incredibly deceptive trick.""

""There's a reason lawyers are so beloved,"" a smiling Cruz sarcastically quipped.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted_cruz_slight_of_hand_deceptive_dems,2020-01-26
"Teen who tracked Elon Musk's private jet now following Putin, Russian oligarchs","The teenager who famously launched a Twitter account that tracks tech billionaire Elon Musk's private jet is now monitoring the travel activity of Russian President Vladimir Putin and several Russian oligarchs.

What are the details?

Jack Sweeney, a 19-year-old freshman student at the University of Central Florida, runs the accounts by programming bots to monitor flight tracking data and tweet every time a certain plane departs one airport or lands at another.

Now under Sweeney's gaze on an account called ""Russian Oligarch Jets"" are 39 planes and helicopters belonging to 19 oligarchs — including Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich, steel magnate Alexander Abramov, Vladimir Potanin, and Norilsk Nickel, among others.

Another account, called ""Russian VIP & Putin Jets,"" seeks to monitor the travel of other high-profile members of Russia's elite class and perhaps even the notorious Russian president himself.

Though Sweeney was careful to note that data coming from this account might not be ""too accurate"" given the sheer number of private jets and issues relating to aircraft coverage in Russia. Likewise, Putin is not necessarily known to be a jet-setter.

What else?

The accounts only started days ago but have already garnered massive followings due to the worldwide attention being given to Russian leaders amid the country's unprovoked invasion of neighboring country, Ukraine.

“It’s just been crazy,” Sweeney told NBC News. ""I just figured some people would be interested in it. I just didn't think all kinds of people would be.""

He added that ""people have been asking me about Putin for a while. They wanted to know if they could track him.""

As of Tuesday afternoon, the account tracking Russian oligarchs had attracted more than 180,000 followers. The account tracking Putin, which was launched later, had attracted more than 30,000 followers.

The college freshman added that he knew almost nothing about the Russian power structure heading into the weekend.

""Before this, I didn’t even know there were these [influential] oligarchs like this,"" he said. ""They probably do have a decent amount of power from what I can understand.""

Others, however, are well aware of the influence such men have and are eager to penalize them in any way they can for Russia's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, a move that has destabilized global politics.

Anything else?

The oligarchs were apparently on the move this week, as jets and helicopters owned by Abramovich moved from Moscow to distant locations such as Basseterre in Sint Kitts and Baku, Azerbaijan. aircraft owned by Abramov touched down in London, England, and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.



Interestingly, one of Abramov's private jets landed in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday afternoon.

Starting Sunday, Russian aircraft were no longer permitted to fly in airspace owned by the European Union, Reuters reported. While the U.S. is reportedly considering similar action, no decision has been made.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teen-tracks-russian-oligarchs-flights,2022-03-01
"'Tell him I will thrash them,' Putin reportedly declares as he rejects a handwritten bid for peace from Zelenskyy","Roman Abramovich, the former owner of the Chelsea FC soccer team, in recent weeks has been serving as an impromptu diplomat as he works to convey messages between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Abramovich, a fabulously wealthy Russian businessman, is currently attempting to avoid Western sanctions on his wealth by residing in Istanbul, Turkey. Aside from his business endeavors, Abramovich is well known for his close relationship with Putin.

From his residence in Turkey, Abramovich has been acting as a “peacemaker,” according to the Daily Mail, as he flies back and forth between Moscow and Ukraine communicating with Putin and Zelenskyy.

Last Wednesday, Abramovich left his Istanbul residence aboard a private jet for Moscow.

The oligarch flew into the Russian capital to meet with Putin and give him a handwritten note from Zelenskyy that outlined Ukraine’s terms for peace.

In response to this, Putin is reported to have said, “Tell him I will thrash them.”

After meeting with Putin in Moscow, Abramovich returned to Istanbul, where he met with the Ukrainian politician turned negotiator Rustem Umerov.

In Turkey, Abramovich and Umerov were assisted in negotiations with Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Kalin suggested that Ukrainian officials make a deal with their Russian counterparts in which Crimea and Donbas be held under a long-term lease — similar to the situation between Britain and China regarding Hong Kong.

Putin is reportedly considering the agreement, but his intense frustration with his military’s lack of success and disdain for Zelenskyy are holding him back.

Abramovich is one of several Russian oligarchs seeking refuge from Western sanctions in Turkey. He currently has two of his superyachts moored in Bodrum, a city on the country’s southwest coast.

Abramovich, in particular, has been able to work around sanctions from the Turkish government, despite his close relationship with Putin, because of his utility and willingness to participate in and assist with peace talks.

Previous peace talks hosted by Turkey between Russian and Ukrainian coalitions reportedly failed.

This experience is not unique, however.

Efforts to secure peace are proving to be increasingly difficult as the conflict drags on.

Leadership in the Israeli government has also run into trouble trying to advocate for peace.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Zelenskyy over the phone in mid-March and urged him to accept Putin’s conditions for peace, including an immediate cease to military action, enshrining geopolitical neutrality in the Ukrainian constitution, officially recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, and recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Zelenskyy was not agreeable to these terms.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tell-him-i-will-thrash-them-putin-rejects-handwritten-bid-for-peace-from-zelenskyy,2022-03-28
Tesla will continue paying salaries of Ukrainian employees who return home to fight,"As a way to support Ukraine in its fight against invading Russian forces, Tesla has announced that it will continue paying the salaries of Ukrainian employees asked to return to their homeland to fight for at least three months.

The announcement was disclosed in an internal email to employees in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, CNBC reported. The outlet noted, however, that it wasn’t immediately clear whether the policy had been or would be extended to employees in North America and elsewhere around the globe.

The company reportedly said that after the three-month time period, it would reassess the situation depending on how the conflict is going.

""For any Tesla employees who is a Ukrainian national and has been asked to return to Ukraine for active duty as a reservist, we will maintain their employment and salary for 3 months, with a view to assessing after this period as needed,"" read the email, sent by Axel Tangen, Tesla's director of Northern Europe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up military reservists late last month as Russian troops continued to mass around the country's borders. Only days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion, sending Europe into its bloodiest land war since World War II.

Since the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy has leaned on the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, promising to supply weaponry to any citizen who would remain and fight.

The United States and several other Western nations have responded to Russia's unprovoked attack by heavily sanctioning the invading country while supplying Ukraine with a deluge of armaments and high-tech weaponry.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, too, has been aiding the war efforts. Tangen's email announcing the three-month pay for military policy shed light on Musk's enterprise to quickly bring fortified internet service to Ukraine.

""Tesla teamed up with SpaceX to provide coverage expansion for its Starlink services to help provide an alternative internet infrastructure,"" Tangen wrote, noting that volunteers tested, configured, and shipped several hundred Starlink units to Ukraine this month.

He added that ""in true Tesla fashion, the solution has been put together in less than 3 days.""

Additionally, Tesla’s Energy team assembled and provided lithium-ion battery storage systems known as Tesla Powerwalls to run the Starlink equipment.

Ukraine vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who also oversees digital transformation for the country, personally thanked Musk on Twitter, writing, ""Received the second shipment of Starlink stations!

Biden admin recruits TikTok influencers to combat 'misinformation',"The Biden administration announced this week that it plans to utilize social media influencers to ""combat scams and misinformation"" about the new federal student loan debt relief program. The White House has repeatedly enlisted TikTok stars to push the administration's preferred messaging, including previous campaigns focused on vaccines and the invasion of Ukraine.



""The White House will engage directly with digital creators and influencers on social media platforms to help spread accurate information about the program and alerts concerning potential scams,"" the White House fact sheet read.

The announcement comes just days after Biden came under heavy scrutiny for walking back student loan forgiveness eligibility, a move that NPR called a ""remarkable reversal."" An administration official told the news outlet that 800,000 borrowers would no longer be qualified to receive the relief.

The White House hopes its ""influencer army"" will help reach and spread more desirable information about the Biden administration to younger audiences.

After passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration invited 20 social media influencers to the South Lawn of the White House, where they were briefed on the legislation. Select online personalities with large audiences received a special invitation to attend the event.

V Spehar, a TikTok user with 2.7 million followers, told NPR, ""I got a magical email from the digital communications team at the White House saying they were going to be doing essentially a creator briefing for the Inflation Reduction Act.""

The influencers who attended the intimate event were briefed in the Roosevelt Room by members of the National Economic Council, the climate policy office, President Biden, and Vice President Harris.

Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, told NPR, ""The reality is, if we want to go out and talk to a wide amount of people whose lives are going to be impacted by the Inflation Reduction Act, and both take credit and also tell people how they can access some of the benefits, then we need to get out into the digital communities that people exist in — and that means spending time with digital creators who have huge reaches into those audiences.""

Pew Research reported that 33% of individuals ages 18 to 29 said they get their news from social media.

""We're not expecting them to become Biden administration propagandists,"" Flaherty said. ""But we want to make sure that they have the best information that they can get and be able to ask questions, just like reporters would, to be able to inform their audiences.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-admin-recruits-tiktok-influencers-to-combat-misinformation,2022-10-09
The Biden administration resumes oil and gas leases on federal land but in a reduced capacity and with steeper fees,"This past Friday, the Biden administration announced that it would resume granting lease sales for the drilling of oil and natural gas on federal lands.

However, as the Washington Examiner reported, the Biden administration intends to drastically decrease the amount of federal land available for drilling and plans to increase the royalty it charges companies to produce oil on federal lands.

In a recently released press release, the Department of the Interior said that it will make 144,000 acres of federal lands available for drilling. This is an 80% reduction in acreage that was originally designated for natural gas production. The department will also begin charging companies drilling royalties of 18.75% instead of 12.5%.

The release said, “The [Bureau of Land Management] will issue final environmental assessments and sale notices of upcoming oil and gas leases that reflect this strategic approach.”

“The lease sales will incorporate many of the recommendations in the Department’s report,” the release continued. “Including ensuring Tribal consultation and broad community input, reliance of the best available science including analysis of GHG emissions, and a first-ever increase in the royalty rate for new competitive leases to 18.75 percent, to ensure fair return for the American taxpayers and on par with rates charged by states and private landowners.”

It continued, “The BLM assessed potentially available and eligible acreage in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming. It began analyzing 646 parcels on roughly 733,000 acres that had been previously nominated for leasing by energy companies. As a result of robust environmental review, engagement with Tribes and communities, and prioritizing the American people’s broad interests in public lands, the final sale notices will offer approximately 173 parcels on roughly 144,000 acres, an 80 percent reduction from the acreage originally nominated.”

This move by the Department of the Interior comes as the Biden administration begins to acknowledge the importance of increasing domestic energy production amid soaring energy prices.

Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, called the department’s new plan an overdue “reset’ of the leasing program.

She said, “For too long, the federal oil and gas leasing programs have prioritized the wants of extractive industries above local communities, the natural environment, the impact on our air and water, the needs of Tribal Nations, and, moreover, other uses of our shared public lands.”'

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western nations issued thoroughgoing sanctions on the Russian economy. The U.S. was quick to stop importing Russian oil, and since the Biden administration ended American energy independence, American energy prices drastically rose as there was suddenly less oil being imported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-administration-resumes-oil-and-gas-leases-on-federal-land-in-reduced-capacity,2022-04-16
The Bidens celebrate their new cat as the economy worsens and global tensions rise,"As global tensions rose and economic uncertainty plagued the American people this week, the Bidens welcomed a new four-legged friend into the White House.

The first lady’s office announced that America’s first family welcomed a two-year-old gray-and-white-striped cat named Willow to the White House.

Reuters reports that a spokesperson for Jill Biden, Michael LaRosa, confirmed that the young tabby cat — named Willow — was named after Mrs. Biden’s hometown of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.

According to LaRosa, Mrs. Biden met Willow at a campaign stop in 2020.

“A farm cat from Pennsylvania, Willow made quite an impression on Dr. Biden in 2020 when she jumped up on the stage and interrupted her remarks during a campaign stop in 2020,” LaRosa said, “Seeing their immediate bond, the owner of the farm knew that Willow belonged with Dr. Biden.”

While Willow may be living her American dream, many humanoid Americans are having an incredibly rough winter as the domestic economy aggressively trends downward and tensions continue to rise abroad.

Americans are watching their wages and savings evaporate due to inflation, and Russia continues to mass forces along Ukrainian borders.

Inflation increased by 7% last year, according to data provided by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is the biggest increase in inflation since the early 1980s, marking a 40-year high. Notably, core inflation — the inflationary rate not accounting for price fluctuation in things like food and gas — rose by 5.5%.

While the Biden White House celebrates the addition of a new pet to the first family’s rotating menagerie of critters, the American people are watching as their wages and savings shrink before their very eyes as the economy spirals down the drain.

American citizens are without evacuation assistance from the government and the American embassy in Kyiv has been closed, as Russia stands ready to attack and invade Ukraine. The U.S. State Department believes foreign intelligence shows “every indication” that Russia will use force against Ukraine by mid-February, reports Fox News.

The Washington Examiner reports that President Biden previously stated he has “no intention of putting American forces or NATO forces in Ukraine.” But, regardless of his intentions, American lives are still at risk and American interests abroad are being compromised.

According to the Associated Press, the first lady has been expecting Willow to move into the West Wing since last April. Whereas the legacy media and its left-wing acolytes might find the Bidens' new pet endearing, the American people continue to worry about what lies in the future.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-s-celebrate-their-new-cat-as-the-economy-worsens-and-global-tensions-rise,2022-01-28
The Chinese government is accelerating the build-up of its nuclear arsenal as tensions with the US rise,"People familiar with the thought process of China’s leadership say that the Chinese government has begun to accelerate the development of its nuclear arsenal after reassessing the threat posed to mainland China by the United States.

The Wallstreet Journal said that China’s nuclear effort “long predates Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the U.S.’s wariness about getting directly involved in the war there has likely reinforced Beijing’s decision to put greater emphasis on developing nuclear weapons as a deterrent.”

It is believed that Chinese leaders see a stronger nuclear arsenal as a way to deter the U.S. from involving itself in a potential future conflict over Taiwan.

The Chinese government has also accelerated work on more than 100 suspected missile silos that could be used to store nuclear-tipped missiles in remote western regions of China.

American officials and independent security analysts who study nuclear proliferation say they are unsure about what is motivating Beijing’s race to develop its nuclear arsenal.

The Wallstreet Journal reported that the “people close to the Chinese leadership said China’s increased focus on nuclear weapons is also driven by fears Washington might seek to topple Beijing’s Communist government” as American foreign policy becomes more hawkish towards China.

American military officials and security analysts worry that China rapidly accelerating the development of its nuclear arsenal could embolden the Chinese Communist Party to launch a surprise nuclear strike.

Reportedly, the Chinese government plans to maintain an arsenal “no larger than necessary to ensure China’s security interests.”

A person close to the leadership of China suggested that another reason Chinese leadership is rushing to strengthen its nuclear arsenal is so that the U.S. can’t push them around on the geopolitical stage. The person said, “China’s inferior nuclear capability could only lead to growing U.S. pressure on China.”

This past year, the American security apparatus was caught entirely off guard as the Chinese government launched a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into space that circled the earth before sailing towards its target on the planet’s surface.

An unnamed U.S. official said, “We have no idea how [China] did this.”

People familiar with the thinking of Chinese leadership have said that it is unlikely that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has had an impact on the Chinese government’s nuclear acceleration despite the lingering threat of Putin using a nuclear weapon against Ukraine causing immense anxiety within the international community.

The Pentagon estimates that China will have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of this decade.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-chinese-government-is-accelerating-the-build-up-of-its-nuclear-arsenal-amid-heightened-tensions-with-the-united-states,2022-04-10
The Egyptian government extends the stays of Ukrainian tourists for free in wake of the Russian invasion,"The Egyptian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry allows tourists affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to extend their stay at Egyptian hotels free of charge until it is safe to return home.

On Thursday, Ahram Online, Egypt's largest online news organization, reported that Egypt's Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Khaled Anani, made this decision following the closing of Ukraine's airspace.

The Hotel Association of Egypt also issued a directive to all of its member hotels to extend the stays of Ukrainian and Russian tourists until Russian and Ukrainian airspace reopens, enabling them to return home safely.

Hotels were instructed to provide these stranded tourists with their resort's full amenities free of charge.

The South Sinai Hotels Chamber issued a statement to the general managers of hotels in Sharm El-Sheikh that implored them to extend the stays of Ukrainian tourists who had returned from the airport after having their flights canceled.

The chamber also told hotel management that they should provide stranded Ukrainians with whatever assistance they need and not let ""any tourist leave any hotel.""

The chamber's statement encouraged hotel management to be careful moderating potential confrontations between Ukrainian and Russian tourists.

The Ukrainian embassy in Egypt shared the Hotel Association of Egypt's directive and the South Sinai Hotels Chamber's statement on its official Facebook page and encouraged stranded Ukrainian tourists to present these documents to hotel management if necessary.

Prior to the Ministry's announcement, the Ukrainian embassy said that it was cooperating with officials in tourism and tour operators to help provide stranded Ukrainians with resources due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the temporary closure of Ukrainian airspace.

The embassy also said that it was working to find routes of entry into Ukraine through Poland, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary so that the stranded Ukrainians can return home.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace, Ukrainian citizens abroad should stay in place, closely follow events, and register in the ministry's digital communications system that connects Ukrainians with their embassies and consulates abroad.

The head of Egypt's National Company for Air Navigation, Ihab Mohi El-Din, said that on Thursday prior to Ukraine barring commercial flight from its airspace, Egyptian airports received hundreds of Ukrainian civilians from airports in Kiev and Lviv.

Egypt is one of the most popular tourist destinations for Ukrainians. In 2019, nearly 1.5 million Ukrainians visited and during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 over 700,000 Ukrainians vacationed in Egypt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-egyptian-government-extends-the-stays-of-ukrainian-tourists-for-free-in-wake-of-the-russian-invasion,2022-02-26
The Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates in mid-March,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believes that the Fed is on track to raise interest rates in mid-March.

“Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,” Powell said in prepared testimony before Congress.

Powell said that it was too soon to tell how the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent sanctions on Russia issued by Western nations, could affect the U.S. economy, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The chairman’s remarks highlight the delicate economic climate that the Federal Reserve must navigate as it raises interest rates for the first time since 2018 amid rapid inflation that could be further exasperated in response to Western sanctions on Russia.

He said, “The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain.”

It’s typically unusual for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates during times of geopolitical conflict. That said, the Fed is under increased pressure to raise rates since inflation is running far above the Fed’s 2% target and Western sanctions on Russia stand to further raise prices.

In late February, allied leaders of Western nations issued a joint statement expressing their intentions to restrict Russian access to the SWIFT telecommunications network.

In the statement, Western leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States said, “As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies.”

Targeting the Russian financial sector, oligarchs, and the Russian central bank with these sanctions will economically isolate Russia and make international commerce extremely difficult for the country.

Similar to previous spikes in inflation being caused by supply chain shortages and difficulty importing goods, Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve believe that the extra duress put on international trade as a result of these sanctions will cause prices to further to inflate for American consumers.

“We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation expectations and inflation itself from a number of factors. We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched,” Powell said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-federal-reserve-is-on-track-to-raise-interest-rates-in-mid-march,2022-03-02
The first all-civilian crew of astronauts has docked with the International Space Station,"The world's first fully private space crew has docked with the International Space Station.

On Friday morning, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket containing a Dragon capsule launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday morning ""without any major hiccups,"" Engadget reported.

Reportedly the crew's flight to the ISS took around 20 hours and experienced a brief delay in the docking sequence due to a video routing problem.

CBS News reported that the SpaceX rocket carried ""a retired NASA astronaut and three wealthy civilians on the first non-government, fully commercial flight to the International Space Station – a trailblazing mission intended to help pave the way to a privately operated space lab.""

The crew consisted of Michael Lopez-Algeria, commander and former NASA astronaut, and businessmen Larry Connor, Eytan Stibbe, and Mark Pathy.

The crew is expected to spend eight days on the space station where they will conduct science experiments along with ""outreach and commercial activities."" The crew is also expected to return scientific samples back to Earth for NASA to study.

The mission was conducted by Axiom Space, a company that is — according to its website — dedicated to ""the full realization of low Earth orbit's possibilities.""

Axiom Space ""has been involved with every ISS mission since the program's inception"" and hopes to make ""the possibilities of Low Earth Orbit accessible to visionary governments, researchers, manufacturers, and individuals.""

The company believes that ""microgravity is the most promising environment for innovation and problem-solving since the Internet"" and plans on ""building the first commercial space station in our solar system starting in 2024.""

This launch marked the sixth piloted flight of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, is the ""second fully commercial flight to orbit,"" a ""d the ""fi"" st all-commercial visit to the International Space Station.""

Over the past twenty years, eleven private astronauts have had the privilege to visit the International Space Station under commercial arrangements with Russia'Russia'sagency.

In recent weeks, the Russian government announced that it would no longer collaborate with Western nations on maintaining the International Space Station. Russian officials indicated that they would see to the completion of already ongoing projects and tasks but that the country will withdraw its support of the station so long as Western nations continue to sanction the Russian economy in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Prior to pulling out of the International Space Station, Russian officials threatened to drop the station on the Western world by ceasing to provide it with resources for propulsion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-first-all-civilian-crew-of-astronauts-has-docked-with-the-international-space-station,2022-04-09
'The Five' explodes after Juan Williams accuses co-hosts of regurgitating White House talking points,"The usually genial Fox News show ""The Five"" exploded into angry recriminations on Wednesday after Juan Williams accused the other co-hosts of regurgitating White house talking points.

Williams was talking about the controversy over a phone call from President Donald Trump to the president of Ukraine when he made the snide comment about his co-hosts.

""But, I think ah, just listening here,"" said Williams, ""I think boy those talking points, they've made the rounds, because, the reality is....""



""Whoa, whoa, whoa,"" objected Greg Gutfeld. ""What does that mean? Are you saying that I got talking points, Juan?""

""Are you telling me I was told what to say by the White House?"" interrupted Jesse Watters.

""No, You gotta answer to the accusation!"" Gutfeld exclaimed as Williams tried to continue on.

""No, I'm saying they're all around but here's the point,"" said Williams.



""You had a whole day to talk!"" Objected Gutfeld. ""Let's get Katy in, at least she has something to say that's original!""

""Here we go, asking a foreign government to investigate a political rival is illegal,"" continued Williams. ""It's illegal, it's a violation of the constitutional oath.""

""Unbelievable,"" interrupted Gutfeld. ""You get that from Media Matters, Juan?""

The White House released a transcript of the phone call with the Ukrainian president, but his critics concluded that it proved he was asking for a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 election. The president and his allies responded by alleging Democrats and the media were protecting Joe Biden, the Democratic primary frontrunner.

"Iranian Revolutionary Guard claims responsibility for missile barrage in Irbil, says it responded to crimes from the 'Zionist regime'","The Iranian government has claimed responsibility for a recent missile barrage that targeted the expansive U.S. consulate complex in the Iraqi city of Irbil – also spelled Erbil.

There are no reported American fatalities, according to the Associated Press, but the attack marks a significant escalation between the U.S. and Iran.

The Iranian Revolutionary guard said that it launched the attack against an Israeli “strategic center of conspiracy” in Irbil.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard said that Israel recently acted offensively by planning a recent strike that killed two members of the Revolutionary Guard which prompted an Iranian response.

“Following the recent crimes of the fake Zionist regime and the previous announcement that the crimes and evils of this infamous regime will not go unanswered; Last night, the ‘Strategic Center of Conspiracy and Evil of the Zionists’ was targeted by powerful and point-to-point missiles of the IRGC,” the Iranian Revolutionary Guard said in a statement following the attack.

An American defense official and an Iraqi security official confirmed that the strike was launched from Iran.

An Iraqi official in Baghdad initially said that several missiles had struck the U.S. consulate in Ibril and that the consulate was the target of the attack.

However, Lawk Ghafari, the head of the Kurdish foreign media office, said that none of the missiles struck the U.S. facility but that areas around the sprawling complex had been hit.

The U.S. defense official said it was unclear how many missiles were fired and what the precise area of impact was. A second U.S. official said that there was no damage at any building belonging to the U.S. government and that there is no clear indication that the target was the consulate complex.

The barrage came several days after the Iranian government said that it would retaliate for an earlier Israeli attack outside of Damascus, Syria, that resulted in the deaths of two members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

The attack also coincided with increasing regional tensions.

Negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials over the Iran nuclear deal have been paused in response to Russian complaints over Western sanctions stemming from the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian diplomats have been serving as meditators during the negotiations.

Iranian officials also suspended the ongoing secret Baghdad talks that were aimed at defusing longstanding tensions with its rivals in Saudi Arabia.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi responded to the attack by tweeting: “The aggression which targeted the dear city of Erbil and spread fear amongst its inhabitants is an attack on the security of our people. I discussed these developments with the KRG PM. Our security forces will investigate and stand firm against any threats toward our people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-iranian-revolutionary-guard-claims-responsibility-for-missile-barrage-in-irbil-says-it-responded-to-crimes-from-the-zionist-regime,2022-03-13
The Russian central bank takes steps to stabilize the ruble as it plummets in value,"The Bank of Russia is proceeding with emergency measures to stabilize its economy and to prevent the Russian ruble from losing further value.

For the first time, the Russian central bank said that it will intervene in the foreign exchange market and expand its Lombard list of securities that it will accept as collateral, Bloomberg reported.

The central bank did not mention whether or not it would raise interest rates but it did proceed with agreeing to provide Russian banks with additional liquidity. It is preparing to offer banks 1 trillion rubles — roughly $11.5 billion —in an overnight repo auction.

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin, ordered Russian forces to launch their invasion of Ukraine and strike strategic targets to demilitarize the country. Upon doing so, the ruble fell to a record low in value.

In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, leaders of Western nations are implementing a wide array of sanctions to weaken the Russian economy.

Less than a day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, President Joe Biden announced that the United States would target Russia’s largest financial institutions, Sherbank and VTB, to prevent them from using the American financial system to conduct transactions. These sanctions are fairly comprehensive and will restrict nearly 80% of Russian banking assets.

Previously, Biden stopped short of calling for Russia’s removal from the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).

Biden said, “It is always an option, but right now it’s not the position the rest of Europe wishes to take.”

Kicking Russia out of SWIFT would greatly damage the Russian economy in the short term and make recovery incredibly difficult in the long term. It could prevent Russia from engaging in international transactions and would cripple their ability to export oil and gas.

On Saturday, the allied leaders of several Western countries — including the Untied States — expressed their support for preventing Russia from being able to access and utilize the SWIFT network.

The Western leaders agreed to target specific Russian banks for removal from the SWIFT system, to prevent the Russian central bank from manipulating its monetary policy, and to take aggressive steps to sanction and financially punish Russian individuals involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

By preventing Russia from using the SWIFT network, the West will effectively isolate them and inhibit them from conducting trade with some of its largest trade partners.

At the time of writing, a Russian ruble is worth about 0.012 U.S. dollars. The in-game currency for the popular children’s videogame “Roblox” – aptly named Robux – is worth about 0.0125 U.S. dollars per unit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-russian-central-bank-takes-steps-to-stabilize-the-ruble-as-it-plummets-in-value,2022-02-27
The tallest man in the U.S. has passed away at 38 years old,"The tallest man in the United States passed away Friday from heart disease at 38 years old.

The Star Tribune reported that Igor Vovkovinskiy was a bit more than 7 feet, 8 inches tall.

Vovkovinskiy was born in Ukraine in 1982, according to Ranfranz and Vine Funeral Home, where a memorial service is scheduled to be held Saturday.

He came to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1989, according to the Star Tribune.

The man's significant size was the result of a tumor pressing against his pituitary gland, leading to the secretion of abnormal levels of growth hormone, according to a ""60 Minutes Australia"" report.

The program had interviewed Vovkovinskiy in 2012.

""It's unlikely that he'll ever stop growing,"" a doctor interviewed on the program said. ""We're using medications to try and slow the effects of that growth hormone down for him and to suppress that pituitary gland as much as we can. But unfortunately, yes, he, he continues to add height and he continues to add weight.""

Vovkovinskiy told the ""60 Minutes Australia"" interviewer that he was 7 feet, 8.33 inches tall.

""Looking at the world from my height, it's, it's a different experience every day. I always have to be thinking about, am I endangering my life?

The truth about those US-funded biological laboratories in Ukraine,"In case you haven't noticed, there has been quite the controversy in the last week about whether Ukraine does or does not have biological research facilities that were funded, at least in part, by the United States military. The accusation has been the subject of some absurd fact-checks by our corporate media and accusations of ""Russian disinformation"" from our government.

The truth is: Yes, there are indeed biological research facilities in Ukraine that have been funded by our government. We don't have any way to know whether these facilities were conducting research that was intended to produce weapons or not, but we do know that if the pathogens housed in these facilities escaped, they would be just as deadly as as an intentionally produced bioweapon.

The controversy began when the Russian government tweeted the following accusation:

Specifically, the Russian government stated that it found evidence of a ""military-biological programme"" that was funded by the United States Department of Defense and that was being cleaned up during the course of the invasion.

Promptly, the United States government leapt into action to dispute this contention with the assertion that the United States military does not, and never has, funded a ""biological weapons"" program and claimed that this accusation was part of a ""Russian disinformation"" campaign. This assertion was dutifully repeated by the government's stenographers in the corporate media.

Amazingly, the seminal ""fact-check,"" written by USA Today, argued that there were no ""biolabs"" funded by the military, even while acknowledging the existence of such labs. The ""fact-check"" notes that the United States and Ukraine did have such labs, but that they were to ""prevent the proliferation of dangerous pathogens and related expertise and to minimize potential biological threats"" and further explicitly stated that the United States was providing funding to those labs, albeit for the purpose of ""making repairs, updating equipment and purchasing supplies"" at those laboratories.

At the risk of overstating the obvious, if the military is ""purchasing supplies"" at these laboratories, to say nothing of ""updating equipment"" or ""making repairs"" at these laboratories, it is funding them.

In a remarkable off-camera briefing held last week, the Defense Department further spoke about these claims. In that briefing, an unidentified ""senior Department of Defense official"" said, among other things:

A few key points about the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program Biological Threat Reduction Program activities in Ukraine this is part of the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. Through that program, we have invested approximately $200 million in Ukraine since 2005, supporting 46 Ukrainian labs, health facilities, and diagnostic sites . DOD's CTR program began its biological work with Ukraine to eliminate the remnants of the Soviet Union's illegal biological weapons program left in the Soviet successor states after the USSR fell. There are no DOD bioweapon labs in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world.

The first and most obvious point to make about this statement is that it is an admission that: a) these laboratories exist, and b) we have given them a lot of money. Now, the unnamed senior official follows this up with two red herrings. First, the senior official asserted that our cooperation with Ukraine on this project began as an effort to eliminate the bioweapons program that was being carried on by the Soviet Union. Assuming that is true, it has nothing to do with our efforts that began in 2005, some 14 years after the Soviet Union fell. Second, the official asserted that ""there are no DOD bioweapon labs"" anywhere in the world.

Let's assume that this assertion is true, because it seems to be all that either the DOD or the press is focusing on. Assume that nowhere in Ukraine is a laboratory that has the express purpose of creating or proliferating a bioweapon. Fine. The assertion is simply not responsive to the charge that was actually made by the Russian government, which was that they found evidence of a ""military-biological programme"" that was funded by the United States Department of Defense. That assertion is demonstrably true and has been confirmed as true by our government. Now, our government says, and I have no reason to disbelieve it, that the purpose of those labs was not to create a bioweapon. But that doesn't mean, in this case, that what the Russian government said was false.

We know some of what the government was doing in Ukraine from documents that were released by Wikileaks. In a 2008 cable, it was revealed that Andrew Weber of the OSD/CTR (the same Department of Defense agency referred to in last week's briefing) held a discussion with Ukrainian officials about the need to create one central laboratory in Ukraine that would house its most dangerous pathogens because, among other reasons, ""the U.S. seeks to consolidate the strains/pathogens that could be used by terrorists on human or agricultural targets.""

This illustrates the problem with the government's straw man protestations that it does not fund bioweapon labs. Unlike other potential weapons of mass destruction, there is no functional difference between the danger associated with biological materials that are collected for peaceful purposes and materials that are collected for illicit, non-peaceful purposes. If a terrorist breaks into a nuclear power plant, they can't make off with a functioning nuclear bomb. However, if they break into a biological research facility that houses a dangerous pathogen that is being kept for the purpose of, say, vaccine development, they now have a fully functioning dangerous pathogen.

It probably (hopefully) is true that the Ukrainians are not housing dangerous pathogens in order to develop bioweapons on the U.S. taxpayer's dime. However, after we have just come through a two-year pandemic that has taken millions of lives and may well have been started due to a leak from a laboratory that was trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine, that may come as cold comfort to people who are justifiably concerned about the safety of those pathogens during the course of the scorched-earth campaign the Russian military is now conducting.

By the way, the initial Russian accusation did not just say the program existed, it said that there was an ""emergency cleanup"" under way that was trying to eradicate the program. This is, frankly, good news. It's exactly what should be happening.

Absolutely no one would begrudge the Ukrainians an aggressive research program into chemical and biological agents, given Russia's nasty history with poisons and pathogens — a history that includes the probable attempted assassination of Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko by the Russian government in 2004. And, given that the Russian military is now carpeting Ukraine with explosive devices, with apparently little care or ability to deliver those devices with precision, it is entirely appropriate for a cleanup operation to be under way to ensure that those pathogens are not inadvertently released.

But the United States government should be saying that, in order to ensure that our credibility remains intact on the world stage after the sad and senseless invasion of Ukraine is over.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-truth-about-those-us-funded-biological-laboratories-in-ukraine,2022-03-14
"Guest on 'The View' dares to blame Biden for inflation crisis, record-high gas. Whoopi swiftly blames others.","""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg kowtowed to President Joe Biden on Wednesday when a guest dared to blame him for the ongoing crises in the United States.

""I want to say this, though, the country’s not doing well,"" Grisham observed.

""So I think that Biden does need to get some stuff in order. We have got high gas prices. We do have inflation,"" she continued as Goldberg tried to interrupt. ""Come to the Midwest. I invite anybody to come to the Midwest, where farmers can’t afford fertilizer, they can’t afford fuel. People really are suffering at the grocery store. There are a lot of things going on that I think could affect the polls.""

Goldberg immediately seized on Grisham's accusation. According to Goldberg — whose net worth is estimated to be $60 million or more — ""we're all suffering.""

""And I would say this to you: Go to New Jersey. Go to upstate New York. Go anywhere in the state of New York. Go to the state of New Jersey. Go anywhere in the states. We’re all suffering!"" Goldberg claimed.

Goldberg then defended Biden from the economic problems facing Americans right now, such as record-high gas prices.

""I'll tell you, everybody is suffering. But let’s place it in the places that it belongs. OK?"" she said. ""Gas prices aren’t bad because of anything Biden did. It’s just what he’s going to absorb.""

Sunny Hostin added to the defense, ""There’s also a war going on in Ukraine."" Goldberg agreed, ""There’s a war going on, and everybody said, this is what we got to do. So we’re in the middle of it.""

And the baby formula shortage? Goldberg claimed ""Abbott"" is responsible, most likely a reference to the baby formula manufacturer.

""People want baby food, baby stuff. That is also not on him. That’s on Abbott,"" Goldberg claimed. ""But I noticed when people talk about these things, specifically what you were just saying, nobody ever says, here’s the cause of this, and here’s how we have to fight this.""

Anything else?

Grisham is right. Americans believe the U.S. is heading in the wrong direction, which explains dismal polling for Democrats.

Biden's favorability is under water by an average of 13 points, according to RealClearPolitics, and all signs point toward a red tsunami this November, especially if Biden and Democrats continue to abdicate responsibility for the problems ailing Americans.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that Goldberg's reference to ""Abbott"" is most likely directed at the baby formula manufacturer. The story originally said it was in reference to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Goldberg did not clarify in her remarks on ""The View.""

"'The View' hosts savage the marriage of Kellyanne, George Conway with dire prediction","Despite all that is happening in the world, on Tuesday, the ladies of ""The View"" devoted an entire segment to the marriage of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and George Conway, a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump.

The segment came in response to George chiding Kellyanne on social media Monday. Kellyanne had posted a video of Joe Biden with the comment, ""We need Ukraine's help to defeat THIS guy?"" George responded by saying, ""Your boss apparently thought so.""

The small exchange is emblematic of a marriage in shambles — one that will surely end in a split, the hosts of ""The View"" predicted.

""They're going to get a divorce,"" Sunny Hostin said.

Joy Behar said that Kellyanne has previously ""emasculated"" George — when she claimed that her husband ""gets his power through me"" — while Meghan McCain called the marriage ""sick.""

""I think that they have a really sick relationship,"" McCain said. ""I think this is a sick thing to do. You have four kids at home, and they're going to read this someday. ... The idea that me and my husband would be somehow feuding with each other over our work, I just think it's gross. I don't know why America has to be subjected to their marital problems.""

Behar later claimed the public disagreements ""turns them on — they love it,"" while guest host Ronan Farrow withheld making judgment, instead suggesting that the couple likely gets along behind closed doors.



Abby Huntsman, meanwhile, said the public exchanges make her ""uncomfortable,"" and claimed that George has ""bullied"" his wife.

"World wakes up to all-out war: Ukraine says more than 40 soldiers, 10 civilians killed during ongoing invasion; Putin issues ominous threats to West as Ukraine declares martial law","All-out war is unfolding across Ukraine as Russian forces have invaded the neighboring country.

What are the details?

Ukraine officials say that more than 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians have been killed thus far in the early hours of the Russian invasion as explosions have rocked cities across Ukraine.

In response to the violent attacks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared martial law.

Residents have taken to the highways in an attempt to to flee Ukrainian capital Kyiv, while others have taken to subway stations as fortified, improvised bunkers.

Ukraine Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, noting that Russia is on a ""path of evil,"" comparing Russian President Vladimir Putin's attack to that of Adolf Hitler.

In Thursday remarks, Zelenskyy called for ""everyone who is able"" to join the military and called on veterans to help.

Putin took to the airwaves early Thursday morning and issued disturbing threats while detailing the invasion — which he referred to as a ""special military operation.""

In a series of implausible remarks, he claimed that two ""people's republics"" — Ukrainian regions of Donbas — of Donetsk and Luhansk ""turned to Russian with a request for help.""

In response, Putin said, he vowed to ""demilitarize"" and ""deNazify"" Ukraine, which he claimed had been subjected to genocide.

""Our actions are self-defense against threats,"" he falsely claimed. ""We do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone. ... NATO supports Ukrainian neo-Nazis ... our actions are self-defense against threats.""

He concluded, ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history. We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made. I hope that I have been heard.""

What else?

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to hand down the ""harshest ever sanctions"" against Russian in response to the ""barbaric attack,"" threatening to ""weaken Russia's economic base"" as well as its ""capacity to modernize.""

""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,” Von der Leyen told reporters during the early hours of Thursday morning. “We condemn this barbaric attack and the cynical arguments that are being used to justify it.”

She added, “These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war. And we know that millions of Russians do not want war. We will not allow President [Vladimir] Putin to replace the rule of law, by the rule of force, and ruthlessness. Ukraine will prevail.""

NATO member states Estonia, Latvia, Lithiuania, and Poland have all triggered NATO Article 4, CNN reported, to ""launch consultations within the alliance over Russia's attack on Ukraine.""

“The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of the Parties is threatened,” Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty states. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, previous invocations of NATO Article 4 have resulted in a NATO response to include military aid and more.

Later Thursday morning, CNN reported that NATO is set to ""increase land, sea, and air forces on its eastern flank"" amid the attack.

In a statement, the security alliance said, ""Russia’s actions pose a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security, and they will have geostrategic consequences. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the security and defense of all Allies.""

“We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the Alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,"" the statement continued. ""We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.""

“Today, we have held consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty,"" the statement concluded. ""We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all Allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defense across the Alliance. Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.""

President Joe Biden on Wednesday night condemned the attack.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" Biden said in a statement on the invasion. ""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-world-wakes-up-to-all-out-war-ukraine-says-more-than-40-soldiers-10-civilians-killed-during-ongoing-invasion-putin-issues-ominous-threats-to-west,2022-02-24
'The View' hosts say people mocking Kamala Harris' awkward laugh are racist and misogynist,"The co-hosts of ""The View"" excoriated critics who were mocking Vice President Kamala Harris' awkward laugh are motivated by racism and misogyny.

Many on social media ridiculed an odd moment when Harris laughed during a media briefing with Polish President Andrzej Duda about the very serious war in Ukraine.

Three of the four hosts on ""The View"" Friday thought the real problem was bigotry against Harris' half-Jamaican, half-Indian heritage.

""I don’t see them making fun of Pence’s laugh or any of the guys,"" said Joy Behar.



""What it is is that they constantly question the qualifications of Black women, and that’s why people are saying that she’s unprepared,"" said Sunny Hostin.

Guest co-host Stephanie Grisham, who was formerly the press secretary in the Trump White House, disagreed with Hostin, which appeared to anger her.

""You can disagree, but that's the truth of it,"" Hostin snapped.

""This is based in racism. This is based in misogyny. And we’re talking about a woman that has extensive experience abroad, extensive experience as an attorney, extensive experience as the chief legal officer of one of our largest states in the country and I think this is just much ado about nothing,"" she continued.

""She is prepared,"" claimed Hostin, ""she gets wonderful marks across the board, but this is just something that I think happens to women and especially Black women.""



Ana Navarro ran through what she thought were important accomplishments by Harris and added angrily, ""if you think that happened because she's not serious, or because she's not qualified, then you should go qualify your heart, and qualify your opinions.

""But they do this all the time, right?"" Navarro continued. ""They have an obsession over Kamala Harris laughing. Guess what? She laughs!""

Behar then claimed that Republicans were getting revenge by mocking Harris for the ridicule that many heaped on Sarah Palin, who had run for vice president in the 2008 presidential election.

'This guy is brutal': Biden calls for Putin to be tried for war crimes,"Russian President Vladimir Putin was met with intense Western condemnation on Monday, as President Joe Biden and his Western allies called for the Russian leader to stand trial for war crimes.

These alleged war crimes were discovered as Ukrainian forces worked to reclaim the areas around Kyiv from withdrawing Russian troops. The Los Angeles Times reported that Ukrainian forces found mass graves in the suburbs of Kyiv. Reportedly, these graves were filled with the corpses of civilians, and the suburban streets are also said to be littered with civilian corpses.

Many of the slaughtered civilians bore mark marks of torture and execution. Bodies were found with their hands tied behind them and seemingly fatal gunshot wounds at the base of their skulls.

“This guy is brutal,” Biden said. “What’s happening in Bucha is outrageous.”

The Ukrainian government said that it has counted more than 400 civilian deaths so far in the suburbs of Kyiv, including those in Bucha.

Biden’s rhetoric towards his Russian counterpart, Putin, has been intensifying as the conflict in Ukraine drags on.

In mid-March, Biden referred to Putin as a “war criminal” in remarks that the White House quickly disavowed, saying the statement reflected the president’s personal opinion and not formal U.S. policy.

About a week later, the U.S. government formally accused the Russian Federation of war crimes.

Toward the end of March, Biden referred to Putin as “a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire.”

Most notably, however, Biden at one point appeared to call for regime change in Russia.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” the president said.

True to form, White House officials subsequently had to walk back Biden’s statements.

One official said that Biden “was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change” but was instead insisting that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”

This past Monday, Biden said, “[Putin] is a war criminal, but we have to gather information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight.”

His comments come as Russian forces continue to withdraw from Kyiv and the surrounding northern regions of Ukraine. However, this withdrawal is not a retreat, as Russian forces have continued to strike Ukraine’s southern coastal cities and move offensive operations into the country’s eastern region.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited parts of Ukraine’s recently vacated northern region and described the decimated residential areas as a “genocide.”

In a recent address to the Romanian parliament, Zelenskyy said, “Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/this-guy-is-brutal-biden-calls-for-putin-to-be-tried-for-war-crimes,2022-04-05
'This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own it': Ex-Obama official drops truth bomb as Biden blames Russia,"President Joe Biden is trying to blame February's record-high inflation numbers on Russia — but a former Obama administration official is not having it.

Steven Rattner, a former counselor to the treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, called out Biden on Thursday for misleading the American people on the record high inflation rates seen in February.

""This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own it,"" Rattner tweeted after the president released a statement blaming Russia for rising prices.



Earlier, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 7.9% increase in the consumer price index over the past year — representing a 40-year high inflation increase.

Biden referred to the price increases as ""Putin's price hike,"" claiming the Russian invasion of Ukraine is behind the surge in fuel prices punishing American pocketbooks.



""A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions. As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin’s unprovoked war, but Americans can know this: the costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing,"" Biden said in a written statement.

The president pledged to take further action to ease the supply chain logjams that have contributed to inflation and to ""reduce the huge federal budget deficit that I inherited from my predecessor.""

But Rattner said the president was wrong.

""Well, no. Those are Feb #'s and only include small Russia effect,"" he explained.

Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. The BLS report covered price increases for the entire month of February. And inflation is an issue the Biden administration has struggled to address for months. Last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and others dismissed rising prices as ""transitory"" and expected inflation to subside as the economy recovered from COVID-19 lockdowns.

But inflation never slowed down, and over the past year it rose at the highest rates seen in 40 years. In response, the Fed has made plans to raise interest rates in order to combat rising prices, with the first rate hikes expected to come next week.

Before blaming Russia, Biden blamed disrupted supply chains for rising prices, but Rattner also called this excuse ""simplistic and misleading"" in an op-ed for the New York Times three weeks ago.

""Blaming inflation on supply lines is like complaining about your sweater keeping you too warm after you’ve added several logs to the fireplace,"" Rattner wrote.

""The bulk of our supply problems are the product of an overstimulated economy, not the cause of it,"" he stated, explaining that as pandemic restrictions eased, Americans began spending more money — aided by generous COVID-stimulus payments started by President Donald Trump and continued under Biden's American Rescue Plan.

""All that consumption has resulted from vast amounts of government rescue aid (including three rounds of stimulus checks) and substantial underspending by consumers during the lockdown phase of the COVID crisis,"" Rattner wrote, chocking inflation up to ""a classic economic case of 'too much money chasing too few goods'"" once the pandemic began to end.



He suggested that Biden ""make deficit reduction as important as [his] other initiatives"" to combat inflation, noting that ""smaller deficits reduce net spending by government, thus helping offset demand by consumers.""

However, Biden and Washington Democrats have shown no appetite for reduced government spending. The president has instead prioritized a multi-trillion dollar Build Back Better plan projected to add at least $750 billion to the deficit, which has already eclipsed $1.3 trillion for this year.



If Biden follows Rattner's advise he has two options: Compromise and work with Republicans to reduce spending, over the protestations of his progressive base, or attempt to raise taxes ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Neither seems likely to happen.

Tim Scott will take on critical race theory and Biden's record in Reagan Library remarks,"South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott (R) will warn educators against ""teaching kids that they are oppressors"" when he takes the stage at the Reagan Library in California Tuesday night on April 19.

Scott is participating in the Reagan Foundation & Institute's ""Time for Choosing"" speaker series, which seeks to provide a platform for ""leading voices in the conservative movement to address critical questions facing the future of the Republican Party."" His speech will take a shot at critical race theory and the New York Time's controversial 1619 Project, as well as address rising inflation and criticize President Joe Biden's leadership, according to excerpts reported by Axios.

The southern lawmaker, who is the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, will say he's living proof that conservatism provides opportunity for Americans of color.

""It was education, hard work, and faith that allowed my family to go from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,"" Scott will say, according to his prepared remarks.

Scott will reportedly speak in favor of transparency in schools, saying that ""parents have a right to know what their kids are being taught in the classroom"" and that ""teaching kids that they are oppressors is just as bad as teaching kids they are always going to be victims.""

His remarks touch on issues that have been a priority for Republican lawmakers across the country. Backlash against critical race theory in 2021 led many GOP-controlled legislatures to advance bills prohibiting schools from teaching ""divisive concepts"" like the idea that one particular race is ""inherently superior or inferior"" to another or ""inherently responsible for actions committed in the past."" Such legislation was filed in response to reports that schools were adopting lesson plans that teach how ""all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism,"" or that American institutions were designed for the ""impoverishment of people of color and enrichment of white people,"" as a school in Buffalo, New York taught.

Republicans have also introduced curriculum transparency bills, which they claim are needed to keep parents informed of what their children are being taught. Opponents say such legislation could have a chilling effect on speech in schools and argue that parents should not have a role in school curricula.



Elsewhere in his speech, Scott will take shots at President Biden's record in office and the Democratic majorities in Congress, with the 2022 midterm elections in view.

""President Reagan once said, 'Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man ... Democrats’ leadership has led to a 40-year high in inflation, and they’re still pouring more money on this crisis. That’s not good for moms making decisions in homes like the one I grew up in,"" Scott will say, according to Axios.

He will also claim that Biden's ""weakness on the global stage has emboldened terrorists, bullies, and dictators,"" most notably Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

""Bloodthirsty dictators like Putin only understand strength, and that’s what we must project from the United States,"" Scott's prepared remarks say.

Scott will also call for U.S. energy independence, ""a physical barrier on our southern border,"" and will criticize ""the 1619 Project.""

Time magazine raked over the coals for 'sycophantic' cover of Joe Biden: 'What a joke',"After four years of magazine covers disparaging former President Donald Trump, Time magazine has offered up extremely glowing covers of President Joe Biden. The most recent cover of Time magazine features a flattering illustration of President Biden, which many online commenters ridiculed for being ""sycophantic.""

Last year, Time was roasted for making Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the magazine's ""Person of the Year."" Last November, Time celebrated Biden's presidential victory by calling him a ""dragon slayer,"" saying that his election represented a ""time to heal.""

Time continued its highly favorable coverage of President Biden with a new cover that was so over-the-top praiseworthy that it was widely mocked online.

President Biden will meet up with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 16 in Geneva, Switzerland. Ahead of the summit, Time's latest edition features an illustration of Biden wearing his signature aviator sunglasses, which have the reflection of Putin in the lenses. Biden seemingly appears to be champing at the bit to engage with his Russian counterpart. The headline on the cover says, ""Taking on Putin.""

The image of the 78-year-old Biden makes him appear years younger with zero wrinkles and taut skin.

Several Twitter reactions put a spotlight on Biden waiving sanctions against the company that is building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia into Germany. The pipeline would enable Russia to bypass Ukraine and freely flow natural gas into Europe. Previously, the Trump administration attempted to hinder the development of the pipeline so that Europe would purchase gas from the United States.



Former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell reacted by saying, ""Giving him a pipeline of leverage into Europe is NOT taking him on. It's giving in.""



Cliff Sims, a former senior adviser to the DNI, said, ""Yea, Putin is quivering in his boots after Biden handed him his number one geopolitical infrastructure project on a platter so he can work with the Germans on climate change. What a joke.""

Washington Examiner writer Jerry Dunleavy wrote, ""Biden takes on [the Republicans, Democrats, Eastern European allies, Ukrainians, etc. who opposed the corrupt Kremlin-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline which every honest person knows is a malign influence operation which will ultimately benefit] Putin.""

""If by taking Putin on you mean allowing him to build his massive pipeline while shutting ours down,"" one Twitter user wrote.

National Review's Kyle Smith tweeted, ""DNC press releases aren't this sycophantic.""



An online commenter asked, ""What in the hell kind of fan fiction comic book is this cover?""

One person stated, ""TIME has to use photoshop to show Biden younger than Putin. Is this 'takes on?'""

Multiple Twitter users joked that ""Biden can't even take on stairs, let alone Putin,"" referencing the time President Biden stumbled down the stairs leading up to Air Force One.

Young America's Foundation lampooned the laudatory press coverage of the Democratic president, ""tHe MeDiA dOeSn'T PiCk SiDeS.""

CNN legal analyst zeroes in on a big problem with two key witnesses in the impeachment hearings,"CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin identified the biggest problem with both witnesses on the opening day of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday.

Toobin said most of the testimony related to facts which had been known previously, but there was one very important new development.

He explained that one of Ambassador William Taylor's aides will testify about a phone call he overheard between Ambassador Sondland and President Donald Trump about Ukraine, after which Sondland explained the intention of the president.

""The president cares more about investigations of Biden of the 2016 campaign than he does about anything else relating to Ukraine,"" Toobin paraphrased a quote from the hearing.

""That's important, because the one criticism of these two witnesses, which I think is very much legitimate, it's not really a criticism, it's just a factual statement, is that neither of them had direct contact with the president,"" he explained.

""Ever!"" interjected Jake Tapper.

""Ever,"" Toobin agreed.

""You know, that's a problem if you're going to impeach the president,"" he added.

Toobin made the comments in order to explain the importance of the upcoming testimony of the aide to Amb. Taylor for the Democrats.

Republican allies of the president have argued in his defense that it was reasonable for Trump to ask for a foreign government to look into possible corruption related to Hunter Biden.



The president has decried the proceedings as a ""witch hunt,"" and denied any wrongdoing.

Top Dems accuse Trump of 'retaliation' for firing State Department IG. But there's more to the story.,"President Donald Trump triggered new condemnation on Friday when he fired State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.

Writing in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump said that he ""no longer"" had ""the fullest confidence"" in Linick as inspector general, the New York Times reported. It, therefore, became necessary to dismiss Linick, Trump told Pelosi.

In response, top Democratic leaders alleged Trump was committing more acts of vengeful political retaliation.

Pelosi claimed in a statement that Linick's ousting amplifies Trump's ""dangerous pattern of retaliation."" Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Trump's decision an ""unlawful act of retaliation"" because Linick was reportedly investigating Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""Mr. Linick's firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation,"" Engel said. ""This president believes he is above the law.""

However, that is not the whole story. According to the Daily Caller News Foundation, Linick himself was under investigation last year.

From the DCNF:

Two sources familiar with Linick's ouster told the DCNF that while they were not certain of the precise reason that the watchdog was fired, he was under investigation last year by the Department of Defense's inspector general for mishandling sensitive material.



The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

As the Times noted, Linick was a ""bit player"" in Trump's impeachment inquiry.

Linick drew national attention when he gave congressional investigators a packet of documents he thought might be useful in determining whether or not Trump improperly pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

From the Times:

In the end, the roughly 40 pages of material turned out to be largely inconsequential: a record of contacts between Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Ukrainian prosecutors, as well as accounts of Ukrainian law enforcement proceedings.

In fact, Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin chastised the move.

""It raises more questions than it answers,"" Raskin said of the documents, Roll Call reported. ""The inspector general had no idea where it came from.""

Trump said he would appoint Stephen Akard, current director of the Office of Foreign Missions, as Linick's replacement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-dems-accuse-trump-of-retaliation-for-firing-state-department-ig-but-theres-more-to-the-story,2020-05-16
Top senator reveals Democrat push to impeach Trump led to discovery of key Hunter Biden information,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, revealed Sunday that Democrats' push to impeach Donald Trump led to the discovery of key Hunter Biden information.

What's the background?

Democrats conducted an investigation into Trump last year over allegations that he engaged in a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian president by threatening to withhold military aid if Ukraine did not investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Ultimately, the House, which is controlled by Democrats, voted to impeach Trump. However, the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted the president.

Meanwhile, the Bidens were swept into the controversy when Hunter Biden's work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings was scrutinized.

Joe Biden later added fuel to the fire with an apparent admission that, when he was vice president, he persuaded then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko into firing Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. Biden's admission came during a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations event.

""I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'"" Biden explained. ""I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.'""

""Well, son of a b****, he got fired,"" Biden bragged. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

What did Johnson say?

Speaking with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Johnson explained that his committee never ""targeted the Bidens"" — but only uncovered key information about Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings as a result of the push to impeach Trump.

""When I met with the attorney general, it was really talking about the corrupt FBI investigation relating to the Russian hoax, so I don't believe I ever really talked about our investigations of Hunter Biden, which by the way we never targeted the Bidens,"" Johnson said.

""That whole issue was brought forth during the impeachment. That's when we started expanding our Ukrainian investigation to include his financial dealings, and then when we started seeing all these wire transfers that were connected to Hunter Biden,"" the Republican senator explained.

Johnson went on to express disagreement with the fact that Attorney General William Barr did not disclose the criminal investigations into Hunter Biden during Trump's impeachment.

""I'm sympathetic for keeping investigations confidential unless there's an indictment,"" Johnson said. ""But when you're talking about investigations within the political realm, particularly one that would have affected the impeachment trial of the sitting U.S. president in the U.S. Senate, that should have been relevant information, the fact that they had Hunter Biden's computer that had all these emails back in December 2019, that was before the trial, that was part of the trial, we should have known that.""

The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Finance released a report in September detailing the findings of their investigation into Hunter Biden and the Biden family.

The investigation uncovered, among other things, that ""Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board negatively impacted the efforts of dedicated career-service individuals who were fighting to push for anticorruption measures in Ukraine"" and that ""[Hunter] Biden and [his business partner's] work with Chinese nationals connected to the Communist regime illustrate the deep financial connections that accelerated while Joe Biden was vice president and continued after he left office.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-senator-reveals-dem-push-to-impeach-trump-led-to-discovery-of-key-hunter-biden-information,2020-12-13
"Top Ukraine official denies quid pro quo conversation, refuting key impeachment witness testimony","A top aide to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky refuted a key claim made during last month's impeachment inquiry hearing by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, according to Time.

The aide, Andriy Yermak, denied that he and Sondland were ever in conversation alone and said Sondland never told him that military aid was dependent upon Ukraine opening or announcing investigations into the 2016 election interference and Hunter Biden's board appointment at Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

""Gordon and I were never alone together,"" Yermak said. ""We bumped into each other in the hallway next to the escalator, as I was walking out. And I remember — everything is fine with my memory — we talked about how well the meeting went. That's all we talked about.""

Sondland testified that he told Yermak he believed that ""the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,"" referring to a public statement about the investigations.

Yermak's emphasis on the clarity of his memory may be a subtle dig at Sondland's often shaky and incomplete recollection of key impeachment-related events. During his testimony and subsequent questioning, Sondland emphasized that he didn't take detailed notes and that he had so many conversations with foreign leaders that he sometimes could not remember details of those conversations.

Sondland also frequently deferred to the testimony of others, saying that he had no reason to doubt their recollection of events he was involved in, even if he could not remember them himself. Additionally, Sondland submitted revisions to his closed-door deposition after the fact, saying his memory had been refreshed by the testimony of other witnesses after his own.

The House Intelligence Committee relied heavily on Sondland's testimony to bolster their case that President Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Yermak's claim lines up with what Zelensky himself has said multiple times — that there was no quid pro quo arrangement with President Trump involving military aid or a White House meeting.

"Top US general in Europe says US needs to deploy more troops, warships to counter Russian aggression","The top general overseeing U.S. military operations in Europe told U.S. senators during a hearing Tuesday that he thought the U.S. needed to increase its presence in Europe in order to counter Russia's ""increasingly aggressive force.""

Here's what we know

Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti oversees all U.S. military operations in Europe and is the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe. On Tuesday, he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Asked about the threat of Russian aggression by Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Scaparrotti said, ""In light of Russia's modernizing and increasingly aggressive force posture EUCOM [European Command] recommends augmenting our assigned and rotational forces to enhance our deterrence posture.""

He also said that he had asked for two more destroyers to be sent to Europe because ""we do need greater capacity particularly given the modernization and growth of the fleets — Russian fleets in Europe."" He spoke of Russia as a ""growing threat"" and warned about the current state of U.S. ""intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capacity.""

Scaparrotti also said that the United States is considering helping Ukraine improve its military sniper capabilities, although this would only be done through ""policy deliberations.""

What else?

Scaparrotti told the committee that if Turkey went through with a deal to buy Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles, then the United States should refuse to sell it any F-35 fighter jets.

""My best military advice would be that we don't then follow through with the F-35, flying it or working with an ally that's working with Russian systems, particularly air defense systems, with what I would say is probably one of most advanced technological capabilities,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-us-general-more-warships-counter-russia,2019-03-05
Top US general publicly contradicts controversial statement Biden made about American troops in Poland,"Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of United States European Command, publicly contradicted President Joe Biden on Tuesday.



What is the background?

Biden sowed international confusion last week when he appeared to tell soldiers with the 82nd Airborne that they were headed to Ukraine.

""You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle in front of a damned tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground,’"" Biden said.

The White House was forced to clarify Biden's comments, reiterating that U.S. troops are not going to Ukraine. But Biden caused further confusion on Monday when he was asked to personally clarify his comments, and he said that American troops are training Ukrainian soldiers in Poland.

""I was talking to the troops. We were talking about helping train the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland,"" Biden said, then adding, ""I was referring to being with, and talking with, the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland.""

What did Wolters say?

While testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) asked Wolters about Biden's claim.

Wolters said that ""liaisons"" are being ""given advice"" — presumably by American personnel — but Wolters clarified that American troops are not training Ukrainian soldiers as Biden suggested.

""I do not believe we are in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland,"" Wolters said. ""There are liaisons that are there that are being given advice, and that’s different than I think you’re referring to with respect to training.""

Biden's apparent admission that U.S. personnel are training Ukrainian soldiers in Poland triggered controversy, which Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) highlighted in an interview Monday.

""If that's the case, then it's surely classified. It may be that he’s explaining classified secrets on national television,"" Cruz said on Fox News. ""This is like Mr. McGoo as president, where every time he explains one thing, it gets worse and worse and worse, and we’ve got nuclear weapons pointed at each other. It is incredibly dangerous, this kind of presidential weakness.""

The White House was asked about Biden's remarks and Cruz's concern on Tuesday, but only played coy.

A reporter asked, ""Yesterday, did the president accidentally reveal a previously unknown effort for the U.S. to be training Ukrainian forces in Poland during his answer in the press conference?""

White House communications director Kate Bedingfield responded, ""No. The troops that he met with in Poland routinely interact with Ukrainians. That is something that’s known. ... That is in no way revealing compromised information. That being said, there’s nothing further that I have to say on that beyond what the president said yesterday.""

Just last week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that American troops were not training the Ukrainian military.

""We do not have U.S. troops currently training Ukrainians. We do not have U.S. troops on the territory of Ukraine,"" Sullivan said. ""We do, of course, have U.S. troops defending NATO territory, providing reassurance to our allies, deterring Russian aggression.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-us-general-publicly-contradicts-controversial-statement-biden-made-about-american-troops-in-poland,2022-03-30
Blaming Biden: Majority of likely general election voters think that the president's 'policies and spending' are the top cause for soaring inflation,"As Americans continue to get soaked by soaring inflation, a recent Trafalgar Group survey of likely general election voters found that a majority (59.9%) thought that ""President Biden's policies and spending"" are the top factors causing increasing inflation in the country — just 31.6% thought that the war between Russia and Ukraine is the top reason for increasing inflation.

The survey was performed May 25 through May 29 — the Trafalgar Group joined with Convention of States Action for the poll.

While a massive majority of Republicans (87.9%) blamed Biden for the nation's roaring inflation, only a third of Democrats (33.3%) blamed the president. And while 55.2% of Democrats blamed the Russia-Ukraine war as the chief culprit behind rising inflation, only 9.7% of Republicans held that view. A whopping 61.1% of those categorized as ""No Party/Other"" blamed the president, while 27.1% picked the foreign conflict.

Americans have been witnessing the purchasing power of their money be rapidly eroded by high-flying inflation.



""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending April, a smaller increase than the 8.5-percent figure for the period ending in March,"" the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics noted in a consumer price index report that was released earlier this month.

Gas prices have been on the rise, and as of Tuesday, the AAA national average for a gallon of regular fuel has reached $4.622.

If significant inflation persists, it could bode ill for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm election cycle.

In an op-ed, Biden described dealing with inflation as his ""top economic priority."" He said that the Federal Reserve is responsible for taming inflation.

""First, the Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation,"" Biden wrote. ""I agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now.""

""Second, we need to take every practical step to make things more affordable for families during this moment of economic uncertainty—and to boost the productive capacity of our economy over time,"" the president declared. ""I’ve done what I can on my own to help working families during this challenging time—and will keep acting to lower costs where I can—but now Congress needs to act too.""

""Third, we need to keep reducing the federal deficit, which will help ease price pressures,"" he wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trafalgar-poll-inflation-president-biden,2022-05-31
Joe Biden meets trans activist Dylan Mulvaney in White House,"Interviews with President Joe Biden are very rare and difficult to procure. According to a report from the White House Transition Project, Biden only gave 28 interviews in his first year in office – compared to 95 by Donald Trump, 162 by Barack Obama, and 50 by George W. Bush. In 2022, Biden went 220 days without an interview with an American TV journalist until he sat down with ""60 Minutes"" host Scott Pelley in mid-September. However, Biden has reportedly found the time to fit in interviews with six young people at the Oval Office.

NowThis – a progressive video-centric news site for young people – was allegedly granted access to Biden for interviews regarding Democrat-friendly topics such as gun legislation, student loan relief, abortion access, criminal justice reform, climate change, and trans rights.

NowThis said of the event, ""President Joe Biden sat down with six young people focused on finding solutions to some of the most critical issues facing their generation"" during the ""NowThis Presidential Forum.""

Transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney will be interviewing President Biden about trans rights. Mulvaney is a 25-year-old TikTok content creator who hosts a social media series titled ""Days of Girlhood"" about transitioning.

In a TikTok video posted on March 12, the transgender activist claimed to have become a ""girl."" In the video, Mulvaney mocked negative female stereotypes, such as crying throughout the day and buying unaffordable dresses.

The ""dylanmulvaney"" TikTok account has more than 8.3 million followers and over 267 million likes.



One of Mulvaney's viewers is apparently President Joe Biden – who turns 80 years old in less than a month.

Mulvaney announced on Thursday that Mulvaney had interviewed President Biden for NowThis. The trans activist noted that President Biden had watched the ""Days of Girlhood"" series about Mulvaney's transgender transition.

""It's day 222 of being a girl. I'm in Washington D.C., and I’m going to the White House to speak to the President of the United States,"" Mulvaney said on the video on Chinese social media platform TikTok.

""You know that phrase, ‘I think I may have girlbossed too close to the sun?’ Well that’s how I feel today,"" Mulvaney said while wearing a ""Don't mess with trans kids"" shirt and filming in a bathroom. ""Because I get to sit down with Joe Biden and NowThis News, and I get to ask him a few questions surrounding trans issues in the United States and talk to him about my transness, and I really just want to represent my community the best that I can.”

""And you know what, as silly as I am on here, I am ready to step up and show that trans people, we’re not going anywhere, and that trans kids, they deserve a fighting chance to be their true selves,"" Mulvaney continued.



To meet President Biden, the transgender activist wore an outfit featuring the colors of the trans flag, including white high heels and a pink scarf.

Video shows Mulvaney entering the White House, seeing a portrait of Michelle Obama, and saying, ""Our queen, love you, I love you.""

President Biden allegedly gave the trans activist a cookie in the Oval Office.

Mulvaney frantically gushed about petting Biden's dog.



Mulvaney said of the meeting, ""I left with a lot of hope and optimism, not only for just trans people, but many different topics.""

""And the fact that our president has watched 'Days of Girlhood' – it's kind of epic,"" the trans activist said of Biden watching the TikTok series about transitioning.

""And I'm not gonna lie I have been having a rough go of it lately. A lot of darkness,"" Mulvaney added. ""And today was what I needed to keep going.""

Mulvaney called on everyone to vote in the midterms because they will ""be one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.""

Mulvaney said, ""We're going to clean up some messes that have needed cleaning for hundreds of years.""

The NowThis interviews with Biden are said to be released on Sunday night.

Last week, Mulvaney was embroiled in a controversy involving cosmetics behemoth Ulta Beauty. Mulvaney appeared in a Ulta-sponsored video along with gender-fluid hairstylist David Lopez. The two biological men discussed girlhood and motherhood.



Mulvaney declared, ""I know I can find love, I know I can still be a performer, I know I can have a family. I want to be a mom one day — and I absolutely can!""

The controversial video sparked outrage, and many women vowed to boycott Ulta Beauty.

This isn't the first time Biden's White House has enlisted social media influencers to appeal to young voters.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced it would utilize social media influencers to ""combat scams and misinformation"" about the new federal student loan debt relief program.

In March, the White House welcomed popular TikTok content creators to deliver a briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In December 2021, Biden appeared in a TikTok video with the Jonas Brothers to promote COVID-19 vaccines.

"Transgender woman who wants to leave Ukraine rips country's transphobia, says 'there's no way Ukrainian border people can let me through'","A transgender woman living in Ukraine wants to get out of the country amid the Russian invasion, but Zi Faámelu's passport says ""male"" — and the 31-year-old noted to CBS News that ""there's no way Ukrainian border people can let me through. There's no way.""

What are the details?

The Ukraine State Border Guard Service reportedly announced last week that men ages 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. But Faámelu may not be granted entry into a neighboring country anyway because of the mismatch between Faámelu's legal sex and lived gender, LBGTQNation said.

""This is not a very rainbow-friendly place. ... Lives for trans people are very bleak here,"" Faámelu noted to CBS News. ""If you have a male gender in your passport, they will not let you go abroad. They will not let you through.""

The LGBTQ community has become more accepted over the years, but the network said it's more complicated for transgender people.

LBGTQNation explained it's not easy for transgender Ukrainians to get updated passports, as Human Rights Watch said they're likely still required to undergo psychiatric observation and gender-affirming surgery to update their documents.

“I don’t want to go through that. This is like, humiliating for the world…. I decided to keep my passport, keep male in my passport, and now I cannot leave this country,” Faámelu noted to CBS News. “[It’s] a war within a war, truly.”

'I'm literally scared for my life'

The network said Faámelu — who lives in Kyiv, which has been barraged by Russian military forces — is running out of food and hasn't left home for days.

""A few hours ago I heard bombings and my windows were shaking. ... I'm literally scared for my life,"" Faámelu added to CBS News.

What's more, Faámelu told the network that transphobia is the norm in the city and in neighboring countries, and fears that if that trying to leave will increase the chances the transgender woman will be treated violently.

""Many people have guns and weapons. ... It can be an excuse for violence,"" Faámelu told CBS News, adding, ""This is a very scary situation.""

CBS News added that Faámelu also was a popular contestant on the Ukrainian singing competition show ""Star Factory.""

Anything else?

Adding to the difficulty are Faámelu's parents, who live in Crimea, the network said — and, according to Faámelu, don't believe Russia has invaded Kyiv: ""They are literally brainwashed. The world sees the picture, but they are simply blind in this case. My parents think it's all fake, that we bomb ourselves, that we try to create some drama.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-woman-who-wants-to-leave-ukraine-rips-countrys-transphobia-says-theres-no-way-ukrainian-border-people-can-let-me-through,2022-03-02
The Treasury Dept. has provided highly sensitive information about Hunter Biden and associates to GOP senators,"The Treasury Department is complying with requests from GOP senators and has turned over highly sensitive information regarding Hunter Biden and his business associates to Republican senators who have asked for the materials, Yahoo News reported on Thursday.

According to the news outlet, a spokeswoman for Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said that the Treasury Department is ""voluntarily cooperating"" with the Senate Republicans' requests ""at lightning speed.""

""Agencies like the Treasury Department are rapidly complying with Senate Republican requests — no subpoenas necessary — and producing 'evidence' of questionable origin,"" the spokeswoman said.

For months now, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), chairman of the Finance Committee, and Ron Johnson (Wis.) chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, have been conducting an investigation into ""potential conflicts of interest posed"" by Biden's business dealings.

The two senators have been sending letters to numerous departments and agencies in Washington — including the State Department, the Treasury, the Justice Department, the FBI, the National Archives and the Secret Service — requesting information to aid their investigation.

According to Wyden, their requests to the Treasury Department have been met with cooperation. Yahoo News reports that Grassley and Johnson have sought ""some of the most sensitive and closely held documents in all of federal law enforcement — highly confidential suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by financial institutions with FinCEN, an agency of the Treasury that helps to police money laundering.""

While it seems clear that some documents have been turned over in response to the senators' requests, it is not yet certain that SARs were among those documents.

The Treasury Department website notes that a financial institution is required to file a SAR after it deems an ""initial detection of facts"" constitutes one. Such constituting activities include cash transactions that exceed $10,000 or behavior that ""might signal criminal activity.""

A copy of the senators' letter to the Treasury Department, made available by Reuters, shows that Grassley and Johnson requested SARs and related documents pertaining to Biden, Burisma Holdings, and Rosemont Seneca Partners, along with a number of other contacts.

Grassley's office responded to Democrats' criticisms of the Treasury's compliance, saying, ""it's unfortunate that Democrats whom we've kept in the loop on our investigations would recklessly seek to interfere with legitimate government oversight.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/treasury-sends-highly-sensitive-info-about-hunter-biden,2020-02-06
Trey Gowdy explains how Barack Obama may become a witness in President Trump's impeachment trial,"Former Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) explained this week how former President Barack Obama may be a relevant witness in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

""Part of impeachment is setting a precedent for what's going to happen in the future,"" Gowdy told Fox News host Sean Hannity,

""So, if the vice president can make that assertion, then he is relevant as a witness, but so too is President Obama because I would want to know whether or not he had the authority of the president at the time he made that that pronouncement that there'll be no loan guarantees unless the prosecutor is fired,"" he continued.

Gowdy explained that if Democrats claim that Trump has engaged in ""unprecedented abuse of power"" then that ""makes what other presidents did relevant.""

""If President Obama gave Joe Biden permission to condition loan guarantees on the firing of a prosecutor, then that makes both of them potentially relevant as witnesses,"" Gowdy said.

Gowdy was referring to the infamous video of Biden in 2018 bragging about threatening to withhold aid from Ukraine if the country did not fire its top prosecutor.

Biden said at the time:

I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and Yanukovych that they would take action against the state prosecutor and they didn't. So they were walking out of the press conference, and I said we were not going to give them the $1 billion. They said you have no authority. You are not the president. The president said ... I said call him. I'm telling you, you are not getting $1 billion. I said you're not getting $1 billion and I am going to be leaving here in six hours and if the prosecutor is not fired you are not getting the money. Well, son of a b**** ... he got fired.

Trey Gowdy explains Trump's single best piece of evidence for impeachment trial,"Former congressman Trey Gowdy explained what he believed was the best piece of evidence that President Donald Trump's lawyers could use in his defense in an upcoming impeachment trial in the Senate.

Gowdy made the comments in an interview on ""American's Newsroom"" on Fox News Thursday.

""The transcript is the single best piece of evidence that the president has,"" said Gowdy, referring to a summary of a call between the president and Ukrainian President Zelensky that precipitated the impeachment charges by Democrats.

The president is accused of obstruction against Congress and abuse of power over claims that he was demanding an investigation into Joe Biden and his son for political motivations.

""Who brought up Rudy Giuliani's name? It wasn't Donald Trump. It was Zelensky,"" Gowdy continued.

""This was the second call, not the first call. If President Trump were really hellbent on ensuring that Ukraine investigate the Bidens, would he not have brought that up in the first telephone call we had with Zelensky? I mean why wait until the second?"" Gowdy said.

""Who brought up [US Attorney General] Bill Barr and under what circumstances was Bill Barr's name brought up?"" he added.

""I think the transcript is the single best piece of evidence that the president has, laying aside the reality that there was no announcement of an investigation, there was no investigation, and the aid was ultimately released, so I don't think the Democrats have a great case for conviction,"" Gowdy said.

""But also you would be hard-pressed to find five members of this jury that have not already made up their mind,"" he concluded.

Democrats sent two articles of impeachment to the Senate on Wednesday after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) attempted to force Senate Republicans to agree to her terms for the impeachment trial.

Trey Gowdy dismantles key liberal narrative about impeachment based on Ukraine transcript,"Former congressman Trey Gowdy dismantled an argument used by critics of the president to claim that he acted improperly by asking his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to seek evidence of corruption from Ukrainian officials.

Gowdy was speaking to Dana Perino on her Fox News show when she asked him about the claims against Giuliani.

""Rudy is not hard to find, and that is a knowable fact. Whether or not the State Department directed Mr. Giuliani, or whether or not somebody else did, or whether he did it on his own initiative,"" Gowdy answered.

""But, I think the seminal question is, does any of that matter? What is the theory under which that is an impeachable offense? If the president asks Mayor Giuliani to do it, is that the impeachable offense?"" he asked.

""Keep in mind in the transcript, Dana, it was the Ukrainian president who first brought up Rudy's name! It wasn't Donald Trump!"" Gowdy laughed.

""The Ukrainian president is the first one to mention Rudy Giuliani, and we are in a sad state of affairs if you cannot have the Attorney General, Bill Barr, ask about a piece of evidence that one point, [former FBI Director] Jim Comey and the FBI were interested in, also lots of people were interested in, the server, because it may help us prevent future attacks,"" he explained.

""So if it is impeachable for the Attorney General to seek a piece of relevant evidence, we're in a weird wild place!"" Gowdy concluded.

Democrats have begun an impeachment inquiry based on the accusations against the president based on a transcript of a phone call he made with the Ukrainian president. His critics say the president used his office in order to seek favors from a foreign government to influence the 2020 election.

Defenders of the president say he was merely asking the Ukrainian government to look into corruption that might relate to U.S. interests.

'It basically just dropped off a cliff': Analysts fear major trucking downturn spells doom for US economy,"The U.S. trucking industry has suffered a dramatic downturn in recent months and financial analysts are worried the bad news is a presage of widespread economic trouble.

What are the details?

According to data compiled by Reuters, the demand for trucking every kind of product from food to furniture has been in a free fall since March. And one segment of the industry that deals with on-demand trucking, known as the ""spot market,"" has been hit especially hard.

""It basically just dropped off a cliff,"" said Craig Fuller, the CEO of transportation data company FreightWaves, in conversation with the news agency.

The demand-sensitive spot market is now in correction territory, Reuters reported. Average first-quarter spot rates, excluding fuel, plummeted 55 cents per mile from $2.78 in mid-January to $2.23 on April 14. A slight downtick is reportedly common for that time of year, but the industry normally only sees a 22 cent per mile decrease.

The rate deterioration took hold when diesel prices nearly doubled amid backlash over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has been pummeling trucker wages ever since.

Reuters cited one California-based trucker, 63-year-old Marco Padilla, to demonstrate just how bad things have gotten. Padilla told the outlet he used to spend about 25-30 cents per mile to run his truck. But he's nowhere near that range anymore.

""For every dollar (of pay), I was pocketing 70 cents,"" he said. ""Now it costs $1 a mile.""

What does it mean?

Those familiar with the trucking industry know spot market trouble is rarely an isolated incident.

One expert, Joseph Rajkovacz, who serves as director of governmental affairs for the Western States Trucking Association, described it as the ""proverbial 'canary in the mineshaft,'"" meaning it is an early indicator of coming danger.

Analysts fear the downward trend could soon ""decimate truckers' ability to dictate prices and push some small trucking firms into bankruptcy,"" the outlet stated. But not only that, it could foreshadow a wider recession across all sectors of the U.S. economy.

Trucking data company Convoy found that economic recessions followed six of the 12 trucking recessions since 1972. The reason is simple: When consumers buy less, companies ship less, causing trucking activity to slow.

Stated another way, decreased trucking activity typically means only one thing: Consumer retail activity is down. And since consumer spending accounts for about 70% of economic activity, any decline can be catastrophic for the overall economy.

That seems to be exactly what the economy is experiencing at the moment. American consumers, hurt by historically high inflation and global supply chain crises, have cut back on spending.

What else?

Trucking activity, however, is not the first recession indicator to come up this year. Last month, news that the U.S. Treasury note yield curve had inverted first caused many economists to worry.

Trump administration violated law by withholding aid to Ukraine: GAO report,"The Trump administration violated the law when it withheld military aid to Ukraine for policy reasons, according to a Government Accountability Office memo released just as articles of impeachment are being transmitted from the House to the Senate.

The House impeachment saga has centered on the accusation that President Donald Trump abused his presidential power by withholding military aid in order to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.

According to the GAO, an independent congressional watchdog, delaying aid to advance a policy agenda rather than for programmatic reasons is illegal.

""Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,"" the GAO report reads. ""[The Office of Management and Budget] withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.""

OMB issued a statement defending the legality of the decision to temporarily withhold the military aid.

""We disagree with GAO's opinion,"" OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel said, according to the Washington Post. ""OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President's priorities and with the law.""

There are no criminal penalties associated with violation of the ICA, and the determination by the GAO is not likely to have any direct impact on impeachment — although Democrats have already used it as justification to call additional witnesses for the Senate trial.

Previous administrations have been called out by the GAO for violations of the law as well, although they may not have created as big a media splash since they lacked the context of a related impeachment trial. From the Post:

Several administrations have been slapped by the GAO, including that of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. In general, those administrations released funds after being cited, making lawsuits unnecessary. Most recently, in December 2018, the GAO said the Department of Homeland Security illegally withheld $95 million appropriated for the Coast Guard to support national security efforts. The funds were eventually released.



GAO also found in 2014 that the Obama administration broke the law in exchanging five Taliban commanders for a captured U.S. soldier without giving Congress 30 days notice.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-violated-law-by-withholding-aid-to-ukraine,2020-01-16
Trump turns on AG Bill Barr after report claims he knew about probe of Hunter Biden before election,"President Donald Trump criticized U.S. Attorney General William Barr after a report claimed that he knew about the federal investigation into Hunter Biden before the election.

The report from the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday that Barr knew about two investigations into his business dealings at about the time that his father was vice president of the United States.

The Department of Justice has rules against taking investigative steps that would have an affect on any election, and Barr's decision to keep the investigations under wraps might have been in order to satisfy that policy.

On Friday the president reacted negatively to the report via his social media account.

""Now it turns out that my phone call to the President of Ukraine, which many, including me, have called 'perfect', was even better than that,"" tweeted Trump.

""I predicted Biden corruption, said to call the A.G. [Bill Barr], who perhaps knew of the corruption during the impeachment hoax?"" he added.



The president was referring to a conversation he had with Ukrainian President Zelensky where he asked him to look into charges of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats impeached the president partly over the call because they said it was an abuse of power.

While accusations of criminal activity by Hunter Biden were tossed around before the election by allies of the president, the existence of a federal investigation was revealed on Wednesday.

""I learned yesterday for the first time that the US Attorney's Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,"" said Hunter Biden in a statement put out by the Biden Harris transition team.

""I take this matter very seriously, but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" he added.

A later report said that the probe was much more expansive than his ""tax affairs,"" and could include accusations of money laundering and illegal conduct with foreign countries.

Trump defends call with Ukraine president: ‘It’s very important to talk about corruption’,"President Donald Trump said Monday that ""honesty"" was his reason for discussing suspected corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden, Biden's son Hunter Biden, and a Ukrainian national gas company that employed the latter on its board on a July phone call with the president of Ukraine.

What's the background?

Hunter Biden's relationship with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma is at the center of a recent media firestorm resulting from a July phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump reportedly urged Zelensky to look into a probe of the company and Hunter Biden.

At a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations event, Biden said that he — while still vice president — pressured then-Ukranain president Petro Poroshenko to fire then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was leading an investigation into the company by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.

Shokin was fired, though Shokin's replacement told The Hill earlier this year that some evidence in the Burisma case might interest U.S. authorities and that he would like to present that information to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.

The recent controversy surrounding the phone call began last week with a complaint from a so-called whistleblower who reportedly did not have ""direct knowledge"" of Trump's conversation with Zelensky.

What did Trump say?

When asked about the specifics of his phone call, Trump explained Monday that ""if we deal with a country we want honesty.""

""We're supporting a country; we want to make sure that country is honest,"" Trump continued. ""It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption, so it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important.""

When asked about the recent controversy regarding a July phone call between him and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City on Monday, President Trump said ""we had a perfect call with the president of Ukraine; everybody knows it. It's just a Democrat witch hunt, here we go again.""

Democrats ""failed with Russia; they failed with recession; they failed with everything, and now they're bringing this up,"" Trump continued. ""The one who's got the problem is Biden. Because you look at what Biden did: Biden did what they would like to have me do, except for one problem: I didn't do it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-defends-call-with-ukraine-president,2019-09-23
Trump EU ambassador will defy administration and testify to Democrats’ impeachment probe: Lawyer,"Despite the Trump administration's efforts to stop him, United States Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland will testify in House Democrats' impeachment probe against President Donald Trump next week, his lawyers said.

In a Friday morning statement, an attorney for Sondland said, ""Notwithstanding the State Department's current direction not to testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees' subpoena, and he looks forward to testifying on Thursday.""

The statement added that the diplomat ""has no agenda apart from answering the Committees' questions fully and truthfully.""

Earlier this week, Sondland was scheduled to voluntarily give testimony to a trio of House committees but was blocked from doing so at the last minute by the Trump administration.

""I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify,"" President Trump said of the decision, ""but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see.""

The chairmen of the relevant committees responded later that day with a subpoena for Sondland's testimony and documents related to the investigation.

Sondland's attorney said that while his client can provide testimony to the impeachment investigation, the subpoenaed documents are another matter entirely. The ambassador ""respects the Committee's interest in reviewing all relevant materials,"" the statement explained, ""however, federal law and State Department regulations prohibit him from producing documents concerning his officials responsibilities.""

The White House, however, has unequivocally stated that it will not cooperate with the impeachment probe in a letter sent out Tuesday night. Chief among the reasons it listed is the fact that the probe was announced without an authorizing vote of the full House of Representatives, as has been done in past presidential impeachment cases.

Sondland is a key figure in the controversy surrounding President Trump's communications with Ukrainian government officials. In testimony given last week, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told lawmakers that he consulted with Sondland in August about a proposed anti-corruption statement to be given by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

According to the testimony and a corresponding text message, Volker and Sondland discussed whether or not the statement should mention Burisma — the energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter — and allegations of interfering in the 2016 elections. Volker testified that the statement was ultimately scrapped.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-eu-ambassador-will-defy-administration-and-testify-to-dems-impeachment-probe-lawyer,2019-10-11
Trump fires back at John Bolton over explosive Ukraine allegation in forthcoming book,"President Donald Trump has strongly denied explosive allegations about his Ukraine dealings made by John Bolton, his former national security adviser, in a forthcoming book.

In a series of tweets published just after midnight Monday, Trump accused Bolton of parroting falsehoods to promote book sales.

""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book,"" Trump said.

The New York Times reported late Sunday that Bolton claims in his book that Trump admitted to him last August that he wanted to continue freezing nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine if the Ukrainian government did not cooperate with investigations into the Bidens.

Bolton's account undercuts the heart of Trump's impeachment defense and suggests the president engaged in a quid pro quo, or at least intended to do so.

According to the Times, Bolton also writes about the involvement of other top government officials.

For example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged privately that there was no basis to claims by the president's lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt and believed Mr. Giuliani may have been acting on behalf of other clients, Mr. Bolton wrote.



Mr. Bolton also said that after the president's July phone call with the president of Ukraine, he raised with Attorney General William P. Barr his concerns about Mr. Giuliani, who was pursuing a shadow Ukraine policy encouraged by the president, and told Mr. Barr that the president had mentioned him on the call. A spokeswoman for Mr. Barr denied that he learned of the call from Mr. Bolton; the Justice Department has said he learned about it only in mid-August.

Speaking on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham blamed the manuscript leak on Bolton's publisher, and said the timing was ""suspect.""

""It's very clear the president did nothing wrong. And then suddenly, this manuscript has magically appeared in the hands of the New York Times making very, very big claims. This is by a publisher — the same publisher that [James] Comey used, also,"" Grisham said, Politico noted. ""And the fact that magically, again, you know, the book ordering online — pre-order link popped up a couple hours after all of this hit, you know, it's sad. But I think the timing is very suspect.""

But Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, blamed the leak on the White House. He told the New York Times that the White House has been in possession of Bolton's manuscript since Dec. 30, when it was turned over for review to determine if there was classified information in the manuscript, a routine procedure for books written by former government employees.

""It is clear, regrettably, from the New York Times article published today that the pre-publication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,"" he said.

Bolton's book, titled, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" is scheduled to be released on March 17.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-fires-back-at-john-bolton-over-explosive-ukraine-allegation-in-forthcoming-book,2020-01-27
"Trump fires key intelligence figure that sparked Ukraine probe, Dems are already calling it 'retribution'","President Donald Trump notified Congress on Friday evening that he was firing a key intelligence community figure that sparked the Ukraine probe, and Democrats rushed to call it unfair ""retribution.""

""This is to advise that I am exercising my power as President to remove from office the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, effective 30 days from today,"" Trump said in the letter.

Michael Atkinson served as the intelligence community's chief watchdog and was the first to notify Congress about the whistleblower complaint that led to the impeachment inquiry against the president.

The president said in the letter that he no longer had confidence in Atkinson and that he would be relieved of his duties in 30 days.

""As is the case with regard to other positions where I, as president, have the power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as Inspectors General,"" Trump added.

Democrats immediately pounced on the opportunity to accuse the president of politically motivated retribution.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) accused the president of trying to diminish the independence of the intelligence community.

""President Trump's decision to fire Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson is yet another blatant attempt by the President to gut the independence of the Intelligence Community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing,"" Schiff said.

""At a time when our country is dealing with a national emergency and needs people in the Intelligence Community to speak truth to power, the President's dead of night decision puts our country and national security at even greater risk,"" he added.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) defended Atkinson.

""Michael Atkinson is a man of integrity who has served our nation for almost two decades,"" he tweeted.

""Being fired for having the courage to speak truth to power makes him a patriot,"" he concluded.

"'It was all bulls**t': Trump hits Romney, Democrats, and Russia probe in post-acquittal victory speech","A jovial President Donald Trump took a post-impeachment victory lap Thursday, after his Wednesday impeachment acquittal in the Senate, in a lengthy White House speech that praised his Republican allies while excoriating Democrats and GOP Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) and derided the Russia probe in fairly explicit terms.

""This is really not a news conference, it's not a speech, it's not anything, it's just we're sort of — it's a celebration, because we have something that just worked out,"" Trump told the audience. ""We went through hell unfairly.""

During his remarks, Trump also took aim at other previous attempts to undermine his presidency, including the Russia probe and the related Mueller report.



""We've been going through this now for over three years,"" Trump said. ""It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever. I don't know that other presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said no, they wouldn't have. But I can tell you, at a minimum, you have to focus on this, because it can get away very quickly, no matter who you have with you.""

""We were treated unbelievably unfairly,"" Trump said later in the wide-ranging speech. ""We first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bulls**t. We then went through the Mueller report, and they should have come back one day later. They didn't; they came back two years later, after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money.""



Trump also called out Democrats during the remarks, mentioning House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) by name.

""I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy,"" Trump said, referring to health care, immigration, and tax issues.

""So I've always said they are lousy politicians, but they do two things,"" he continued, later explaining that those things are that they are ""vicious as hell"" and they stick together.

""Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person,"" Trump said. ""Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person. And she wanted to impeach a long time ago, when she said 'I pray for the president.'"" He went on to add that ""she may pray, but she prays for the opposite, but I doubt she prays at all.""

He also criticized Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who he said ""used religion as a crutch"" in voting to convict him the day before. ""Never heard him use it before, but today, you know, it's one of those things,"" Trump went on. ""But you know, it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president.""



Throughout his remarks, Trump heaped praise on several of his Republican allies from both the House and the Senate who were in attendance, thanking them for their support during the impeachment process and even cracking jokes about a few of them.

For example, the president joked about Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and his famous tendency not to wear jackets. ""I said, he never wears a jacket. What the hell is going on? He's obviously very proud of his body."" He also joked that people say that when Jordan works out, ""the machine starts burning.""

However, while the Ukraine impeachment efforts may finally have come to a close, Trump said that he doesn't expect Democrats to cease their efforts against him.

""I'm sure they will try to cook up other things,"" Trump said, specifically referring to Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

""They'll go through the state of New York, they'll go through other places, they will do whatever they can,"" Trump said. ""Because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do, in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-hits-romney-democrats-russia-probe-in-post-acquittal-victory-speech,2020-02-06
President Trump keeps EU ambassador from testifying in 'compromised kangaroo court' impeachment probe,"President Donald Trump said that he blocked a U.S. ambassador from testifying to House investigators because doing so would put him in front of a Kangaroo court.

Tuesday morning, it was reported that Ambassador Gordon Sondland had been barred from testifying at a scheduled deposition, which was part House Democrats' impeachment probe of President Trump and his correspondence with Ukrainian officials.

Later in the morning, President Trump took to Twitter to explain the reasoning behind the decision to block Sondland's testimony:

""I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see.""

Sondland — the United States ambassador to the European Union — was originally scheduled to provide closed-door testimony to the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees, but was directed not to do so at the last minute.

""Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,"" Sondland's attorney said in a statement, adding that the ambassador had agreed to testify voluntarily ""in order to answer the committee's questions on an expedited basis.""

As a sitting ambassador, the statement explained, Sondland is bound to State Department policy. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said that the administration's decision was ""additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress.""

House Oversight Committee top Republican Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said that, while he and his colleagues had hoped to hear Sondland's testimony, they also ""understand the reason why the State Department decided not to have Ambassador Sondland appear today; it's based on the unfair and partisan process that Mr. Schiff has been running.""

Sondland is a key figure in the controversy surrounding President Trump's communications with Ukrainian government officials currently fueling the impeachment probe. In testimony given last week, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told lawmakers that he consulted with Sondland in August about a proposed anti-corruption statement to be given by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The current impeachment controversy centers on President Trump's desire to have Ukrainian officials look into alleged corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, related to a past investigation of Burisma — a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden as a board member. According to the testimony and a corresponding text message, Volker and Sondland discussed whether or not the statement should mention Burisma and allegations of interfering in the 2016 elections. Volker testified that the statement was ultimately scrapped.

UPDATE:



Later Monday morning, The Democratic chairmen of the committees that Sondland was scheduled to testify before responded to the administration's decision by announcing that they would subpoena Sondland ""for both his testimony and his documents.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-keeps-eu-ambassador-from-testifying-to-compromised-kangaroo-court-impeachment-probe,2019-10-08
'No way to dress that up': Trump lawyer’s Biden-Burisma arguments draw praise from even CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin,"Pam Bondi's breakdown of the corruption concerns surrounding Hunter Biden's business dealings in the Ukraine during the Senate impeachment trial were so effective, that even CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin had to give her credit for it.

During the White House defense team's opening arguments Monday, the former Florida attorney general argued that questions about potential corruption surrounding the Bidens' dealings in the Ukraine while Joe Biden was vice president and Hunter Biden was employed as a board member at the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma were indeed legitimate.

""When the House managers gave you their presentation, when they submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and Burisma,"" Bondi began, adding that ""they referenced Biden or Burisma over 400 times"" during opening arguments ""and when they gave these presentations, they said there was nothing, nothing to see.""

Bondi went on to say that Democrats' ""case crumbles because they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no basis to raise this concern, but that's not what public records show.""

In addition to giving a detailed timeline of Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma during his father's time in office, as well as the political events in Ukraine at the time, Bondi pointed out how even witnesses called by House Democrats during the impeachment investigation saw potential problems with the matter.

""In fact, every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Bondi said. ""Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and other unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest. These were their witnesses.""



She also pointed out how multiple legacy media outlets raised questions about Hunter Biden's role at Burisma before the matter ended up at the center of congressional Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump.

www.youtube.com

During a CNN segment later Monday, Toobin, the network's legal analyst, admitted that Bondi had done an effective job of pointing out the bad optics of Hunter Biden's Ukrainian employment.



""I thought Attorney General Bondi did an effective job at showing how sleazy the hiring of Hunter Biden was,"" Toobin said. ""There is no way to dress that up. He was given a great deal of money for a job he was unqualified for and the only reason he got it is because he was the vice president's son.""

However, Toobin then immediately pivoted to the Trump defense's team's discussion about Joe Biden's role in the matter, ""a parade of lies"" and ""outrageously false in every fact, in every insinuation.""

During an interview with ABC News last year, Hunter Biden also admitted that he ""probably"" wouldn't have gotten the lucrative position at Burisma if his last name weren't Biden.

Trump plans retaliation against White House officials who testified during impeachment hearings,"Now that President Donald Trump has been acquitted of the impeachment charges leveled against him by House Democrats, he has turned his attention toward ways to punish White House officials who testified against him, according to the Washington Post.

One of the first to face consequences for his role in the impeachment process may be National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was among the first officials to testify publicly before the House Intelligence Committee in November.

Vindman, who likely understood the consequences of his testimony, has reportedly already planned to step down from the NSC by the end of this month. However, President Trump may desire to send a message by removing Vindman more quickly. The Post reports:

[Vindman] will be informed in the coming days, likely on Friday, by administration officials that he is being reassigned to a position at the Defense Department, taking a key figure from the investigation out of the White House, according to two people familiar with the move who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel decisions.



Vindman had already informed senior officials at the NSC that he intended to take an early exit from his assignment and leave his post by the end of the month, according to people familiar with his decision, but Trump is eager to make a symbol of the Army officer soon after the Senate acquitted him of the impeachment charges approved by House Democrats.

Vindman was on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was flagged by an anonymous whistleblower in a complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry. In his testimony, Vindman raised concerns about the appropriateness of the call's content, and the accuracy of the transcript released to the public.

While the president was able to discourage or prevent testimony by senior officials such as chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, numerous lower-ranking White House or State Department officials contributed to House Democrats' impeachment case against Trump.

As a result, President Trump is considering more terminations or reassignments in an attempt to remove opposition and shrink the overall size of his national security staff.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-plans-retaliation-against-white-house-officials-who-testified-during-impeachment-hearings,2020-02-07

Earlier on Friday another impeachment witness, Lt. Col. Vindman, was removed from the National Security Council, which some critics saw as retaliation on the part of President Donald Trump.

Sondland continued in his statement to thank the president for the opportunity to serve as an ambassador.

""I am grateful to President Trump to having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support, and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union,"" he added.

Sondland testified about what he overheard in relation to a call by the president to the president of Ukraine, and whether a ""quid pro quo"" demand was made in exchange for an investigation into Joe Biden and his dealings in the country crippled by corruption.

President Trump releases transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian president that convinced Pelosi to pursue impeachment,"The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of President Donald Trump's phone conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. This phone call became a major point of contention after a ""whistleblower"" from within the U.S. government reported that Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who has been a frontrunner for most of the Democratic presidential primary polls including at the time this call occurred.

This phone call took place on the morning of July 25.

What's the background?

Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas firm. Biden would later openly admit that while he was vice president he had asked the then-president of Ukraine to fire a corrupt prosecutor. This prosecutor happened to concern the oligarch who owned Burisma. The replacement prosecutor shut down an investigation into Burisma within a year of taking over.

According to the anonymous government whistleblower, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. Trump had put a hold on military aid to Ukraine worth $400 million the day before the phone call. Because of this, there here were accusations from Democrats and members of the news media that he may pushed for the investigation by threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine.

These rumors were enough to convince more Democrats, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), to support impeaching the president.

What did the transcript say?

In the transcript, toward the middle of the phone conversation, Trump asked Zelensky if he would ""do us a favor.""

At no point during this conversation did Trump state to Zelensky that there would be any sort of quid pro quo for this favor.

Zelensky responded that one of his assistants had spoken ""with Mr. [Rudy] Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine."" He also discussed recalling and replacing the U.S. ambassador to the United States.

""I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us,"" Zelensky added.

Then Trump moved on to the topic that caused the recent controversy:

Good because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.

Zelensky responded that he was planning on adding one of his own prosecutors ""since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament."" He added that this new prosecutor would ""be 100% my person, my candidate"" and that they would ""look into this situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.""



Trump replied that he would ""have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.""

""I'm sure you will figure it out,"" Trump continued. ""I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It's a great country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-releases-transcript-of-his-phone-call-with-the-ukrainian-president,2019-09-25
Outrage ensues after President Trump implies official leaking info to whistleblower should be executed,"President Donald Trump is facing criticism for comments where he said that the official who tipped off a whistleblower about his comments was akin to a spy, and mused that they used to be executed.

The comments were made on Thursday by the president at a private event in New York.

""I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy,"" Trump said.

""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right?"" he added. ""The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.""

Democrats have seized on the transcript of a phone call between the president and the president of Ukraine to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings. An anonymous whistleblower first revealed the interaction.

The president also bashed Democrats and called reporters ""scum"" during the event.

""Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call — heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw — they're almost a spy,"" Trump complained.

Critics accused the president of threatening a witness with the comments.

""This president is psychologically deranged, and it's only going to get worse,"" commented Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, on MSNBC.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) denounced the president for the comments, saying that they amounted to witness intimidation.



""The President's suggestion that those involved in the whisteblower complaint should be dealt with as 'we used to do' for 'spies and treason' is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation,"" Schiff tweeted.

""All Americans must denounce such witness intimidation,"" he added.

'Quiet!' — President Trump shuts down Jim Acosta in testy exchange over Lev Parnas,"CNN's Jim Acosta got shut down by President Donald Trump during a media briefing where the reporter pressed the president on a statement from a Ukrainian associate of Rudy Giuliani.

Acosta took to Twitter to object about his treatment.

""Just asked Trump about Parnas claim that admin efforts in Ukraine were ""all about 2020."" Trump insisted he's only posed for photos with Parnas,"" Acosta said.

""Kept repeating that defense. Eventually told me to be 'quiet,'"" he added.



Parnas claimed in an MSNBC interview that Giuliani acted as a personal lawyer to Trump when he went to Ukraine in order to gather evidence against Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. He said that the president was aware of the mission and that U.S. Attorney General William Barr was also on the ""team.""

Video from CNN shows the entire interaction, in which the president continuously denies knowing anything about Parnas, and denying he ever talked to him.

""What is your response to Lev Parnas who says that your efforts in Ukraine were all about 2020, that you just wanted Joe Biden out. What's your response?"" asked Acosta.

""I don't know him at all, don't know what he's about,"" the president responded. ""Don't know where he comes from, know nothing about him.""

Acosta attempted to interrupt the president several times as he continued to talk over him and deny the claims from Parnas.

""I don't know him, I've never had a conversation that I remember with him, and you certainly, let me tell you, you just have to take a look at the polls,"" Trump said.

""You just have to take a look at the pictures, you just have to take a look at the polls, you see I don't need anybody's help,"" Trump continued. ""We're doing phenomenally well.""

President Trump unleashes twitter response to impeachment announcement — and a video bashing Democrats,"President Donald Trump excoriated Democrats in a series of tweets Tuesday in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-N.Y.) announcing a formal impeachment inquiry.

""Such an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage,"" the president tweeted.

""So bad for our Country!"" he added.



The president named Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) among those who were supporting impeachment against him.

""Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?"" he added incredulously in a second tweet.

""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" the president continued. ""PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!""

Pelosi had been resisting calls from the left wing of the Democratic party to press for impeachment, but she relented after a damaging report citing an anonymous whistleblower in the administration.

The president also shared a video condemning Democrats for being obsessed with impeachment, and claiming that impeachment proceedings have already helped increase his popularity.

Pelosi cited the report that the president had asked the Ukrainian president to help investigate claims that Joe Biden had improperly used his office under the Obama administration to help his son. Trump has denied the claims and said he would release a transcript of the call to defuse the accusations.

""I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" said Pelosi during the media briefing. ""The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.""



Pelosi later told reporters that it was, ""really a sad day for our government, actually.""

Trump says he'll release the full transcript of his controversial phone call with Ukrainian president,"President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he will release the ""unredacted transcript"" of a phone call he had with the president of Ukraine in which, a whistleblower claims, Trump pressured the foreign leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter BIden.

What did Trump say?

""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country,"" Trump wrote in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon, ""but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine. You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""

What phone call?

An anonymous whistleblower from within the U.S. government reported that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden's dealings with a Ukrainian natural gas firm known as Burisma Holdings.

Joe Biden would also fall into the scope of this investigation, since he has admitted that while he was vice president he pressured the Ukrainian Parliament to remove a corrupt prosecutor who also happened to worry the oligarch who owned Burisma. The prosecutor was removed from office, and his replacement shelved the investigation into Burisma within a year.

Why does this phone conversation matter?

Democrats have cried foul at the possibility of Trump asking a foreign leader to investigate two U.S. citizens.

These accusations against Trump stemming from this whistleblower accusation have been enough to push congressional Democrats closer to impeachment. Shortly after Trump's tweet, Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that she thought that the House was ""ready"" to try impeaching Trump because now members of Congress ""have the facts.""

Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) announced that he was also endorsing impeachment, and the Democrats seem closer than ever before to having the simple majority they would need to move forward with that process.

Asked by The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg if her caucus would stand down if, when Trump releases his transcript, it turns out to be ""more benign"" than Democrats had expected, Pelosi seemed unfazed. ""No,"" she said. ""It's not about that. This is about the Constitution of the United States. And we have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offense under the Constitution of the United States. But this one is the most understandable by the public.""

According to the Wall Street Journal, Pelosi will announce at 5 p.m. ET that she plans to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.

Trump: White House will release second Ukraine transcript; Biden and Pelosi should testify before Congress,"President Donald Trump reiterated on Saturday that the congressional impeachment investigation into his dealings with the Ukraine is a ""witch hunt"" while calling for former Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be called as witnesses in the inquiry.

According to Fox News, the president told reporters ""The witch hunt continues, lot of witch hunt continues."" Trump added, ""The Republicans have never been so united and I think the people of our country have never been so united.""

Speaking at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the nation's 45th president indicated he will likely release a transcript of a second phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday. ""They want to have a transcript of the other call, the second call, and I'm willing to provide that,"" said the president. He continued, ""You'll read the second call, and you'll tell me if there's anything wrong with it.""

Trump later took to Twitter with additional recommendations for witnesses, saying ""Shifty Adam Schiff"" and others should be added to the list.

Democrats say they'll 'consider' GOP request



As reported by TheBlaze, House Republicans also revealed on Saturday they intend to call on Hunter Biden to testify before investigators, along with the whistleblower who filed the complaint about the call. However, it is unclear if Democrats will agree to the Republicans' proposed witnesses to testify. Fox also reported that pursuant to newly-approved rules governing the impeachment inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Democrats get to decide who testifies before the committee.

In response to the GOP's request, Schiff issued a statement saying the Intelligence Committee would evaluate the Republicans' preferred witnesses and ""give due consideration"" to those ""within the scope of the impeachment inquiry, as voted on by the House.""

Schiff added, ""This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President's effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm.""

Republicans respond

Meanwhile, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) noted in a statement that Trump should be able to cross-examine his accusers. ""Because President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify.""

Nunes, who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, added that ""given the multiple discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and the closed-door testimony of the witnesses, it is imperative that the American people hear definitively how the whistleblower developed his or her information, and who else the whistleblower may have fed the information he or she gathered and how that treatment of classified information may have led to the false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats during this process.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump_second_transcript_biden_pelosi,2019-11-10
"Dems impeached Trump for defying subpoenas, now Biden says he won't comply with one either","Former Vice President Joe Biden said in an interview on Friday that he would not comply with a subpoena if the Senate were to call him to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial.



""What are you going to cover?"" Biden responded to Des Moines Register Executive Editor Carol Hunter when she asked him if he would be willing to appear before Congress. ""You guys are going to cover for three weeks anything that I said. And (Trump's) going to get away. You guys buy into it all the time. Not a joke … Think what it's about. It's all about what he does all the time, his entire career. Take the focus off. This guy violated the Constitution. He said it in the driveway of the White House. He acknowledged he asked for help.""

Biden added that any attempt to subpoena him would be on ""specious"" grounds and that he does not believe the Senate will compel him to testify, according to the Register. The Democratic candidate also said that him appearing before the Senate would be part of a candidate to ""take the focus off"" of Trump.

Wasn't Trump just impeached for this?



Should Biden refuse to comply with a Senate subpoena, it would place Democrats in a politically awkward situation and undermine their impeachment case since the former vice president would be engaging in conduct that is similar to the activities detailed in one of the House's charges against Trump.

Democrats levied two articles of impeachment against President Trump:



The first charge declared that Trump abused his power by tying foreign aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country's president announcing an investigation into a company on which Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served on the board.

The second article of impeachment accused the president of ""Obstruction of Congress,"" which included directing the ""Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to comply with those subpoenas."" The Democrats said that by instructing others to defy a congressional subpoena, President Trump ""interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives.""

Democrats said defying a subpoena disqualified Trump from presidency

According to the House Democrats's charges, Trump's defiance of subpoenas merited his ""impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.""

House and Senate leaders are negotiating the terms of an impeachment trial. Biden has not been subpoenaed, but some of Trump's allies have suggested he should be.

Trump's legal team present '6 key facts' in impeachment case that exonerate Trump,"President Donald Trump's legal team began their defense Saturday, where they laid the groundwork to make the case that Trump is innocent of the impeachment charges.

During the brief session, Deputy counsel Mike Purpura explained the ""six key facts"" about the impeachment case that absolve Trump of wrongdoing.

1. The infamous Ukraine call transcript

""The transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything,"" Purpura explained. ""The paused security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call.""

2. Ukrainian officials deny being pressured

""[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky] and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything,"" Purpura said.

3. Ukraine did not know about paused aid

""President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know — did not even know — the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call,"" Purpura explained.

4. No witnesses say Trump tied aid to Biden investigation

""Not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations in security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else,"" Purpura said.

5. Security Assistance aid continued after phone call

""The security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25, without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations,"" Purpura explained.

6. President Trump has been a strong ally of Ukraine

""The Democrats' blind eye to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats' own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor,"" Purpura said. ""Those are the facts.""

"Tucker Carlson mocks AOC on-air, she responds by suggesting there's 'sexual harassment' in his office","On Friday, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson took to the airways to lampoon the upcoming book “Take Up Space: The Precedented AOC” written by New York Magazine’s editing team.

Tucker said, “Now, a hagiography of Sandy Cortez is like a box of Fig Newtons. You know it's wrong to open it, but the temptation is strong, and so we did. And before we knew it, we consumed the whole thing. We still feel sick. So that is what we're opening with tonight, the new Sandy Cortez book.

“Yes, it’s a lighter topic than tyranny in Canada or war in Ukraine,” Tucker continued, “We’ve got limited self-control of stuff like this. It’s an amazing book … It opens by comparing Ocasio-Cortez to Jesus and then it suggests that because she once got second place in a high school science competition, she could have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. It is a remarkable piece of journalism.”

The Fox News host continued by ridiculing the lavish praise heaped onto AOC by the book. He said, “Imagine if you were the person who wrote that. So here's this crazed solipsist filming herself as she puts together a coffee table and eats popcorn, the least-compelling film made since Andy Warhol died, and this is what you call it, ""She's shone a bright light on her own complicated, multifaceted self."" That's the moment you have to be honest with yourself and say, ""It's time for me to retire."" By the way, the person who wrote this didn't even perceive how creepy it was.”

Responding to the book’s claim that AOC is “the first politician in history to live fully out loud while female, and the degradations of womanhood are personal to her” and the congresswoman’s claim that “as a woman of color, it’s so hard to be taken seriously,” Tucker said, “There is no place on Earth, outside of American colleges and newsrooms, where Sandy Cortez would be recognized as a ‘woman of color,’ because she’s not. She’s a rich, entitled white lady.”

The congresswoman responded to Tucker’s ridiculing via Twitter.

In early January, after facing charges of hypocrisy for being seen not wearing a mask while vacationing in Florida, AOC suggested that underlying reason people were mad at her was because they wanted to be romantically involved with her.

After Tucker mocked her on-air she suggested that Tucker’s ridicule was akin to sexual harassment. The congresswoman said, “If you’re this easy [with] sexual harassment on air, how are you treating your staff?”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tucker-carlson-mocks-aoc-on-air-she-responds-by-suggesting-there-s-sexual-harassment-in-his-office,2022-02-19
Tulsi Gabbard slams Kamala Harris for marijuana hypocrisy in Brittney Griner arrest,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard blasted Vice President Kamala Harris regarding her ""hypocrisy"" of vehemently defending Brittney Griner but not standing up for Americans locked up at home for marijuana violations – including those who were prosecuted by the former California attorney general.

On Thursday, Vice President Harris condemned Russia for sentencing Griner to nine years in prison for possessing a cannabis vape pen at an airport near Moscow earlier this year.

""With today’s sentencing, Russia continues its wrongful detention of Brittney Griner. She should be released immediately,"" Harris wrote on Twitter. ""@POTUS and I, and our entire Administration, are working every day to reunite Brittney, as well as Paul Whelan, with loved ones who miss each of them dearly.""



Gabbard told Fox News host Will Cain, ""Another note of hypocrisy coming from Kamala Harris and this administration, as you mentioned during her illustrious record as attorney general in California…she kept prisoners in prison longer than their sentences to use them as free slave labor yet at the same time these very same people are condemning other countries for doing the exact same thing. It doesn't make any sense.""

""My question for her and the Biden administration – where is your outrage for your fellow Americans who are sitting in prison today here in the United States of America because of minor marijuana violations,"" Gabbard declared. ""How come you are not fighting as hard for them to be returned home and reunited with their families as you are for Brittney Griner.""

""To me, the message to the American people through [the administration's] actions is loud and clear, is that if you are rich and powerful or famous, then you will get special treatment from this administration,"" Gabbard proclaimed. ""If you are not. We don't care about you, and we're going to let you sit there and rot in jail.""



""Unfortunately, like too many politicians, it seems that she puts her finger to the wind and decides the things she's supposed to be angry about on any given day and if it becomes politically inconvenient or damaging then she'll switch the other way,"" Gabbard said about Harris flip-flopping her opinion of drug enforcement.

Gabbard stressed that she didn't think that any person should be imprisoned for marijuana offenses.

Harris oversaw thousands of arrests for marijuana as a district attorney and attorney general.

The San Jose Mercury News reported in 2019 that when Harris oversaw more than 1,900 marijuana convictions – including a few dozen who were put in prison – when she was San Francisco's top prosecutor between 2004-2010.

In 2011, there were 1,970 Americans locked up for marijuana violations when Harris was California's attorney general, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

Harris staunchly opposed the legalization of marijuana in California when she was a district attorney and when she was the state's attorney general.

In a radio interview in February 2019, Harris said she smoked marijuana while listening to music by rappers Tupac and Snoop Dogg. However, Tupac didn't release an album until 1991 and Snoop Dogg's first album was released in 1993. However, Harris was a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, starting in 1990.

This is not the first time that Gabbard has criticized Harris.

Gabbard effectively destroyed Kamala's 2020 presidential aspirations during a Democratic primary debate in August 2019. Gabbard bashed Kamala for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California.

Now, Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations, and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California, and she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.

Tulsi Gabbard goes scorched-earth on Kamala Harris over Ukraine-Russia performance: 'Grade-school understanding',"Democrat Tulsi Gabbard said Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris' recent performance on the world stage proved she lacks the foreign policy prowess necessary for top American leaders.

What is the background?

While President Joe Biden remained stateside, the Biden administration dispatched Harris to Germany last week to meet with top European leaders and hopefully decrease the chances of war between Russia and Ukraine.

The trip ended with an embarrassing press conference in which Harris made contradicting claims. On one hand, Harris claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""made his decision"" to invade Ukraine. On the other hand, Harris claimed the U.S. was prepared to impose crippling economic sanctions that Harris promised would ""absolutely"" deter Putin from invading Ukraine.

What did Gabbard say?

Speaking on Fox News, Gabbard called Harris' performance ""embarrassing"" and charged that the vice president was dispatched as a ""purely political calculation,"" presumably to beef up Harris' foreign policy résumé.

""My gosh, this is embarrassing. It’s hard to keep track of all of those jumbles of words. It’s clear she was sent there to be the voice of the United States as a purely political calculation,"" Gabbard said. ""She has no foreign policy background, she has no foreign policy understanding. She has no concept of the cost of war, nor does she have the temperament necessary to be the voice of the United States on the global stage. It’s embarrassing to see this play out.""

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, added that Harris' threats of deterrent sanctions defied the laws of ""grade-school understanding.""

""She talked about deterrence and sanctions. How do you deter someone by punishing them before they do it? It’s very simple. This is kind of like grade-school understanding,"" Gabbard said. ""If you say, 'I’m going to punish you before you do something,' wouldn’t a kid say, 'Fine, I might as well go ahead and do it anyway.' This is not rocket science.""

Gabbard later explained the American people ""will be left holding the bag"" for the Biden administration's response to Ukraine-Russia conflict, meaning they will pay the price incurred by U.S. involvement.

Tulsi Gabbard supports impeachment inquiry days after saying there wasn't a 'compelling' case,"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) spent most of this week dismissing the Democratic Party's efforts to impeach President Donald Trump as being unnecessarily divisive, saying that there wasn't a ""compelling"" case for impeachment.

Friday, however, the presidential candidate changed her mind, saying in a press release that it is ""necessary"" for her to publicly support an impeachment inquiry into the allegation that President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son by threatening to withhold aid money.

Here's a recap of Gabbard's ... evolution ... on this issue:

Tulsi Gabbard during a Tuesday interview on Fox News: ""I've been consistent in saying I believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided.""

Tulsi Gabbard during a Wednesday interview on Hill.TV's ""Rising"": ""Most people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president that won an election in 2016.""

Tulsi Gabbard in a Friday statement: ""However, after carefully looking at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine's president, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump's comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.""



Gabbard had been the only Democratic candidate speaking out in opposition to an impeachment inquiry, and now becomes one of a growing group of Democratic representatives supporting impeachment.

While exact counts are unclear, and will depend on the specifics of proposed articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) support of impeachment after months of resistance has brought her caucus to the cusp of having enough votes to get a majority.

Twisted Sister's Dee Snider supports Ukraine using 'We're Not Gonna Take It' as battle cry against Russian invasion,"Dee Snider — the outlandish and outspoken frontman for '80s metal band Twisted Sister — tweeted over the weekend that he's all in favor of Ukraine adopting the band's famous anthem ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" as its battle cry amid Russia's invasion.

""I absolutely approve of Ukrainians using 'We're Not Gonna Take It' as their battlecry,"" Snider tweeted Saturday. ""My grandfather was Ukrainian, before it was swallowed up by the USSR after WW2. This can't happen to these people again!""

Snider added a ""F***RUSSIA"" hashtag to the end of his missive.

However, when it comes to folks in the anti-mask movement wanting to use ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" as their own rallying cry, Snider has no love for their cause. Indeed, on Sunday he added the following explanation to his Twitter page:

He explained that ""one use is for a righteous battle against oppression; the other is [an] infantile feet stomping against an inconvenience.""

It's not like Snider can prevent ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" from blasting through loudspeakers at any given event, so his disagreement has no actual teeth. Rolling Stone said that earlier this month, the song was used at an anti-vaccination protest in New Zealand, and Snider responded by saying “while I may not agree with some of the things it’s used to fight, I can’t pick & choose the ones I want.”

The magazine added that when a similar protest was held in New York, Snider said he's ""aware many people representing many causes use ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ as their battle cry. Some I agree with & some I don’t (anti-vaxxers for example) BUT the song was designed for the listener to 'fill in the blank' (what from whom?) with their own cause.”

Anything else?

According to the New York Post, Snider has been openly anti-Russia since the days of the Cold War and commented on a photo of him wearing a “Russia Sucks” button onstage back in the late 1970s.

“My Ukrainian grandpa would have been so proud!” Snider tweeted Sunday.

Image source: Twitter, redacted

But when a Twitter user posited that Russian citizens didn't have a choice in the war that President Vladimir Putin started, Snider fired back:

Then when a user told Snider she's a young Russian woman protesting against the war and getting arrested for it, Snider agreed to stop using the ""F***RUSSIA"" hashtag in favor of a ""F***PUTIN"" one.

“And change will come from the young and young at heart,"" he added to the twee. ""It’s never easy.""

(Updated) New York Post account locked as Twitter completely censors Hunter Biden story; users can't even send it in DMs,"*Update*

New York Post business reporter Noah Manskar says that the Post's primary Twitter account has been locked after publication of a bombshell report on Hunter Biden.



According to Manskar, Twitter said the account was locked ""because of the lack of authoritative reporting on where the materials in our Biden story originated.""

Original Story:



After Facebook limited the distribution of the New York Post's bombshell Hunter Biden story, Twitter users are reporting an inability to share the story on the platform.

As the video from the Daily Caller's White House Correspondent Anders Hagstrom shows, an error message appears when users attempt to share the story, which Twitter has labeled as ""potentially harmful.""



New York Magazine contributor Yashar Ali reported the censorship, along with a statement from Twitter explaining why it is blocking the spread of the New York Post's article.

""Given the lack of authoritative reporting on the origins of the materials included in the article, we're taking action to limit the spread of this information,"" Twitter said in a statement shared by Ali.

""As our Hacked Material Policy states, 'we don't permit the use of our services to directly distribute content obtained through hacking that contains private information, may put people in physical harm or danger, or contains trade secrets,"" Twitter said.



On Wednesday, the New York Post published what the paper says is email correspondence between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, appearing to show Pozharskyi thanking the younger Biden for setting up a meeting with his father, who was then serving as vice president. The email, if true, would contradict claims from Biden that he's never spoken with his son about his overseas business dealings.

According to the Post, the email was contained in a ""massive trove of data recovered from a laptop computer."" The computer was dropped off at a repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware in April 2019 and the owner of the shop told the Post it was never retrieved by its owner.

Nothing in the Post's story suggests the email or other material recovered from the laptop was ""hacked.""

Several commentators and even some lawmakers expressed shock and outrage at the steps Twitter and Facebook have taken to suppress the Post's story.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a crusader against powerful social media companies, accused Facebook and Twitter of censorship and remarked, ""you almost get the idea #bigtech wants to buy this election.""



In several tweets, Hawley criticized Twitter and Facebook for suppressing the story.

Hawley also sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey with a list of questions about how Twitter made the decision to block the Post story and whether Twitter communicated with the Biden-Harris presidential campaign before suppressing the story.



Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also sent a letter to Dorsey ""regarding Twitter's censorship of the New York Post.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) threatened Facebook and Twitter with legislation to regulate the social media platforms as publishers.







House Judiciary Committee Republicans tweeted the story and asked other users to share it because ""The mainstream media doesn't want you to share this article.""

New York Post opinion writer Sohrab Ahmari called Twitter's actions ""a digital civil war.""

Writer Mark Hemingway said the actions by Twitter verge into ""'enemy of the people' territory,"" referencing President Donald Trump's frequent claim that the mainstream media and social media's bias makes them the enemy of the people.

The Dispatch's David French noted that Twitter and Facebook never censored information reported from the infamous Steele Dossier, despite many of the claims made about President Donald Trump having been false.



The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway pointed out that Twitter took no steps to limit the distribution of the New York Times' story on President Trump's taxes.

And Lee Fang, a reporter for the Intercept, also noted the discrepancy in Twitter's enforcement of this policy.

Twitter debuts new 'crisis misinformation policy',"Twitter rolled out a new global ""crisis misinformation policy"" on Thursday that the company says will combat misinformation during emergencies and other crisis situations.

In a blog post, Twitter said it will censor posts that spread misinformation by placing a warning notice in front of tweets from high profile accounts that violate the policy. The company aims to slow the spread of ""the most visible, misleading content, particularly that which could lead to severe harms.""

Judgements on which content is true or false will be made with ""verification from multiple credible, publicly available sources,"" including journalists, non-governmental watchdog groups, and other conflict monitoring groups.

Once Twitter determines that a claim is misleading, it will stop promoting that content in the Home timeline, Search, and Explore features. Examples of content that could be suppressed include false reporting of a major conflict, false allegations related to the use of weapons or war crimes, or false information relating to how the international community responds.

There will be an exception to this policy for commentary, fact-checkers, and people sharing personal accounts of their experience.



""Content moderation is more than just leaving up or taking down content, and we’ve expanded the range of actions we may take to ensure they’re proportionate to the severity of the potential harm,"" wrote Yoel Roth, the company's head of safety and integrity.



A tweet with content that violates the crisis misinformation policy may be placed behind a warning label that reads: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules on sharing false or misleading info that might bring harm to crisis-affected populations. However, to preserve this content for accountability purposes, Twitter has determined this Tweet should remain available.""



""We’ve found that not amplifying or recommending certain content, adding context through labels, and in severe cases, disabling engagement with the Tweets, are effective ways to mitigate harm, while still preserving speech and records of critical global events,"" Roth wrote.

These new standards will be specifically enforced during ""emergent global crises,"" with the first iteration of this policy being activated for the ongoing war in Ukraine. Twitter said it will rely on the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee's emergency response framework and other global humanitarian frameworks to determine when a major crisis is occurring.

The new policy comes as billionaire Elon Musk is attempting to acquire Twitter in a $44 billion deal. Musk, a free speech advocate, has criticized the company's content moderation policies. His deal to buy Twitter has been put on hold pending an investigation of how many fake or spam accounts are on the platform.

Twitter defends censoring Trump's tweets while not blocking Khamenei's posts calling for genocide,"During a Wednesday hearing on anti-Semitism, a Twitter representative defended the social media company's decision not to block tweets from Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calling for genocide, but at the same time flagging tweets from President Donald Trump.

A Twitter spokesperson attempted to justify censoring President Trump, but also putting no restrictions on the tweets written by Khamenei. Ylwa Pettersson, Twitter's head of Public Policy and Philanthropy for the Nordics and Israel, spoke about online anti-Semitism with Israel's Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption, and Diaspora Affairs.

Arsen Ostrovsky, international human-rights lawyer and executive director of the Israeli-Jewish Congress, asked Pettersson why several of President Trump's tweets have been flagged, but there haven't been any consequences for the Iranian leader for his tweets promoting violence.

""We have an approach toward leaders that says that direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on military-economic issues are generally not in violation of our rules,"" Pettersson responded.



Knesset member Michal Cotler-Wunsh then asked Pettersson, ""So, calling for genocide is okay, but commenting on politics is not?""

Pettersson replied, ""If a world leader violates our rules, but if there is a clear interest in keeping that on the service, we may place it behind a notice that provides some more context about the violation and allows people to click if they wish to see that type of content.""

""That is what happened for the Trump tweet,"" Pettersson continued. ""That tweet was violating our policies regarding the glorification of violence, based on the historical context of the last line of that tweet, and the risk that it could possibly inspire harm and similar actions.""



""And, as it was in the interest of the public to keep that on the platform, we decided to keep it up, place it behind a notice … to limit the interaction with it, but because it is of importance to have it remain so that the citizens can see what their political figures are commenting and hold them accountable for what they're saying online,"" Pettersson concluded.

""I think that what's come up again and again through different examples is actually a sense of double standards, and I would implore Twitter and other online platforms to ensure … that there is no double standard in the application,"" Cotler-Wunsh retorted.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley reacted by saying: ""What does this say when @Twitter censors @realDonaldTrump more than the Ayatollah? Social media needs to give conservatives the same rights as they give terrorist leaders.""

Former Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell shared a video of the interaction on Twitter.

Khamenei has used his Twitter account to push holocaust denial theories, call for the ""elimination"" of Israel, and ask for support and assistance to ""any nation or any group anywhere who opposes and fights the Zionist regime.""















In May, Twitter flagged President Trump's tweet for ""glorifying violence"" for a tweet that read: ""...These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let it happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!""

U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai questioned Twitter about controversial tweets from the Supreme Leader of Iran in response to Trump's tweet being censored. Pai asked the social media company: ""Do these tweets from Supreme Leader of Iran @khamenei_ir violate 'Twitter Rules about glorifying violence'?""

Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs Orit Farkash-Hacohen wrote a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in May that called for the social media company to remove anti-Israel tweets written by Khamenei.

""Twitter's own Hateful Conduct Policy clearly stipulates that a user 'may not promote violence against, or directly attack, or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin or religious affiliation… or calls for mass murder,'"" Farkash-Hacohen wrote to Dorsey. ""However, the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is unremittingly abusing your platform by doing just that — without any enforcement or repercussions.""

Twitter's Vice President of Public Policy Sinéad McSweeney responded by saying that Khamenei's tweets did not violate the platform's terms of service.

""World leaders use Twitter to engage in discourse with each other, as well as their constituents,"" McSweeney wrote in the June 15 letter, according to the New York Post. ""Presently, our policies with regards to world leaders state that direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on current affairs, or strident statements of foreign policy on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.""

""Our assessment is that tweets you have cited are not in violation of our policies at this time, and they fall into the category of foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues of our approach to world leaders,"" McSweeney explained.

In June, Twitter blocked a Trump tweet that said: ""There will never be an 'Autonomous Zone' in Washington, D.C., as long as I'm your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!""

""We've placed a public policy interest notice on this Tweet for violating our policy against abusive behavior, specifically, the presence of a threat of harm against an identifiable group,"" Twitter stated.

Earlier this week, Twitter suspended Donald Trump Jr.'s account for sharing the viral video of frontline doctors claiming hydroxychloroquine could be used to treat COVID-19.

Twitter has also removed Trump tweets over copyright complaints. Earlier this month, the social media platform deleted a Trump campaign ad that used a Linkin Park song.

Last October, Twitter deleted a video posted by Trump poking fun at Joe Biden's son Hunter for his relationship with a Ukrainian gas executive. The video was removed because it used the music and video from Nickelback's song ""Photograph.""

On June 30, Twitter removed a meme that Trump posted because The New York Times filed a copyright complaint.

Twitter has a field day with 'cringe' videos of Biden's new disinformation czar singing Mary Poppins parody song and her 'Harry Potter' tribute band: 'This is enough of a reason to ban TikTok',"Nina Jankowicz was named as the Biden administration's executive director of the Department of Homeland Security's new Disinformation Governance Board on Thursday. Jankowicz was immediately thrust into the spotlight after being named as the head of the government agency that will reportedly ""coordinate countering misinformation related to homeland security, focused specifically on irregular migration and Russia.""

Commentators took notice that the Disinformation Governance Board czar previously dismissed Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop – which has been authenticated by numerous media outlets – as a ""Trump campaign product.""

A TikTok video of Jankowicz singing was broadcast on Thursday's episode of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" The video features Jankowicz singing about ""information laundering"" set to a musical parody of the ""Mary Poppins"" song “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”

According to Mediaite, Jankowicz sings the lyrics:

Information laundering is really quite ferocious. It’s when a huckster takes some lies and makes them sound precocious.

By saying them in Congress or a mainstream outlet, so disinformation’s origins are slightly less atrocious.

It’s how you hide a little, hide a little, little, little lie, it’s how you hide a little, little lie, it’s how you hide a little, little, little lie.

When Rudy Giuliani shared bad intel from Ukraine. Or when TikTok influencers say COVID can’t cause pain.

They’re laundering disinfo and we really should take note. And not support their lies with our wallet, voice or vote – oh!

In February 2021, Jankowicz shared her singing performance on Twitter with the caption: ""You can just call me the Mary Poppins of disinformation.""

Twitter reactions to the musical number by the new head of the Disinformation Governance Board included shock and cringe.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): ""This is who the government is trying to put in charge of regulating YOUR speech.""

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.): ""Behold, America’s new speech czar.""

BlazeTV host Steve Deace of ""The Steve Deace Show"": ""She’s perfect! She is the incarnate Spirit of the Age who also embodies the affluent woke white women that are the Democrats’ main base now.""

RealClearPolitics president Tom Bevan: ""Wait, this is real? I thought it was a joke or a deep fake or something.""

Columnist Joe Concha: ""This can’t be real. But it is.""



Lawyer Harmeet K. Dhillon: ""I’m telling you, lockdowns really messed with people’s mental health!""

Outkick founder Clay Travis: ""This is the new Biden administration head of Ministry of Truth, Nina Jankowicz. She is in charge of what’s truth and fiction in America. Every time you think the Biden administration can’t get more ridiculous, they do.""

Conservative commentator Katie Pavlich: ""Why is the director of the Biden Ministry of Truth using a Chinese spy app?""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw: ""I mean, she wrote a whole book based on the premise that you can be a CIA agent and also ~marginalized~ at the same time so she’s the perfect censor kween for the Biden regime.""

Author Steven Phillips, MD: ""So this is the truth czar? I thought this was a joke at first--Imo, the poor judgment, smugness, & overconfidence it takes to make a video like this is no joke. And I think it's even more egregious due to her documented history of spreading lies. How did we get here?""

Editor Curtis Houck: ""Rich, white, liberal women are indeed the worst and catering to them is destroying our country.""

Author Matt Stoller: ""Honestly this is enough of a reason to ban TikTok.""

Former Arizona Senator Kelli Ward: ""A spoonful of sugar cannot make THIS medicine go down.""

Editor Brandon Morse: ""I've made some pretty cringe stuff in my time but damn.""

Former NYPD detective Rob O'Donnell: ""They had Baghdad Bob, we have Nanny State Nina. The Ministry of Truth is unconstitutional, period. Every entity has a Press Secretary or PIO to relay their point of view, this is an abuse of a Law Enforcement Agency.""

Author Ajit Datta: ""Who would have thought the collapse of the world's greatest empire would be so funny.""

Talk show host Mark Davis: ""God help us.""

Apparently, this is not Jankowicz's first foray into music.

According to a ""Harry Potter"" fan website, Jankowicz and another young woman launched a ""wizard rock band"" named ""The Moaning Myrtles"" based on the ""Harry Potter"" books in 2005. The band reportedly released two albums by 2008.

""The band's name is a take-off of Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who was killed by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk and now haunts the first-floor girls' lavatory,"" according to the Harry Potter Wiki site.

I advocate for human rights

Remotely taking on each threat

So call your reps and join the fight



When people tried to silence me

I stood my ground and I resisted

Because we need equality

And nevertheless, I persisted



Wuh oh wuh oh I've got a reputation

Wuh oh and yeah it's cause for celebration

So I'm standing up for the next generation

You can call me Myrtle Elizabeth Warren

Twitter is reportedly suspending users who share alleged Ukraine whistleblower's name on social media platform,"Twitter is reportedly suspending some users who mention the alleged Ukraine whistleblower's name in posts.

What are the details?

Several social media users have shared snapshots of their suspensions from Twitter, which cite inappropriate behaviors such as tweeting a person's private information.

In this case, the alleged whistleblower's name.

One social media user wrote, ""Twitter is now Suspending users for posting the alleged Whistleblower's name. The name has been mentioned: in media ... in the Mueller Report (Vol. II, Pg. 71, Footnote 468) .. in the transcript of Amb. Taylor's Testimony (Pg. 236). What's going on?""

Another user shared a screenshot of her suspension notice.

The notice read, ""You may not publish or post other people's private information without their express authorization and permission.""

The user's original tweet simply read, ""Naming the whistlechump,"" and featured the whistleblower's name and the hashtag #WhatTriggersLiberals.

A third user wrote, ""I'm back after being suspended by Twitter for tweeting the name of the fake whistleblower. Twitter joins Democrats and their media puppets gaslighting America that whistleblowers are guaranteed anonymity. That's not how it works. He must TESTIFY IN PUBLIC.""

Twitter is now labeling and lessening the visibility of tweets hyperlinked to Russian state-owned media,"Micro-blogging platform Twitter will label and lessen the visibility of tweets hyperlinked to Russian state-owned media in an attempt to tamp down propaganda from the country.

CNN tech reporter Brian Fung posted an example of the label that would be added to tweets that are hyperlinked to certain sites like Russia Today and Sputnik.

Twitter users are able to bring articles to the attention of their followers, but the social media site can tweak its algorithm to lessen the spread of those tweets when it deems it necessary.

The company said that the ""overwhelming majority"" of tweets containing the state-sponsored content was shared by individuals and not by the accounts run by those outlets. About 45,000 tweets were sent per day by these individual accounts, according to the company.

Facebook and Google recently blocked Russian state-owned media from appearing in Ukraine at the behest of that country's government. The two platforms also barred the state-owned organizations from monetization and profiting from advertisements anywhere in the world.

Russia called these efforts censorship and threatened to throttle Facebook in their country while Twitter has already reported disruptions in its access.

Many of the heroic Ukrainian efforts to resist the Russian invaders have gone viral on social media and inspired admiration from onlookers around the world. On the other side of the coin, Russia has been caught trying to use social media in order to spread misinformation about its invasion of Ukraine.

Tech expert Ritesh Kotak told CTV News that Russia had passed laws in order make social media companies more vulnerable to state censorship.

""The thing about disinformation is it's so easy to put up and propagate now because of the internet and just how connected we are,"" said Kotak.

Twitter removed Trump campaign ad for Linkin Park copyright,"Twitter removed a Trump campaign ad on Saturday because the political advertisement used a Linkin Park song, and the alternative rock band objected to having their music used by President Donald Trump. Linkin Park filed a copyright complaint because Trump's ad had their 2002 song ""In the End"" as the soundtrack of the video.

""Per our copyright policy, we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by copyright owner or their authorized representative,"" a Twitter spokesperson told The Verge on Sunday.



""Linkin Park did not and does not endorse Trump, nor authorize his organization to use any of our music,"" the official Twitter account for Linkin Park wrote on Saturday night. ""A cease and desist has been issued.""

The political ad features images of President Trump and excerpts from his inauguration speech set to a cover song version of Linkin Park's ""In the End"" performed by Tommee Profitt and featuring Fleurie and Jung Youth that was released this year.

On Friday night, White House deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino shared the video on Twitter. President Trump retweeted the video on Saturday. The video has been replaced with a message that says: ""This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.""

Twitter received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice from Machine Shop Entertainment, the management company owned by Linkin Park. The July 18 filing was posted on the Lumen Database, a nonprofit transparency initiative that collects requests for the removal of online materials.

Linkin Park's late lead singer, Chester Bennington, was staunchly against President Trump before his death on July 20, 2017. Months before Bennington's death, he tweeted: ""I repeat….. Trump is a greater threat to the USA than terrorism!! We have to take back our voices and stand for what we believe in.""

Several music artists have instructed the Trump campaign to stop using their songs during campaign events and rallies, including the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Panic! at the Disco, Pharrell Williams, R.E.M., Aerosmith, Adele, the Village People, and Tom Petty's family.

Last October, Twitter removed a video posted by Trump attacking Joe Biden's son Hunter's relationship with a Ukrainian gas executive. That video was deleted because it used the music and video for Nickelback's song ""Photograph.""

UK spies told to use gender-neutral words and pronouns,"As Europe watched the largest conventional military attack enacted in Ukraine since World War II, Great Britain is reportedly making sure that U.K. spies recognize their privilege and are encouraging them to use the proper pronouns.

The Daily Mail published leaked documents that British intelligence agencies are promoting inclusive language while doing away with verbiage that may ""reinforce dominant cultural patterns.""

The alleged toolkit is titled ""Mission Critical,"" and is intended for MI5 (the U.K's domestic intelligence agency), MI6 (the U.K.'s foreign intelligence agency known as the Secret Intelligence Service and SIS), and the Government Communications Headquarters (the U.K.'s intelligence, security, and cyber agency known as GCHQ).

The guidance for England's spies was reportedly approved by Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the U.K.'s national security adviser, who wrote, ""This toolkit is called 'Mission Critical' because a diverse and inclusive culture is critical to succeeding in our national security missions.""

The document, which was reportedly published internally on Dec. 6, urges Britain's spies to declare their pronouns and to add them to email signatures.

""Sharing your pronouns, if you are comfortable doing this, helps to create an environment in which this is normal,"" the document allegedly states.

In a section regarding inclusive language, the toolkit notes, ""In national security, look out for words and phrases, such as 'strong' or 'grip,' that reinforce the dominant cultural patterns.""

""Avoid jargon, hierarchy or gender biases,"" the internal document states, and recommends refraining from using the word ""manpower.""



""Use gender-neutral language to reflect people's diversity and reduce stereotypes and assumptions, for example about job roles and functions which need not be gender-defined,"" the document states.

""The toolkit says staff should 'understand your unconscious bias,' 'be aware of intersectionality [the idea that different forms of prejudice can overlap],' 'acknowledge your privilege,' and consider refusing to speak on all-male panels,"" the guidance says, according to the Daily Mail.

The toolkit purportedly encourages intelligence officers to read a list of books regarding equity, including those by leading critical race theory advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw.

Last April, the transgender flag was flown at the MI6 headquarters in London to mark the Transgender Day of Visibility.

Richard Moore — the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service — declared, ""We’re proud of our trans and non-binary colleagues and committed to providing an inclusive workplace where you can be your true self.

Docs reportedly show Ukraine aid was formally frozen on same day as Trump-Zelensky July phone call,"Documents obtained by the House Budget Committee related to the holdup of foreign aid to Ukraine earlier this year shows that the White House's budget office formally took actions to freeze the aid on the same day as President Donald Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, CNN reported Tuesday.

Citing a committee summary of White House documents, the story said — while a hold on the aid had been announced to national security officials a full week prior to the call — that the Office of Management and Budget's first official action to temporarily halt aid came on the evening of July 25, hours after the two world leaders spoke on the phone.

The withholding letter — which was among documents handed over to Congress — was signed by a career OMB official. The funding was eventually released Sept. 11.

Trump's motives for holding up the foreign aid are central to the current impeachment investigation going on in Congress. The president and his allies have claimed that the aid was temporarily withheld in order to ensure that the country's recently elected government was serious about tackling the country's long history of corruption. His opponents have characterized the hold as an effort to pressure a foreign government to announce or conduct investigations that would politically benefit the president in the 2020 presidential election.

Regarding the OMB documents, House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) and Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) criticized what they called ""a pattern of abuse"" from the office.



""Although the committees only received a partial production of the requested materials, OMB's responses and documentation to date confirm that the apportionment process has been misused to withhold Congressionally enacted appropriations,"" the two Democrats said, according to a Politico story Tuesday.

In a statement to Blaze Media, an OMB spokesperson said that ""this is the same old spin from Democrats"" and that the office ""has and will continue to use its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President's priorities and with the law.""

The spokesperson added, ""Given Congress' constant penchant to tell agencies they are not allowed to spend appropriated money and hold money for months on end, in scores of examples, we find it laughable that Congress is taking issue with the [administration's] actions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-aid-frozen-same-day-trump-zelensky-call,2019-11-26
Ukraine and Russia are both using Chinese commercial drones for psychological warfare and spying,"We've officially entered the age of drone wars.

The Ukraine-Russia war started with the mobilization of Russian tanks, but now more than ever, the two countries are fighting, spying, and engaging in psychological warfare with the use of both military drones and commercial/residential ones, according to a new report by the Washington Post.

With massive amounts of money being sent to eastern Europe, Republicans have been asking for details regarding the weapons being provided, but the use of handheld drones was likely not on anyone's mind or at the very least has been severely underreported.



Currently, there are ""hundreds of reconnaissance and attack drones flying over Ukraine each day"" — all varying in type and size — in what appears to be an obvious result of, and solution to, attrition. Drones are being used in all integral militaristic phases on both sides, with radar jamming and air defense being carried out by large fleets.

Russia is reportedly using it's own six-foot drones, along with Iranian drones that are nearly twice the size. Ukraine is being provided the American Switchblade 300 ""suicide drone"" alongside its use of the gigantic Bayraktar TB2, a Turkish drone with a 12-meter wingspan.

However, both sides are using what's called the Mavic 3 drone — a small, easily obtainable product for home or commercial use that can be bought off the manufacturer's website or Amazon. It's use was recently called a ""true symbol of modern warfare"" by a retired Russian general earlier this year.

They are so widely prevalent that Ukrainian soldiers say they often ""don’t know if the drone they spot is friend or foe.""

The Chinese-made drone typically used for aerial photography or video has a vastly different purpose in this armed conflict than those of its larger cousins. Among its uses include dropping explosives fashioned out of recycled soda bottles, a strategy Ukrainian special forces claim they used in November 2022.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine, the aerial units are explicitly used as a method of psychological warfare by dropping small munitions on Russian bases.

Ukraine is publicly collecting funds to buy up swaths of drones around the world to add to its fleet. A charity run by a Ukrainian TV star openly boasts on its website about the number of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles it has provided the military:

""Drones, the eyes in the sky Strengthened Ukrainian army with 2984+ Drones,"" it reads.

Also mentioned are the captured/damaged enemy vehicles that have been repurposed:

""Repaired 2 T-72 tanks, 2 BMP-3, 1 APC, and BREM for the needs of Ukrainian defenders.""

The pursuit for even more drones is apparently endless; Ukraine's United24, the official crowd-funding arm of the country, has an initiative called the ""Army of Drones"" which seeks to by around 1,000 UAVs. Its fundraising achievements are posted proudly on the website.

""Total collected: $237,850,771 ... Current Balance: $36,724,286.""

The goal, according to the report, is 10,000 drones all across the front lines to broadcast the war ""without interruption.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-and-russia-drone-warfare,2022-12-02
"State Department orders family members of US diplomats to evacuate Ukraine. Biden reportedly considers deploying thousands of troops, warships, and aircraft into Eastern Europe to deter Russia.","The situation in Ukraine is quickly developing. The latest updates regarding the potential hot spot for hostilities, include the U.S. State Department ordering family members of U.S. diplomats to evacuate the country, and a report that President Joe Biden is considering deploying thousands of American troops, warships, and aircraft into the powderkeg region to deter Russia from executing any advancements.

A senior State Department official told reporters Sunday night, ""Military action by Russia could come at any time. The United States government will not be in a position to evacuate U.S. citizens in such a contingency.""

Also on Sunday, the U.S. Department of State issued an update on its official website.

""Do not travel to Ukraine due to the increased threats of Russian military action and COVID-19,"" the alert warned. ""Exercise increased caution in Ukraine due to crime and civil unrest. Some areas have increased risk.""

""On January 23, 2022, the Department of State authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. direct hire employees (USDH) and ordered the departure of eligible family members (EFM) from Embassy Kyiv due to the continued threat of Russian military action,"" the notice cautioned. ""U.S. citizens in Ukraine should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options.""

The State Department's warning emphasized, ""There are reports Russia is planning significant military action against Ukraine. The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, and in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. Demonstrations, which have turned violent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine, including in Kyiv.""

Another report that surfaced on Sunday night added more concern for the region, especially for U.S. military members. The New York Times reported that President Biden is ""considering deploying several thousand U.S. troops, as well as warships and aircraft, to NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, an expansion of American military involvement amid mounting fears of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, according to administration officials.""

The potential escalation of U.S. forces in the region was reportedly discussed by senior Pentagon officials and Biden at presidential retreat Camp David on Saturday.

""Senior Pentagon officials presented Mr. Biden with several options that would shift American military assets much closer to Mr. Putin’s doorstep, the administration officials said,"" the NYT reported. ""The options include sending 1,000 to 5,000 troops to Eastern European countries, with the potential to increase that number tenfold if things deteriorate.""



According to the report, Biden is expected to make a decision ""as early as this week"" on whether he will send military troops and hardware to the region as a deterent.

This is a far different message than Biden's press conference last week, where he was much more leniant with Vladimir Putin, ""I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades, and it depends on what it does, it's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.""

A day after his press conference, President Biden attempted to walk back his comments about Ukraine.

""Let me start by first saying a few words about Russia and Ukraine,” Biden said on Thursday. “I’ve been absolutely clear with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.""

“It will be met with [a] severe and coordinated economic response that I’ve discussed in detail with our allies as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin,” Biden continued. “But there is no doubt — let there be no doubt at all — that if Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-biden-russia-military,2022-01-24
Congress poised to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine,"As Americans struggle under the heavy financial burden caused by soaring inflation, Congress could soon approve around $12 billion in additional aid pertaining to embattled nation of Ukraine.

The Associated Press, citing an unidentified individual familiar with the measure, reported that more than $12 billion in aid pertaining to Ukraine will be inserted into the stopgap spending legislation that would fund the U.S. government into the month of December.

The Biden administration's request for the spending measure included $11.7 billion for security and economic assistance related to Ukraine, according to the AP. The outlet reported that in order to avert a partial government shutdown both houses of Congress would need to approve legislation by the the end of Friday, which marks the conclusion of the fiscal year.

Reuters, citing unidentified sources, reported that congressional negotiators had agreed to insert almost $12 billion of fresh military and economic aid for the nation of Ukraine into the measure. The outlet said that Biden had requested that the legislature supply $11.7 billion in new aid for Ukraine in the bill.

Ukraine has been seeking to defend itself against a brutal Russian invasion.

But Americans have been facing the devastating financial consequences caused by sky-high inflation. According consumer price index data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller figure than the 8.5- percent increase for the period ending July.""

Last month, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel massive amounts of federal student loan debt, a move that some have warned will worsen America's inflation problem. The plan calls for cancelling $10,000 of student debt for individuals earning less than $125,000 per year, or less than $250,000 for married couples — people earning below those income thresholds who received Pell Grants would be eligible for $20,000 of loan cancellation.

""Sad to see what’s being done to bribe the voters. Biden's student loan forgiveness plan may win Democrats some votes, but it fuels inflation, foots taxpayers with other people’s financial obligations, is unfair to those who paid their own way & creates irresponsible expectations,"" GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted last month.

Ukraine call whistleblower's attorney tweeted about a 'coup' and 'rebellion' against Trump in 2017,"An attorney for the anonymous whistleblower, who filed a complaint about President Donald Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, tweeted in 2017 about a ""coup"" and ""rebellion"" against Trump, according to Fox News.

The attorney, Mark Zaid, wrote the tweets after the firing of former Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama-era official who refused to defend federal laws in court.

""Coup has started,"" Zaid wrote in January 2017. ""First of many steps. #Rebellion. #Impeachment will follow ultimately.""

""45 years from now we might be recalling stories regarding the impeachment of @realDonaldTrump,"" Zaid wrote in June 2017. ""I'll be old, but will be worth the wait.""

Zaid is openly opposed to President Trump, and has openly courted whistleblowers to expose dirt on the president on Twitter. Now, it appears, he has succeeded, as the whistleblower he represents issued a complaint that is now one of the foundational pieces of an impeachment inquiry.

The attorney also tweeted in July 2017 that he believed ""CNN will play a key role in [Trump] not finishing out his full term as president.""

The whistleblower's identity, political views, and motives have become sources of heavy speculation as Democrats seek to protect his identity and Republicans increasingly push to expose it in order to present the impeachment effort as a coordinated effort to overturn the 2016 election result.

With public impeachment inquiry hearings set to start next week in the House Intelligence Committee, House Republicans have issued a subpoena to have the whistleblower testify — a request that will likely be vetoed by the Democrats, who have authority over who testifies as the majority party.

""The president's allies would like nothing better than to help the president out this whistleblower,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said last week. ""Our committee will not be a part of that. They have the right to remain anonymous. They certainly should not be subject to these kinds of vicious attacks.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-call-whistleblowers-attorney-tweeted-about-a-coup-and-impeachment-in-2017,2019-11-07
"Ukraine, calls for Twitter to ban Russian account","Ukraine's official Twitter account has called for the social media company to put the kibosh on Russia's @Russia account.

Ukraine tweeted, ""hey people, let’s demand @Twitter to remove @Russia from here."" The Ukrainian account declared that there is ""no place for an aggressor like Russia on Western social media platforms"" and ""they should not be allowed to use these platforms to promote their image while brutally killing the Ukrainian people.""



Blaze Media's Elijah Schaffer responded to the post by tweeting, ""Banning a social media account will stop a war LOL.""

""I don't know who needs to hear this, but: banning an account on social media will not prevent a full-scale invasion that is already underway,"" Elizabeth Faddis of the Washington Examiner tweeted.

A tweet posted earlier by Ukraine's account urged people to ""Tag @Russia and tell them what you think about them.""

Last year, Twitter made the highly controversial decision to permanently suspend Donald Trump's @realDonaldTrump account. Trump, who was still presdient at the time, had been a prolific tweeter who frequently utilized the platform to disseminate his views.

The country's call for Twitter to ban Russia's account comes as Russia invades Ukraine. The U.S. and other nations have condemned Russia and levied sanctions.

According to the Associated Press, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of ""consequences you have never seen"" for any nation that seeks to interfere.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-calls-for-twitter-to-ban-russian-account,2022-02-25
Ukraine diplomat drops new info that Trump was overheard saying he cares more about Biden investigation than Ukraine,"A member of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor's staff overheard President Donald Trump asking U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland about the progress toward a requested Ukrainian investigation, presumably into the Bidens, while Taylor and Sondland were in Ukraine in July.

Taylor also said the staffer asked Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine, and Sondland allegedly responded that the president cared more about investigations into Biden.

The alleged phone call and exchange came on July 26, one day after the now-public call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that spurred a whistleblower complaint and is now the focus of an impeachment inquiry. During that call, President Trump sought a Ukrainian investigation into CrowdStrike, Burisma, and Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Taylor said Wednesday that he was not made aware of the staffer's claim until last Friday, weeks after his October closed-door impeachment inquiry testimony.

Here's what Taylor said Wednesday:

Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26. While Ambassador [Kurt] Volker and I visited the front, this member of my staff accompanied Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador Sondland met with Mr. Yermak.



Following that meeting, in the presence of my staff at a restaurant, Ambassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kyiv. The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about ""the investigations."" Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.



Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which [Rudy] Giuliani was pressing for. At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it here for completeness.

Taylor, who was tapped as the top Ukraine diplomat under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, reiterated his previous testimony that he was concerned about an apparent understanding (although not a direct or explicit order from President Trump) that security aid to Ukraine was conditioned upon Ukraine's willingness to investigate the Bidens.

"Ukraine fights back: Air defenses reportedly 'wreaking havoc' on Russian aircraft; civilians take up arms; former president stands ready to fight, vows country will hold off Russian troops 'forever'","Despite being outmatched in nearly every facet of warfare, the Ukrainian people are reportedly standing strong in defense of their country, seeking to hold off Russian troops who initiated an unprovoked invasion on Thursday.

What are the details?

Though it is difficult to get an accurate picture of how exactly the fight is going in Ukraine, images and videos shared on social media over the last several hours offered signs of Ukranian determination to defend their homeland.

Forbes reporter David Axe tweeted that Ukrainian air defenses and fighters were ""wreaking havoc"" on Thursday, downing Russian planes and helicopters conducting aerial assaults on Ukraine's military installations and population centers.

One Ukrainian fighter pilot dubbed the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" has emerged as an unconfirmed hero after having allegedly single-handedly downed six Russian fighter jets.

TheBlaze previously reported that Ukraine claimed to have inflicted significant losses on the Russian military on the first day of fighting — including up to 80 tanks, as many as 516 armored combat vehicles, 10 aircraft, 7 helicopters, and 2,800 special staff.

Reportedly hell-bent on attacking Kyiv and overthrowing the Ukrainian government, Russian forces persisted through whatever resistance was offered. On Friday, they advanced into a northern district of the capital city, where residents were under direction to ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend the city.

Within Ukrainian cities, residents have vowed to take up arms against the encroaching enemy. Video posted to Twitter by security analyst Michael A. Horowitz Friday allegedly showed weapons being distributed en masse to Ukrainian civilians who had volunteered to fight.

Among the brave residents standing in the streets prepared to fight was former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The former leader reportedly took up a Kalashnikov rifle alongside civilian defense forces on Friday.

When asked by CNN's John Berman, ""How long do you think you can hold out?” Poroshenko defiantly answered, ""Forever.""

""Putin will never [overtake] Ukraine no matter how many soldiers he has, how many missiles he has, how many nuclear weapons he has — we, Ukrainians, are free people,"" he added.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother are also determined to defend their city and nation.

""It’s already a bloody war,"" Klitschko told ITV Thursday, according to the New York Post. ""I don’t have another choice. I have to do that. I would fight.""

What else?

Current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also remained in the capital despite facing serious danger. The leader reportedly claimed that he and his family are top targets in the offensive and that Russian kill squads are actively seeking to assassinate him.



""I'm staying with my people,"" he proclaimed.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday that Russia has ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance"" in Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin's designs for the European continent won't stop there.

Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine earlier this week after Putin first announced the launch of a ""special military operation"" in his country.

Under that declaration, Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. Rather, they are being encouraged to join the fight. Amazingly, those older than 60 are also reportedly getting in on the action.

Anything else?

A commander in Kyiv told CBS News that thousands of people had arrived to fight, many whom have little or no military experience. According to him, the greatest challenge has been finding guns for all the volunteers.

""This is my country. I have my family here, and I have a duty to protect my family and to protect my country. And this is the duty of each and every Ukrainian,"" one resident, a mapmaker by trade who had arrived in Kyiv to help defend it, said.

He added, ""We will fight as much as we can. We will fight because we have our families ... our country and our lifestyle that we are not ready to give up.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-fights-back-wreaking-havoc,2022-02-25
Ukraine fires back at Biden: ‘Americans are safer in Kyiv’ than in ‘crime-ridden’ US cities,"Ukrainian officials responded harshly to the Biden administration on Monday over its decision to urge the families of American diplomats to leave the country ahead of an anticipated invasion from Russia.

What are the details?

According to BuzzFeed News, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky countered the administration's claims of a coming Russian attack, saying Zelensky ""does not think there’s any remotely imminent threat to Kyiv.""

""The fact that the US was the first one to announce this is extremely disappointing and quite frankly these Americans are safer in Kyiv than they are in Los Angeles ... or any other crime-ridden city in the US,"" the source added.

The statement came as Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine in recent weeks. Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to deny that he is preparing for an attack. President Joe Biden, however, has said he thinks an invasion of some sort is more likely than not.

In anticipation of an imminent attack, Biden's State Department on Sunday ordered the evacuation of family members of diplomats and authorized the departure of some U.S. government employees, adding that ""military action by Russia could come at any time.""

The State Department also elevated its travel advisory to ""Level 4 — Do Not Travel"" due to the military threat and warned that it ""will not be in a position to evacuate U.S. citizens"" from Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.

The stark warnings were characterized by Ukrainian officials as ""utterly ridiculous"" and symbolic of what it views as ""US inconsistency,"" BuzzFeed reported.

""On the one hand, [Washington tells Ukraine] how we should democratize. We stand with you. It's your right to determine to join the West. We will stand with you against Russian aggression,"" the source reportedly said, rehashing past messages from the U.S. ""Then Russia turns up the temperature and they’re the first to leave.""

On Monday, Biden also ordered the Pentagon to put 8,500 troops on heightened alert for potential deployment to Europe in response to Russia's fear mongering.

What else?

This was the second time in under a week that Ukrainian officials have criticized Biden over his messaging on the Ukraine-Russia situation.

In a press conference last week, Biden appeared to downplay the consequences of a ""minor incursion"" by Russia, sewing doubt as to whether the U.S. or NATO allies would respond with force should Russian invade its neighboring country.

Biden would go on to strangely predict that Putin ""will move in"" to Ukraine because ""he has to do something.""

Ukrainian officials were reportedly ""stunned"" by the president's comments, adding, ""It gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure.""

In a tweet, Zelensky said, ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-fires-back-at-biden-kyiv-us-cities,2022-01-24
Ukraine foreign minister: US ambassador never said aid money was linked to Biden investigation,"Ukraine's foreign minister said U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland never linked the release of security aid to Ukraine to the country's willingness to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, according to Reuters.

Much of the evidence presented by Democrats and their chosen witnesses point toward an alleged abuse of power or ""quid pro quo"" by President Donald Trump rests on allegations that Sondland, who had direct contact with Trump, delivered the message to Ukraine that aid was contingent upon a Biden investigation.

If Ukraine foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko is correct, the Democrats' case has been significantly undermined.

""Ambassador Sondland did not tell us, and certainly did not tell me, about a connection between the assistance and the investigations. You should ask him,"" Prystaiko said.

Prystaiko's denial of pressure or a quid pro quo involving the security aid supports previous assertions by Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky that he felt no pressure from Trump to investigate the Bidens. In fact, at the time of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, Ukraine was not aware that aid was being withheld.

""I think you read everything. I think you read text,"" Zelensky said at a September press conference. ""I'm sorry, but I don't want to be involved to democratic, open elections of U.S.A. No, you heard that we had good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things. I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed me.""

Ukraine ambassador William Taylor testified Wednesday that a member of his staff overheard President Trump asking Sondland about ""investigations"" during a phone call on July 26.

Ukraine hit with another massive cyber attack; one GOP senator warns Russian missile strikes could follow,"The Ukrainian government said it was hit with another critical cyber attack on Wednesday, this one taking down several government websites and banks in the Eastern European country.

What are the details?

The attack, called a mass distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, reportedly began around 4 p.m. local time, according to a post by Mykhailo Fedorov, head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, CNBC reported.

In a post on his Telegram, Fedorov reported that websites for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, and Verkhovna Rada, the country’s parliament, were among those affected by the attack.

The government websites were offline as of Wednesday morning as officials attempted to switch traffic to another provider in order to minimize damage.

CNBC noted that a DDoS attack is when a hacker floods a target's network or server with traffic so that others can't access it.

What's the background?

The sweeping cyber attack is the second in the course of a week. Though the source of the attack has not yet been confirmed, it comes as Russia becomes increasingly hostile toward its neighboring country, threatening a full-scale military invasion.

On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent ""peacekeeping"" troops to Donetsk and Luhansk, two Russian-speaking regions in southeastern Ukraine, promoting global backlash. President Biden considered the brazen move the start of an invasion and responded by ordering sanctions against the country.

The United States attributed last week's attack — which affected Ukraine's Defense Ministry, army, and state banks — to Russian agents, though Russia denied any involvement.

What else?

Over the weekend, reports surfaced indicating that the U.S. had obtained intelligence that Russia planned to invade Ukraine in the coming days.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said in a tweet Wednesday that massive cyber attacks on the Ukrainian government and the disruption of communications were part of Russia's plan.

He also warned that the cyber attacks would be ""followed by targeted missile strikes against air defense sites [and] ammunition/weapons depots.""

World Health Organization tells Ukraine to destroy dangerous pathogens to prevent 'potential spills' of disease from labs,"The World Health Organization advised Ukrainian officials to destroy dangerous pathogens stored in laboratories across the war-torn country to prevent a potential outbreak of disease, Reuters reported. Due to the Russian invasion, the WHO recommended public health labs protect against ""any potential spills"" in Ukraine that could lead to disease spreading to the general population.

""Biosecurity experts say Russia's movement of troops into Ukraine and bombardment of its cities have raised the risk of an escape of disease-causing pathogens, should any of those facilities be damaged,"" Reuters reported on Thursday.

The report noted that Ukraine has ""public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans including, most recently, COVID-19."" Reuters added that the Ukrainian labs have ""received support from the United States, the European Union, and the WHO.""

The WHO informed the outlet that it had collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to promote security practices that help prevent ""accidental or deliberate release of pathogens.""



""As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,"" the WHO told Reuters in an email.

The WHO did not reveal when it made the recommendation to Ukrainian officials. The health agency also did not provide specifics as to what kinds of pathogens are housed in Ukraine's labs. The WHO also did not divulge whether or not Ukrainian health officials were heeding the advice to destroy the dangerous pathogens.

Reuters did not receive a response from Ukrainian officials regarding requests for comment on the WHO guidance.

On Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova reiterated a long-standing allegation that the United States operates biowarfare laboratories in Ukraine. Washington and Kyiv have both denied the accusations.

""We can already conclude that in Ukrainian biological laboratories in direct proximity to the territory of our country, development of components of biological weapons was being carried out,"" Zakharova claimed.

Reuters reported, ""Zakharova said Russia had documents showing that the Ukrainian health ministry had ordered the destruction of samples of plague, cholera, anthrax, and other pathogens after Feb. 24.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby dismissed the accusations on Wednesday.



""The Russian accusations are absurd, they are laughable and you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda,"" Kirby said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the accusations as ""conspiracy theories.""

""This is preposterous. It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,"" Psaki tweeted on Wednesday.

""The United States is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere,"" she continued.

""This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,"" Psaki said. ""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.""

A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson proclaimed, ""Ukraine strictly denies any such allegation.""



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded, ""That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of.""

""I am a reasonable person. The president of a reasonable country and reasonable people. I am the father of two children,"" Zelenskyy added. ""And no chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.""

The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting for Friday to discuss Russia's allegations of ""military biological activities of the U.S. on the territory of Ukraine,"" according to ABC News.



Olivia Dalton – spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations – called the claims ""disinformation.""

""This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,"" Dalton said on Thursday. ""We’re not going to let Russia gaslight the world or use the U.N. Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-labs-world-health-organization-disease,2022-03-11
"Ukraine offers Russian soldiers money and amnesty to surrender, or says they can 'die in an unjust war'","While war rages in Ukraine, the country is offering Russian soldiers money and a promise of amnesty should they lay down their arms and surrender, Ukraine's defense ministry said Monday.

“We offer Russian soldiers a choice: to die in an unjust war, or full amnesty and 5 million rubles of compensation if they put down their guns and voluntarily surrender to prison,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a message to Facebook and Twitter.

While the value of the Russian Ruble is fluctuating because of severe economic sanctions imposed on Russia by western governments opposed to the war, the offer is worth about $46,000 as of publication time.

According to Defense One, the intention behind the offer is to further delay the Russian advance on Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, which American officials say has been delayed by logistics failures.

“They ended up having to rely on fuel and sustainment capabilities earlier in the process than what we believe they had planned to do,” a senior Pentagon official told reporters. “So on day four they're running out of gas, and they're having logistics problems.”

Ukraine's defense ministry has claimed that more than 5,300 Russian troops have been killed or captured since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country last Thursday. Reports of casualties by either side should be received with skepticism, as both the Ukrainian and Russian governments are actively promoting wartime propaganda to boost morale on their respective sides.

“A lot of them are very young. The Kremlin turns them into criminals, turns them into murderers. Some of them were deceived,” ministry officials said. “Ukraine is a civilized country. All prisoners are safe, they are being helped. They already communicate with loved ones.”

Ukraine's message to Russian soldiers is this: ""You have a chance to start a new life. Make a choice. Leave without a weapon with a white flag. Say a code word: ‘million.’ Live a life. Give your family a hug. For those who will continue to behave like an occupier — there will be no mercy.”

It's a message that comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ramped up tensions with the west by putting Russian nuclear forces on high alert Sunday. Putin pointed to ""aggressive statements"" by NATO members and the harsh sanctions against Moscow as justification for readying Russia's military to launch nuclear weapons.

U.S. officials are concerned Russia's failure to take Kyiv swiftly could result in Putin escalating further.

“The way he [Putin] characterized it, ‘special combat duty alert’—think he called it something like that—it's not a term … in what we understand to be Russian doctrine. So that's why we're still analyzing it and reviewing it to try to understand what exactly it means,” the senior defense official said.

So far, Russia has not changed the position of its nuclear forces nor have U.S. officials been able to reach their Russian counterparts for clarification on Putin's intentions.

“There's no ‘hotline’ established with respect to the crisis in Ukraine,” the official said, in apparent reference to the 1963 line of communication between the White House and the Kremlin to avert nuclear war.

Russia's forces are currently amassed fewer than 20 miles north of Kyiv, CNN reports. While Ukrainian forces are putting up stiff resistance, aided by the incompetence of the Russian army, it appears to only be a matter of time before the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians are overwhelmed.

Roughly one fourth of Russia's gathered troops have yet to enter Ukraine, a senior defense official told reporters Monday, and U.S. intelligence believes a ""second wave"" of troops is coming, along with increased Russian airstrikes, long-range missiles, and artillery fire.

""They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv, and one of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and the scale of their targeting of Kyiv,"" the official said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-offers-russian-soldiers-money-and-amnesty-to-surrender,2022-02-28
Joe Biden hit with another investigation — by Ukrainian officials,"A Ukrainian court forced the opening of an investigation into claims that former Vice President Joe Biden pressured the resignation of a special prosecutor in order to benefit his son Hunter Biden.

The Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigations confirmed the investigation into Biden's motivation to press for the 2016 dismissal of Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, according to a report from the Washington Post.

The investigation mirrors the demand made by President Donald Trump in an infamous call made with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The accusations of a ""quid pro quo"" with Zelensky led to the two impeachment charges that were issued against the president by the Democrat-led House of Representatives.

""They need to investigate this. They have no other alternative,"" said Shokin's lawyer Oleksandr Teleshetsky.

""They are required to do this by the decision of the court,"" he added. ""If they don't, then they violate a whole string of procedural norms.""

Shokin has claimed that his resignation was forced in order to prevent a probe into Burisma, an energy company that had appointed Hunter Biden as a board member in 2014.

Republicans in the U.S. Senate have also opened an investigation into the claims of corruption against Biden and his son.

Hunter Biden is also entangled in his own scandal having to do with fathering a child with a former exotic dancer from a Washington, D.C., club he frequented.

Biden was considered the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary, but his campaign has performed disastrously in the first state contests, paving the way for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to seize the lead.

"Ukraine's parliament votes to allow citizens to carry guns, act in self-defense amid Russian invasion. Gun stores are already bustling.","As Russia continues to threaten a full-scale military invasion, the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday approved a draft law giving citizens permission to carry firearms and act in self-defense — and within hours, gun stores were bustling.

Reuters reported that the draft measure was approved on ""the first reading.""

Its authors reportedly stated in a note that ""the adoption of this law is fully in the interests of the state and society,"" adding that the law is needed due to ""existing threats and dangers for the citizens of Ukraine.""

The move comes only days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered ""peacekeeping"" troops to the Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in southeastern Ukraine. Onlookers, including President Joe Biden, called the brazen maneuver the beginning of an invasion.

Russia has been massing troops on its border with Ukraine for weeks and has recently begun threatening war while continually insisting there are no invasion plans. But as of Wednesday, as many as 80% of Russia's approximately 150,000 stationed troops now appear to be in ready position, a senior U.S. defense official warned, according to the Hill.

The imminent threat of a large-scale assault has prompted Ukraine's government to issue a 30-day state of emergency, under which the Eastern European country has begun calling up military reservists and has drafted the measure to allow ordinary civilians to carry firearms.

Ukrainians reportedly responded to the draft law by descending en masse on gun stores. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the threat of attack on Kyiv has caused ""an unprecedented rush to buy arms.""

Gun shops are reportedly experiencing long lines already as Ukrainian citizens bolt to purchase guns, ammunition, and sniper rifles. Some weapons, such as the AR-10 and AR-15, have already sold out in gun stores.

""Of course, I’m worried about the situation,"" one Ukrainian told the news outlet, speaking from the basement of a gun store in central Kyiv. ""I’m hoping for the best but preparing for everything.""

Another citizen said, ""I’ve bought two sniper complexes with good optics. I’ve also ordered a drone on Amazon. It hasn’t turned up yet.""

Armed up, he felt bullish about his country's chances against an occupying Russian force.

""We can win against Russia. This isn’t 2014,"" he said. ""We have heavy weapons, thanks to U.S. and U.K. If they come, we will shoot at them from every window.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-parliament-allows-citizens-to-carry-guns,2022-02-23
Ukraine planned to reopen Biden investigation — months before Trump's call to Zelensky,"The Ukrainian government had plans to reopen an investigation into Burisma Holdings, the company at which Joe Biden's son, Hunter, sat on the board, months before President Donald Trump brought up the issue on a call with current Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, according to Fox News.

The revelation could be severely damaging to Democrats' attempt to impeach President Trump for allegedly pressuring Zelensky to look into the Bidens and their Ukrainian business activities in July.

What did we learn?

Ukrainian officials had planned the investigation before Zelensky even assumed the presidency. A document obtained by Fox News contributor John Solomon reveals that in February, when Petro Poroshenko was still president, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau requested that the Burisma investigation be revisited.

Additionally, Solomon reports that the U.S. government was aware of this at the time.

""The U.S. government had open-source intelligence and was aware as early as February of 2019 that the Ukrainian government was planning to reopen the Burisma investigation,"" Solomon said on ""Hannity"" on Tuesday night. ""This is long before the president ever imagined having a call with President Zelensky.""

What was being investigated?

The NABU was looking into the existence of ""illicit funds"" going through Burisma, owned by Mykola Zlochevsky.

According to Solomon, this ""illicit"" financial activity overlapped with the time Hunter Biden was on the board, when he was making as much as $1 million per year.



A ""notice of suspicion"" filed by the NABU questioned whether $3.4 million that was paid to Hunter Biden's firm may have been part of that illicit funding.

Who knew about this?

If Solomon's reporting is correct, and the U.S. government was fully aware of the NABU's intention to investigate Biden and Burisma, the question arises: Did the whistleblower who flagged Trump's call with Zelensky know about it? Was it intentionally omitted from the complaint, or was the whistleblower ignorant of the situation?

""A month later, in April, the prosecutor's office — open-source intelligence, again — the U.S. government officials confirming they were aware of this — made a request of another investigative agency in Ukraine for assistance in going through these bank records,"" Solomon said on ""Hannity."" ""That is a significant change in the timeline — it was omitted from the whistleblower's complaint, and the question is did he not know it or did he exclude it because it didn't fit the narrative he was trying to write.""

Why this matters



There is significant evidence pointing to Democrats' efforts to influence the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton by colluding with Ukrainian officials. However, the Democratic Party has put a tight focus on President Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky, claiming that his attempt to invite foreign influence into the 2020 election is grounds for impeachment and removal.

If the whistleblower complaint about the Ukraine call intentionally omitted information that Burisma and the Bidens were already subject to Ukrainian investigation, that lends credence to suspicions that the complaint (which does not contain firsthand information) was misleadingly crafted to implicate the president.

"Ukraine president offers weapons to any citizen 'who wants to defend the country,' says, 'Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities'","Hours after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of his country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Thursday morning issued a call to arms, publicly declaring that he would give weapons to any Ukrainian citizen who wished to defend their country.

What are the details?

As Russian troops poured into Ukraine and air assaults pummeled military installations, airports, and hospitals, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home or face violence.

But Zelenskyy was not willing to see his military or his people lie down and take the unprovoked assault without a fight. In a series of tweets, the president urged his fellow citizens to defend their country.

""We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities,"" Zelenskyy said.

He added: ""We will lift sanctions on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""

Zelenskyy's tweets echoed remarks he made a day prior.

In a passionate speech addressing Russian citizens who may be sympathetic to Ukraine's cause, Zelenskyy promised retaliation to any military advance.

""If we’ll be attacked by the [enemy] troops, if they try to take our country away from us, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. Not attack, but defend ourselves. And when you will be attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces,"" he declared.

Days before, the Ukrainian parliament cleared the way for citizens to carry arms and act in self-defense — and within hours, gun stores in the country were being cleared of product.

What else?

Not all Ukrainian citizens have resolved to take up arms, and understandably so. Russia's initial air assault campaign brought devastation to parts of the country and aroused a great deal of fear and panic.

Highways were reportedly jammed up Thursday morning and afternoon as many sought to flee major population centers and head west.

Russia claimed Thursday evening that it had destroyed at least 74 military installations, including 11 airfields. Russian troops reportedly captured an airport in Hostomel, just outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Ukraine also reported that enemy troops had seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

But not everything was going the Kremlin's way. Russia's aggression came with a significant economic toll.

Russian stocks plummeted at least 33% Thursday and the country's currency, the ruble, hit an all-time low against the U.S. dollar, CNN reported.

The outlet noted the Moscow stock exchange had suspended trading earlier on Thursday amid news of the invasion. However, when dealing resumed, stocks went into free-fall. The crash reportedly wiped out about $70 billion in value from Russia's biggest companies.

Moreover, that downturn preceded the handing down of further severe sanctions from the U.S., U.K., European Union, and other allies.

The hope of government leaders in the West is that Russia's military campaign will be too economically devastating to continue on. It remains to be seen if sanctions alone will deter Putin or work quickly enough to defend Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-president-offers-weapons-to-anyone-who-wants-to-defend-their-country,2022-02-24
"Ukraine President Zelensky says there was no quid pro quo with Trump, but criticizes withholding of aid","Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky told Time that there was no ""quid pro quo"" demand from President Donald Trump involving military aid, but he was still not pleased that the aid was temporarily held up.

President Trump is very likely going to be impeached by the House of Representatives for an alleged abuse of power, standing accused of withholding military aid from Ukraine to pressure Zelensky into opening and/or publicly announcing investigations into the Ukrainian business dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, while Joe was vice president.

But, Zelensky has and continues to maintain that there was no such arrangement.

""I never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo,"" Zelensky said. ""That's not my thing.""

Zelensky has expressed a desire to avoid involvement in U.S. political affairs, a position that was affirmed by numerous witnesses who testified last month in the impeachment inquiry hearings. So he said he wasn't aware of or concerned with any alleged quid pro quo — he was concerned about his nation's ability to defend itself.

""I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war,"" Zelensky said. ""If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.""

Zelensky is also bothered by the constant portrayal of Ukraine as a corrupt nation. While the characterization is indisputably accurate, Zelensky wants and needs that image of Ukraine to change for the nation to advance under his administration. But, much of the impeachment inquiry has highlighted the corruption in the nation over the years.

""When America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals,"" Zelensky said. ""It might seem like an easy thing to say, that combination of words: Ukraine is a corrupt country. Just to say it and that's it. But it doesn't end there. Everyone hears that signal. Investments, banks, stakeholders, companies, American, European, companies that have international capital in Ukraine, it's a signal to them that says, 'Be careful, don't invest.' Or, 'Get out of there.'""

One of President Trump's cited reasons for withholding security aid to Ukraine was concern about corruption.

"Ukraine President Zelenskyy appears to blast Biden for watching 'from a distance' as Russia inflicts horror on Ukraine, says country has been 'left alone' to defend itself","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to hit out at President Joe Biden and others in an early Friday morning video, saying that the embattled country has been ""left alone"" to defend itself against invading Russian forces.

What are the details?

In recorded remarks, Zelenskyy said that Western allies are not doing enough to help Ukraine stop Russian aggression amid the deadly invasion.

“This morning, we are defending our country alone,” Zelenskyy lamented. “Just like yesterday, the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance. Russia was hit with sanctions yesterday, but these are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.”

""Who is ready to fight with us?"" he asked. ""Honestly, I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? ... Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: Now is an important moment — the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: Are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance.""

He continued, ""Today, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer.""

In the video, Zelenskyy also added that he and the Ukrainian citizens appreciate the outpouring of support from Russian citizens who took to St. Petersburg to protest against the country's invasion.

""To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who went out to protest, I want to say: We see you,” he said. “This means you heard us. This means you are starting to believe us. Fight for us, fight against the war.”



Elsewhere in his remarks, Zelenskyy said that Russia's attacks on civilians will not be forgiven.

""The enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven.

What else?

Biden on Thursday said that U.S. troops would not be sent to Ukraine, but would instead defend NATO member states that may be impacted by the aggression.

""Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said in remarks on the ongoing invasion. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies.""

"On Ukraine and 'quid pro quo', the Trump White House's inconsistent messaging fuels impeachment inquiry","Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's comments about Ukraine during a Thursday news conference, and the subsequent walking back of those comments, highlighted a growing problem with the Trump administration's defense against Democrats' impeachment inquiry — officials don't seem to agree on what did and what did not happen.

Mulvaney appeared to undermine the administration's ""no quid pro quo"" defense regarding President Donald Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, before saying later in the day that there was no connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and their cooperation with investigations President Trump was asking for.

'Quid pro quo,' or no?

House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry into the question of whether President Trump used the threat of withholding aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky into investigating 2016 election interference in favor of Hillary Clinton and/or the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of former vice president Joe Biden.

The inquiry, and the defense from the Trump administration and its allies, focused on whether or not there was a ""quid pro quo."" On the call with Zelensky, was President Trump asking a favor for a favor? Was the delay in the $400 million in aid money directly related to the investigation?

There has been inconsistency on both sides of this dispute. Democrats have alleged a ""quid pro quo."" Trump has said there was none. Some Democrats later said it doesn't actually matter if there was an explicit ""quid pro quo"" or not, while others maintained that the July 25 call transcript was enough evidence of such an arrangement.

President Trump has offered more than one explanation for the delayed aid, which don't necessarily contradict one another, but which have been presented in a way that muddy the waters some. Trump has said the aid was delayed because European countries are not contributing enough, and also that the aid was held up over concerns about corruption in the Ukrainian government.

What he has not said, however, is what a seemingly flustered Mulvaney emphatically stated Thursday afternoon.

'Get over it'

Here's the exchange between Mulvaney and ABC News chief White House correspondent Jon Karl on Thursday:

Mulvaney: Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that's it. And that's why we held up the money.



Karl: So the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason [Trump] ordered to hold the funding to Ukraine?



Mulvaney: The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.



Karl: Withholding the funding?



Mulvaney: Yeah. Which ultimately, then, flowed

Mulvaney went on to clarify the legal reasons why the administration needed to release the appropriated aid to Ukraine by the end of September, before the reporter turns back to quid pro quo.

Karl: Let's be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.



Mulvaney: We do that all the time with foreign policy. We were holding up money at the same time for, what was it, the northern triangle countries. We were holding up aid to the northern triangle companies so that they would change their policies on immigration.

A bit later, Mulvaney appeared to put a defiant punctuation on what many see as a clear admission of the previously denied ""quid pro quo.""

""I have news for everybody. Get over it,"" Mulvaney said. ""There's going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen. Elections have consequences. And foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.""

Mulvaney Tells Reporter: 'Get Over' Quid Pro Quo: 'It Happens All The Time' | Velshi & Ruhle | MSNBC youtu.be

The Department of Justice quickly distanced itself from any knowledge of the ""quid pro quo"" Mulvaney described.

""If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,"" a senior DOJ official said, according to The Hill.

White House lawyers also backed away from what Mulvaney said.

""The President's legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press briefing,"" Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement.

That's not what I meant?

Seemingly realizing that his news conference had, in the eyes of the media at least, gone horribly wrong, Mulvaney began trying to walk back what he said and clarify.

""Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,"" Mulvaney said in a statement later Thursday. ""There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server—this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server.""

That statement, however, doesn't change the fact that we have a video of a reporter saying, ""What you just described is a quid pro quo,"" and Mulvaney responding, ""We do that all the time.""

There is disagreement and debate about Trump's call with Zelensky. Was there a quid pro quo? If there was, would it be wrong? Is the call wrong even without a quid pro quo? Or was it, as President Trump has repeatedly described it, ""perfect""? Beyond ethical questions of right and wrong, there is the further question of whether it would justify impeachment.

Either way, the Trump administration is doing itself no favors by delivering multiple, sometimes contradictory messages about the issue, while Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who is somewhat unpredictable, makes the TV news rounds creating even more headlines about Ukraine.

Democrats' impeachment inquiry started off based on assumptions and interpretations of a phone call, and didn't appear to have much to sustain it long term. But every time the administration contradicts itself, it adds fuel to allow the impeachment fire to burn longer and longer — which was probably the Democrats' goal the whole time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-quid-pro-quo-trump-white-house-inconsistent-messaging-fuels-impeachment-inquiry,2019-10-18
Ukraine requests Elon Musk's help as war knocks out internet service — and he immediately delivers,"Elon Musk, the world's richest man, came to the rescue over the weekend after Ukraine requested help providing internet access to the country as Russian forces continue to besiege it.

What happened?

Mykhailo Fedorov, the vice prime minister of Ukraine and minister of digital transformation, reached out to Musk via Twitter on Saturday seeking the billionaire entrepreneur's assistance via Starlink, a SpaceX satellite broadband internet service.

""@elonmusk, while you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand,"" Fedorov said.

Musk quickly responded, ""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.""

""Starlink terminals are coming to Ukraine! Thank you @elonmusk, thank you everyone, who supported Ukraine!"" Fedorov responded.

For embattled Ukraine, internet connectivity is vital for victory against Russia. Satellite internet connectivity will allow the Ukrainian government, military forces, and citizens to remain connected with one another and the world as the war damages internet infrastructure, particularly in rural areas away from Ukraine's cities.

Reuters reported on Saturday that internet connectivity in Ukraine has become a significant problem, especially in southern and eastern areas of the country where fighting has been heaviest thus far.

What is Starlink?

Branding itself as the ""world's most advanced broadband internet system,"" Starlink uses a network of satellites in low-earth orbit to provide internet connectivity to communities worldwide. Because Starlink satellites orbit earth much closer than geostationary satellites traditionally used for satellite internet, the connection Starlink provides is faster and more reliable than traditional satellite internet service.

In order to connect to Starlink, users need the appropriate terminal receiver, more of which are being shipped to Ukraine as Musk confirmed.

However, more satellite activity could pose a problem for Ukrainians. As John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, explained, ""Russia has big electronic ears,"" which means that ""users' uplink transmissions become beacons... for airstrikes.""

Fortunately, big tech companies like Google and Meta are now taking steps to protect Ukrainians by disabling information that could be used to track Ukrainian military and citizens.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-requests-elon-musks-help-as-war-knocks-out-internet-service-and-he-immediately-delivers,2022-02-28
Ukraine and Russia peace talks near Belarus,"Ukraine has agreed to hold peace talks with Russia ""without preconditions,"" according to multiple reports. Sunday's announcement of peace talks was reportedly made by the office of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the fourth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow will occur on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River, according to Sky News. A precise time for the meeting was not provided.

""The announcement came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks,"" the Associated Press reported.

The statement from Zelenskyy's office noted that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is involved with the peace talks.



“Alexander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters, and missiles stationed on Belarus territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks and return,” said the statement from Zelenskyy's office, according to the Financial Times.



Of the peace talks, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said it ""is already a victory for Ukraine"" that there are no preconditions for the meeting, according to Deborah Haynes – security and defense editor at Sky News.

""We go there to listen to what Russia wants to say,"" Kuleba said, according to Haynes.

Kuleba reportedly declared, ""There is nothing bad in talking, and if the outcome is peace that is to be welcomed. We will not surrender. We will not capitulate. We will not give up a single inch of our territory. This is not the goal of our fight.""

Previously, Zelenskyy had refused to attend peace talks in Belarus. The Ukrainian president argued that Belarus was not a neutral territory since Russia has a large contingent of troops in the country and it was one of the launch places for the Russian invasion.

Ukraine has surprised many by holding back much of Vladimir Putin's military forces at the beginning of the war.

"Ukraine Russia war update: US aid, NATO send weapons, Zelenskyy demands more","As Russian forces march closer to the capital city of Kyiv, the international community is sending military aid to Ukraine. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling on nations to inflect financial punishments on Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine.

US has sent over $1 billion to Ukraine in the past year

The United States is sending an ""unprecedented third payment of $350 million"" in military aid to Ukraine to help the country defend against Russia's advancing forces.

""I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the president, an unprecedented third presidential drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday. ""This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1 billion.""

""This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing,"" Blinken continued. ""It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.""

Fox News reported, ""The defense aid will include anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, and body armor and related equipment, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Saturday.""

The $350 million will be allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act ""in defense articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training, and to make the determinations required under such section to direct such a drawdown,"" according to the White House.

NATO sending weapons to Ukraine

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg revealed on Friday that the military alliance would be sending weapons to Ukraine – including air defenses.

Reuters reported, ""He said some of the 30 allies announced the type of weapons that they would supply Ukraine, including air defenses, without giving details. 'Allies are very committed to continue to provide support,' he said.""

Stoltenberg commented on Russia attempting to take out the Ukrainian government during a press conference, ""We see rhetoric, the messages, which is strongly indicating that the aim is to remove the democratically-elected government in Kyiv.""

NATO also activated its response force for the first time in its history. On Thursday, all 30 NATO members agreed to activate the multinational force of approximately 40,000 land, air, maritime, and special operations personnel.

Stoltenberg said activating the NATO Response Force (NRF) was necessary because ""the Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine.""



""We are deploying [the NRF] to ... prevent any miscalculations, any misunderstandings that we are not ready to protect and defend all our allies,"" Stoltenberg declared. ""This is something that all allies have agreed to do.""

""We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense,"" he added.

Ukrainian president urges nations to take more measures against Putin

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed for Russia to be cut from the SWIFT international electronic bank payment system to punish Putin for the invasion of Ukraine.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a ""cooperative of financial institutions formed in 1973 with headquarters ... overseen by the National Bank of Belgium in partnership with other major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank,"" according to CBS News.

""The anti-war coalition is working. Defensive weapons and equipment are arriving to Ukraine. We have almost unanimous support from the EU on cutting Russia from SWIFT,"" Zelenskyy said, according to Euronews. ""I hope Germany and Hungary will find the courage to support this decision.""

On Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Russia shouldn't be cut off from SWIFT just yet because it is ""very important"" to keep such measures ""for a situation where it may be necessary.""

Barron's noted, ""Germany has been more cautious about excluding Russia from SWIFT. Russian gas makes up a higher share of energy supplies in Germany and other parts of Europe than in France, which backs the move.""

Regarding Hungary kicking Russia out of SWIFT, Fortune pointed out, ""Energy likely plays a part – Hungary signed a deal with Moscow just a few weeks ago that will allow it to buy Russian gas far below market prices.""

President Joe Biden deferred to Europe on whether to boot Russia from SWIFT.

""The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence – maybe more consequence than SWIFT – number one,"" Biden said on Thursday. ""Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.""

Zelensky also called on ""all civilized countries"" to ""impose an embargo on Russian oil products"" and ""ban Russian citizens from entering your territory,"" according to Fox News National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-update-nato-us-aid,2022-02-26
Ukraine Russia war update: Plane shot down over Kyiv,"Ukraine has claimed to have inflicted a significant blow on Vladimir Putin's forces.

The Financial Times reported on an update by Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, claiming losses that the Russian military had incurred.

Maliar reportedly wrote in a Facebook post: ""Since the beginning of the open large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, the troops of the invading country have suffered the following losses (approximately) as of 3pm Friday:

Tanks — up to 80

Armored combat vehicles of various types — 516

Aircraft — 10

Helicopters — 7

Special staff — 2,800

We are strong! Victory will be ours.""

On Thursday, at least 15 Russian T-72 tanks were ""destroyed or damaged by the Ukrainian forces using the Javelin PTRK, an American anti-tank missile, near Glukhov,"" according to the Daily Mail.

Ukraine has reportedly launched a counteroffensive and attacked a Russian military base approximately 10 miles from the border of the warring countries, Newsweek reported.

The Daily Mail added, ""Ukrainian forces claimed on Friday to have destroyed part of an airfield in Millerovo in southern Russia, destroying several of Moscow's fighter jets.""

The U.K. Ministry of Defense stated Thursday: ""It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned Day 1 military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia's advances.""



The British agency also acknowledged that Russian forces ""highly likely"" captured the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant. Ukrainian officials have since confirmed the report, adding that Russian forces have seized control of the now-defunct nuclear power plant and that the staff are being ""held hostage,"" according to CNN.

Ukraine lost one of its best fighter jets on early Friday morning. CNN reported that a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv shortly before dawn on Friday, according to Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin. Several videos capture the fiery scene above the country's capital city of nearly 3,000 residents as smoldering debris rains down on Kyiv.



Before the war started, Ukraine only had 34 Su-27 fighter jets, according to Forbes.

The destroyed plane caused a high-rise apartment to catch fire. Three people in the apartment building were injured, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

The New York Times reported that the United Nations released a statement on Friday claiming that they had received reports of at least 25 civilians have been killed and 127 injured in Ukraine due to ""shelling and airstrikes"" from the Russian invasion. The U.N. cautioned that the actual death toll was likely much higher.



The U.N. also estimates that roughly 100,000 Ukrainians have fled their homes, many traveling to neighboring countries for safety.

Ukraine stands up to Russia in powerful moment at emergency UN meeting: 'There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.',"Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations confronted Russia's U.N. ambassador in a tense exchange late Wednesday just as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What happened?

During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council late Wednesday, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya directly confronted Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, a rare moment at the U.N. that underscored its seriousness.

Less than an hour after Russia began its invasion, Kyslytsya called on the U.N. Security Council to remove Russia as president of the council (the council rotates the ""president"" role each month, and the Russian Federation just so happened to be president of the council in February) — and that is when things got tense.

""It’s too late, my dear colleagues, to speak about de-escalation, too late,"" Kyslytsya said.

""The Russian president declared war. Should I play video of your president?"" Kyslytsya then asked Nebenzia directly, holding up his phone. ""Ambassador, should I do that right now, or can you confirm it?""

""Do not interrupt me, please — thank you,"" he continued.

""Then don't ask me questions when you are speaking,"" Nebenzia fired back. ""Proceed with your statement.""

""Anyway, you declared war. It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war,"" Kyslytsya responded. ""So, I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war.""

Ukraine - Security Council, 8974th meeting | United Nations | UNTV Live (23 Feb 2022) - Official youtu.be

At the end of the meeting, after other countries had condemned Russia for the invasion, Kyslytsya blasted Russia with a powerful line of condemnation.

""As I said, relinquish your duties as chair. Call Putin, call [Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey] Lavrov to stop aggression,"" Kyslytsya said. ""And I welcome the decision of some members of this council to meet as soon as possible to consider the necessary decision that would condemn the aggression that you launch on my people.""

""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, ambassador,"" Kyslytsya continued.

Shockingly, just before adjourning the meeting, Nebenzia said that Russia is not being aggressive toward Ukraine because there is a ""junta in power in Kyiv."" The comment amounts to an outright rejection of Ukraine's sovereignty.

Ukraine to fire prosecutor who was digging into Hunter Biden's business activities: report,"The Ukrainian government intends to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the energy company Burisma and former board member Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine, Reuters reported.

Kostiantyn Kulyk, who has met with President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in the past to discuss the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine, is reportedly being fired for a refusal to take a test required of all prosecutors as part of anti-corruption efforts under President Volodomyr Zelensky's administration.

More than 400 prosecutors have already been fired by Prosecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka as a part of the apparent clean-up process in the prosecutor's office.

Kulyk reportedly compiled a seven-page dossier on Hunter Biden and Burisma earlier this year, although the exact contents of the alleged dossier are unknown.

During the Obama administration, Vice President Joe Biden was the point man on Ukraine relations. In 2014, Hunter Biden was named to the board of Burisma and paid a salary of $50,000 per month, despite having little or no relevant experience. Joe Biden has denied that he used his position to benefit his son or protect him from investigation.

Giuliani has said Kulyk told him that Joe Biden, while he was vice president, pushed for the firing of former prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016 in order to protect Hunter from an investigation. Kulyk was reportedly investigating Shokin's firing.

Kulyk's role in investigating Burisma and Joe and Hunter Biden is significant to President Trump, who is facing potential impeachment for allegedly withholding aid money to force similar investigations.

On July 25, President Trump mentioned a potential investigation into that situation to Zelensky during a phone call, which House Democrats are now using as the basis for an impeachment inquiry alleging Trump abused his power to pressure a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.



Trump has denied making the investigations a condition for Ukraine to receive aid, and Republicans also argue that even if there was a quid pro quo, it would not be an impeachable offense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-to-fire-prosecutor-who-was-digging-into-hunter-bidens-business-activities-report,2019-11-05
"Russia claims destruction of 74 Ukrainian military facilities as land assaults begin — citizens flee cities in fear, take shelter in subway stations","Russia's Defense Ministry claimed early Thursday that the Russian military had already destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities — including 11 airbases — only hours into the launch of its full-scale invasion of the neighboring country.

What are the details?

As of Thursday morning, Ukraine reported at least 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians had been killed in the shocking military advance, though those numbers are expected to rise in the coming hours and days.

Only hours before, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast aside global condemnation and threats of harsh economic sanctioning when he announced a ""special military operation"" had begun in southeastern Ukraine. The West called the maneuver what it actually was: a declaration of war.

Under the cover of darkness, the Russian military launched airstrikes on cities across Ukraine, from the Donbas region — where Putin falsely claims he is acting in defense of Russian separatists — to Kharkiv in the northeast just 30 miles from the Russian border, to Ukraine's capital in Kyiv.

On Thursday, Ukraine’s military chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, reportedly said Ukrainian troops were fighting the Russian army in the country's north and south.

According to the Associated Press, Zaluzhnyi said a battle was raging near the Hostomel airbase just under five miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv. The north-central location of the capital indicates that Russian troops had advanced significantly into Ukraine.

He added that in the south, more fighting was going on near Henichesk, Skadovsk, and Chaplynka. Putin has claimed Russia will only attack Ukrainian military facilities.

In Luhansk, in the southeast, video appeared to show Russian tanks traveling through emptied city streets. Meanwhile, Putin carried on as usual, reportedly maintaining his scheduled meeting in Moscow with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.

What else?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly said that Russian forces were trying to seize the area surrounding the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, near the Ukraine-Belarusian border.

""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,” Zelenskyy said in a statement, adding, ""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.""

The president previously severed diplomatic ties and declared martial law. In a tweet, he also pleaded with sympathetic Russian citizens to protest their government's warring.

Anything else?

Many Ukrainians have responded to the onslaught by attempting to withdraw cash and flee major urban centers, though reporters have noted that highways have quickly become jammed with traffic and ATMs have been emptied of cash. Grocery stores, too, are reportedly being rapidly cleared of products.

Others have taken shelter in subway stations, hoping they will serve as improvised bomb shelters.

""I heard noise and woke up. I realized it sounded like artillery,"" one Kyiv resident recounted to reporters. He jumped from the couch and ran to wake his mother as another explosion went off behind him.

"Ukrainian president slams Trump impeachment as a 'soap opera,' undermines key Dem argument","Americans are not the only ones who were exhausted by the Democratic Party-led impeachment of President Donald Trump.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was a key subject of the controversy related to Trump's dealings with his country, says he is ready to turn the page on the scandal and even compared it to a 'soap opera.'

According to the AFP, Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday: ""After the whole impeachment soap opera, I want to go (to Washington) and start a blank page on our relations.""

It's like 'Dallas' and 'Santa Barbara'

The Ukrainian president echoed the television series comparison in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The Federalist's David Marcus reported Zelensky even compared the impeachment process to the hit 1980s soap operas ""Santa Barbara"" and ""Dallas,"" which were known for their dramatic style.

According to Marcus, during his CNN interview Zelensky severely undermined key arguments by Democrats in their impeachment efforts against Trump. For instance, by stating that he looks forward to meeting soon with Trump, Zelensky throws ""cold water"" on the suggestion that he was being extorted or unduly pressured in his July 25 phone call with the American commander in chief.

""I'm ready to host him before he hosts me,"" he told the audience in Munich, which drew applause from attendees.

Making progress on corruption

The Ukrainian leader also pushed back against the notion that his country is corrupt. However, he did acknowledge that his country had suffered from corruption under previous governments. Zelensky also said that his administration is making a concerted effort to fight for transparency.

Government malfeasance was at the center of the impeachment controversy focused on Trump asking Zelensky to address corruption in order to qualify for foreign assistance. Democrats allege that the U.S. had no legitimate interest in cracking down on foreign corruption in the eastern European and that Trump was merely pressuring the Ukrainians to launch a bogus investigation into Burisma, an energy company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board.

However, several key witnesses during House impeachment hearings testified that the U.S. had a long-standing policy of demanding that foreign governments, including Ukraine, clean-up their internal affairs before releasing foreign aid. Moreover, no investigation into Biden or Burisma was announced by Ukrainian officials and the country received its foreign aid funds.

On Feb. 5, 2020, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on two articles of impeachment related to the controversy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine_president_slams_impeachment_soap,2020-02-16
"Ukrainian beauty queen posts pic in fighting gear, warns Russian 'invaders will die'","Former Miss Grand Ukraine Anastasia Lenna has taken to social media to voice strong opposition to the Russian invasion of her home country.

Lenna, a beauty queen and Ukraine’s 2015 representative in the Miss Grand International beauty contest, posted multiple photos and videos on her Instagram account in recent days condemning the unprovoked attack and warning that Russian invaders will face fierce resistance from the Ukrainian people.

In one post, Lenna is seen wearing what appears to be fighting gear. In another post, this one a reel, she is seen practicing her aim with a rifle at a shooting range.

In the caption, she wrote, ""The invaders will die on our Ukrainian lands! Wait and see!"" adding, ""Please, share more information about this situation! Support Ukraine! Stop Russian aggression! You can help us!""

According to the New York Post, Lenna shared a message on her Instagram story over the weekend that said, ""Everyone who crosses the Ukrainian border with the intent to invade will be killed!""

The post, written in English, was reportedly accompanied by a photo of armed soldiers blocking a roadway.

In a subsequent post, she allegedly quipped, ""Our army is fighting in such a way that NATO should apply for entry into Ukraine.""

Multipleoutletsreported that Lenna had in fact joined the Ukrainian military to offer armed resistance against the Russian assault; however, that has not yet been confirmed.

Lenna, who is an avid airsoft player, shared another post on her Instagram on Monday, saying, ""I am not [sic] a military, just a woman, just normal human. Just a person, like all people of my country.""

""All pictures in my profile to inspire people,"" she continued. ""I had a normal life just on Wednesday, like millions [of] people. I don’t do any propaganda except showing that our women of Ukraine — strong, confident, and powerful.""



""I appreciate all attention and support to my country, all people in Ukraine we fight every day against Russian aggression,"" she added. ""We will win!""

Lenna's messages come as many Ukrainian civilians and notable figures — including current Ukrainian President Volodomor Zelenskyy, former President Petro Poroshenko, and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko — have joined the fight against Russia.

Since the start of the invasion, the government has urged male residents aged 18 to 60 to take up arms in defense of their country and offered weapons to anyone who would join the fight. Countless have responded to the call.

Despite being under-armed and outmanned, Ukrainian fighters have thus far been able to hold off Russian forces from reaching the capital and overthrowing the government — as they reportedly planned to do.

Now, the two sides are expected to hold peace talks ""without preconditions"" on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River, in the coming days.

11 year old Ukrainian boy Hassan Pisetskaya escapes war,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, there have been more than 2.3 million refugees who fled the war-torn country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. One of the most astonishing Ukrainian refugees is an 11-year-old boy who escaped the nation by traveling over 600 miles to neighboring Slovakia.

Last Friday, Russian forces seized the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia – which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. During the Russian capture of the nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine, a fire broke out near one of the station's six reactors.

With war waging in Ukraine, Yulia Pisetskaya wanted to get her 11-year-old son to safety. However, Pisetskaya's mother is sick and is unable to move on her own, according to a video posted on Facebook. In an effort to get her son out of harm's way, Pisetskaya put her 11-year-old son Hassan on a train in Zaporizhzhia.

Pisetskaya – who is a widow – wrote the phone number of relatives who live in Slovakia on his hand. The young boy had his passport and a small red backpack.

The boy traveled by himself for approximately 620 miles by train to the Slovakian border.

Once he arrived at the border of Slovakia, kind volunteers provided Hassan with food and drink. Border officials were able to contact Hassan's relatives living in the Slovak capital Bratislava and reunite him.

Yulia Pisetskaya thanked everyone who assisted in her son's safe arrival in Slovakia, ""I am grateful you have saved my child’s life.""

""In your small country, there are people with big hearts ... Please save our Ukrainian children and give them a safe haven,"" the mother said, CBS News reported.

According to a Facebook post from the Slovak Embassy in the U.K., a Slovak interior ministry representative said of Hassan, ""He conquered everyone with his smile, fearlessness, and determination of a real hero.""

Roman Mikulec – Slovakia's interior minister – penned a touching tribute to the triumphant boy.

""Little Hassan is only 11 years old, but in his way he has shown huge determination, courage, and fearlessness that sometimes adults don't have,"" Mikulec wrote on Facebook. ""I am really very sorry for him and all the other children and their families who have to flee their country because of what is happening in Ukraine.""

Mikulec proclaimed that people in Slovakia are ""ready to help"" the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.

""You will find security with us and if you ask for temporary protection, you will be provided with health care, social security, food, accommodation, education, and job opportunities,"" he said on social media.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-boy-escapes-russia-war,2022-03-10
"Ukrainian brewery joins war effort, switches to manufacturing Molotov cocktails: 'Putin is a d**khead'","A Ukrainian brewery has joined the war effort and has replaced the act of brewing its craft beer with manufacturing Molotov cocktails in an effort to stem the tide of Russian forces.

What are the details?

Pravda brewery in Lviv has begun manufacturing the makeshift bombs in anticipation of the possibility that Russian tanks will begin to roll into the city, according to reports.

Pravda brewery owner Yuriy Zastavny said that he would fight tooth and nail to ensure Ukraine's victory over Russian invaders.

""We do this because someone has to,"" he reasoned. ""We have the skills, we went through a street revolution in 2014. We had to make and use Molotov cocktails then.""

Zastavny vowed that he would do everything possible to help win the war.

""I have absolutely no doubt that we'll win,"" he told Fox News on Monday. ""We are already winning because we already disrupt[ed] the plans of the crazy dictator. And we will continue to do it, because they are not facing only the Ukrainian Army, but they are facing the army of 40 million people prepared to fight every step.""

He added that his employees gave him the idea to switch over to the manufacturing of firebombs.

""Once we understand what can come through beer -- because it’s no time for beer, we need to get other things sorted out – we decided to make Molotov cocktails because we can use bottles, we can use the people, and it was a grassroots idea.""

What else?

One employee described the perfect way to craft the cocktail, telling Agence France-Presse that in order to build a successful homemade firebomb, ""you have to wait for the cloth to be well soaked.""

""When it is, that means the Molotov cocktail is ready,"" the employee told the news agency as he stuffed a rag into the beer bottle, which was filled with oil and gasoline.

AFP reported that one of the brewery's favorite beers is called ""Putin khuylo"" — reportedly translated to ""Putin is a dickhead.""

According to reports, military instructors have also been teaching local civilians how to launch the bombs against Russian troops.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-brewery-joins-war-effort-switches-to-manufacturing-molotov-cocktails,2022-03-01
Ukrainian forces reclaim the region containing Kyiv as Russian forces withdraw and regroup,"As of Saturday, the Ukrainian military has taken the entirety of the region containing the country’s capital city of Kyiv.

In a statement shared on Facebook, Hanna Maliar, the Ukrainian defense minister, said, “Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel, and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader.”

The Daily Mail reported that the towns of Irpin and Bucha — from which people would previously commute to and from Kyiv — were reclaimed by Ukrainian forces earlier this week. Both towns have reportedly suffered high civilian death tolls and experienced large-scale destruction.

The mayor of Bucha said that 280 people had been buried in a mass grave while corpses littered the city’s streets, while at least 200 people have been killed in Irpin — which is often considered a suburb of Kyiv.

There was also heavy fighting in Gostomel as both Russian and Ukrainian forces sought to gain control of the region’s airfield.

Ukrainian officials have said that Russia’s current process of withdrawing from the northern parts of Ukraine is strategic so that the Russian military can refocus its forces on the country’s eastern and southern regions.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to congratulate Ukraine’s “brave armed forces” for successfully pushing back the invading Russian army.

Ukraine’s apparent victory at retaking Kyiv comes as broken-down Russian artillery litter the highways that connect the city to the rest of the country.

The Daily Mail said, “As Ukrainian units advance, they’re met with burned-out tanks and heavily-armored personnel transport vehicles that line the roads once populated by commuters that would have been heading in or out of the capital.”

Despite the off-putting nature of abundant worn-down and broken machinery, the Ukrainian military apparently continues to discover gruesome relics of war, potentially indicating that the Russians continued to commit war crimes as they withdrew from Kyiv.

Reportedly, Ukrainian troops found the bodies of 20 men dressed in civilian clothing on a single street. Eyewitnesses said that one of the corpses had his hands tied.

The dead bodies were strewn across roads of residential areas and suburban towns.

Zelenskkyy warned that the withdrawing Russian forces were leaving behind “catastrophic” situations by placing land mines outside of residential areas, abandoning their broken-down equipment, and the “bodies of those killed.”

The Ukrainian forces were also successful in retaking control of the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant.

The Russian invasion has reportedly displaced 4 million Ukrainian refugees.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-forces-reclaim-the-region-containing-kyiv-as-russian-forces-withdraw-and-regroup,2022-04-03
Ukrainian foreign minister smacks down suggestion that Russian incursion is 'minor': 'Invasion is an invasion',"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba rebuffed any attempt to soften language of Russia's invasion into eastern Ukrainian provinces.

What is the background?

After Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk — two provinces in eastern Ukraine — and ordered Russian ""peacekeeping"" troops into those regions, the Biden administration initially refused to describe the incursion as an ""invasion.""

According to the Washington Post, the Biden administration on Monday wrestled over whether Russian troops entering Ukrainian provinces constituted an ""invasion."" One administration official even reportedly said the development was not an ""invasion"" because the territories have been disputed and not without some Russian troops, at least in part, since 2014.

President Joe Biden later described Russia's actions as an ""invasion"" worthy of the swift response he promised last month, which meant imposing harsh economic sanctions meant to deter Putin from further action.

What did Kuleba say?

During a joint press conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Ukrainian foreign minister made it clear that Russia's actions could only be described as an ""invasion.""

Kuleba's remarks came in response to a question from Fox News reporter Ben Hall, who observed that ""there is a suggestion that what we’ve seen so far is a minor invasion,"" a reference to the Biden administration's initially soft response and potentially Biden's reference last month to a ""minor incursion.""

""First, there is no such thing as minor, middle, or major invasion. Invasion is an invasion,"" Kuleba said.

LIVE: Secretary of State Blinken, Ukraine Foreign Minister Kuleba hold a press conference youtu.be

Kuleba then addressed sanctions the Biden administration enacted on Donetsk and Luhansk, criticizing the move, considering that Kyiv says each region remains part of Ukraine.

""I can say frankly that yesterday (Monday), when we learned about the first executive order to impose sanctions on — related to economic activities with Donetsk and Luhansk — we were puzzled, because we saw how the side that sought recognition from Russia is being punished, but we didn’t see how Russia, who granted its recognition, is punished,"" Kuleba said.

However, Kuleba also praised Biden for action taken on Tuesday with new sanctions against Russia. Kuleba said that Ukraine hopes Biden issues more sanctions as Russia aggression continues.

""We do appreciate today’s — the sanctions which were announced today. They target Russia. They’re very specific. They are painful,"" Kuleba said. ""And this strategy of imposing sanctions by waves, if I may put it this way, is something that can work if it continues in a sustainable way.""

"Ukrainian GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz passionately condemns Putin's 'genocide,' calls on Biden to 'get his act together and exercise some leadership'","Indiana Republican lawmaker Victoria Spartz, who was born in Ukraine and emigrated to the United States, gave an impassioned plea for more action from the United States government to stop the ""genocide"" of the Ukrainian people at the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invading troops.

""This is not a war. This is a genocide of the Ukrainian people by a crazy man who cannot get over that Ukrainian people do not want socialism, Soviet Union, communism,"" Spartz said Tuesday at the House Republican leadership press conference. She wore the colors of Ukraine's flag to stand in solidarity with the people there, who have been attacked by Russia without provocation. ""They want to be with the United States of America. They want to be free people, they want to be with the West,"" she said.



Spartz shared a personal story about her Russian-born grandmother, who is 95 and is currently living in Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine. The city has been hit by heavy shelling from Russian artillery, and the most recent news is that Belarusian forces have crossed the border and joined the siege.

""They are bombing civilians non-stop, day and night. The whole city,"" Spartz said, becoming emotional as she related what she's heard from her grandmother, who spoke with another relative living in a small village outside Chernihiv.

""Her daughter told her [the Russians] came into [the] village with heavy machine guns [and] killed almost every person in that village. And whatever people were left, women and children, they forced them to walk in front of the tanks as a human shield because they cannot take that city,"" the congresswoman told reporters, fighting tears.



She shared words from her grandmother, who said: ""No, don't cry. We are not crying here. We're going to fight, but just give us some guns so we don't just fight with sticks.""

The lawmaker told other stories of how Russian troops are allegedly shooting women and children and committing war crimes, including using illegal thermobaric weapons. Reports indicate that Russia has used ""vacuum bombs,"" also known as fuel-air explosives, which use one explosive charge to spread fuel in a cloud that sucks up oxygen and flows around objects. A second charge then detonates the cloud, causing a massive explosion that is particularly destructive inside closed spaces like buildings or foxholes.

""They are leveling the cities to the ground! Destroying the people, slaughtering them like animals. They are killing people — it is not a war, it's a genocide because we have a crazy man that believes he has the whole world hostage,"" Spartz said, speaking with righteous indignation.

She criticized President Joe Biden for not doing enough to support Ukraine, emphasizing that America is not being asked to go fight, but the Ukraine is asking for more help with defense and for ""serious"" sanctions.

The United States, European Union, and other allied nations have imposed severe economic sanctions against Russian financial institutions and government personnel, including Putin himself. Western governments have also pledged to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, a messaging service that connects financial institutions around the world, as punishment for Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

But Republicans have criticized Biden for not going further and sanctioning Russia's energy sector. While White House press secretary Jen Psaki told Fox News on Tuesday that energy sanctions are not ""off the table,"" she said the president is focused on ""minimizing the impact on the global markets and the American people.""

Economic sanctions on Russia's energy industry, while extremely punitive, would cause energy prices in countries that import oil from Russia to increase sharply, including in the U.S.

But for Spartz and others opposed to Russia's aggression, the sacrifice may be worth it to stop the war.



""I can tell you one thing. If we don't stop [Putin] there, he is not going to stop. He is going to go further. And then we'll have to send our children to die to fight this. So I think we have an obligation and duty to save this world, help Ukrainian people to survive,"" Spartz said.



""And this president needs to get his act together and exercise some leadership. What's happening under his watch is [an] atrocity. What he's doing to this country and to the world is unforgivable, but I think we'll get together as Republicans and Democrats, but act decisively fast or this blood of many millions of Ukrainans will be on his hands too,"" she warned.

"Ukrainian government official shreds Biden, Democrats: 'If Democrats weren’t such p***ies in foreign policy, this might not have happened'","An anonymous Ukrainian official hit out at President Joe Biden and U.S. Democrats, the Daily Wire reported Saturday, saying that if the Democrats ""weren't such pussies,"" the Russian invasion might never have happened.

What are the details?



The official told the outlet that the war-torn country is in dire need of assistance and said that ""[i]f Democrats weren't such pussies in foreign policy, this might not have happened.""

“The Obama-Biden administration has refused lethal aid to Ukraine for a long time,” the official told the Daily Wire under the condition of anonymity. “It was [former President Donald] Trump who was the first to provide some Javelins to Ukraine, then Biden started sending Javelins in mass just before invasion. But too little, too late.”

The official added that everything Biden has done thus far since being in office has been a day late and a dollar short.

“Biden’s first step in office was to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Now he applies them heavily. Now it’s too late,” the official added. “If Democrats did not play into the weak policy of not sending weapons to Ukraine and lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Putin would probably think twice or three times. Also, we never understood why would Biden say that no U.S. troops would be involved. Even if he did not intend to, why say it when no one asked? At least [he] could have speculated on the possibility to deter an attack.”

The Biden administration previously offered to evacuate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to which the fiery president said that he needed ammunition — not a ride.

The message appears to be much the same: The official added that the country is in dire need of ""rifles, bullets, Javelins, Stingers.""

""[Freezing] all Russian USD and EUR assets"" would also be helpful, the official pointed out.

What else?

The official added that Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly believed that his troops would be met with ""flowers"" in some cities across Ukraine.

“Putin actually believed that he would be greeted with flowers at least in some [cities],” he said. “Instead, in every single city they were met with bullets.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-government-official-shreds-biden-democrats,2022-02-28
'False flag': Ukrainian kindergarten hit by military shells as US officials warn Russian invasion is 'imminent',"A kindergarten was struck by artillery shells in a town on the Ukrainian government-controlled side of the front line in eastern Ukraine Thursday, wounding three adult civilians, the Ukrainian military said.

In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation accused ""Russian occupation troops"" of shelling the town of Stanytsia in the Luhansk region, referring to Russian-backed separatist troops that have been causing violence in the area for eight years. The separatists in turn accused the Ukrainian government of opening fire on the territory four times over the past 24 hours, according to Reuters.



A spokesman for the Kremlin did not comment directly on Ukraine's allegation, but said there is ""an ongoing exchange of strikes"" near the border between Ukraine and Russia and that ""the first strike came from the Ukrainian side,"" the New York Times reported.



The breach of a tenuous cease-fire agreement in the region was received by western leaders as a possible ""false flag"" operation by Russia to create a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine.

U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Thursday, ""the picture is continuing to be very grim.""

""A kindergarten was shelled in what we are taking to be, what we know was a false flag operation designed to discredit the Ukrainians, designed to create a pre-text, a spurious provocation for Russian action,"" Johnson said.

""We fear very much that that is a thing we will see more of over the next few days,"" he added.

American officials have likewise warned that ""evidence on the ground"" suggests a Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""imminent.""

""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" President Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""Every indication we have is they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.""

Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine and earlier this week claimed that troops deployed along the border had completed military exercises there and were returning to base.

But the United States and NATO allies have said there was no evidence to support Russia's claims. Satellite images reported by Axios show a military pontoon bridge has been established over the Pripyat River in Belarus, less than four miles from the Ukraine border. Moscow has actually increased troop presence on the border ""by as many as 7,000 troops,"" according to a senior administration official.



U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the reports of the shelling were ""troubling.""

“We’ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict. So we’ll be watching this very closely,” he said, speaking from Brussels.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba blamed Russia for a ""severe violation"" of the cease-fire agreement and President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a ""provocative shelling.""

Russia turned the accusations around and blamed Ukraine for a ""further escalation of tensions.""

“We have warned many times that excessive concentration of Ukrainian forces near the contact line, together with possible provocations, can pose terrible danger,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-kindergarten-hit-by-military-shells-us-officials-warn-russian-invasion-imminent,2022-02-17
Ukrainian lawmaker accuses Russian soldiers of raping a woman in front of her child,"A Ukrainian woman was raped by a Russian soldier in front of her child, according to a lawmaker who said Ukraine will ""not be silent"" about crimes committed during Russia's invasion of her country.



Member of Parliament Maria Mezentseva said in a TV interview that the alleged war crime took place in Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, the Guardian reported. She told the U.K.'s Sky News that the victim's husband was shot dead in his house before the alleged assault.

“There is one case which was very widely discussed recently because it’s been recorded and proceeded with [by] the prosecutor’s office, and we’re not going into details, but it’s quite a scary scene when a civilian was shot dead in his house in a small town next to Kyiv,"" Mezentseva said.

“His wife was – I’m sorry but I have to say it – raped several times in front of her underage child.”

According to the Guardian, the Russian soldier is believed to have threatened the child after the attack.

Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has confirmed the alleged attack was reported to authorities and said Wednesday that an arrest warrant has been issued for the soldier.

Mezentseva, who serves as the head of Ukraine's permanent delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said that war crimes committed during the invasion must be recorded. ""Justice has to prevail,"" she said.

She added that sexual assault cases were being underreported.

“There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general,” she said. “And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about that.

“That’s why you know, when we’ve been talking to Boris Johnson, when we will be talking to your Home Office, when we’ve been talking to MPs of UK, we’ve also raised this issue that this aftermath, which we are dealing with right now, the aftermath of war, has to be taken very cautiously, very seriously, and to take into account the UK experience and experience of other countries, which can help us in dealing with psychologists, and how to help these people to actually live over these cases, to keep going afterwards, to keep living.”

""We will definitely not be silent,"" she added.



There have been previous reports of sexual assaults committed by Russian soldiers, which is considered a war crime and violation of international humanitarian law.

Earlier in March, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleged there were ""numerous cases"" of Russian soldiers raping women in Ukraine. Another Ukrainian lawmaker, Lesia Vasylenko, said officials had reports of ""women being gang-raped,"" including ""senior citizens,"" and that ""most of these women have either been executed after the crime of rape or they have taken their own lives.""

While rape is common in times of war, sexual assaults are difficult to prove, and accusations of rape have been used as a powerful propaganda tool to rally opposition to the enemy.



The U.S. government determined last week that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, after a ""careful review"" of public and intelligence sources transmitting news from the war.

“We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities. Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-lawmaker-accuses-russian-soldiers-of-raping-a-woman-in-front-of-her-child,2022-03-28
Ukrainian leaders rule out a ceasefire and will not cede territory to Russia to end fighting,"Ukrainian leadership has ruled out the possibility of a ceasefire or granting any concessions of land or policy to Russia.

The decision not to grant either a ceasefire or concessions to end Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine came as Russian forces intensified their attack in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, and the Russian government decided to stop exports of gas to Finland, the New York Post reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, “The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult.” He made clear to his constituents that while the Russian army is trying to take the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk, Ukrainian forces will dig in and work to hold off the Russian advance.

Russian forces were able to outlast the weekslong resistance by Ukrainian fighters in the southeastern city of Mariupol. Whoever controls Mariupol has strategic access to crucial waterways.

With full control of Mariupol, Russia will also have command of land routes linking the Crimean Peninsula with mainland Russia and other areas of eastern Ukraine that are of interest to the Russian government.

Russian forces are now waging a major offensive in Luhansk in the Donbas region. Russian-backed separatists already controlled large swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighboring Donetsk. Reportedly, the Russian government wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-controlled territories in Donbas and forcibly annex the region.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, ruled out the possibility of Ukrainian officials agreeing to a ceasefire with Russia and said that the Ukrainian government would not accept any deal with Russia that involves the transfer of territory. Podolyak theorized that making any concessions to Russia would result in Russia renewing attacks on Ukraine shortly after the fighting breaks.

In a recent interview, Podolyak said, “The war will not stop (after concessions). It will just be put on pause for some time. They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.”

Podolyak’s statements contradict calls for a ceasefire made by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

Heightening tensions with Western nations, Russia’s state-owned gas company said it would be halting all gas exports to Finland in response to the Finns refusing to pay for Russian oil with rubles.

Ukrainian leadership says Russia has a 'multifaceted plan to destabilize' Ukraine,"Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is more likely to pursue a destabilization campaign than launch a large-scale invasion.

Oleksiy Danilov, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top national security adviser, said, “The No. 1 task for Russia is to undermine us from the inside.”

The Wall Street Journal reports that in a recent interview, Danilov said that a military invasion would be too costly for Russia, given the size of Ukraine’s army and the Ukrainian people’s will to fight. He also said that the West constantly pressuring Russia will cause the Russian leadership to pursue alternative forms of warfare instead of a conventional invasion.

Danilov believes that the Russians will pursue a series of intense cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and will apply economic pressure to foment discontent among the Ukrainian public. He said, “It will be very difficult for them to achieve their aims by military means. I think, impossible. They have a multifaceted plan to destabilize the domestic situation on the territory of our country. That’s the number one task for them.”

Russian leadership continues to deny that it has any plans to invade or cause harm to Ukraine. They argued that Western countries are ignoring their security concerns by working to integrate Russia’s neighboring countries into NATO and the European Union.

As NATO and the European Union continue to grow their ranks, Russia grows increasingly frustrated. Russian leadership perceives these growing coalitions as an explicit threat to their country’s sovereignty.

In early February, Putin said, “We didn’t see an adequate response to our key concerns.”

In 2014, Russia invaded parts of Ukraine and, according to the Wall Street Journal, has “employed a variety of tactics to try and sap the country’s resources and will to fight.”

Russia’s destabilization efforts in Ukraine over the past years have had mixed results. The Kremlin is in communication with and supports Russian nationalist, Ukrainian separatists in the eastern regions of Ukraine. It uses these proxies to disrupt the daily operations of the Ukrainian military and cause chaos in the daily lives of the region’s inhabitants.

It is theorized that Russia is sponsoring the separatists so that the country has pretext to send its military further into Ukraine. This strategy is similar to Russia’s antagonism of Georgia prior to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

Despite Ukrainian leadership’s skepticism about Russia’s intentions for outright war, Western nations are reducing their presence and encouraging citizens to leave Ukraine.

Ukrainian MP: Joe Biden got nearly $1M from Burisma for lobbying,"A Ukrainian member of Parliament said former Vice President Joe Biden received $900,000 from Burisma for lobbying activities and called for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate further, according to Ukrainian news agency Interfax.

Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach said he has documentation to back up his claim, which he said he will post on his Facebook page.

""This was the transfer of Burisma Group's funds for lobbying activities, as investigators believe, personally to Joe Biden through a lobbying company,"" Derkach said. ""Funds in the amount of $900,000 were transferred to the U.S.-based company Rosemont Seneca Partners, which according to open sources, in particular, the New York Times, is affiliated with Biden. The payment reference was payment for consultative services.""

Derkach also alleged that $16.5 million was paid by Burisma to a group of representatives that included Hunter Biden. He said Joe Biden used ""political and economic levelers of influencing Ukrainian authorities and manipulating the issue of providing financial aid to Ukraine"" to help Burisma by closing investigations into Burisma group's founder and owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.

According to Derkach, there is a clear link between a $1 billion loan guarantee signed between the U.S. and Ukraine, and the firing of prosecutor general Viktor Shokin two months before. Shokin was investigating Burisma before he was fired.

""Biden's fifth visit to Kyiv on December 7-8, 2015, was devoted to making a decision on the resignation of [then Ukrainian Prosecutor General] Viktor Shokin over the case of Zlochevsky and Burisma,"" Derkach said. ""Loan guarantees worth $1 billion that the United States was to give to Ukraine was the point of pressure. Biden himself admitted exerting pressure in his speech at the Council of Foreign Relations in January 2018, calling Shokin 'son of a bitch who was fired.'""

The Biden campaign did not immediately return a request by TheBlaze for comment on Derkach's allegations.

Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump, pointed to Derkach's allegations to support his own claims of the Bidens' corruption in Ukraine.

""This case stinks. They can run away from it all they want,"" Giuliani said on Fox News on Wednesday, also suggesting that there was corruption involving Biden with China and Romania.

Video: Huge fireball erupts after Russian tank-landing ship explodes; Ukrainian navy says vessel was 'destroyed',"A massive fireball erupted from a Russian Navy amphibious ship while it was docked in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk in southern Ukraine on Thursday. The Ukrainian navy asserted the tank-landing ship had been ""destroyed.""

Video shows a huge explosion and fire on the Project 1171 Alligator-class landing ship Orsk. A thick black plume of smoke billowed from the fiery ship and spread over the harbor.

БЕРДЯНСК: взрывы и пожар в порту 24 марта 2022 года www.youtube.com

""There have been claims made that the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an attack on the Orsk, potentially using one of their Tochka (SS-21 Scarab) short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), but there’s so far no evidence to confirm exactly what led to the inferno on the vessel,"" the Drive reported.



The Ukrainian navy claimed on Facebook, ""In the temporarily captured Russian port Berdyansk, a large paratrooper ship 'Orsk' of the Black Sea Fleet of occupiers was destroyed.""

Ukraine’s armed forces celebrated on social media by saying, ""The morning starts with good news! The large landing ship 'Orsk' of the Black Sea Fleet of the occupiers was destroyed in the captured Russian port of Berdyansk.""

""That’s only the beginning,” a Ukrainian military source told the Times.

The 370-foot ship can transport as many as 425 troops as well as 20 tanks or 40 armored vehicles and is beachable to unload vehicles on land.

Two Project 775 Ropucha-II class landing ships — Tsesar Kunikov and Novocherkassk — had burning debris on their decks, and the fires were quickly extinguished, according to military analyst H.I. Sutton.



""It marks the largest ship that Ukrainian forces have managed to strike so-far and represents another embarrassing loss for Vladimir Putin's beleaguered army,"" according to the Daily Mail.



A day before the strike, Russian state media was touting the ships supplying reinforcements at the captured port city on the Sea of Azov. The video shows armored personnel carriers being extracted from the Orsk.

""By land, air and now sea, Russian troops continue to advance and reinforce into Ukraine,"" RT reporter Murad Gazdiev said in the video. ""The Azov Sea, with its ports and towns, is now under Russian control...which has allowed Russia's Black Sea fleet to and the Orsk landing ship to stage this operation.""

Berdyansk was captured by Russian military forces on Feb. 27. The port city is roughly 50 miles southwest of the besieged city of Mariupol.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that approximately 100,000 people are enduring ""inhumane conditions"" in Mariupol.

""For more than a week now, we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror,"" Zelenskyy said during a televised address.

Zelenskyy said the people of Maiupol have ""no food, no water, no medicine.""

The local council in Mariupol said Russian airstrikes were turning the city into the ""ashes of a dead land.""

Drone footage released this week by Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs shows the devastation to Mariupol after weeks of heavy shelling by the Russian military. Russian bombardments from artillery, airstrikes, and naval vessels have turned the city into ruins.

Ukrainian officials believe Russia is planning a terrorist attack at Chernobyl,"Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is preparing to launch an attack at Chernobyl.

In a lengthy Facebook post, the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “stockpiling” the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers to justify a “false flag” attack on the power plant.

Business Insider reported that Ukrainian officials claim that Russian forces are using car refrigerators to collect the corpses of dead Ukrainian soldiers.

The Ukrainian officials warned that Russia is planning to stage a “man-made catastrophe” at the power plant and might use the dead Ukrainian soldiers as props. Ukrainian officials believe the Russian military will stage the corpses so that they appear to be “killed saboteurs.”

Shortly after Russian forces began the invasion of Ukraine, they seized control of the infamous Chernobyl power plant and 20 miles of surrounding land that serves as a buffer zone.

The facility continues to be operated by Ukrainian workers. The BBC reported that more than 100 Ukrainian citizens have been stuck living on-site since the Russian invasion.

Despite no longer functioning as nuclear power plant, the Chernobyl facilities still require constant management and employs a work force of more than 2,000 people including scientists, technicians, cooks, medics, and more.

The workers stuck on-site are forced to live in temporary dorms within the powerplant’s facilities and have refused deliveries of food from Russian personnel, believing it to be a propaganda stunt.

On Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it unexpectedly lost remote contact with the Chernobyl site. The IAEA’s announcement came one day after Russian forces damaged a power line connected to the facility.

Ukrainian officials warn that there is only a two-day supply of diesel fuel left on-site to power the Chernobyl facility’s emergency generators. They also said that Russian forces refuse to let the repairmen and engineers enter the facility.

The officials allege that the Russians are relying on “Belarusian specialists” and that the Russians are planning a terrorist attack while working undercover at the site.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has not provided evidence for these claims.

The allegations of a pending terrorist attack come as the United States sounded the alarm over the possibility of Russian forces using chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Last week, White House press secretary warned of a possible “false flag” attack by Russian forces. Psaki alleged that the Russians might use chemical or biological weapons in this attack.

She said that the proliferation of “disinformation” online might provide the Russian military a pretense for launching this attack.

Psaki said, “It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-officials-believe-russia-is-planning-a-terrorist-attack-at-chernobyl,2022-03-12
"Ukrainian plane carrying 176 crashes in Iran, killing all on board. Now Iran is reportedly refusing to hand over the black box.","A Ukraine International Airlines aircraft crashed on Wednesday morning in Iran, killing all 176 people on board.

The plane crashed just 10 minutes after taking off, appearing to burst into flames while in midair.

FlightRadar24 reported that the plane lost contact about two minutes after taking off.

What are the details?

The airliner, a Boeing 737-800 NG, was just three years old and had been recently tested. The last scheduled maintenance on the plane was just two days before the fateful flight, which left Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran and was bound for Kyiv, Ukraine.

The Ukrainian embassy in Tehran initially issued a statement dismissing the notion of terrorism, but deleted the statement. It later reissued a statement saying that the cause was unknown and the disaster was under investigation. Authorities have chalked the crash up to technical issues.

The region has experiencing a plethora of unrest over the last week, beginning with the U.S. airstrike on Gen. Qassem Soleimani, which ultimately resulted in Iran firing numerous missiles on military facilities housing U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq Tuesday night. However, authorities do not believe that the crash is related to the missile launches.

According to Reuters, Pirhossein Koulivand — head of Iran's emergency services — said that flames from the wreckage were ""so heavy"" that no rescue was possible. Rescue methods included 26 ambulances and a helicopter.

The New York Times reported that Qassem Biniaz at the Iranian Ministry of Roads and Urban Development said that one of the airliner's engines caught fire and that pilots lost control.

IRIB, the Iranian state broadcaster, said that one of the airliner's black boxes was discovered. Reuters also reported on Wednesday that Iran, however, is refusing to hand over the black box for investigation.

A spokesperson for Boeing issued a statement confirming the crash.

""We are aware of the media reports out of Iran and we are gathering more information,"" the statement said. ""This is a tragic event and our heartfelt thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families. We are in contact with our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time. We are ready to assist in any way needed.""

What was the Ukraine reaction?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's offered his ""sincere condolences to family and loved ones of all passengers and crew members.""

Ukraine International Airlines announced an indefinite suspension of flights to Tehran in the crash's wake.

""It was one of the best planes we had, with an amazing, reliable crew,"" Yevhen Dykhne, president of the Ukraine International Airlines, said during a news briefing on the incident.

NBC News reported that the majority of people on the airliner hailed from mainly areas in Iran and Canada.

The outlet reported that 82 people on board were Iranian, 63 were Canadian, and 11 people were Ukrainian, including the flight's nine crew members. Also, 10 people were from Sweden, four people were from Afghanistan, three people were from Germany, and three people were from the United Kingdom.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-plane-carrying-176-crashes-in-iran-killing-all-aboard,2020-01-08
"Ukrainian President Zelensky: We'll 'happily' look into potential 2016 election interference by Ukrainians, Democrats","Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky said during a ""marathon"" media session Thursday that he would ""happily"" investigate potential interference by Ukrainian and Democratic officials in the 2016 U.S. election, according to the Associated Press.

Zelensky said it benefits Ukraine to definitively answer the question of whether interference in the U.S. election came from Ukraine, and the only way he can say ""yes or no"" to whether it happened is to investigate.

President Donald Trump asked Zelensky to look into election interference and Joe and Hunter Biden's Ukrainian business dealings during a July 25 phone call with Zelensky that Democrats are attempting to use as grounds for impeachment.

Zelensky, however, denied any allegations that President Trump attempted to ""blackmail"" him to open investigations, saying he didn't even know that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of U.S. aid had been delayed until after he spoke with Trump on July 25.

Democrats have alleged that Trump withheld the aid as a way to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden, a potential 2020 election rival.

Zelensky told the AP he was simply hoping that the call with Trump would lead to a visit by Trump to Ukraine, and that he was hoping to persuade Trump to change the White House's rhetoric regarding Ukraine.

""I don't want to interfere in U.S. elections,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky said he does not intend to release the Ukrainian transcript of his phone call with President Trump. The White House released a non-verbatim transcript of the call last month, which, along with a related anonymous whistleblower complaint, sparked an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats.

Zelensky has made himself available literally all day to reporters, meeting with a different group of seven to 10 reporters every half hour Thursday. According to the Washington Post, 300 journalists have signed up for sessions. Questions are not screened in advance, and all participants are allowed to ask questions.

""I wanted to have an informal meeting,"" Zelensky said of the media marathon. ""I've never seen one like this.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-president-look-into-election-interference-by-ukrainians-democrats,2019-10-10
Ukrainian president on Trump phone call: ‘Nobody pushed me’,"Amid the ongoing firestorm of Washington, D.C.'s latest impeachment drama, the president of Ukraine says that he hasn't felt pressured by U.S. President Donald Trump to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

At an appearance with President Trump in New York on Wednesday, President Zelensky was asked by a reporter whether or not he felt any pressure from Trump to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.



Zelensky responded, ""I think you read everything,"" referring to the recently released transcript of a July phone conversation between the two world leaders during which the two discussed the Biden issue.

""I'm sorry but I don't want to be involved to Democratic open elections of [the] USA,"" the Ukrainian leader said. ""We had, I think, [a] good phone call. It was normal; we spoke about many things. And you read it that nobody pushed me.""



""In other words, no pressure,"" President Trump added.

Hunter Biden's past relationship with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma — which employed him as a board member — is at the center of a recent media firestorm over a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump reportedly urged Zelensky to look into a probe of the company and Hunter Biden.

At a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations event, Biden said that he — while still vice president — pressured then-Ukranain president Petro Poroshenko to fire then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was leading an investigation into the company by threatening to withhold $1billion in U.S. loan guarantees.

Shokin was fired, though Shokin's replacement told The Hill earlier this year that some evidence in the Burisma case might interest U.S. authorities and that he would like to present that information to U.S. Attorney General William Barr.

During their July phone call, according to the transcript released Wednesday, President Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Biden/Burisma matter, but did not at any point say that there would be any kind of quid pro quo for doing so. Zelensky responded that he was already planning on putting a prosecutor on the case and told Trump ""if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation.""

Before the White House even released the transcripts, however, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced an ""official impeachment inquiry"" in response to the matter and said that Trump's actions ""have seriously violated the Constitution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-president-on-trump-phone-call-nobody-pushed-me,2019-09-25
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy seeks to meet with Putin to reach a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing crisis,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin so that they may find a resolution to the ongoing crisis and violence along their shared border, the Associated Press reported.

“I don’t know what the president of the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting,” Zelenskyy said during the Munich Security Conference.

Zelenskyy affirmed that he is dedicated to finding a diplomatic solution to dissolve tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

He said, “Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

Zelenskyy made these statements just hours after separatist leaders in the eastern regions of Ukraine initiated a full military mobilization. Subsequently, leaders of Western nations emphasized to Russia that there would be “dire warnings” should they proceed with invading Ukraine.

Fearing for the safety of their citizens, Germany and Austria ordered their citizens to evacuate Ukraine and the German airline Lufthansa ceased to provide service to Kyiv and Odessa – both cities are at risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion.

The New York Times reported that despite not launching an invasion, Russian forces continue to launch shells into towns in eastern Ukraine. Residents of this area have subsequently fled.

Separatists in Ukraine’s eastern region asserted that Ukrainian leadership has been planning a large-scale offensive against them and their Russian allies.

The notion of a Ukrainian offensive has largely been dismissed by Western leaders as counterintuitive considering that Russian forces are currently surrounding the country.

At the Munich Security Conference, where Zelenskyy reaffirmed his dedication to diplomacy, Western leaders displayed a united front and repeated their calls for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.

Vice President Kamala Harris referred to the ongoing crisis as “a defining moment” for European security and the defense of democratic values.

Harris warned that if Russia were to invade Ukraine the United States and its allies would restrict Russia’s access to financial institutions, limit technology exports to the country, and target “those who are complicit and those who aid and direct this unprovoked invasion.”

She said, “Russia continues to claim it is ready for talks while at the same time it narrows the avenues for diplomacy. Their actions simply do not match their words.”

Despite many of the parties invested in the ongoing crisis insisting that diplomacy is the only way forward, the New York Times reported that President Joe Biden said that the United States has intelligence showing that Putin has made a final decision to reject diplomacy and invade Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-seeks-to-meet-with-putin-to-reach-a-diplomatic-resolution-to-the-ongoing-crisis,2022-02-19
Ukraine President Zelenskyy takes apparent shot at Biden over inaction in face of Russian aggression,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took an apparent shot at President Joe Biden on Saturday, telling members of Congress that inaction from the Biden administration in the face of Russian aggression enabled Russian President Vladimir Putin.

What are the details?

During a video conference attended by more than 280 members of the U.S. House and Senate, Zelenskyy claimed that Russia would not have invaded his country had the U.S. demonstrated its strength on the world stage.

""If you had started sanctions months ago, there would not have been war,"" Zelenskyy said.

Just days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the Biden administration defended its decision not to enact sanctions on Moscow despite clear warning signs of an impending invasion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed at the time that enacting sanctions would essentially mean the U.S. government was surrendering its leverage over Russia because sanctions are meant ""to try to deter Russia from going to war."" Obviously, withholding sanctions failed.

Still, in his call with American lawmakers, Zelenskyy urged the U.S. government to issue increasingly harsh sanctions against Moscow, including a ban on Russian oil, and pleaded the U.S. to help Ukraine secure more fighter jets for its air force.

""He said repeatedly that an embargo on Russia and particularly their oil and natural gas, was absolutely critical,"" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) later told Fox News.

According to the Washington Post, Zelenskyy stopped short of calling for an outright no-fly zone, but repeatedly said that victory for Ukraine would mean winning the air war.

""Ukraine needs airpower urgently and America should send it. Zelensky’s message is simple: ‘close the skies or give us planes,'"" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement after the call.

How is the US responding?

The Biden administration has thus far refused to ban imports of Russian oil, citing domestic energy needs and skyrocketing gas prices.

However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support cutting off Russian oil. ""Ban it,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week, while Sen. Dick Durban, the No. 2 Senate Democrat said, ""It just infuriates me to think that we are dependent on Russian gas and oil.""

Blinken finally said on Sunday the Biden administration is considering banning Russian oil, just one day after Axios reported that Biden officials had pressured Senate Democrats not to support bipartisan legislation that would ban imports of Russian oil.

Meanwhile, Blinken revealed Sunday NATO has received the ""green light"" to send more fighter jets to Ukraine, but a no-fly zone remains out of the question over fears it would further escalate the war.

Putin has said that imposing a no-fly zone would be viewed by Moscow as participation in the war.

Ukrainian officials 'stunned' by Biden's weak response on Russia: He just gave Putin the 'green light to enter Ukraine at his pleasure',"President Joe Biden raised alarm bells in Ukraine Wednesday after he appeared to downplay a potential ""minor incursion"" by Russia in the coming days or weeks, sowing doubts as to whether the U.S. and NATO allies will respond with force if Russia were to invade the neighboring country.

""I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades, and it depends on what it does, it's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" Biden told reporters during a long, rambling East Room news conference.

""But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine,"" he added, though his passive words didn't inspire confidence.

Later in the news conference, the president strangely predicted that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will move in"" because ""he has to do something.""

Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine over the last several weeks but has repeatedly denied that it is planning to invade.

What was the reaction in Ukraine?

In response to Biden's remarks Wednesday, CNN senior intelligence correspondent Matthew Chance read directly from his prepared notes to relay that one Ukrainian official was ""shocked that President Biden would give a green light to Vladimir Putin in this way.""

That official reportedly added, “It gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,"" Chance told network anchor Jake Tapper.

According to Chance, another Ukrainian official remarked that Kyiv, referring to Ukraine's government, ""is stunned at what President Biden had to say.""

What else?

The two anonymous officials were soon joined in their rebuke of Biden by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

In a tweet Thursday morning, Zelensky said, ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.""

USA Today called the statement a ""remarkable retort from a close U.S. ally that has received millions of dollars in military assistance.""

Kuleba similarly admonished Biden in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, arguing that the president's half-hearted warning leaves open a window for Putin.

“Speaking of minor and full incursions or full invasion, you cannot be half-aggressive. You’re either aggressive or you’re not aggressive,” Kuleba said. “We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This aggression was there since 2014. This is the fact.”

Anything else?

The White House quickly tried to clean up the mess in a subsequent clarification of Biden's remarks.

""If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our allies,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Wednesday evening.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-response-biden-green-light-putin,2022-01-20
Ukrainian sailor partially sinks yacht owned by Russian oligarch boss before returning to Ukraine to fight for his country,"A Ukrainian sailor on the Spanish island of Majorca was arrested over the weekend after he tried to sink his Russian boss' yacht to carry out revenge against the Kremlin — now he plans to return to Ukraine to fight for his country.

What are the details?

Taras Ostapchuk, 55, allegedly caused severe damage to the oligarch's $7.7 million luxury vessel on Saturday by opening up its valves causing it to partially sink, according to local Spanish outlet Ultima Hora and English language newspaper the Majorca Daily Bulletin.

The 156-foot yacht, called Lady Anastasia, is reportedly owned by Alexander Mijeev, a Russian arms dealer who formerly led the Russian Helicopter Corporation before taking over Rostec, a Russian state-owned weapons supplier.

To carry out his revenge plan, Ostapchuk opened a large valve in the engine room and a second in another compartment where the crew resides before instructing three other crew members, all of who are Ukrainians, to abandon the ship.

When police arrived, the defiant sailor reportedly told them: ""My boss is a criminal who sells weapons that kill the Ukrainian people.""

The unrepentant mechanical engineer later told a judge, ""I don't regret anything I've done and I would do it again.""

Ostapchuk reportedly decided to sink the ship after watching a video of Russian forces attacking an apartment building in Ukraine, killing or injuring civilians, and that he only intended to inflict material damage.



He recalled that he lived ""in a very similar building"" as the one Russian forces targeted. ""From my window I see the parliament of Ukraine. I wondered what would happen to my house, because it is located in a similar position.""

What else?

Incensed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, Ostapchuk now plans to return to Ukraine to defend his homeland.

In an interview following his release, the engineer told Ultima Hora, ""As soon as I reach the first city in Ukraine, I will find a military commander and ask him if they need me.""

""I said to myself: Why do I need a job if I don't have my country?"" he continued. ""Yes, it's true, I had a good job as chief mechanic on the ship and a good salary, but I'm going to fight for my country. I've lost my job, but that's not a problem. I will not lose my country.""

Reflecting on his partially failed attempt to sink the Lady Anastasia, he said, ""I lost the first battle, which was to sink the Russian chief's ship, but I will win the next one.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-sailor-partially-sinks-russian-yacht,2022-02-28
Cheerful Ukrainian soldier's video message to Russians goes viral: 'We'll soon start kicking your ass',"A cheerful message from a Ukrainian soldier to Russian soldiers went viral as the invasion force came closer to attacking the capital city of Kyiv.

The unidentified soldier smiles and laughs as he casually threatens the Russians invading his country on the order of President Vladimir Putin.

""I'll record this in Russian to make it be f***ing clearer,"" says the soldier to the camera.

""Well guys, what's up? What, is the Ukrainian night quiet? As the great Ukrainian writer Gogol said? Is everything good with you kids? Do you like our Bayraktars?"" he said, referring to an unmanned aerial vehicle made by Turkey.

The video was widely circulated online in the original language:

""What do you think — what's flying above you right now? What do you think — what is rustling in the bushes, my guys? What thoughts do you have about that?"" he said, smiling.

""What the f*** could it be? Dudes, you are f***ed!"" he added.

""You've stopped for now. We're fine. We're pulling up our reserves. We have aviation and we have tanks! We've got everything! Your ass is ours, fellows!"" he continues.

""How about this... why don't you f***ing surrender while you still have that chance? Many of yours have already chosen that path, it's not that bad, really,"" says the soldier.

""It may be a mistake, but we treat prisoners of war fairly well. So you are stuck right now, and soon we'll start kicking your ass! And we'll start doing it right now!"" he says.

""Therefore, use your last chance!"" the soldier concludes.

The video was edited with subtitles translated into English, but with the expletives uncensored. The untranslated video garnered more than 350,000 views, while the subtitled video pulled in more than a million views in a few hours.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that it was likely Russian forces would try to take the capital city of Kyiv Saturday morning. The U.S. State Dept. said he was offered assistance to leave the country, but he refused.

"'F*** you, b***h': Ukrainian UFC fighter has pointed message for Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime for invading her country","A Ukrainian UFC fighter who has family facing down tanks and missiles amid Russia's invasion of her home country gave Vladimir Putin a pointed piece of her mind in an interview with TMZ Sports.

""F*** you, bitch,"" Maryna Moroz said when asked what she'd like to say to the Russian president and his regime. ""I love my country. Don't touch Ukraine.""

What are the details?

Moroz, 30, is scheduled to fight Mariya Agapova — an MMA fighter from Kazakhstan — Saturday night at UFC 272, TMZ Sports said.

While the event is to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, understandably much of Moroz's heart and mind is focused on what's happening in her home country.

""It's hard time for Ukraine,"" she said, adding, ""I want to support my country, my president, whole army in Ukraine, and I want to say we don't want war. ... I worry about my family right now in Ukraine.""

Moroz was born in Vilnohirsk, Ukraine, in September 1991, which TMZ Sports said is about the same time Ukraine gained its independence amid the collapse of the Soviet Union.

And with Ukraine's autonomy now threatened, Moroz is deeply concerned.

""Many people die right now,"" she said, lamenting the increasingly ""dangerous"" situation in Ukraine.

In fact, she said her father has been making homemade grenades for protection and to fight back against advancing Russian forces.

Moroz added to TMZ Sports that she tries to call home ""every couple of hours"" but that it's difficult to stay in touch.

What this fight means to her

Despite the hardships in Ukraine, Moroz also has a job to do Saturday — and that's to beat Agapova.

In a way, she knows she'll be fighting for her country.

'Nothing has changed': Ukrainian official says Russia has not withdrawn troops from border after talks with Biden,"There has been no change in the Russian buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine since U.S. President Joe Biden's much-hyped video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Ukrainian security official said Wednesday.

According to Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's Security and Defence Council, there are still 92,000 Russian troops at the border, but there's no indication that Russia has imminent plans to invade.

Danilov told Reuters in an interview that the Ukrainian government is still concerned about the military build-up and that there has been no big change since the Dec. 7 meeting between the U.S. and Russia, when Biden threatened severe retaliatory economic sanctions should Putin choose to start a war.

""Nothing has changed,"" Danilov said. ""There has been some [increase in troop numbers] but not critical enough for us to say: this is it, it [an invasion] is going to happen now.""

He estimated that Russia would need at least 500,000-600,000 soldiers at the border ""in order to keep the situation under control in the event of an offensive.""

Danilov also said that Russia could deploy additional troops very quickly at any time, but would need more than 24 hours to bring those troops to the border to mount an invasion.

In the event of war, Ukraine hopes that its Western allies, including the United States, will keep it supplied with weapons, he said.

The world is watching Russia, which for months now has built up troops on its border with Ukraine in what the country says are ""military exercises."" News reports have shown Russian personnel and equipment including tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers deployed to the Pogonovo training area and Yelnya in Russia and Novoozernoye in Crimea.

A U.S. intelligence report from earlier this month claimed that Moscow is planning a multi-front offensive against Ukraine that could begin as early as next year and involve as many as 175,000 soldiers.

Russia previously annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine in 2014, though Moscow now denies having any intention of invading or seizing more territory, accusing the U.S. and Ukraine of engaging in destabilizing behavior.



Putin has demanded that the U.S. guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the NATO military alliance. He has also called on the U.S. and other Western countries to cease military activity near Russia's border. European Union leaders in turn have threatened more economic sanctions against Russia if it attempts military expansion into Ukraine.

The eastern region of Ukraine is mired in civil war, where pro-Russian separatists supported by Moscow are fighting the pro-western Ukrainian government. Danilov said the government has no intention of escalating the conflict by sending more troops to retake control of the region.

Danilov also said Ukraine must be a party to any discussion of its membership in NATO.

""We will not take orders from anyone, we will not tolerate any tsar, we are a different kind of people,"" he said.

""Is compromise possible? Yes, it is possible, but not at the expense of our independence and our country.""

Following their Dec. 7 video conference, Biden and Putin have agreed to hold more talks to discuss tensions with Ukraine and other issues. The Kremlin said there continue to be very serious differences between Russia and the United States over Moscow's ""red lines"" which it says the West must not cross.

Putin expressed interest in meeting with Biden in person, though the Russian government has not said when such a meeting could take place, Reuters reports.

UN General Assembly demands Israel surrender its nuclear weapons after 149-6 vote,"Only a handful of countries supported Israel's right to nuclear self-defense in a recent U.N. vote.

The U.N. General Assembly considered a resolution Wednesday calling for Israel not to develop, produce, test, or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons.

Additionally, the resolution called for the Jewish nation to ""renounce possession of nuclear weapons"" and to assent to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons treaty, thereby placing ""all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive International Atomic Energy safeguards.""

149 nations voted in favor of the resolution. Only six voted against it.

What are the details?

The U.N. general assembly demanded that Israel agree to ""accede to the [Middle Eastern nuclear non-proliferation] Treaty without further delay, and not to develop, produce, test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, to renounce their possession and to place all its unsafeguarded nuclear facilities under full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.""

Israel, India, Pakistan, and South Sudan have not signed the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons treaty.

Israel has never formally acknowledged possessing nukes. However, former President Jimmy Carter told MSNBC in 2014 that Israel has ""300 or more"" nuclear warheads, and leaked emails from former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell indicated the nation had at least 200 nukes in its arsenal.

The resolution calling for Israel's disarmament was advanced by Palestine and various other countries including Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the six nations that opposed the resolution were Canada, Israel, Micronesia, Palau, the U.S., and Liberia.



Ukraine, which voted with the Palestinians against Israel on another resolution in November, was among the 26 nations that abstained from the resolution.

The U.N. General Assembly similarly voted on Oct. 28 for Israel to dispose of its nuclear weapons. The result was 152-5 in favor of the resolution. The European Union abstained.

Fox News Digital reported that while the October resolution concerned the ""risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East,"" it focused on Israel and failed to mention Iran.

A report published by the Institute for Science and International Security on Dec. 5 indicated that Iran may have ""advanced its nuclear weapons readiness under civilian nuclear and military non-nuclear cover projects.""

Notwithstanding its apparent compliance with treaties such as those pushed by the U.N., Israel's rival ""threatens the world with a program ready to produce nuclear weapons 'on-demand.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/un-general-assembly-demands-israel-surrender-its-nuclear-weapons,2022-12-08
UN tells staff to avoid using terms 'war' and 'invasion' to describe Putin's war in Ukraine,"The words ""war"" and ""invasion"" are apparently too politically incorrect for the United Nations, which has instructed staff to avoid using those terms in reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Instead, the U.N. communications department would like staff to use terms such as ""conflict"" or ""military offensive"" to describe the nearly universally condemned war of aggression waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin against his country's smaller neighbor. Employees were also asked to refrain from describing the conflict as a war and from adding the Ukrainian flag to their personal or official social media accounts or websites.

“[USE] ‘conflict’ or ‘military offensive’ and NOT ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ when referring to the situation in Ukraine,” an email reported by the Irish Times stated. “Do NOT add the Ukrainian flag to personal or official social media accounts or websites.""



The instructions were given to avoid harming the international body's reputation by offending Russia, which has killed hundreds of Ukrainian civilians and forced 2 million people to flee the country.

“This is an important reminder that we, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the email stated. “There is a serious possibility of reputational risk that has been flagged by senior officials recently.”

Teachta Dala Neale Richmond, spokesman on European affairs for Ireland's Fine Gael party, blasted the ""illegal war of aggression"" and called on the U.N. to condemn Russia in a statement to the Irish Times.

“The fact is just because Russia is a big country that has an essential role in the UN, they’re influencing policy in a direction that’s simply false,” he said, referring to how Russia holds one of five permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.

""Quite clearly this is not just any war, but an illegal war of aggression, that should be condemned from a height by all members of the U.N. and the U.N. itself,"" he added.

Russian officials refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation,"" using Putin's preferred euphemism for the war. Putin's government has severely restricted what Russian media outlets are allowed to report about the war with a new law enacted Friday that could put journalists in prison for up to 15 years if they publish any stories the government considers ""fake.""

Thousands of Russian anti-war protesters have also been arrested, two local independent broadcasters were closed down, and international media websites have been blocked in the country.

Communist Chinese government flexes international 'clout' by defeating UN vote to debate China's genocide of the Uyghurs,"On Thursday, the United Nations' human rights council voted on an American-led motion to hold a debate about human rights abuses committed by communist China against Uyghurs in the nation's western region of Xinjiang. Of the council's 47 nation state members, 36 voted: 19 against and 17 for the motion. The result, said to be an ""abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims"" by Human Rights Watch's China director, Sophie Richardson, is regarded as a win for the communist regime.

The motion proposed debate regarding the findings of a 48-page U.N. rights office report published on August 31 that detailed potential ""crimes against humanity"" in Xinjiang. While the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and a number of other countries have already formally declared the Chinese communist party's (CCP) internment and ethnic cleansing of the country's Uyghur population a genocide, this debate would have invited greater international scrutiny.

The result of the vote also revealed China's growing international influence and leverage over third-world countries.



The vote

The following countries voted against the motion to debate whether the CCP's genocide constitutes a human rights concern: Bolivia; Cameroon; China; Cote d'Ivoire; Cuba; Eritrea; Gabon; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Mauritania; Namibia; Nepal; Pakistan; Qatar; Senegal; Sudan; United Aram Emirates; Uzbekistan; and Venezuela.



A number of countries abstained from voting, including Brazil, India, Mexico and Ukraine.

In addition to the European powers, a handful of countries supported the American motion including the Republic of Korea, Japan and Somalia.

The response

Though not surprised by the result, Olaf Wientzek of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation suggested that it damaged the credibility of the UN and ""shows China's diplomatic clout."" He emphasized that the motion did not propose a monitoring mechanism, but simply debate, but ""that was too much for many members.""

The U.K. ambassador in Geneva, Simon Manley, stated: ""China's attempts to stifle debate and hide the truth will not succeed.""

Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group said, ""It's a serious blow for the credibility of the council and a clear victory for China ... Many developing countries will see it as an adjustment away from Western predominance in the UN human rights system.""

Zhang Meifang, consul general of China in Belfast, tweeted ""Justice prevails!""

A spokesman for the communist Chinese regime's ministry of foreign affairs stated, ""The issues related to Xinjiang are not about human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism.""

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said, ""Today's vote protects the perpetrators of human rights violations rather than the victims — a dismaying result that puts the U.N.’s main human rights body in the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the U.N.’s own human rights office.""

The report

The topic for the precluded debate was the Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner's report. This report countered the CCP's claims that its suppression, internment, and murder of Uyghurs were justifiable as part of a broader ""counter-extremism"" strategy.

Among the report's recommendations, it suggested that a thorough investigation be undertaken into ""allegations of torture, sexual violence, ill-treatment, forced medical treatment, as well as forced labour and reports of deaths in custody.""

Uyghurs who have escaped China have detailed forced late-term abortions, routine tortures, and forced labor in China's re-education camps (called ""Vocational Education and Training Centers"" by the CCP) where an estimated 1 million people have been confined in recent years.

Xinjiang itself has reportedly been transformed into an open air prison camp.

Uyghur neighborhoods are surrounded by militarized checkpoints. Those who want to leave are retinal-scanned. Each neighborhood is assigned a ""grid monitor"" who surveils their activities and ensures against their adherence to religious customs.

According to Nury Turkel, the chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Uyghurs outside the camps are subjected to ""a barrage of scans, tests and examinations ... [including] retinal scans and fingerprints ... blood or hair samples ... for DNA profiling.""

The New York Post reported that they must also ""read from a set text for forty-five minutes so their voices could be recorded and identified,"" enabling spies to determine who was talking in tapped and taped communications.

Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote that Xinjiang, home to nearly 12 million Uyghurs, ""may be the most tightly controlled media environment on Earth, on part with North Korea.""

A 2020 report from the Washington-based Center for Global Policy indicated that under the pretenses of a ""poverty alleviation"" scheme, the CCP forces an estimated 570,000 Uyghurs to to pick cotton by hand for the CCP.

The UN high commissioner's report suggested that the CCP's actions may also ""constitute international crimes.""



Just as Christians who have fled China are hunted down internationally by the CCP, so too are Uyghurs. In fact, the recently exposed international network of communist Chinese police stations that operate in the U.S., Canada and Europe, reportedly help keep tabs on those who have escaped persecution in Xinjiang.

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" documenting these extralegal forward operating communist bases.

While touted as pseudo-embassies, the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law. Uyghurs who have fled China are regarded by the regime as lawbreakers.

In fact, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

According to a 2021 Freedom House report, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

International implications

All of the nations that voted against the motion have been pulled into China's sphere of international influence.

China, which has been materially supporting Russia during its war on Ukraine, has expanded this influence, in part, through its Belt and Road Initiative. Through its BRI, the CCP helps poorer nations build ports, rail lines and telecommunications networks, as well as secure financing. Since this assistance is usually unaffordable by design, the BRI transforms countries into politically malleable debtors. The Economic Times characterized BRI as one of ""China's colonial advances wrapped in benign global treaties.""

The New York Times reported that extra to economic leverage, some in the U.S. suspect that BRI is enabling China to build ""a globe-spanning bloc of nations that will mostly buy Chinese goods and tilt toward China's authoritarian political model.""

Every one of the countries on the human rights council that voted with China are part of the BRI. Somalia was the outlier, which is part of BRI but nevertheless took a stand.

Liu Mingfu, a retired colonel in the Chinese communist military, wrote a book to which Chinese president Xi Jinping has referred, entitled ""The China Dream."" Liu, a proponent for communist Chinese global supremacy, characterized the competition between China and the U.S. not a ""shooting duel"" or ""boxing match,"" but as a ""track and field"" competition, or a marathon.

Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, indicated in the book ""The Hundred-Year Marathon"" that elements of the communist Chinese regime have long aspired to ""replace the United States as the economic, military, and political leader of the world by the year 2049 (the one hundredth anniversary of the Communist Revolution),"" in part to ""avenge or 'wipe clean' (xi xue) past foreign humiliations,"" such as the Chinese addiction to opium in the 19th century.

Pillsbury stated that the CCP's aim is ""a world without American global supremacy.""

Pillsbury detailed how Liu and other influential Chinese political thinkers believe China to have a responsibility ""to 'improve' all the nations and people of the world by 'harmonizing' them—spreading Chinese values, language, and culture so they can better fit into under heaven. This empire 'values order over freedom, ethics over law, and elite governance over democracy and human rights.'""

In addition to evidencing China's growing political clout, Thursday's UN vote hints at the nature and priorities of the world order the CCP seeks to establish.



'Cesspool of political bias'

The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the council because of its inclusion of numerous human rights abusers such as China, Cuba, Pakistan and Venezuela. The U.S. was the first country in the council's 12-year history to drop out voluntarily.

Then-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, ""We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights."" She added, ""the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.""

Unearthed documents reveal details that contradict what Biden said about his dealings in Ukraine,"John Solomon, an executive president at The Hill, called into question the version of events that former Vice President Joe Biden has been repeating regarding his interactions with Ukraine while he was vice president.

How much does everyone agree on?

Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was paid $50,000 a month to sit on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas firm. Biden would later openly admit that while he was vice president he had asked the then-president of Ukraine to fire an allegedly corrupt prosecutor general. This prosecutor happened to be investigating Burisma. This prosecutor was fired.

The replacement prosecutor shut down an investigation into Burisma within a year of taking over.

A whistleblower's complaint revealed that in July, President Donald Trump had asked the current president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to help Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine. Trump has insisted that the was nothing wrong with his question, pointing to the fact that there was no quid pro quo offered during this conversation for this request.

What has Biden said?

While Biden has admitted that he urged then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, but that it had nothing to do with his son or Burisma Holdings.

In response to questions about whether his foreign policy benefited his son, Biden insisted that he had ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings"" and said that reporters ""should be looking at Trump"" instead.

But Hunter Biden admitted in a New Yorker article from July that his father had discussed his role at Burisma on at least one occasion, telling Hunter, ""I hope you know what you're doing."" That article also noted that members of the Obama administration were uneasy about Hunter Biden's role in Burisma, fearing that it could end up ""potentially undermining his father's message.""

What happened now?

Writing in the Hill, Solomon said that through years of reporting on this topic, he had come across a number of details that ran contrary to what Joe Biden had said.

Through interviews and reviewing documents, Solomon said, he found proof that lawyers for Burisma had approached the Ukrainian government shortly after Shokin's firing to apologize ""for dissemination of false information by U.S. representatives and public figures.""

Solomon also pointed to a 2015 New York Times story, which noted that Burisma hired Hunter Biden less than a month after former-President Barack Obama appointed Joe Biden to be in charge of the United States' relationship with Ukraine.

During an interview on Friday, Solomon told Glenn Beck that ""at that moment he was fired"" Shokin ""was making plans to interview Hunter Biden."" Solomon stressed that this in itself ""doesn't mean Hunter Biden did anything wrong, but he was about to interview Hunter Biden in the middle of the 2016 election. That would have been a big story.""

Solomon said that Shokin had personally told him that he believed he was fired for continuing to look into Burisma despite Biden's request for him to end the investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unearthed-documents-reveal-details-that-contradict-what-biden-said-about-his-dealings-in-ukraine,2019-09-27
US accuses Zero Hedge of spreading Russian propaganda. Website fires back at 'hit piece.',"U.S. intelligence officials have accused the libertarian-leaning financial website Zero Hedge of spreading Russian propaganda, though the website vigorously denies the accusation.

Anonymous officials who spoke with the Associated Press on Tuesday alleged that Zero Hedge, which has 1.2 million readers, published articles created by Moscow-controlled media. The officials pointed to multiple articles that criticized U.S. warnings about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Some of those articles were authored by people affiliated with the Strategic Culture Foundation, a group sanctioned by the Biden administration last year for allegedly participating in Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. election, according to the AP. The officials said the foundation's leadership takes direction from the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service.

Recent Zero Hedge articles cited by the AP include the headlines: “NATO Sliding Towards War Against Russia In Ukraine,” “Americans Need A Conspiracy Theory They Can All Agree On,” and “Theater Of Absurd... Pentagon Demands Russia Explain Troops On Russian Soil.”



In a written response published Tuesday, Zero Hedge called the AP article a ""hit piece"" and said it has ""been singled out for pursuing non-establishment groupthink.""

""Well, now we've done it — we've angered the CIA, and for what? For publishing views that challenge the conventional narrative,"" Zero Hedge wrote.

The post noted that there is ""no actual accusation that Zero Hedge works directly with anyone tied to Russia or its intelligence apparatus."" The officials quoted by the AP did not say whether they believed Zero Hedge knew of any alleged links to spy agencies and they did not allege a direct link between the website and Russia.



Zero Hedge told the AP it seeks to “publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.”



""[T]his website has never worked, collaborated or cooperated with Russia, nor are there any links to spy (or any other) agencies,"" Zero Hedge emphasized in its response.

Zero Hedge said that the Strategic Culture Foundation ""periodically guest posts on its website along with hundreds of other sources of alternative information."" The website added that one of the main writers for the foundation, Alastair Crooke, is ""a former high ranking MI6 figure and UK diplomat, i.e., a former British spook.""



""Perhaps he is now a double agent working for Putin after spending decades spying for the UK?” Zero Hedge wrote.

Zero Hedge told the AP the Strategic Culture Foundation is ""one of our hundreds of contributors — unlike Mainstream Media, we try to publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.""

The intelligence officials said three other websites have ties to the FSB, Russia's federal security service.

“These sites enable the Russian government to secure support among the Russian and Ukrainian populations,” one official said. “This is the primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-accuses-zero-hedge-of-spreading-russian-propaganda,2022-02-15
US airports hit with cyberattacks; Russian hacker group suspected culprit,"Over a dozen major national airports reported cyberattacks on Monday that caused public-facing websites to go offline. According to a senior official briefed on the situation, a Russian hacker group is believed to be behind the incident.



The attacks did not impact any internal communications or transportation security. The source told ABC News, ""It's an inconvenience.""

Websites for Des Moines International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Chicago O'Hare International Airport were impacted on Monday morning.

The ""denial of service"" attack meant that customers could not view wait times and congestion information on the airports' public-facing web domains.

""Early this morning, the FlyLAX.com website was partially disrupted,"" LAX told ABC News. ""The service interruption was limited to portions of the public facing FlyLAX.com website only. No internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions.""

""We noticed this morning that the external website was down, and our IT and security people are in the process of investigating,"" Andrew Gobeil, a spokesman for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, told WAGA-TV. ""There has been no impact on operations.""

All of the impacted airports reported that the websites have since been restored.

John Hultquist, head of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told ABC News that over a dozen airport websites were targeted. The attackers were able to cause a ""denial of public access"" error by overloading the websites with artificial users.

Hultquist said the pro-Russian hacker group ""Killnet"" was believed to be behind the attacks. The group has been active since the invasion of Ukraine and is focused on targeting Ukraine's allies.

Recently, the pro-Russian group Killnet took credit for taking down U.S. government websites in Kentucky, Florida, Alabama, and Indiana. The group was previously confirmed to have hacked a U.S. Congress website and organizations in Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Italy, and Estonia.

Hultquist noted that groups similar to Killnet have turned out to be fronts for state-backed actors but explained that there was no evidence to suggest the Russian government was involved in the Monday cyberattacks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-airports-hit-with-cyberattacks-russian-hacker-group-suspected-culprit,2022-10-10
US announces $600m more in military aid to Ukraine,"The Biden administration announced last week that it will send another $600 million in military aid to Ukraine. The funding includes “arms, munitions, and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories.”

Specifically, the U.S. will be sending Ukrainian fighters High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), night vision goggles, claymore mines, mine-clearing equipment, 105mm artillery rounds, and 155mm precision guided artillery rounds, among other equipment, according to a Pentagon press release.

""To meet Ukraine’s evolving battlefield requirements, the United States will continue to work with its Allies and partners to provide Ukraine with key capabilities,"" the Pentagon said.

The aid was authorized under the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to “sanction the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks,” according to Reuters.

“With admirable grit and determination, the people of Ukraine are defending their homeland and fighting for their future,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. “The capabilities we are delivering are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table when the time is right,” Blinken added.

According to The New York Times, Ukrainian and American officials say the regular announcements of new shipments from American inventories have given Ukraine’s senior commanders the confidence to plan complex simultaneous offensives.

The new round of funding comes on the heels of a $2.8 billion infusion announced earlier this month and nearly $3 billion announced in late August. The total amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine now stands at nearly $15.9 billion since President Joe Biden took office, reports the Associated Press. According to Blinken’s statement, this is the twenty-first time the U.S. has sent weapons to Ukraine.

Ukraine has scored a number of key victories in recent days, retaking several strategic towns earlier this month. Russia, however, continues its artillery and air strikes in eastern Ukraine.

Blinken said that the U.S. will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-announces-600m-more-in-military-aid-to-ukraine,2022-09-18
"While Ukraine fights to defend itself from one of the world's largest armies, the US Army is training its officers on gender identity","While much of Ukraine fights for its continued freedom, some U.S. soldiers are being made to learn about gender identity and preferred pronouns, the Washington Free Beacon reported Tuesday.

What are the details?

An official Army presentation on the subject, purportedly obtained by the outlet through a military whistleblower, was titled ""Policy on the Military Service of Transgender Persons and Persons with Gender Dysphoria"" and aimed to help train officers on how to teach subordinates materials related to gender dysphoria and transgenderism in the U.S. Army.

The unnamed whistleblower, the outlet reported, was a ""high-ranking officer in the Army Special Forces.""

The outlet reported the mandatory program ""offers several hypothetical scenarios for how soldiers should be treated if they are transgender or in some stage of transitioning to another gender.""

Under one scenario contained in the training guide, a ""soldier who was assigned male at birth says he identifies as a female,"" ""lives as a female in his off-duty hours,"" and ""is not requesting to be treated as a female while on duty.""

In such a case, according to the slides, the outlet reports that the soldier ought to be ""treated with dignity and respect and no further action is required.""

If the soldier in question, however, requests at any point to be identified as female during duty hours or appears to be experiencing ""increased distress"" relating to gender dysphoria, the commanding officer is required to ""inform [the] soldier of the Army's transgender policy and recommend that he sees a military medical provider.""

""Gender transition in the Army,"" the presentation added, ""begins when a soldier receives a diagnosis from a military medical provider indicating that gender transition is medically necessary.""

Another scenario addresses a female service member who tells her first sergeant that she identifies as male and would prefer to be treated as such. The soldier in the scenario has not yet seen a military medical provider for the condition.

At that point, Army leaders are required to inform the soldier that the U.S. military ""recognizes a soldier's gender by the soldier's gender marking in DEERs,"" or the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, a massive database that tracks military members.

""The soldier, according to the presentation, will be expected to meet the uniform, grooming, and physical readiness standards associated with their recognized gender,"" the outlet added, and noted that the soldier in question would then be sent to a military medical provider who is able to determine whether ""gender transition is medically necessary"" at that point.

What else?

A spokesperson for the Army told the outlet that the slides in question are part of a required training and are taken from a program ""used to train Army personnel on the recent changes to the DoD and Army transgender service policy.""

The spokesperson added that all Army personnel are required to participate in the training by Sept. 30, 2022.

""We remain committed to treating all soldiers with dignity and respect while ensuring good order and discipline,"" the spokesperson added. ""Soldiers who meet those standards can serve openly in their self-identified gender.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-army-is-training-its-officers-on-gender-identity,2022-03-01
US Army special operators take first place in international sniper competition,"U.S. Army special operators recently put their world-class marksmanship on display when they took home first place in an annual international sniper competition held in North Carolina.

The event, which the U.S. Army Special Operations Command has hosted at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg since 2004, routinely tests the abilities of personnel from several branches of the U.S. military and abroad.

According to the Army Times, this year's contest featured two-man teams from France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland in addition to teams from across the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Secret Service, and the Coast Guard.

The competition, which took place March 21-25, tested the sharpshooters on a variety of different skill sets needed to execute the task of a sniper, all while seeking to simulate the experiences of real combat.

In all, the teams were put through 23 different scenarios that measured the snipers' and spotters' long-, medium-, and short-range marksmanship capabilities, according to Insider.

""The sniper teams face lanes that force them to maneuver over and around obstacles to establish a firing position and make engagement on a target. In other lanes, they might have to be in a static position while other challenges that make it hard are presented, like targets that move behind obstacles,"" said Col. Matthew Tucker, commanding officer of the Army's 2nd Special Warfare Training Group, in a statement.

""It could be everything from taking exceptionally long shots to dealing with complex situations to how they communicate about what they happen to be seeing in a given situation that we might set up for them,"" he added.

In the end, the event's host, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, won first prize. Insider noted that ""the generic name may mean it was composed of members of Delta Force, a secretive unit the Army rarely acknowledges.""

Coming in second was a team of French SAS commandos, followed by the U.S. Army National Guard's 20th Special Forces Group in third. In fourth was a team of Marine Raider sniper instructors, and in fifth was a team from Germany's special operations unit, Kommando Spezialkräfte.

The full order of team rankings is provided in the Army Times report.

Participants noted that this year's competition took on a special consideration given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.

Tucker remarked to the Times that all of the international participants were from Europe, where they ""currently face a common threat there that harkens back to the Cold War.""

""So this has been a great opportunity for us, this year, to improve the interoperability that will be required of all of us to meet treaty obligations with NATO as well as with other allies,"" he said.

US government buys $290 million in anti-radiation drugs as Biden warns of nuclear 'Armageddon',"On Thursday, at a Democrat fundraiser in New York City, President Joe Biden claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""not joking"" about his ""potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons.""

Biden suggested the reason for Putin's alleged willingness to risk a nuclear confrontation with the West is that ""his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming.""

The president told Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee donors at James Murdoch's house, ""We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.""

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also recently employed the term ""Armageddon,"" when in September he called for the global dismantling of nuclear warheads to prevent ""humanitarian Armageddon.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that there was yet no ""indication that Russia is preparing to imminently use nuclear weapons.""

In his September 22 speech to the United Nations, Biden condemned Russia, suggesting it stood as the chief threat to global peace. He characterized Putin's previous warnings as ""irresponsible nuclear threats.""

Biden stated, ""A nuclear war cannot be won ... and must never be fought.""

Earlier this week, CIA Director William Burns told CBS: ""We have to take very seriously [Putin's] kind of threats given everything that's at stake,"" but indicated that U.S. intelligence had no ""practical evidence"" that Putin was on the verge of executing the nuclear option.



Russian threats

On September 21, Putin stated, ""I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of NATO countries."" Putin may have been referring to Russia's hypersonic missiles, which can fly up to fifteen times faster than the speed of sound, its quiet-running submarines or its modernized nukes.

""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,"" he said.

Putin added, ""This is not a bluff. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.""

Putin's emphasis that he was not bluffing was likely in reference to the following remarks made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March: ""I think that the threat of nuclear war is a bluff. It's one thing to be a murderer. It's another to commit suicide. Every use of nuclear weapons means the end for all sides, not just for the one person using them.""

Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany suggested that Putin's remarks were those of a ""misguided"" man who had only too late come to understand that he initially ""underestimated the situation. ... He's desperate.""

Josep Borrell, vice president of the European Commission, noted that ""Putin says that he is ready to use all arms at his disposal, and when someone says 'all' he also means explicitly nuclear arms."" Borrell called for the U.N. to act.

Prague-based military analyst Yuri Fyodorov told Reuters Putin was bluffing in the interim, but that may soon change ""in a week or a month from now ... when he understands the war is lost.""

Chechen leader and Putin appointee Ramzan Kadyrov recommended in a Telegram post that ""more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.""

Kadyrov's suggestion came after Russian forces were forced to retreat from the city of Lyman, southeast of Kharkiv in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.

On September 30, Putin announced his intentions to annex the eastern portions of Ukraine (i.e., the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions). In his speech, Putin accused the U.S. of setting a nuclear weapons ""precedent"" by bombing Japan in 1945, effectively ending the Second World War.

Reuters reported that Russia's criminal annexation of 18% of Ukraine greatly heightens the risk of nuclear war, as ""Putin could cast any attack on these territories as an attack on Russia itself.""

Putin would not require an initial nuclear volley by the West to justify his regime's deployment of nukes. After all, Russia's nuclear doctrine calls for nuclear retaliation after ""aggression against the Russian Federation with conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.""

Extra to the nuclear threat, Putin has also called up 300,000 Russian troops for new attacks on Ukraine.

Ukrainian suggestion

On Thursday, Zelenskyy told an Australian policy-focused think tank that NATO should ""eliminate the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons,"" recommending ""preemptive strikes, so that they'll know what will happen to them if they use nukes, and not the other way around.""

Zelenskyy added, ""Don't wait for Russia's nuclear strikes, and then say, 'Oh, since you did this, take that from us!'""

Zelenskyy's office later indicated that the Ukrainian president was not calling for a ""preemptive"" nuclear strike on Russia. Nevertheless, the Kremlin interpreted that to have been his meaning.

A Kremlin spokesman said Zelenskyy's comments ""are nothing but a call to start a world war,"" which would result in ""unforeseeable disastrous consequences.""

A subsequent statement from Zelenskyy's office reiterated ""only the terrorist state Russia can afford to blackmail the world with explosions ... and hint at the use of nuclear weapons, and Ukraine will never make such calls."" The statement also indicated that ""the US administration, together with its partners, is discussing a response plan in the event of the use of nuclear weapons by the Russian federation.""

Preparing for the worst

The U.S. government is taking preparatory steps in the event diplomacy fails. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was purchasing a supply of the drug Nplate, which has been FDA-approved to ""treat blood cell injuries that accompany acute radiation syndrome in adult and pediatric patients.""



Acute radiation syndrome occurs when a person's ""entire body is exposed to a high dose of penetrating radiation"" — the kind resulting from a nuclear explosion or a dirty bomb. Nplate serves to reduce radiation-induced bleeding by stimulating the body's production of platelets. The drug can reportedly be used in both adults and children.

Ukraine is similarly preparing in the eventuality that nuclear weapons are used in the war. Its capital city of Kyiv is readying evacuation centers and ensuring sufficient stock of potassium iodine pills are on hand. Such pills help protect against radiation absorption.

Nukes and their power

According to the Federation of American Scientists, Russia has an estimated 5,977 nuclear warheads. That total includes 1,588 deployed strategic nukes; 2,889 reserve, nondeployed nukes; and 1,500 stockpiled and retired nukes.

The U.S., by way of comparison, has 5,428 nuclear warheads; 1,644 of those are deployed strategic warheads, 100 are deployed nonstrategic nukes, 1,964 are reserve or nondeployed nukes, and 1,720 are retired.

The Washington Post reported that standard modern nuclear bombs have yields equivalent to 500,000 and 1 million tons of TNT (i.e. 500 kilotons and 1 megaton). The nukes dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had, by comparison, yields of 15 and 21 kilotons, respectively.

In the way of nuclear warheads dropped to date, Russia holds the record for the most powerful ever exploded. In October 1961, the Soviets dropped ""Tsar Bomba"" over Siberia. This particular bomb had a yield of at least 50 megatons (i.e. the equivalent of 50 million tons of TNT).

So-called ""low-yield"" nukes, like those Kadyrov recommended Putin use to cover Russian retreats, are still incredibly more powerful than the 2020 Beirut explosion, which injured over 7,000 and killed 218.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-government-buys-290-million-in-anti-radiation-drugs-as-biden-warns-of-nuclear-armageddon,2022-10-07
US Marine killed in Ukraine fighting Russian invasion,"U.S. citizen Willy Joseph Cancel was killed in Ukraine on Monday while fighting alongside Ukrainian troops against invading Russian forces, family members confirm. ""He appears to be the first U.S. citizen to die while fighting alongside Ukrainians in Ukraine,"" Fox News reported.

Cancel – a 22-year-old former U.S. Marine – leaves behind a wife and a 7-month-old baby.

""He went there wanting to help people, he had always felt that that was his main mission in life,"" Brittany Cancel – the widow of the American citizen who died in Ukraine – told Fox News.

""My husband was very brave and a hero,"" Cancel stated. ""I did not expect to be a widow at 23 years old or for our son to be without a father.""

Cancel's mother – Rebecca Cabrera – told CNN, ""He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it.""

""It was something that he believed in his heart, that was the right thing,"" Cabrera added. ""He was the type of man who always stepped up when everybody else stepped back, and there were a lot of men who were like that that were with him.""

Devin Tietze Jr. – Cancel's brother-in-law – told CNN, ""He believed wholeheartedly this shouldn't have happened and he wanted to go help the people in Ukraine.""

Cancel was a correctional officer before going to Ukraine to help fight against the Russian invasion.

""Prior to wanting to help the effort in Ukraine, he was a detention officer in Kentucky,"" the widow told Fox News. ""He had dreams and aspirations of being a police officer or joining FDNY. Naturally, when he found out about what was happening in Ukraine he was eager to volunteer.""

Cancel was hired by a private military contracting company to fight against Russians in Ukraine.

Cancel flew to Poland on March 12 and arrived in Ukraine the next day, according to Cabrera. His mother said Cancel was fighting alongside soldiers from ""all different countries.""



Cabrera said, ""They haven't found his body. They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed, but we would love for him to come back to us.""

Cancel's widow pleaded, ""All I want is for him to come home, and to give him the proper burial he deserves.""



How Cancel was killed in Ukraine is not clear at this time.

An official with the U.S. Department of State told NBC News on Friday that officials ""are aware of these reports and are closely monitoring the situation.""



""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment,"" the official said. ""We once again reiterate U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of U.S. citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.""

Cabrera said of her son, ""He was just a really thoughtful person. He always put everybody ahead of himself even when situations were so stressful. He always kept everybody laughing and calm. He was the man that stood up when everybody else stood back.""

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry created a special unit consisting of foreign fighters known as the ""International Legion."" Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov – commander of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry – claimed that more than 20,000 volunteers and veterans from 52 countries have expressed interest in joining the unit, CNN reported on March 7.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declines US evacuation offer,"The U.S. government reportedly made Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy an offer that most politicians wouldn't refuse. However, Zelenskyy allegedly showed that he isn't like most world leaders.

As Russian military forces invaded Ukraine this week, the U.S. government offered to evacuate Zelenskyy out of harm's way. Despite understanding that his defense was severely outgunned by Russia – one of the strongest militaries in the world – and Vladimir Putin intent on ""decapitating"" the current Ukraine government, Zelenskyy refused to desert his fellow countrymen.

Zelenskyy declined the offer to flee.

""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" an ""upbeat"" Zelenskyy said, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, the Associated Press reported.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday that Zelenskyy remains a ""prime target for Russian aggression.""

Zelenskyy – who traded in his suits for green military fatigues and kevlar – has stayed in Ukraine's capital city as the Russian forces march towards Kyiv.

According to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, ""the bulk"" of Russian forces are roughly 20 miles from the heart of Kyiv as of Saturday morning.

In a video posted on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy delivered a defiant message to the people of Ukraine as the Russian invasion wages on.

""I am here. We are not putting down arms. We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this,"" Zelenskyy said in the video captioned: ""Do not believe the fakes.""



""That is it. That's all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine,"" the actor-turned-leader concluded.



Also on Saturday, Zelenskyy issued a press briefing that the Ukrainians will prevail in the war against Russia.

""Our military, our national guard, our national police, our territory defense, special service, nationals of Ukraine, please carry on. We will win. Glory to Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said.

""The occupiers wanted to set up their puppet in our capital. They didn’t succeed,"" he continued. ""On our streets, there was a proper fight going on.""

""The enemy was using all its weapons, artillery, paratroops, all its weapons. They are hitting residential areas, they are trying to destroy energy infrastructure, and everyone should help us to stop this occupation,"" Zelenskyy declared.



The 44-year-old Ukrainian president also called on ""friends"" of Ukraine to help them defeat the Russians.

""Everyone who can defend Ukraine abroad please do it directly in a united way,"" he said, according to Sky News. ""Every friend of Ukraine who wants to join Ukraine in defending the country please come over, we will give you weapons.""

On Saturday afternoon, Zelenskyy thanked Germany for sending military aid to Ukraine.

""The Russian attack marks a turning point. It is our duty to do our best to help Ukraine defend against the invading army of [Vladimir] Putin,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Saturday.

Germany will supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles, which bypasses the nation's long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones.

On Saturday, the United States pledged to send $350 million in military aid to Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-offers-to-evacuate-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-he-responds-i-need-ammunition-not-a-ride,2022-02-26
US officials believe Iran shot down Ukrainian passenger plane with anti-aircraft missile — likely by mistake,"U.S. officials and Ukrainian investigators said Thursday that they believe a missile likely caused Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 to crash near Tehran Wednesday, killing all 176 passengers on board, the Washington Post reported.

A team of 45 experts and search-and-rescue personnel arrived from Ukraine to investigate the incident, saying in addition to engine failure, they were looking into a missile attack or a terrorist attack as the possible cause.

According to a report by Newsweek, two U.S. officials and one Iraqi intelligence official also believe the crash was a result of Iran firing an anti-aircraft missile into the plane. The U.S. officials added that the Pentagon has assessed the firing as ""accidental."" They noted that Iran's anti-aircraft systems were likely active following the country's missile attacks on military facilities housing U.S. troops Tuesday night.

CBS News reporter, Kris Van Cleave, confirmed the news on Twitter, saying U.S. officials are ""confident"" the flight was shot down after intelligence picked up signals of the radar being turned on and satellite detected infrared blips of two missile launches.

A missile — possibly Russian?



Ukraine National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danylov wrote on Facebook Thursday that his team would search for debris from a Russian Tor air defense missile after reading various reports online saying fragments were discovered near the crash site.



According to Al Jazeera, Danylov confirmed to reporters that his team ""intends to look for the debris of a Russian Tor air defense missile"" while investigating a wide array of possibilities including ""an explosion inside the plane as a result of a terrorist attack,"" a collision with another flying object or the explosion of one of the engines.

The outlet also noted that Russia has for decades supplied Iran with sophisticated weaponry, including Tor M1 missiles in 2007.

Preliminary investigation by Iran's Civil Aviation Organization cited witness accounts that recalled that the plane was on fire before it hit the ground, suggesting that the cause of the crash may not have been ""engine failure"" as Iranian investigators initially concluded.

The Post reported that ""several independent aviation experts have noted that, based on video and the wide debris field, it appeared the Boeing 737 800 was breaking apart in the air.""

A surveillance video posted on Twitter by Iran's state broadcaster appears to show a fiery orange glow interrupt early morning darkness before flaming debris scattering over a wide area.

Immediately after the crash, Iranian officials said the plane had encountered technical problems, but investigation reports noted that no distress call ever came from the aircraft. Iranian investigators also retrieved the black box, or the flight recorder, Wednesday, but Iran announced that they would not hand it over to Boeing or the U.S.

What's the background?

The plane crashed just 10 minutes after departing from Tehran en route to Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, appearing to burst into flames in mid-air.

FlightRadar24 had reported that the plane lost contact with the control center only two minutes after take-off. After reaching a flight altitude of 8,000 feet it turned back toward the airport, evidently encountering a problem.

The notion that the plane encountered such a catastrophic technical problem was called into question after Ukraine International Airlines said on Wednesday that the plane involved in the crash was one of the best in its fleet and that its pilots were very experienced.

According to Business Insider, the airliner, a Boeing 737-800 NG, was just three years old and had been recently tested two days prior to the flight.

The day of the crash the entire region was under duress. The night before the flight, Iran had launched several missiles onto military facilities in Iraq housing U.S. troops. The missile launches came in response to a U.S. rocket strike last week that killed Iranian terrorist military leader Qassem Soleimani. Undoubtedly many Iranians were on edge, waiting to see how the U.S. would respond.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-officials-believe-iran-shot-down-ukrainian-passenger-plane-with-anti-aircraft-missile--likely-by-mistake,2020-01-09
"US Senate predicted to approve Finland and Sweden’s request to join NATO – Sen. Hawley says ‘I intend to vote no,’ receives backlash from Sen. Cruz and Sen. Rubio","The U.S. Senate voted today on a resolution to ratify Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO. The request has largely received bi-partisan support and was expected to pass through the Senate easily.



Finland and Sweden requested to join following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Putin reportedly stated that the two countries could ""join whatever they want."" However, Putin also warned that ""if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there, [Russia] would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats for those territories where threats have arisen for [them.]""

After applying for membership, the Nordic countries were met with resistance from Turkey, which alleged that Finland and Sweden supported groups Turkey had designated as terrorists. Since then, the three countries came to an agreement and signed an accord to allow the application to move forward.

Referring to today's vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stated, ""The NATO vote is a very important vote for American security around the world. Finland's and Sweden's membership will strengthen NATO even further, and is all the more urgent given Russian aggression.""



While most senators have voiced support for the two countries joining NATO, Senator Josh Hawley recently wrote an op-ed explaining why he would not be voting for the ratification. Hawley explained that if the vote passed, ""According to the terms of NATO's founding treaty, that means the United States would be obliged to defend both countries in the event of a military attack. I intend to vote no.""

Hawley expressed concern that America is not in a position to commit to protecting another country. He wrote, ""When it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe.""

The Missouri senator mentioned that European countries are not paying their fair share regarding defense responsibilities. He called on them to invest more in national defense to alleviate costs for the United States. ""All the way back in 2006, NATO member states pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on national defense. It should be higher. The United States spends far more than that on defense. But many NATO members still haven't met even this minimal commitment,"" Hawley noted.

In an interview with Politico, Senator Ted Cruz disagreed with Hawley's points. Cruz argued, ""We don't beat China by retreating from the rest of the world. We beat China by standing with our allies against our enemies.""

Yesterday, Senator Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed in reply to Hawley's. In it, Rubio claimed, ""NATO would be stronger with Finland and Sweden. And while President Joe Biden's record is proof that weakness invites aggression and breeds chaos, the converse is also true. As Ronald Reagan would say, peace comes through strength.""

Rubio argued that by adding Finland and Sweden to NATO, America would have more resources to defend itself against the People's Republic of China.

On July 5, all 30 NATO members signed an accession protocol, granting Sweden and Finland the ability to join the alliance. Since the accession was signed, the two Nordic countries have been allowed to participate in some meetings.

However, the decision must first be ratified by all 30 parliaments before the two countries can become official members. The ratification process could take up to a year, at which point, the defense clause will protect them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-senate-predicted-to-approve-finland-and-sweden-s-request-to-join-nato-sen-hawley-says-i-intend-to-vote-no-receives-backlash-from-sen-cruz-and-sen-rubio,2022-08-03
"Amid roaring inflation, US spends big bucks to help Ukraine","As Americans endure the painful financial consequences of raging inflation, the U.S. continues spending massive sums of money to help Ukraine defend itself against a brutal Russian invasion.

""President Biden has been clear we will support the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted in a Thursday statement.

""Pursuant to a delegation of authority from the President, I am authorizing our twenty-first drawdown of U.S. arms and equipment for Ukraine since September 2021. This $600 million drawdown includes additional arms, munitions, and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories. This drawdown will bring the total U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to approximately $15.8 billion since the beginning of this Administration,"" Blinken said.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a consumer price index report that showed inflation remains quite hot in the U.S. ""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller figure than the 8.5- percent increase for the period ending July,"" the BLS noted.

In a tweet on Sunday, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia noted that she has not spoken to anyone advocating for the U.S. to shell out billions more for Ukraine. ""I have not talked to a single person asking to send more billions to Ukraine. Not one,"" she tweeted.

GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky responded by noting, ""All calls and conversations I've had are with people who want us to stop sending their money to Ukraine.""

""No country is entitled to receive tax dollars from hard working Americans,"" Massie tweeted on Monday. ""But what about country _______ ? Send them your own money.""

Some lawmakers have been pushing for the U.S. to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who along with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced a measure to do just that, has called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a terrorist."" Currently, the only nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism include Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-spends-billons-assist-ukraine,2022-09-16
US: Russia is compiling lists of Ukrainians 'to be killed or sent to camps' following invasion,"Russian forces are now compiling lists of identiable Ukrainian citizens that they plan to kill or send to prison camps following an impending military invasion, the United States government warned in a letter to the United Nations on Sunday.

What are the details?

In the letter, addressed to the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, the U.S. warned it has ""credible information"" that Moscow plans to carry out widespread and preplanned targeted killings, forced disappearances, and torture in the Eastern European country — abuses that would amount to a ""human rights catastrophe.""

The Washington Post first obtained and reported on the letter. It has reportedly been verified by at least three high-ranking U.S. government officials.

""I would like to bring to your attention disturbing information recently obtained by the United States that indicates that human rights violations and abuses in the aftermath of a further invasion are being planned,"" wrote Bathsheba Nell Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in the letter.

Crocker went on to say the violence would likely be directed at those who oppose Russia's actions, such as Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists, activists, and other ""vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons.""

""Specifically, we have credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation,"" she said. ""We also have credible information that Russian forces will likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations.""



The letter did not divulge the nature of the intelligence reportedly obtained.

What else?

Speaking with reporters on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov vehemently denied the letter's claims.

""Do you realize that this is an absolute canard, a lie? It is absolute fiction. There is no such list. It’s a fake,"" Peskov fumed, according to the Washington Post.

But the contents of the letter come as no surprise to experts. Russia's violent intimidation campaigns and human rights abuses are well understood, and Foreign Policy reported on Friday that U.S. agencies had recently become aware that Russia was planning to launch an aggressive arrest and assassination campaign.

Biden said last week he was ""convinced"" Russia had made a final decision to invade Ukraine, alleging the assault could happen in the ""coming days"" and would likely include an attack on the capital, Kyiv.

Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops along its border with Ukraine in recent months and has been threatening military action with increasing intensity of late.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-warns-of-russia-kill-lists-ukraine,2022-02-21
US will not target Russia energy sector with sanctions,"The U.S. and its allies will impose severe new economic sanctions on Russia Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine — but a major sector of Russia's economy will be exempt from the punishing measures.

Politico first reported that the major government-owned Russian energy corporation Rosneft is not expected to be targeted in the new sanctions package. The Biden administration is reportedly concerned about global energy markets, as the price of crude oil reached its highest level since 2014 on Thursday because of Russia's war in Ukraine.

One senior administration official told Politico ""no option is off the table,"" but cautioned ""starting out with energy could actually benefit Putin and pad his pockets. Given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas will drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. And as we have said repeatedly on the record, on background [and] off the record, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not ours.”

President Joe Biden addressed the nation Thursday afternoon and announced the next round of sanctions against Russia, following actions the U.S. government took on Tuesday to target Russian financial institutions and members of the country's elite.

The president said new sanctions will target more Russian elites, top banks, and technology exports and will impose a ""severe cost"" to the Russian economy, ""both immediately and over time.""

“We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximize a long-term impact on Russia and to minimize impact on the United States and our allies,"" Biden said.

But he added that the sanctions package is ""specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue"" and said his administration was ""closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption."" The president promised to release additional barrels of oil from U.S. reserves to head off surging energy prices.



Early Thursday, Putin sent troops into Ukraine from the north, east, and south and began attacking Ukrainian cities with airstrikes and precision-guided cruise missiles. A senior defense official told reporters that Russia plans to ""decapitate"" the Ukrainian government and install a puppet regime in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, Politico reported.

Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with G-7 officials Thursday morning to negotiate the sanctions package.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine was condemned by U.S. lawmakers of both parties, who supported the president's use of sanctions against Russia.

“It is important Congress unite to punish and crush Putin and his cronies,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted. He said there is bipartisan support for sending emergency aid to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian military. He also called for a ""task force to aggressively pursue Putin and his inner circle regarding the extravagant lifestyle they have become accustomed to after stealing Russia blind.""

""If we do not treat Putin and his cronies as the war criminals they are, we will be making a huge mistake and sending the wrong message to other bad actors around the world,"" Graham said.



Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said in a statement that Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine ""has brought into sharp focus the need to expel the current Kremlin leadership from the international community.""

But others called on Biden to go further. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said Biden ""must act now to hit Vladimir Putin where it hurts, beginning with Russia's energy sector.""

""The Biden administration should sanction Russian energy production to a halt, and help arm the Ukrainians to defend themselves. At the same time, the White House should reopen American energy production in full,"" said Hawley. ""This is the time to show Russia and the world that America will not reward aggression and it will not be dependent on its enemies.""

"Vermont's Republican governor refuses to support Trump's re-election, endorses challenger","Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott announced Saturday that he will not endorse his party's presidential nominee — President Donald Trump — in the 2020 election.

Instead, Scott has endorsed former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld.

""I've met with him before, I think a lot of him and his platform so I would be supporting him,"" Scott said Saturday, WPTZ-TV reported.

In response, Weld thanked Scott for his endorsement.

""I'm a great admirer of @GovPhilScott of Vermont, and am delighted to have his endorsement in the Republican presidential primary on Super Tuesday. VT has been well served in the past by Republican governors, and Gov. Scott admirably extends that tradition,"" Weld said

Scott now becomes the first sitting Republican governor to publicly oppose Trump's re-election. Indeed, Scott has been vocal about his opposition to the president.

From Politico:

Scott, a frequent critic of Trump, said in January that Trump ""abused his powers"" and shouldn't be in office after the Senate voted to acquit the president on the two articles of impeachment brought against him by the House for delaying nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in an attempt to force the country to announce an investigation of his Democratic political opponents' actions there.

Weld is the only major Republican who has continued to campaign against Trump. Two others — former Reps. Mark Sanford (S.C.) and Joe Walsh (Ill.) — have already folded their campaigns.

Scott's endorsement came just three weeks before the Vermont primary.

Video: CBS reporter and crew dive for cover during live report as humongous explosion rattles Kyiv,"Several huge explosions rocked Kyiv during the dark early hours Thursday morning, and the moments were captured on a live CBS News broadcast.



What are the details?

CBS international correspondent Charlie D’Agata was finishing his live report from Kyiv when the sky behind him lit up a bright orange, illuminating the buildings and skyline.

""What the hell was that?"" he asked in shock as a second flash quickly drove him and the rest of the crew backward and out of the frame. ""It was almost like lightning, there was this big flash.""

A thunderous explosion could be heard shortly after, apparently stunning D'Agata and the rest of the CBS crew into silence.

""That was close,"" a D'Agata remarked after several moments of quiet. ""Close enough to see the flash.""

CBS News tweeted video of the explosions, captioning it, ""Just as CBS News' Charlie D'Agata was coming off the air tonight in #Kyiv Ukraine, the sky lit up behind him 'almost like lightning' and booming explosions shook the city.""

What else?

The Washington Post reported Thursday that an area west of Kyiv was rocked by a massive explosion, but it remains unknown at the time of this reporting whether the blast was the same caught on CBS' video report.

The report noted that the blast, captured by video cameras in the city's southeastern neighborhoods, ""took place in a region to the west of Kyiv and appeared to have struck an area far from the city center.""

""Russian forces remain stalled on the outskirts of the capital. Unable to substantially push through Kyiv’s defense in the north, they have moved westward to further encircle the city.

Computer repairman at center of 'Biden laptop' scandal breaks silence after reportedly receiving death threats: I'm no 'Russian agent',"John Paul Mac Isaac, the computer repairman at the center of a reported Biden family scandal, is speaking out against any assertions that he is a Russian agent or hacker.

Mac Isaac made the remarks in a new video shared to YouTube on Saturday.

What's a brief history here?

Mac Isaac previously stated that he was in receipt of a laptop computer and hard drive containing highly sensitive information regarding former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and purported business dealings with Ukraine.

In November, Mac Isaac's lawyer, Brian Della Rocca, said that Mac Isaac closed his Wilmington, Delaware, computer repair shop after receiving death threats. A neighbor also told the outlet that Mac Isaac left town.

Hunter has not spoken about the laptop, and the former vice president said that the allegations were nothing more than a ""desperate campaign to smear me and my family."" He did not confirm whether the laptop belonged to his son.

What are the details of the new video?

As highlighted by the New York Post, Mac Isaac spoke out in the video insisting that he is not a double agent.

""For two generations, the Mac Isaac family has fought for the entirety of the Cold War against communism in the '70s,"" he said. ""That's why it's completely absurd that why anyone would ever consider me to be a Russian agent or influenced by Russians. I am proud of my family, I'm proud of my country. I am proud to be an American.""

Elsewhere in the three-minute video, titled ""The Truth,"" Mac Isaac added, ""For the record, I am not nor have I ever been a hacker. Those guys make so much more money than I do. I was hired — never paid — to perform a data transfer from a MacBook Pro to an external hard drive. The signed paperwork clearly states the process and sets the expectations. There's no magic or Hollywood. The process is no different than dragging or dropping from a USB drive. The only difference is I had to perform some surgery on the Mac to get it to boot.""

Mac Isaac also said that he is absolutely not a hacker, which he said would be a ""death sentence"" in his industry.

""To imply that I'm a hacker or that information is hacked has an irreversible impact on my business and my character,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-computer-repairman-hunter-biden-laptop,2020-12-11
LIVE VIDEO: Day 3 for President Trump's defense team to take down impeachment charges as Bolton's claims loom large,"President Donald Trump's defense team will wrap up its opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial Tuesday, beginning at 1 p.m. ET. You can watch a live feed of the proceedings below once it begins.

So far, the president's team has been seen as effectively countering the House impeachment managers' case.

On Day 1 of the defense's presentation, the team launched into its ""six key facts"" about the Democrats' impeachment case that, they say, absolve Trump of wrongdoing. The team also accused lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of concealing the ""potentially exculpatory"" testimony of a major witness. The team's defense was seen by at least one senator as a ""kneecapping"" of Schiff.

The Hill reported that, following Saturday's presentation, at least two Democrats have indicated that they could vote for Trump's acquittal.

The defense continued its statement Monday, with one of the most notable portions being Trump team member and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's takedown of Hunter Biden's alleged shady business dealings in Ukraine. As TheBlaze noted:

""When the House managers gave you their presentation, when they submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and Burisma,"" Bondi began, adding that ""they referenced Biden or Burisma over 400 times"" during opening arguments ""and when they gave these presentations, they said there was nothing, nothing to see.""



Bondi went on to say that Democrats' ""case crumbles because they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no basis to raise this concern, but that's not what public records show.""



In addition to giving a detailed timeline of Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma during his father's time in office, as well as the political events in Ukraine at the time, Bondi pointed out how even witnesses called by House Democrats during the impeachment investigation saw potential problems with the matter.



""In fact, every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Bondi said. ""Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and other unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest. These were their witnesses.""

Even more newsworthy than the defense's presentation has been the ongoing debate over the calling of witnesses. Later this week, after the defense wraps up its opening statements and the Senate uses its 16 hours of questions for both sides, senators will likely vote on whether do subpoena further evidence and/or call witnesses.

On Sunday, portions of former national security adviser John Bolton's book manuscript leaked to the media. In it, Bolton claims that the president wanted to continue freezing aid to Ukraine until the Ukrainian government investigated the family of former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.

Now senators on both sides of the aisle are discussing the increasing likelihood that Bolton and other witnesses could be called. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Monday that Bolton's book makes it ""increasingly likely"" that GOP senators will actually vote in favor of calling witnesses.

Other Republican senators have, of course, dismissed Bolton's revelations. And GOP Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.) warned Republican senators that there would be ""political repercussions"" if they voted to call witnesses.

Reports Tuesday revealed that Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is working on a compromise that would offer a Democrats a ""one-for-one"" deal that would allow each side to call just one new witness, with the idea that Democrats would call Bolton and Republicans would likely call either Hunter or Joe Biden.

Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) killed rumors of a similar possible witness swap last week, before the Bolton revelations came out.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-day-3-for-president-trumps-defense-team-to-take-down-impeachment-charges-as-boltons-claims-loom-large,2020-01-28
Video: Hero Ukrainian soldier sacrifices himself to blow up bridge and stop advancing Russian troops,"A Ukrainian service member reportedly sacrificed his life to detonate explosives on a bridge before Russian forces could cross it into Ukraine.

What are the details?

According to reports, Vitaly Skakun Volodymyrovych blew up the bridge — sacrificing himself — to prevent Russian tanks from advancing over a bridge from Russian-occupied Crimea into mainland Ukraine.

Volodymyrovych was said to have mined the bridge with explosives before making the decision to detonate it.

In a Facebook post, the general staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that Volodymyrovych positioned himself at the bridge as Russian tanks began their advance. When he realized that he would not be able to get out in time, he detonated the bridge while still on it.

In video obtained from social media, a vehicle believe to be driven by Volodymyrovych can be seen entering the bridge. Just moments later, the screen is filled with blinding light from the huge explosion's fireball.

The apparent aftermath of the blast can be seen in a second video, which shows the remainder of the structure rutted with deep cracks and covered with broken rocks and other debris.

What else is there to know about this?

In a lengthy statement on Volodymyrovych's bravery and sacrifice, Ukraine's general staff said, “The bridge was mined, but he didn’t manage to get away from there. According to his brothers in arms, Vitaly got in touch [with them] and said he was going to blow up the bridge. Immediately after an explosion rang out.”

A Friday report from the Sun noted that his comrades are now hailing him as a hero for ""significantly slowing down the advancement of the enemy"" — a move that also afforded the Ukrainian force time to ""regroup and redeploy its defenses.""

The statement added that the Marine Command plans to ""apply to the High Command to award the state award to sailor Skakun Vitaliy Volodymyrovych.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-hero-ukrainian-soldier-sacrifices-himself-to-blow-up-bridge-and-stop-advancing-russian-troops,2022-02-25
Video shows enormous line of Teslas waiting to charge in Louisiana,"A video showing a massive line of Tesla electric cars waiting their turn at a charging station in Louisiana is making the rounds on the internet this week.

What are the details?

The video, posted on Facebook by Texas resident Candace Metz on Sunday, appears to show more than a dozen Tesla vehicles wrapped around a parking lot near Interstate 10 in Louisiana, just off Prien Lake, Road in Lake Charles.

""Yesterday I was in Louisiana along I-10. I stopped to get gas when I noticed a line of cars all waiting,"" Metz wrote in the video's caption. ""Come to find out — it was a line of Teslas waiting their turn to charge up.""

""Curious, I pulled over and asked the guy how long it took to charge — he said normally 30 min[utes] but these stations are running slow due to demand so it’s over an hour per car,"" she continued, adding, ""Take a look at this line ... Each car is over an hour to charge.""

""Hope those people have food and clothes — they may not make dinner,"" she quipped.

A Google Maps search of the area showed that the drivers were crowded near a 120kW Tesla Supercharger station. According to the auto manufacturer's support page, Supercharger stations allow for ""up to 200 miles in 15 minutes of charge.""

The next closest Supercharger station is more than 100 miles away in Alexandria, though a few less-efficient Destination Charging stations are available nearby. However, Destination chargers only provide for ""up to 44 miles of range per hour charged.""

Why does it matter?



The video quickly garnered attention online as commenters debated whether traditional gas-powered vehicles remain more efficient than newer electric vehicles even as gas prices skyrocket across the U.S. amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The cost of gas spiked to historic highs in recent weeks as private companies boycotted Russian energy and the Biden administration later placed an embargo on Russian oil as a way to penalize the Kremlin for its unprovoked assault.

Yet as gas prices soared, hurting America's middle class, Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg responded to the crisis by gleefully pushing electric vehicles, boasting about the country's vast network of charging stations.

However, with the average cost of a new electric vehicle at more than $55,000 and videos like this one cropping up, that may be a tough sell.

""No thanks, I'll keep to my $5 a gallon gas!"" Metz exclaimed in the video.

Several commenters agreed with her sentiment, adding, ""Welcome to the future of [Democrat] Green energy"" and ""This is what the New Green Deal Hippies want us to do!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-line-of-teslas-wait-to-charge,2022-03-16
"LIVE VIDEO: President Trump's team takes the Senate floor again to fight Democrats' impeachment charges, could address the recent Bolton accusations","President Donald Trump's defense team is set to begin day two of its three-day opening arguments at 1 p.m. ET Monday.

On Saturday, the president's team began its presentation and immediately launched into its ""six key facts"" about the Democrats' impeachment case that, they say, absolve Trump of wrongdoing.

The team's defense was seen by at least one senator as a ""kneecapping"" of Schiff.

The Hill reported that, following Saturday's presentation, at least two Democrats have indicated that they could vote for Trump's acquittal.

Constitutional lawyer and frequent Trump critic Jonathan Turley praised the defense team's efforts, calling them ""powerful"" and ""brilliant."" And even CNN's Jeffrey Toobin said over the weekend that Republicans and the president are ""winning"" the impeachment case.

A new twist in the impeachment saga developed over the weekend as part of former national security adviser John Bolton's book manuscript leaked to the media. The New York Times reported that Bolton's book claims that Trump admitted that he wanted to continue freezing aid to Ukraine until the Ukrainian government investigated former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

The president has adamantly denied Bolton's reported allegations. It is possible the president's defense team could address the accusations during Monday's presentation.

Democrats have long desired to have Bolton testify and reportedly have even discussed a witness swap to get the former NSA to share what he knows in exchange for having one of the Bidens testify. However, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) killed that idea last week.

Under the trial's organization resolution, after the House impeachment managers wrapped up their case Friday, the president's defense team has up to 24 hours over three days to present its side. The Trump team is scheduled to finish its opening arguments Tuesday.

After both sides have made their cases, senators will have 16 hours to submit questions to both the House managers and the president's defense team.

"VIDEO: Republicans get another stab at Adam Schiff and the impeachment managers, might try to force Justice Roberts to allow whistleblower to be named","The Senate will reconvene at 1 p.m. ET Thursday to wrap up the questioning phase of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. You can watch the live feed of the proceedings below once it begins.

Following three days of opening statements from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and his crew of House impeachment managers and three days of presentations from the president's defense team, senators began the first of two days of questioning Wednesday. Per the rules of the trial, senators are required to submit all questions for the impeachment managers and the defense team in writing to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial.

During Wednesday's question time, Justice Roberts reportedly refused to read questions from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) that named the whistleblower whose actions revealed the controversial call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment efforts.

But the fight is not over: Paul told reporters Wednesday, ""It's still an ongoing process, it may happen tomorrow."" Fox News reported that Paul might even try Thursday to force Roberts to read questions that name the whistleblower.

Once the questioning phase is concluded, the Senate will vote on whether to subpoena more documents and/or call witnesses. That vote is expected to occur Friday.

Democrats have been clamoring to call former national security adviser John Bolton after leaked portions of his book manuscript reportedly claimed that the president said he was withholding aid to Ukraine in order to get an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Also, news broke Wednesday that Bolton reportedly told Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) to look into the firing of former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.

Republicans, in turn, have threatened to call the Bidens — and even the whistleblower — as witnesses. And at least one Democratic senator seems to believe calling Hunter Biden would be a worthwhile endeavor.

But the fight could all be for naught: GOP senators revealed Wednesday night that they believe they now have the votes to block any calls for witnesses.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-republicans-get-another-stab-at-adam-schiff-and-the-impeachment-managers,2020-01-30
LIVE VIDEO: Republicans poised to finally kill Democrats' ongoing cries for more impeachment witnesses,"UPDATE — 1:19 p.m. ET: Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski has announced she will vote ""no"" on calling witness, according to Fox News. This will likely give the GOP the 51 votes they need to block Democrats' attempts to call witnesses.

The original report follows.

---

The U.S. Senate will reconvene at 1 p.m. ET Friday to debate and vote on whether the upper chamber will call witnesses for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. You can watch a live feed of the proceedings below once it begins.

Thursday marked the final day of the questioning phase of the trial, which followed three days of accusations from the House impeachment managers and three days of defense from the president's team.

The issue now before the Senate is whether to call witnesses and/or subpoena more documents.

Following Tennessee GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander's announcement Thursday that he would oppose calling more witnesses, Republicans believe they have the votes to block Democrats' demands to get witnesses to testify in the trial. However, the vote could be very close. GOP Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Susan Collins (Maine) have both said they will vote with the Democrats on calling witnesses.

One Republican senator, as of Friday morning, had not yet made clear her position: Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. If she votes with Romney and Collins, the vote would result in a 50-50 tie, a situation that might then give the presiding officer, Chief Justice John Roberts, the power to cast a tie-breaking vote — a result Roberts and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell likely do not want — though the vice president, as president of the Senate, is normally the tie-breaker. As of press time, the event of a tie is an uncertain situation.

Democrats are, of course, upset that the GOP would refuse any witnesses. They had hoped that recent reported revelations in former national security adviser John Bolton's forthcoming book would get at least four GOP senators to side with the 47 Democrats to call witnesses. Bolton's book manuscript, which was leaked to the media last weekend, reportedly states that President Trump admitted he was withholding aid to Ukraine in order to get an investigation into presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) claimed Thursday that Chief Justice John Roberts has lost ""legitimacy"" by overseeing an impeachment trial that didn't include witnesses. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stated that President Trump cannot be truly acquitted if the Senate does not call witnesses.

Republicans countered Democrats' complaints with a reminder that former Vice President Biden noted in 1999, when he was a senator considering the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, that the Senate had previously determined in other impeachment trials that it did not need to ""take new evidence or hear live witness testimony.""

If the GOP is successful in blocking witnesses, the impeachment trial could wrap up over the weekend, and perhaps as soon as Friday afternoon, the Washington Post reported. But Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Friday that the final vote on acquittal might not happen until next week.

"Horrifying video purportedly shows Russian tank blowing up car, killing two elderly Ukrainians","A video being widely circulated on the internet this week shows a supposed Russian tank obliterating a civilian car in Ukraine, reportedly killing an elderly couple inside.

The video was reportedly shared on Telegram by Ukrainian news agency Yhiah on Tuesday, according to the Daily Mail. However, watermarks splashed across the video indicate it was originally posted by an individual or organization running an account called ""Kyiv Operative.""

It shows the tank opening fire on the car just moments after the vehicle comes to an abrupt stop in the middle of an empty street. In the aftermath of the blast, the car appears to be severely damaged with the doors caved in and the body destroyed in several places.

The video was also shared online by a Twitter account called ""Armed Forces"" Ukraine, which has been compiling and posting relevant content since the start of the war.



(Warning: the following video contains graphic content that may be disturbing to some viewers.)

Multiple reports online claimed the blast killed two elderly Ukrainians, though details about the incident could not be independently verified.

This latest alleged incident comes as a growing number of reports continue to surface showing Russian atrocities in Ukraine as forces carry out violence against civilians attempting to flee battle zones.



Early on in the conflict, photos and videos shared online indicated that the Russian forces were assaulting airports, hospitals, apartment buildings, and other civilian population centers in their advance on the capital, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's insistence that only military installations would be targeted.

The civilian targeting soon became even more direct. One Russian tank was captured on video chasing down and flattening a civilian car. Then, missile strikes began raining down on Ukrainian civilians near Kyiv as they sought safety by fleeing battle over a damaged bridge. A mother and her two children were killed in the attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to hunt down ""every bastard"" who has attacked his people in response to the ""deliberate murder.""

""We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed 'start,'"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address, adding, ""There will be no quiet place on this Earth for you, except for the grave.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-russian-tank-blowing-up-car,2022-03-09
LIVE VIDEO: Schiff's impeachment managers offer last gasp in final day to attempt to make their case against Trump. President's team prepares to strike back.,"Democratic House impeachment managers will wrap up their case Friday in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. The trial resumes at 1 p.m. ET. You can watch a live feed of the proceedings below once they begin.

On Thursday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and his team of House Democrats focused largely on the abuse of power article of impeachment. Democrats contend that the president abused his power by trying to have the Ukrainian government influence the U.S. 2020 elections when he urged Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

Most of their case Friday will focus on the charge that Trump obstructed Congress by ignoring or blocking subpoenas.



Under the trial's organizing resolution, the House managers will wrap up their 24 hours of presenting their case today. The president's team will launch its 24 hours of defense Saturday.

According to the Washington Post, the Senate might meet for only a few hours Saturday instead of spending the entire day on the trial. The outlet reported that the president doesn't want much of his case made on the weekend, when voters are likely less focused on the Senate's goings-on. Trump tweeted Friday that it's unfair to have to begin his defense on Saturday, which he called ""Death Valley in T.V.""

After both sides have made their cases, senators will have 16 hours to submit questions to both the House managers and the president's defense team.

LIVE VIDEO: Senate begins impeachment trial of President Trump with fight over the rules,"The U.S. Senate will reconvene Tuesday and begin debating Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposed rules for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. You can watch a live feed of the proceedings below.

Should the Kentucky Republican's proposal pass, arguments would begin Wednesday morning. However, Senate Democrats plan to offer amendments to McConnell's resolution, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday. At issue are the rules of evidence and the calling of witnesses. Democrats say the Republicans' proposed rules would severely hamper House managers' ability to submit evidence to the full Senate.

There is also continuing debate over which witnesses the mangers' should be permitted to call. Over the last few weeks, at least two people Democrats believe could have evidence harmful to the president's case — and did not testify before the House — have come forward to say they are willing to testify before the Senate if called.

Lev Parnas, a former associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has reportedly turned over documents that, he says, show the president pressured the Ukrainian government to announce an investigation into the family of former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Parnas, facing federal charges that could see him serving prison time, has expressed a willingness to testify in the impeachment trial, USA Today reported.

Another witness Democrats have said they hope to call is former Trump national security adviser John Bolton. House Democrats never subpoenaed Bolton to testify, but he announced Jan. 6 that he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Bolton's testimony could be crucial if rumors that he has crucial knowledge about the White House's dealings in Ukraine are true.

Republicans have responded to Democrats' demands about witnesses by vowing to call their own witnesses, potentially even Hunter Biden, son of the former vice president.

The seven Democratic House impeachment managers appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will present the impeachment articles and evidence. Those managers are: Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (Calif.), Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (N.Y.), and Reps. Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), Val Demings (Fla.), Jason Crow (Colo.), and Sylvia Garcia (Texas).



The U.S. House voted Dec. 18 to impeach the president for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On Thursday, the House formally delivered the two articles of impeachment to the Senate.

What are the details?

Videos shared to social media shows the massive armored vehicle driving down what appeared to be a suburban residential road before driving into the path of a sedan — and then directly over the vehicle, appearing to flatten it altogether.

After a moment, the tank can be seen reversing off of the sedan, pulverizing its frame a second time, likely prompting bystanders to assume the worst for the car's occupant.

In the videos, bystanders can be heard screaming and crying as the tank rolls over the vehicle and its occupant inside.

What else?

Later footage shared to social media shows the aftermath of the crash and the dramatic rescue.

According to various reports, the unnamed elderly passenger lived — and was able to extricate himself from the crushed vehicle with the help of several nearby civilians, who pried him out of the wreck using various tools.

Video saw the unidentified group of men attempting to force open the door on the dazed-looking elderly man's vehicle in order to free him from the twisted wreckage.

What else?

Witness Viktor Berbash told the Sun that he couldn't believe his eyes and described the scene as he recalled it unfolding.

""I saw an armoured vehicle and there was automatic fire,"" he told the outlet. ""And here this car, with probably an anti-aircraft gun on it, was already here ...

Video of Ukrainian woman confronting Russian soldier goes viral: Put sunflower seeds in your pocket 'so at least [flowers] will grow' when you're killed,"A fiery Ukrainian women went viral for her reaction to a Russian soldier patrolling a Ukrainian street earlier this week.

What are the details?

The unnamed woman — dressed in nearly all black and wearing a white winter hat — was seen in a video shared to social media telling off a Russian soldier and suggesting he carry sunflower seeds in his pockets — so that when he is killed on foreign soil, flowers will sprout from his decomposing body.

“Put them in your pockets,” she stoically told the soldier during one point of the interaction, “so at least sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here.”

The sunflower, which is Ukraine's national flower, is often said to represent power, strength, warmth, and more.

Elsewhere in the video, the woman could be heard telling the soldier, ""You're occupants, you're fascists! What the f*** are you doing on our land with all these guns?""

She added, ""From this moment, you are cursed. I'm telling you. You f***ing came here uninvited.""

""Pieces of s**t,"" she concluded.

The original video, shared by Twitter account UkraineWorld, was captioned, ""Ukrainian woman confronts Russian soldiers in Henychesk, Kherson region. Asks them why they came to our land and urges to put sunflower seeds in their pockets [so that flowers would grow when they die on the Ukrainian land].""

Video: Veteran interpreter breaks into tears while translating Zelenskyy’s speech as Ukraine survives another night,"A veteran video interpreter who was translating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Sunday speech broke into tears while detailing Ukraine's resolve against attacking Russian forces.

What are the details?

Video shared to social media showed the interpreter — a woman who remains unidentified at the time of this post and working for a German news outlet — pausing, choking up, and finally breaking into tears while translating Zeleskyy's speech while on the air.

Zelenskyy in the speech was describing how the war-torn country had sustained another day of Russian attacks.

""Russia is on the path of evil,"" Zelenskyy said in the speech. ""The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote on the U.N. Security Council.""



The interpreter then paused and began to choke up while delivering Zelenskyy's following lines.

""Ukrainians,"" the country's president continued, ""we know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win. Last night was brutal in Ukraine. Again, the shelling, again the bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure.""

As she continued speaking, she broke once more and took a breath, reportedly saying ""sorry"" before going off the air.

Zelenskyy added that the country is set to fight for as long as it takes to ""liberate the country"" and that Russian forces would only come in heavier and in a more vicious way.

“The night was hard,” he added. “The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror. They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.”

He added, ""If children are born in shelters, even when the shelling continues, then the enemy has no chance in this — undoubtedly — people's war. To victory!

Videos: Ukrainians reportedly take joyride on captured Russian tank as other vehicles are set ablaze or hauled away with tractors,"A group of Ukrainian men allegedly took a captured Russian tank for a joyride through snow-covered fields this week while others set fire to the vehicles or hauled them away using tractors, according to video clips shared online in recent days.

In the first video clip — which has now gone viral online — a group of men are seen cheering and laughing as they ride atop a T-80BVM armored battle tank in a field in Kharkiv, Ukraine, the Daily Mail reported.

The man filming the scene on his cellphone reportedly shouts, ""We did it!"" and ""Glory to Ukraine!"" while his compatriots laugh and yell along with him.

The video, purportedly first uploaded to Telegram, has since been shared online by several different social media accounts, including a Twitter account operated by Barstool Sports called ""Zero Blog Thirty.""

It wasn't immediately clear how the men commandeered the vehicle, however, reports of Russian troops abandoning tanks and other weaponry amid fighting in Ukraine have become widespread.

Newsweek reported Tuesday that a barrage of recent social media posts show Russian forces within the occupied country leaving military vehicles behind and fleeing combat.

Open-source intelligence monitor, OSINT Defender, tweeted a video earlier this week reporting that Russian troops fled a depot in the Sumy region, ""leaving behind BMPs, BTR-80s, MT-LBs and Infantry Transport Vehicles.""

Other abandoned vehicles reportedly included ""a 152mm Msta-S self-propelled howitzer, 1V13 command vehicle, T-80U tank, and logistical trucks,"" according to the Twitter account, ""Ukraine Weapons Tracker.""

Belarusian media outlet, NEXTA, posted a video on Thursday purportedly showing a line of Russian tanks being set ablaze near Nikolaev, now known as Mykolaiv.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmers have gained some notoriety on social media for allegedly hauling away abandoned Russian tanks using tractors, according to a report from British magazine, Farmers Weekly.

In one video, a tank is pulled down a street as someone chases after it.

The magazine quoted an anonymous source who said, ""A Russian solider got lost and got out of his armored personal carrier. He wandered off and the farmer came and took the tractor. The armored personnel carrier had been left unattended, so the farmer decided to nick it.""

In a separate video, an alleged Ukrainian farmer appears to tow away another Russian vehicle as bystanders wave and cheer.

Viral Twitter thread by prominent journalist exposes liberal hypocrisy on Iran protests,"Yashar Ali, one of Twitter's most beloved users, called out some of President Donald Trump's opponents in a viral Twitter thread early Sunday.

In a series of tweets that were widely circulated, Ali, who is of Iranian descent, said that some on the left are using the Iranian people ""as a tool to attack President Trump.""

To back his claims, Ali said that many of ""the most active and prominent liberal Twitter accounts"" ignored the latest anti-government protests in Iran orchestrated by citizens angry that the Islamic Republic lied about shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet last week.





The protests, Ali went on to say, were an ""inconvenient"" fact for those who continue to blame Trump for the escalating situation in Iran.

Ali said, ""It seems to me the protests were inconvenient for some of these folks today. They were placing the blame on the Iranian leadership who lied repeatedly about what happened. They weren't blaming President Trump...so it wasn't worth it to bring attention to or support them?""

Earlier in his thread, Ali said that Iran ""is a tinderbox internally"" because Iranians are ""furious"" with Tehran for lying about what brought down Ukraine International Flight PS752, which resulted in the deaths of all 176 people onboard the plane.

Viral video shows Ukrainian girl singing 'Let it Go' while huddled in Kyiv bomb shelter,"Video of a Ukrainian Girl singing ""Frozen"" hit ""Let it Go"" while huddled inside a bomb shelter with her family has been viewed more than 2.7 million times at the time of this reporting.

What are the details?

In the video, a young girl can be seen singing the 2013 film's song in Ukrainian while people gather around inside a Kyiv, Ukraine, bunker.

Those watching the child's impromptu performance can be seen smiling at the girl, encouraging her to continue, and filming them with their phones.

Following the performance, those gathered broke into cheers and applause.

The Daily Mail reported that social media user Marta Smekhova shared the original video to Facebook in a March 3 post recalling her encounter with the child, whose name she said is Amelia.

""Seeing in one of the Kyiv bomb [shelters], how children draw bright pictures in half-darkness, I of course, couldn't silently pass by,"" she wrote in the post according to the outlet's report. ""[I] stopped, praised, offered to do a little exhibition to somehow decorate this not so happy place.""

The social media user added that she was immediately taken with Amelia, who loved to perform, and began filming the child as she sang the beloved song.

""Everyone put their business aside and listened to a song by this girl who was just beaming light,"" Smekhova wrote. ""Video made with the permission of the girl's mother, [I] promised that many people will see [them], Amelia really wanted this. I showed this video to people in different cities of Ukraine, it was seen by foreigners in different parts of the world. Amelia, your singing left no one indifferent.""

Smekhova concluded the post, ""Look, Russians, against whom you are fighting. Only a coward can fight against civilians.

Visa and Mastercard suspend operations in Russia,"Visa and Mastercard are cutting ties with Russia as Western sanctions continue to ravage the Russian economy in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Independent reported that Visa and Mastercard are suspending operations in Russia “over the coming days.” Visa said that once its ban is in place Visa bank and credit cards issued in Russia will not work abroad and cards issued to people outside of Russia will not work inside the country.

Al Kelly, the CEO of Visa, said, “We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed.”

Mastercard issued a statement expressing a similar view calling the Russian invasion of Ukraine “shocking and devastating.”

The company said, “With this action, cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by the Mastercard network. And, any Mastercard issued outside of the country will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs.”

“These have been and will continue to be very difficult days – most of all for our employees and their families in Ukraine; for our colleagues with relatives and friends in the region; for our colleagues in Russia; and for the rest of us who are watching from afar,” Mastercard added.

Previously, the Ukrainian government called on international financial institutions to cut ties with Russia to apply maximum pressure to Russian leadership.

In late February, shortly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Western nations issued a series of thoroughgoing sanctions on the Russian economy.

Notably, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States locked arms in a joint statement calling for Russian banks to be removed from the SWIFT telecommunications network.

They said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion. Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

The European Commission took further steps against Russia and banned all Russian planes from European airspace.

In response to Western sanctions, corporations took steps to sever their relationships with Russia as they try to exhaust the Russian economy.

The British Petroleum Company (BP) announced that it would liquidate its holdings in Russian state-owned energy companies. BP owns a nearly 20% stake in Rosneft; the British company intends to end its partnership with Russian energy companies which it hopes will put strain on Russia’s ability to export fossil fuels and natural gas.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/visa-and-mastercard-suspend-operations-in-russia,2022-03-06
Vladimir Putin has ordered his military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert,"Vladimir Putin has ordered his military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert on Sunday as tensions with the West escalate over the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin blamed ""aggressive statements"" by NATO members and hard-hitting economic sanctions against Moscow as the reason for increasing Russia's preparedness to launch nuclear weapons.



""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,"" Putin said on state television, according to the Associated Press.

""Senior officials of the leading Nato countries also allow aggressive statements against our country, therefore I order the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty,"" Putin added in the appearance with top Russian military officials.



The order came at a meeting between the president, the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff of the armed forces of Russia, Valery Gerasimov, the Guardian reported.



At the meeting, Putin ordered his top military command to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a ""special regime of combat duty.""

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned the decision as a ""totally unacceptable"" escalation.

""President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable, and we have to continue to condemn his actions in the strongest possible way,"" Thomas-Greenfield said during an appearance on ""Face the Nation.""

Thomas-Greenfield declared that the U.S. will ""continue here at the United Nations and around the world to use every possible lever we have at our disposal to expose his actions.""

Time magazine reported, ""The practical meaning of Putin's order was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have the land- and submarine-based segments of their strategic nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not.""

Putin's decision to place Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert comes after several Western countries have pledged military aid to Ukraine.

Washington Post claims DNI threatened to resign if he couldn't testify about whistleblower complaint. White House and DNI say it never happened.,"The Washington Post reported that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire threatened to quit if the White House did not allow him to testify before Congress later this week. But within an hour of the article's publication, both the White House and Maguire himself had issued denials.

What did the Post say?

Citing ""current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter,"" the Post reported Wednesday afternoon that Maguire ""warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress.""

Maguire is supposed to testify before Congress on Thursday regarding a whistleblower complaint that alleged that President Donald Trump withheld U.S. aid in order to urge the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter's dealings with a Ukrainian natural gas firm. Biden so far has consistently been one of the top polling Democratic candidates hoping to run against Trump in 2020.

On Wednesday, Trump released the transcript of the phone call in question which did in fact show that Trump had urged him to investigate, but also that there had been no offer of a quid-pro-quo as a number of Trump's opponents had suggested. Maguire is one of the few people to date who has seen the entire whistleblower complaint.

The Post also reported that Maguire had urged the White House to make an official decision on whether or not it planned to use executive privilege to try to legally withhold information on this matter.

Both Maguire and the White House have denied this

But, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham shot back in a tweet, ""This is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.""

Minutes later, Maguire released a statement of his own saying, according to Fox News's Chad Pergram, ""At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role..I have never quit anything in my life & I am not going to start now. I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation""

Trump also mentioned this story during a press conference Wednesday afternoon, calling it a ""fake article"" that ""shocked him"" because it failed to mesh with the image of Maguire as he knew him.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wapo-claims-dni-threatened-to-resign-if-he-couldnt-testify-about-whistleblower-complaint-white-house-and-dni-say-it-never-happened,2019-09-25
"'As empty gestures go, impressive': WaPo's Jennifer Rubin mocks Pope Francis' visit to Russian embassy over Ukraine invasion — and gets torched for it","Pope Francis visited the Russian embassy to the Holy See on Friday to express concern over Russia's invasion of Ukraine — a move that Reuters characterized as an ""unprecedented departure from diplomatic protocol.""

The outlet said Moscow's ambassador, Aleksandr Avdeyev, told the RIA Novosti news agency that during the 40-minute meeting, Francis expressed ""great concern"" about Ukraine's humanitarian situation and quoted the pontiff as calling ""for the protection of children, the protection of the sick and suffering, and the protection of people.""

But formerly conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wasn't impressed.

What did she say?

Replying to a tweet from NBC News' chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel on the pope's appeal, Rubin remarked, ""As empty gestures go, impressive.""

How are folks reacting?

As you might imagine, a number of Twitter users who caught wind of Rubin's five-word dismissal of Pope Francis' rare act were equally dismissive of Rubin and her words:

""Yeah Jen, there definitely aren’t over a billion Catholics to be spoken for, and the Holy Father has never played a role in liberating Eastern Europe, definitely not a thing that happened 30-40 years ago,"" one commenter noted.

""Like changing your Twitter name to 'I stand with Ukraine.' What does that even mean?"" another user wondered. ""Did you fly to the Ukraine, take up arms, and are right now helping them defend their country?""

""She's literally saved 40 billion lives by changing her Twitter name to include 'I stand with Ukraine,'"" another user mocked in reference to Rubin.

""God you are an awful human being,"" another commenter declared. ""What has your god, Joe Biden, done for the people of Ukraine other than get them killed? Burn in hell, witch.""

""Really Jennifer?!! An empty gesture!! Pope Francis and his words, thoughts, and actions, have significant influence around the world!"" another user said. ""His words have way more significance than yours! So why don’t you take your empty gesture words and go to Kyiv and stand with Ukraine and fight!""

Anything else?

Reuters noted that a pope visiting an embassy to talk to an ambassador in a time of conflict ""is unprecedented in living memory,"" adding that the Vatican's secretary of state usually summons foreign envoys to meet with the pope in the Apostolic Palace.

The outlet also said that prior to Russia's invasion, Andriy Yurash — Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican — told Reuters that Kyiv would be open to a Vatican mediation of the conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wapos-jennifer-rubin-mocks-pope-francis-visit-to-russian-embassy-over-ukraine-invasion-and-gets-torched-for-it,2022-02-25
Warren stumbles when asked if her new ethics plan would have prohibited the Bidens' Ukraine dealings,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released a new ethics plan last week, focused on ending corruption in Washington and banning private lobbying of foreign governments, among other things.

Warren, who happens to be gaining ground on former Vice President Joe Biden in Democratic primary polls, was asked Wednesday if her plan would allow the child of a vice president to be appointed to the board of a foreign corporation — a clear reference to Hunter Biden's business in Ukraine while Biden was vice president.

The senator did not seem prepared for that question and noticeably stumbled over her inconclusive response.

""No. I don't — I don't know,"" Warren said. ""I mean, I'd have to go back and look at the details on the plan.""

It was an unflattering moment for a top-tier candidate who has built her reputation and credibility on plans and policy knowledge. It's unclear whether Warren hesitated because she truly didn't know the answer, or whether she was trying to avoid admitting that Biden's son had unethically leveraged his father's position for financial gain overseas.

Warren has avoided directly attacking other Democratic primary candidates, even Biden, who she has been trailing in every poll until recently.

Democrats are also likely to avoid drawing attention to Biden's Ukraine controversy as they try to impeach President Donald Trump over an alleged ""quid pro quo"" arrangement with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Democrats claim Trump tried to leverage foreign aid money to pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden.

A transcript of a July phone call between the two leaders confirmed that the president indeed asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, but he did not say or strongly imply that their failure to do so would have resulted in the withholding of aid.

President Trump did delay the release of the aid to Ukraine a week before the call, eventually releasing it on Sept. 11. Trump has said he delayed it over corruption concerns, and because he felt European countries should be doing more to support Ukraine.

Washington enacts plan to ban non-electric cars by 2030,"Washington State Democrats have enacted a plan that would aim to ban most non-electric vehicles in the state by 2030.

Gov. Jay Inslee (D) signed a bill last week that sets a target for all vehicles of the model year 2030 or later that are sold, purchased, or registered in the state to be electric.

""On or before December 31, 2023, the interagency electric vehicle coordinating council ... shall complete a scoping plan for achieving the 2030 target,"" the new law says.

The bill was passed as part of a $16.9 billion ""Move Ahead Washington"" package signed by Inslee on Friday. The governor said this legislation will combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

""Transportation is our state’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. There is no way to talk about climate change without talking about transportation,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""This package will move us away from the transportation system our grandparents imagined and towards the transportation system our grandchildren dream of.""

Democrats have frequently criticized transportation as one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there's been a 22.9% increase in fossil fuel emissions from transportation between 1990 and 2019, the largest increase of any economic sector.



The sweeping legislation includes funding for several infrastructure projects designed to facilitate a larger transition to electric vehicles, including building thousands of new electric vehicle charging stations. The transportation package will also fund four new hybrid-electric ferries, 25 transit electrification projects, and free fares for riders 18 and younger on public transportation systems, the governor said.

The law was endorsed by environmental groups that seek to end the use of fossil fuels.

""The war in Ukraine and the burden of high gas prices on families demonstrate the importance of ending our dependence on gasoline and preparing for an all-electric transportation future,"" Matthew Metz, co-executive director of Coltura, a nonprofit that advocates for phasing out the use of gasoline, said. ""By targeting 2030 as an end date for the sales of gasoline cars in Washington, Clean Cars 2030 gives confidence to consumers, automakers, utilities, investors, and others that now is the time to go all-in on an all-EV future.""

Coltura worked with Washington Democrats to get the bill passed. The lawmakers who supported the bill made it clear that while it only establishes a target for all-electric vehicles by 2030, the plan is to eventually get rid of any vehicle that uses gasoline in Washington.

""Clean Cars 2030 outlines a clear path forward for the future of the electric vehicle transition in our state,"" state Sen. Marko Liias said. ""This part of our Move Ahead Washington plan will create a timeline with the data, tools, and guidelines that every sector from governments to businesses can plan for with confidence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-enacts-target-to-ban-non-electric-cars-by-2030,2022-03-29
Washington Post gives Adam Schiff '4 Pinocchios' for lies about his committee and the infamous whistleblower,"The Washington Post gave Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) a four-Pinocchio rating for his blatant falsehood about whether or not his committee had knowledge of the whistleblower's complaint about a phone call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine.

What was the lie?

During a Sept. 17 interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Daily Beast politics editor Sam Stein asked Schiff if he had heard or wanted to hear from the whistleblower.

Schiff insisted: ""We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to. But I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.""

In addition, on Sept. 19 Schiff told reporters that if the inspector general had not contacted the House Intelligence Committee, which he chairs, ""we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint alleging an urgent concern.""

However, it soon became apparent that the whistleblower had discussed the matter with a staff member with the House Intelligence Committee before he filed his complaint. According to a report from the New York Times, the whistleblower had sought advice on how to proceed.

What did the Washington Post say?



Before getting into what Schiff said, the Post pointed out that it ""recently took Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to task"" who had himself earned ""four Pinocchios for being disingenuous in his remarks to report to obscure his firsthand knowledge of what took place.""

""But politicians spin all across Washington, often to deflect uncomfortable facts,"" the Post wrote, as it segued into talking about Schiff.

But once they had moved to Schiff's quote, the Post took a firm stance, saying: ""This is flat-out false.""

The paper added that ""there's nothing wrong with dodging a question, as long as you don't try to mislead,"" however, it continued, ""Schiff on 'Morning Joe' clearly made a statement that was false.""

Schiff's office tried to deflect, telling the Washington Post that he had been trying to answer another question, and ""that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear."" The spokesman also suggested that Schiff wasn't sure if the whistleblower who approached the committee was the same one who had filed the report.

But the Post rejected that excuse, saying, ""The explanation that Schiff was not sure it was the same whistleblower especially strains credulity.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-gives-adam-schiff-4-pinocchios-over-infamous-whistleblower,2019-10-04
"Washington Post, NY Times issue major corrections over story that Rudy Giuliani's lawyer called 'totally false'","The Washington Post and New York Times issued major retractions on Saturday after initially reporting that Rudy Giuliani and One America News were warned by the FBI they were targets of a major Russian disinformation campaign during the 2020 presidential election season.

What did the newspapers report?

The Post reported on Thursday the FBI warned Giuliani in late 2019 ""he was the target of a Russian influence operation aimed at circulating falsehoods intended to damage President [Joe] Biden.""

The Post also reported that OAN received a similar warning.

The warning was part of an extensive effort by the bureau to alert members of Congress and at least one conservative media outlet, One America News, that they faced a risk of being used to further Russia's attempt to influence the election's outcome, said several current and former U.S. officials. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter remains highly sensitive. Giuliani received the FBI's warning while deeply involved with former president Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign and related activities in Ukraine to surface unflattering or incriminating information about the Biden family.

Meanwhile, the Times claimed Giuliani had received a ""defensive briefing"" in which FBI agents were ""cautioning him that some of the information he was pushing on the Biden family was tainted by Russian intelligence's efforts to spread disinformation.""

Giuliani flatly denied the allegations.

Giuliani's attorney, Robert Costello, told CNN, ""This story is totally false according to Mayor Giuliani. He never received any such briefing.""

What did the retraction say?

The Post issued a retraction acknowledging that neither Giuliani nor OAN received warnings from the FBI as the newspaper initially claimed.

At the top of the story, an editor's note reads:

Correction: An earlier version of this story, published Thursday, incorrectly reported that One America News was warned by the FBI that it was the target of a Russian influence operation. That version also said the FBI had provided a similar warning to Rudolph W. Giuliani, which he has since disputed. This version has been corrected to remove assertions that OAN and Giuliani received the warnings.

The Times, on the other hand, initially edited out their claims about Giuliani having received a warning from the FBI without including an editor's note explaining the correction.

However, the newspaper later added the following note at the bottom of its story, ""An earlier version of this article misstated whether Rudolph W. Giuliani received a formal warning from the F.B.I. about Russian disinformation. Mr. Giuliani did not receive such a so-called defensive briefing.""

A spokesperson for the New York Times claimed editors delayed including a correction notice because they needed to deliberate ""correction language.""

""We decided to update the story as quickly as possible to stop perpetuating the incorrect information while we reviewed correction language,"" the spokesperson said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-new-york-times-issue-major-correction-rudy-giuliani-fbi-warning,2021-05-01
Washington Post staffer 'horrified and humiliated' after co-worker misidentifies her as Breonna Taylor,"A Washington Post staffer is under fire after making the ultimate gaffe: confusing the names of Post video technician Breanna Muir and late police shooting victim Breonna Taylor, Fox News reported.

What are the details?

In a lengthy Twitter thread, the Post's director of video, Micah Gelman, misidentified Muir as ""Breanna Taylor"" — as both share similar first names — while lauding the outlet's coverage of the Ukraine crisis.

Muir took to LinkedIn, where she decried Gelman's careless mistake, which she said ""horrified and humiliated"" her.

She wrote, ""It’s very disheartening that this is my first post on LinkedIn but I felt like I needed to stand up for myself. On Sunday, the Director of Video misidentified me as Breanna Taylor on Twitter. My name is NOT Breonna Taylor, the black woman who was murdered in 2020. My name is Breanna Muir, the black woman who has dedicated 4 years of her life to the Washington Post. I feel horrified and humiliated.""

Muir explained that the incident even made her parents cry.

""It has been difficult for me to explain to my black parents that the Director of Video is referring to me as Breonna Taylor in public,"" Muir added. ""This was the first time that I witnessed my black mother and black father cry. Although, Breonna and I share the same ethnicity, we are two different people. Please stop misidentifying people of color in the workplace. It is not okay and I’m not okay. I pray that these type of ‘mix-ups’ never happen to anyone.""





What was the outlet's response?

In a statement on the mix-up, a spokesperson for the Post told Fox News Digital that the company realizes the ""emotional toll"" the mishap must have taken on Muir and her loved ones.

""Our director of video has apologized both publicly and privately for his mistake,"" the statement said. ""However, we do not take the impact of that error lightly and regret the emotional toll it has had on Breanna. We have also reached out to her and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment throughout the newsroom.""

Gelman himself tweeted an apology for the gaffe and attributed the error to ""working extremely long hours"" during a highly irregular and politically charged news cycle.

""In a long thread last night thanking my staff for working exhaustive hours, I inadvertently misidentified Breanna Muir,"" Gelman wrote. ""I reached out to her to apologize and do so here now. We are all working extremely long hours and while this was not intentional, it should not have happened.""

What was the response to this?

Much of social media appeared to be divided over the snafu, with some supporting Muir and others empathizing with Gelman for the inadvertent mistake.

One user wrote, ""It’s difficult to make an apology sound sincere when it’s wrapped in excuses.""

Another complained, ""[M]isidentified as the murdered black woman, 'Breanna Taylor'… multiple times. Please do better and don’t blame exhaustive hours for unchecked prejudice you have.""

""He called his black female colleague the name of a black woman who was murdered by the police. The idea that race has nothing to do with it is absurd,"" another user reasoned.

Others stated that the gaffe was trivial in comparison to what is happening across the globe at the current time.

""If this is the most tragic thing to have ever happened to Ms. Muir, I think it's about time for her to get outdoors a bit more. There are people in another country who are literally having bombs dropped on their heads — pretty sure they would happily trade places with her,"" one user wrote.

Another added, ""Big deal, man. There are more pressing issues in the world now. Cut yourself some slack, and ignore the people who will try to cancel you over a petty mistake.""

""She's an overdramatic drama queen,"" another user said, referring to Muir. ""You made a mistake. She makes it seem like she was kidnapped for 10 years.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-staffer-horrified-and-humiliated-after-co-worker-misidentifies-her-as-breonna-taylor,2022-03-02
The Washington Post waits 18 months to confirm details of Hunter Biden's deals with Chinese energy company,"Ten days after the New York Times admitted that the Hunter Biden laptop story was real, the Washington Post published a lengthy examination of emails and other documents detailing Biden's multimillion-dollar payout from business dealings with a Chinese energy company.

The Post's report confirms key details about the Biden family's lucrative deals with CEFC China Energy, which had first been reported by the New York Post and others in October 2020. At the time, the mainstream media outlets including the Washington Post smeared the Biden emails story as Russian disinformation, and then-candidate Joe Biden used those reports as a shield against questions regarding his involvement with Hunter's business relationships.



Government records, court documents, bank statements, and emails from Biden's laptop reviewed by the Washington Post now confirm that the Chinese energy conglomerate paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden. New documents obtained by the Post include a copy of a $1 million legal retainer, emails related to the wire transfers, and $3.8 million in consulting fees that are confirmed in bank records and agreements signed by Hunter Biden.



While potential energy projects that Hunter Biden discussed with CEFC were never completed, Hunter Biden still received at least $3.79 million in payments from the company through consulting contracts, the Washington Post reported.

Biden was also given a $1 million retainer, issued as part of an agreement to represent Patrick Ho, a CEFC official who was later charged in the United States in connection with a multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe leaders from Chad and Uganda. The Post obtained a copy of the retainer agreement, which contained the signatures of both Hunter Biden and Ho, who has since been convicted and was sentenced to three years in prison.



Hunter Biden's business deals with China and with the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings Ltd. have been controversial and may have been criminal. Federal prosecutors are investigating Biden for potential tax crimes involving failure to pay taxes on foreign income related to these business relationships. Republicans, meanwhile, have sought to link President Joe Biden to his son's activities, claiming that the Biden family profited from their patriarch's public service. Former President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers have also accused Joe Biden of having conflicts of interest involving Hunter Biden's previous tenure as a member of Burisma's board.

In a separate story, the Washington Post explained that outside security experts worked to verify the emails obtained from Hunter Biden's laptop, which is currently in the custody of the FBI. The experts reportedly could not verify most of the nearly 129,000 emails contained on the laptop, nor did they find clear evidence of tampering, which would suggest the contents of the laptop's hard drive were fabricated. The emails related to Hunter Biden's deals with CEFC were corroborated by the other documents obtained by the Washington Post.

The newspaper acknowledged that the contents of Biden's laptop have ""sparked debate and controversy,"" noting that Facebook and Twitter in 2020 ""restricted distribution of stories about the drive’s contents out of concern that the revelations might have resulted from a nefarious hacking campaign intended to upend the election, much as Russian hacks of sensitive Democratic Party emails shaped the trajectory of the 2016 election.""

The Post did not explain why it only now has attempted to verify the contents of Biden's laptop, 18 months after the New York Post broke the story and well after the 2020 presidential election.

The Post's report stated that there is no evidence that President Joe Biden ""benefited from or knew details about the transactions with CEFC."" Reached for comment, the White House directed the Washington Post to previous statements that Joe Biden ""has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever.”

But this claim was contested in 2020 by Tony Bobulinski, a man who claimed to be a former business associate of Hunter Biden. In the weeks after the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story but before the 2020 presidential election, Bobulinski said that his company, Sinohawk Holdings, had formed a partnership with CEFC and the Biden family.

One of the now-verified Hunter Biden emails reported by the New York Post detailed ""remuneration packages"" for six individuals identified only by initials who were party to the business venture with CEFC. The email, written by James Gilliar of the international consulting firm J2cR, names Hunter Biden as the ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC (China Energy Co)"" and notes his pay was to be ""850."" Hunter Biden was identified with the letter ""H"" in the email, according to the New York Post.

Among the terms of the deal, the email stated, ""10 held by H for the big guy?""

Bobulinski claimed that the ""big guy"" referred to Joe Biden in a statement to the New York Post.

""Hunter Biden called his dad 'the Big Guy' or 'my Chairman,' and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,"" Bobulinski said in 2020. ""I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.""

He also accused Joe Biden of telling a ""blatant lie"" when he denied having any knowledge of his son's business relationship with CEFC China Energy.

Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) have sought more details on the Biden family's business relationships with ""communist China."" On Monday, the lawmakers gave speeches on the Senate floor defending the conclusions of a September 2020 report they put together on the financial connections between Hunter Biden and China, Ukraine, and other foreign countries.



“Our report exposed extensive financial relationships between Hunter and James Biden and Chinese nationals connected to the communist regime,” Grassley said. ""More precisely, these were Chinese nationals connected to the Chinese government’s military and intelligence services.”

He focused on CEFC, noting the now-defunct company's ties to the Chinese government.

“CEFC operated under the guise of a private company but was for all intents and purposes an arm of the Chinese government,” Grassley said. “Hunter Biden and James Biden served as the perfect vehicle by which the communist Chinese government could gain inroads here in the United States through CEFC and its affiliates.""

The Iowa senator said he and Johnson would soon release new documents detailing ""additional connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese regime.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-waits-18-months-to-confirm-details-of-hunter-bidens-deals-with-chinese-energy-company,2022-03-30
WATCH: Adam Schiff confronted for putting words in President Trump's mouth in fake 'parody',"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) chose to put words in President Donald Trump's mouth last week to further his version of events of what he believes Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the Biden's in July.

On Sunday, ABC host George Stephanopoulos confronted Schiff over his ""parody,"" which led to widespread backlash.

""If the facts are as damning as you say why make up dialogue for dramatic effect, even if it's a parody as you say?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

Schiff, however, dodged the question and attacked the president.

""Well George, you're right. The call speaks for itself and it is plenty damning,"" Schiff responded.

""But let's not pretend that this is really what the president is upset with me about,"" he continued. ""I can tell you exactly why the president is furious with me, and that is because when I learned that a whistleblower had filed a credible and urgent complaint that was being withheld from Congress — and no one in the country knew about this yet — I went public to demand that we get that complaint.""

In his opening remarks at last Thursday's House Intelligence Committee hearing that featured testimony from Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, Schiff created a fictional version of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky that did not accurately portray the call notes the White House had released.



Schiff was later criticized during the hearing for offering what he characterized as a ""parody"" and said ""the fact that that's not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.""



In response, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the newly elected leader of the House Freedom Caucus, introduced a resolution to censure Schiff for his ""egregiously false and fabricated retelling"" that ""had no relationship to the call itself.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-adam-schiff-confronted,2019-09-29
Watch: CNN's Don Lemon laughs until he cries as pundits portray Trump supporters as stupid hicks,"Anti-Trump Republican Rick Wilson and New York Times op-ed writer Wajahat Ali had CNN host Don Lemon in stitches Saturday night while doing impressions on air depicting supporters of President Donald Trump as uneducated rednecks.

What are the details?

The Daily Wire reported on the segment from over the weekend and provided a script of the exchange that occurred on CNN, along with the video posted by former CNN (and former TheBlaze) employee Steve Krakauer, who tweeted, ""The arrogance, the dismissiveness, the smug cackling, the accents. If Donald Trump wins re-election this year, I'll remember this brief CNN segment late one Saturday night in January as the perfect encapsulation for why it happened.""



Wilson kicked off the impression contest after being asked about reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""screamed and cursed"" at an NPR reporter and ordered her to point out Ukraine on a map.

""Look,"" Wilson said of Pompeo. ""He also knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it. He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world, and so that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience, you now, the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump, that wants to think that 'Donald Trump's the smart one, and y'all — y'all elitists are dumb.'""

With Lemon laughing, snorting, and eventually wiping away tears, Ali joins in with his own impression of a redneck accent, saying, ""You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling...your reading...knowing other countries...sipping your latte.""

Appearing to realize he may have gone too far, Ali said, ""Sorry, I apologize..."" while chuckling, ""It was Rick's fault. I blame Rick.""

The two went back and forth, cracking each other up, mocking Trump supporters, as Lemon was doubled over with amusement before the host said, ""That was good, sorry. Rick — that was a good one. I needed that.""

Anything else?

Ali and Wilson are both unapologetic despite the backlash that occurred after their segment went viral.

In reaction to a RealClearPolitics story saying the two ""trash[ed] Trump supporters as ignorant Rubes,"" Ali tweeted, ""We did. Not going to apologize for it either. If you're willing to believe and promote these absurd and dangerous lies, well, you deserve to be mocked for it.""



After President Trump retweeted the clip shared by the Daily Caller, Wilson tweeted, ""The most beautiful part of this entirely contrived phony bullshit outrage about that segment isn't that I insulted the Maga demo. The best part is how they're repeating the now-classic #UCrane bit and amplifying a line that clearly made @realDonaldTrump furious.""

"WATCH LIVE: Trump gives press conference after releasing Ukraine phone call transcript, as impeachment momentum builds","President Trump Participates in a Press Conference www.youtube.com

President Donald Trump held a press conference on Wednesday, hours after releasing a transcript of a controversy-causing phone call he had with the president of Ukraine. Trump had asked the Ukrainian president to investigate business dealings that current Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, had with a natural gas firm in Ukraine. This phone call, originally reported by an anonymous whistleblower within the U.S. government, has led to an increased number of Democrats, now including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), to call for Trump's impeachment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-live-trump-gives-press-conference-after-releasing-ukraine-phone-call-transcript-as-impeachment-momentum-builds,2019-09-25
"Watch: Mark Meadows walks past MSNBC reporter during live shot, returns to refute her spin","Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) was quick to refute the spin of an MSNBC reporter in real time on Wednesday, walking past a live broadcast before turning around to push back against the journalist's claim that ""Republicans are really struggling to defend"" President Donald Trump in the midst of impeachment proceedings launched against him by House Democrats.

What are the details?

MSNBC reporter Leigh Ann Caldwell was in the middle of a live shot from Capitol Hill when she noticed Meadows approaching and asked him to speak with her. Meadows continued past Caldwell at a brisk pace as the reporter told her audience, ""Republicans are really struggling to defend the president.""

With that, Meadows did an about-face, stepped back into the camera frame and argued, ""I'm not struggling on anything. The Republicans are not struggling on anything.""



Meadows continued to speak with Caldwell as additional reporters gathered around. After a brief back-and-forth, Caldwell asked Meadows, ""Big picture...is it getting more difficult to defend this president as more of these testimonies come out?""

""No, actually,"" Meadows responded. ""As we hear more testimony — in fact, the testimony that we're hearing today — it's actually getting easier to defend the president from the standpoint there is no linkage between aid. In fact, what we're hearing today, is this is part of a broader analysis in foreign aid in general in terms of what we should do. It wasn't just Ukraine where the aid was held up.""



House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump based on allegations that the White House withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure the country's government to relaunch a corruption probe against a Ukrainian gas firm linked to Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Hill reported that Republicans have argued the White House had no such quid pro quo with Ukraine, while Democrats have argued ""that the mere attempt by Trump to persuade Ukraine's president to open an investigation into Biden constitutes an attempt to solicit foreign interference in a U.S. election.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-mark-meadows-walks-past-msnbc-reporter-during-live-shot-returns-to-refute-her-spin,2019-11-06
Watchdog firm finds another troubling conflict of interest in Hunter Biden's post at Burisma,"Hunter Biden was paid both as member of the governing board and as a consultant to company management in his post at Burisma Holdings, an arrangement that is prohibited in the United States, an independent research firm reported Tuesday.

Biden also received more than 12 times the comparable pay for board members at similarly sized companies.

The findings come from Watchdog Research and were posted in a RealClearInvestigations report.

According to the report:

The authors, Watchdog Research principles Brian Lawe and John Cheffers, say arrangements such as Hunter Biden's — being a corporate governance monitor while also a paid consultant to company management — are prohibited in the United States. Federal securities law forbids anyone from serving as an independent board member if they ""accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee.""



""Obviously, U.S. law does not apply to a private foreign entity because that company is not subject to federal securities law,"" Lawe and Cheffers write. But, they say, ""by accepting 'consulting' payments AND board compensation, Hunter Biden was potentially breaking a cardinal rule created to promote good governance and stop corruption.""

Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden's son, was hired to the board at Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company, a month after his father was appointed to political advisory responsibilities over Ukraine in March 2014.

Despite Biden having had no experience in the oil and gas industry or in serving on boards of for-profit businesses, the company paid him an uncharacteristically high salary — ""records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were paid"" to Hunter Biden's company for ""consulting services,"" according to Reuters.

The payments amount to nearly $1 million per year each for Biden and his business partner and co-Burisma board member Devon Archer.

Watchdog Research, citing a 2017 Harvard study on board compensation, says that the payout amounts to more than 12 times the comparable pay, or more for Biden in a month than board members at similarly-sized companies would be paid in a year.

The Watchdog Research report notes how this puts Hunter Biden between a rock and a hard place: ""If he received the money for consulting, then it would be hard to argue that he was overpaid, but it would be easy to argue that his claims of being an independent director 'focused on governance' are a sham.""

In order to be qualified as an independent director, as Biden claims he was for Burisma, ""the director can have no 'material' relationship with the company prior to serving on the board,"" according to the New York Stock Exchange's guidance.

This appears not to be the case for Biden, as his attorney George Mesires previously said in a statement that Biden was already ""advising Burisma on its corporate reform initiatives"" in his capacity at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner before being asked to join the board.

Also, in that same ABC News interview last month where Biden claimed that his role at Burisma was simply to provide ""corporate governance,"" he also admitted that he would ""probably not"" have been offered the seat on Burisma's board if his father had not been vice president.

The Bidens' involvement with Burisma caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky requested an investigation into the matter.

It was this phone call that led to the House impeachment inquiry against President Trump, proponents of the inquiry claiming that Trump ordering an investigation into his political opponents, and possibly withholding military aid to Ukraine as a quid pro quo, amount to an impeachable offense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watchdog-troubling-conflict-biden-burisma,2019-11-19
"Wells Fargo vows to 'advance racial equity in homeownership' while cutting back on jobs, mortgage lending overall","Wells Fargo, one of the most prominent lending institutions in America, has just announced that it has restructured its goals. For decades, Wells Fargo prioritized overall lending as well as what it calls the ""Correspondent business"" — a practice whereby one financial institution handles the transactions of another institution. However, a Jan. 10 press release announced that it has now decided to ""exit"" correspondence and focus instead on becoming ""the primary mortgage lender to Wells Fargo bank customers as well as minority homebuyers.""

Wells Fargo claimed that it now wants to serve its current customer base, rather than expand its influence. It also claimed that it wants to target so-called ""underserved communities"" and has even partnered with several racial and ethnic activist groups to achieve that end.

""We will continue to expand our programs to reach more customers in underserved communities by leveraging our strong partnerships with the National Urban League, UnidosUS and other non-profit organizations,"" said Senior Executive Vice President Kristy Fercho, who also heads the diverse segments, representation, and inclusion division at Wells Fargo.

According to the New York Post, Wells Fargo has committed to:

investing $100 million ""to advance racial equity in homeownership,""

investing $150 million to assist ""more Black and Hispanic families achieve homeownership"" through home and refinance loans, and

""deploying"" more qualified mortgage lending consultants to ""local minority communities.""

This press release, as well as another announcement released Thursday, indicate that fealty to diversity, equity, and inclusion may have been the driving force behind these policy shifts. When Fercho joined the Walls Fargo team last November, she was not only hired to lead the DEI department, but she was also put in charge of home lending, a hint that the two divisions might soon become more closely united in business practices.

Fercho's bio states that, in addition to the Wells Fargo Foundation, she sits on the respective boards of ""the National Urban League, Opens Doors Foundation, [and] City Year."" She is also affiliated with the REACh initiative, a leftist, U.N.-adjacent group billed as a humanitarian organization. REACh currently advocates for continued intervention in Ukraine and the so-called climate ""crisis.""

In order to divert more resources to these race-based socio-political goals, Fercho and other executives have had to restructure the Wells Fargo workforce. According to Hugh Son of CNBC, Wells Fargo has admitted that it has had to lay off workers in addition to the thousands who were laid off or left their jobs voluntarily last year. However, it would not specify how many layoffs had occurred for this most recent retrenchment.



Wells Fargo, once the largest mortgage lender in the industry, has also had to contend with its brand, which is still tarnished after a scandal erupted in 2016. News exposés and whistleblowers demonstrated that, in order to reach new customer goals, the institution was creating as many as 3.5 million new accounts on behalf of customers without their consent.

""We are acutely aware of Wells Fargo’s history since 2016 and the work we need to do to restore public confidence,"" said consumer lending chief Kleber Santos. ""As part of that review, we determined that our home-lending business was too large, both in terms of overall size and its scope.""

Western nations isolate Russia's economy by kicking them out of SWIFT,"In a drastic move to sanction Russia for invading Ukraine, the leadership of several Western nations agreed to exclude Russian banks from the SWIFT communication network.

In a joint statement, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to removing specific Russian banks from the SWIFT network.

“We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion,” the statement proclaimed, “Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

“As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities,” the statement continued, “We are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days.”

The Western leaders committed to:

“Ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system.”

“Imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”

“Acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine” and to “limit the sale of citizenship … that let wealthy Russians connected to the government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.”

“Launching this coming week a transatlantic task force that will ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions.”

The Western leaders made clear that it would work with governments across the globe to “detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains” and would “deny” prominent Russian figures the ability to launder their wealth abroad.

By preventing Russia from utilizing the SWIFT communication network, Western leaders will effectively isolate them and inhibit them from conducting trade with many of its largest trade partners. This move will also interfere with Russia’s ability to export natural gas and oil, which makes up more than half of the country’s GDP.

The statement ended with a declaration of solidarity with the Ukrainian people “in this dark hour” and affirmed that the West is prepared to launch stricter sanctions against Russia should it become necessary to do so.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/western-nations-isolate-russia-s-economy-by-kicking-them-out-of-swift,2022-02-26
"When Fox News reporter confronts the president over recent string of gaffes, Biden denies they ever happened","Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy confronted President Joe Biden Monday over a recent string of gaffes. Bizarrely, the president claimed none of the gaffes actually occurred.

What is the background?

White House aides have worked overtime in recent days to correct several alleged misstatements from Biden.

First, Biden appeared to tell American forces they were going to Ukraine. The White House said that was not true.

Second, Biden appeared to say the U.S. and NATO were prepared to use chemical weapons in Ukraine if Russia first used them. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, however, said the U.S. was not going to use chemical weapons.

Second, Biden appeared to say the U.S. and NATO were prepared to use chemical weapons in Ukraine if Russia first used them. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, however, said the U.S. was not going to use chemical weapons. Third, Biden appeared to call for regime change in Russia. The White House said that was not the official stance of the U.S. government.

What happened with Doocy?

While taking questions at the White House, Doocy asked Biden whether his repeated misstatements were sowing doubt among U.S. allies, referring to Biden's declaration last year that ""America is back.""

But Biden was apparently unaware that his statements were walked back by the White House.

""Are you worried that other leaders in the world are going to start to doubt that America is back if some of these big things that you say on the world stage keep getting walked back?"" Doocy asked.

""What’s getting walked back?"" the president asked.

When Doocy reminded Biden what he said and about the White House's corrections, Biden declared, ""None of the three occurred.""

When Doocy pressed Biden further, the president claimed his language had been misinterpreted and was missing context. Instead of telling the Army's 82nd Airborne Division they were headed to Ukraine, Biden claimed he was speaking to Ukrainian soldiers in Poland.

Biden then affirmed that if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine it would ""trigger a significant response,"" but declined to provide details.

""I’m not going to tell you. Why would I tell you? You've got to be silly,"" Biden told Doocy.

""The world wants to know,"" Doocy pressed.

""The world wants to know a lot of things. I’m not telling them what the response would be, then Russia knows the response,"" Biden responded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/when-fox-news-reporter-confronts-the-president-over-recent-string-of-gaffes-biden-denies-they-ever-happened,2022-03-29
Whistleblower complaint regarding President Trump's phone call to Ukrainian president accuses Trump of soliciting interference in 2020 election,"A whistleblower's accusations about a phone call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine was controversial enough to cause Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her allies in the House of Representatives to back impeachment. The White House has dismissed it as a complaint over nothing. Now the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has declassified the letter so that anyone can see what it actually says.

What did the letter say?



In the letter, which was written to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who chair the Intelligence Committees in their respective houses of Congress, the still anonymous whistleblower reported that he had heard from ""multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

The whistleblower admitted that they were ""not a direct witness to most of the events described."" However, they said that they thought the information about these events given by colleagues was ""credible because, in almost all cases, multiple officials recounted fact patters that were consistent with one another.""

The complaint focused on a phone call that Trump had made with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the transcript of which the White House released yesterday.

The whistleblower's account of events does seem to generally match up with the transcript of the call. The complaint accused Trump of asking Zelensky to talk with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, about investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's dealings with Ukraine; the transcript confirmed this. It also said that Trump had asked Zelensky to look into whether claims of Russian interference in 2016 started in Ukraine, and to turn over servers used by the DNC in 2016; the phone call transcript also confirmed this.

The crucial difference between the two accounts is that the whistleblower said that these conversation topics might ""pose risks to national security and undermine the U.S. Government's efforts to deter and counter foreign election interference in U.S. elections.""

Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the call as being ""perfect,"" portrayed it as simply business as usual. The president was also quick to point out that there was no evidence in the transcript of any ""quid pro quo"" from the U.S. if Ukraine agreed to what the president had asked.

There's more, about a classified server

The whistleblower also accused the White House of initially trying to hide the transcript, by sticking it on a ""computer system managed directly by the National Security Council (NSC) Directorate for Intelligence Programs,"" which was ""a standalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action."" This would be unusual since nothing in the phone call itself was considered to be classified or sensitive information.

The whistleblower said that multiple White House officials had revealed that this was ""not the first time"" that the Trump administration had put something in this secure system ""solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive — rather than national security sensitive — information.""

In a press conference on Wednesday, Trump volunteered that anyone who wanted could also read the transcript from an earlier call he had with Zelensky, as well as two calls between Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/whistleblower-complaint-regarding-trumps-phone-call-to-ukrainian-president-accuses-president-of-soliciting-interference-in-2020-election,2019-09-26
"Whistleblower had 'political bias' against President Trump in favor of 'rival candidate,' according to intel IG document: report","The White House is preparing to release a document showing that intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson discovered that the whistleblower who lodged a complaint against President Donald Trump had ""political bias"" in favor of a ""rival candidate.""

Fox News reported the development late Tuesday, citing senior Trump administration officials with direct knowledge of the document. The officials did not disclose which presidential candidate the whistleblower favors.

From Fox News:

The senior administration official told Fox News that the White House had nothing to hide, that there has been no wrongdoing, and that the White House's general position has been that it will make everything possible available to Congress or the public regarding Trump's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general.



A senior administration official told Fox News there are a ""few words"" in the transcript that will raise eyebrows, but it is nowhere near as inflammatory as Democrats have suggested.

The development is significant because the whistleblower complaint, involving Trump's July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky among possibly other concerns, has become the central tenant of Democrats' ""impeachment inquiry"" against the president.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused Trump of violating the Constitution in announcing the inquiry Tuesday. ""The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution,"" she said.

In response, the White House said they would release a transcript of Trump's conversation with Zelensky, Atkinson's report, and the whistleblower complaint — so long as such disclosures do not violate the law.

However, numerous reports suggest the documents, especially the phone call transcript, will be underwhelming.

The controversy stems primarily from allegations that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. Democrats allege Trump's intentions were to somehow sway the 2020 election.

However, Ukraine denies that Trump pressured their president.

The controversy reached a fevered pitch last week after the Washington Post reported that Atkinson classified the whistleblower complaint as an ""urgent concern,"" meaning it legally needed to be shared with Congress.

But Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire disagreed the document met the legal definition of ""urgent concern,"" and therefore did not need to be fully disclosed to lawmakers. Democrats framed the decision as Trump's administration withholding vital national security information from Congress.

Despite the whistleblower's bias against Trump, the Justice Department said in a memo Wednesday the accusations remained ""credible.

This story has been updated to add information about the Justice Departmement's memo.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/whistleblower-had-political-bias-against-president-trump-in-favor-of-rival-candidate-report-says,2019-09-25
Whistleblower on Ukraine had 'professional' ties to one of the Democratic 2020 candidates,"A new report published Tuesday cast more light on the possible political motivations of the whistleblower on the president's Ukraine call.

Byron York of the Washington Examiner reported that the whistleblower had a professional tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

It had been previously revealed that the whistleblower was registered to vote as a Democrat, but it appears that there was much greater evidence of ""arguable political bias.""

The report comes from sources with knowledge of a statement from Intelligence Community inspector general Michael Atkinson to Republicans during an impeachment inquiry interview.

""What [Atkinson] said was that the whistleblower self-disclosed that he was a registered Democrat and that he had a prior working relationship with a current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate,"" said one of the sources.

However, Atkinson made it clear that although this was a sign of possible bias, the complaint from the whistleblower still appeared credible.

Atkinson wrote, ""such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible,' particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.""

York reported that Atkinson did not divulge which of the candidates had ties to the whistleblower.

The complaint from the whistleblower lead to to Democrats commencing an official impeachment inquiry against the president.

Whistleblower's attorney boasted of getting security clearance for 'guys who had child porn issues',"Mark Zaid — a lawyer representing the whistleblower whose complaint catapulted House Democrats' impeachment probe against President Donald Trump — is under fire for boasting on Twitter last year that he successfully helped ""guys who had child porn issues"" gain security clearances from the U.S. government.

What are the details?

In reaction to a Slate article questioning how an alleged domestic abuser was granted clearance, Zaid bragged, ""I've gotten clearances for guys who had child porn issues.""



The Daily Caller reached out to Zaid regarding the comment ,and the attorney elaborated: ""I have represented numerous individuals who have all sorts of issues involving their security clearances, including allegations of child porn, which turn out to be rarely true,"" he explained. ""Every time I prevail in a case, the USGOVTP determines it is in the national security interests of our country to grant these individuals access to classified information.""

This is the second time in a week Zaid has faced scrutiny for resurfaced Twitter comments, as they trickle in amid the lawyer's high-profile representation of the anonymous whistleblower at the heart of the House Democrats' impeachment of the president.

Earlier in the week, Fox News published a series of tweets from Zaid made soon after the president took office, where the lawyer called for a ""coup"" and ""rebellion"" against the commander in chief.

Zaid attempted to clarify those messages with a statement, too, and reiterated that he was, indeed, referring to an ongoing ""coup"" back in 2017 — albeit, a legal one.

President Trump pointed to Zaid's public comments from 2017 as evidence that the impeachment is ""all a hoax"" and ""a scam.""

Anything else?

On Thursday, Andrew Bakaj, another attorney who joins Zaid in representing the whistleblower, send a cease-and-desist order to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, warning the president to stop attacking his client.

""I am writing out of deep concern that your client, the President of the United States, is engaging in rhetoric and activity that places my client, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower, and their family in physical danger,"" Bajak wrote, according to CNN. ""I am writing to respectfully request that you counsel your client on the legal and ethical peril in which he is placing himself should anyone be physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates', behavior.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/whistleblowers-attorney-boasted-of-getting-security-clearance-for-guys-who-had-child-porn-issues,2019-11-09
Whistleblower's lawyer reiterates: 'Coup' against President Trump began the week he took office,"Mark Zaid — an attorney representing the whistleblower whose complaint against President Donald Trump was used to spur House Democrats' impeachment probe — has come out in defense of controversial tweets he made in 2017, where he called for a ""coup"" and ""rebellion"" against the president.

In a statement to Fox News on Thursday, Zaid reiterated that he meant to use the term ""coup"" and was describing insider resistance against President Trump that he says began ""just a week into"" the president's term.

What are the details?

On Jan. 30, 2017, Zaid tweeted, ""#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow ultimately. #lawyers.""



Zaid made a series of similar statements against President Trump on Twitter within months of the president taking office, and those messages have resurfaced in recent days. The president read some of the tweets out loud during a rally in Louisiana Wednesday night, and suggested they are evidence that the impeachment is ""all a hoax"" and ""a scam.""

The next morning, the president tweeted, ""Based on the information released last night about the Fake Whistleblowers attorney, the Impeachment Hoax should be ended IMMEDIATELY! There is no case, except against the other side!""



Also on Thursday, Zaid issued a statement to Fox News in an attempt to clarify what he meant in his controversial messages, and he did not back down, writing:

Those tweets were reflective and repeated the sentiments of millions of people. I was referring to a completely lawful process of what President Trump would likely face as a result of stepping over the line, and that particularly whatever would happen would come about as a result of lawyers.

White House adviser says he got info from China on Hunter Biden and a $1.5 billion payment from the Bank of China,"Michael Pillsbury, an informal adviser to the White House on China, told the Financial Times that he received ""quite a bit of background"" information from his contacts in the country related to Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, and a $1.5 billion payment from the Bank of China.

Pillsbury would not fully divulge the details of the information he received, but did say he found the Chinese to be extremely secretive and guarded about Hunter Biden's business dealings in China.

""I tried to bring up the topic in Beijing,"" Pillsbury told Fox Business last week. ""I've never seen them get so secretive in my entire life. They would discuss ICBM warheads sooner than talk about what Hunter Biden was doing in China with Vice President Biden.""

While we don't know what exactly Pillsbury allegedly learned from his Chinese contacts, the $1.5 billion amount referenced is the same as the amount President Donald Trump claimed Hunter Biden received from the Bank of China, although that claim was not backed up with evidence.

Pillsbury would not say whether he was asked by President Trump to ask about the Bidens in China. He later denied that he told FT he received info on the Bidens, but the reporter, Demetri Sevastopulo, shared an email confirming the report.

Biden has dismissed all accusations of wrongdoing in China and in Ukraine as ""flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears"" that the president is using to ""undermine my candidacy for the presidency.""



President Trump and his allies have been working to highlight alleged conflicts of interest and corruption by Joe and Hunter Biden in Ukraine, where Hunter was paid $50,000 per month as a board member for the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. Trump allies have also claimed that Biden's corruption extends past Ukraine to other countries, including China and Romania.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-adviser-hunter-biden-bank-of-china,2019-10-10
White House budget office defends Ukraine aid delay as legal and routine in new memo,"The White House Office of Management and Budget defended the delay in Ukraine military aid as both routine and legal, denying Democratic allegations that it was an irregular abuse of power by President Donald Trump, according to the Washington Post.

The budget office detailed the reasons for the aid delay in a memo that was a response to an inquiry by the Government Accountability Office. The temporary withholding of the aid, and the reasons for it, are central questions in the House impeachment inquiry.

In the memo, OMB general counsel Mark Paoletta said the aid was initially paused in mid-June after the president became aware of it via a media report and, according to the Post, ""questioned the wisdom of the spending.""

The aid delay was extended eight times throughout August and September before being released on Sept. 11 at the urging of Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). These delays, Paoletta wrote, were normal and fully within the authority of the White House.

""For decades, OMB has routinely used its apportionment authority to prevent funds from being used,"" Paoletta wrote in the memo. ""Often, in managing appropriations, OMB must briefly pause an agency's legal ability to spend those funds for a number of reasons, including to ensure that the funds are being spent efficiently, that they are being spent in accordance with statutory directives, or to assess how or whether funds should be used for a particular activity.""

Trump and his allies have maintained that they had concerns over corruption in Ukraine, and whether aid sent to the nation would be used properly. The president also expressed displeasure with the level of contribution to Ukraine from European countries.

Democrats' impeachment efforts have sought to emphasize the potential national security consequences of withholding the aid and to portray Trump's motives as political. They allege that he withheld the aid in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to publicly announce investigations into potential Ukrainian election interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and into Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and his appointment to the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

"White House sends blistering letter to House Judiciary Committee, will not participate in impeachment hearing","The White House will not participate in the House Judiciary Committee's first public impeachment hearing Wednesday, White House counsel Pat Cipollone told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) over the weekend.

Writing in a blistering five-page letter Sunday, Cipollone ripped the ""baseless and highly partisan"" process that ""violates all past historical precedent, basic due process rights, and fundamental fairness.""

""We cannot fairly be expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will afford the President a fair process through additional hearings,"" Cipollone wrote.

""Accordingly, under the current circumstances, we do not intend to participate in your Wednesday hearing,"" he said.

Wednesday's hearing will include testimony from constitutional scholars and legal experts who will discuss the impeachment process and whether the allegations of wrongdoing against the president clear the Constitution's ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" standard for impeachment, Politico reported.

Cipollone said the academic discussion ""does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process.""

The letter echoed Cipollone's previous public statements about the impeachment inquiry, which he has called ""illegitimate,"" because it lacks the due process that Republicans believe should be afforded to the president. So far, the president's legal team has not been allowed to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses.

""It is too late to cure the profound procedural deficiencies that have tainted this entire inquiry,"" Cipollone said.

However, the White House may yet participate in future hearings, Cipollone said. ""If you are serious about conducting a fair process going forward, and in order to protect the rights and privileges of the President, we may consider participating in future Judiciary Committee proceedings if you afford the Administration the ability to do so meaningfully.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-letter-to-house-judiciary-committee-will-not-participate-in-impeachment-hearing,2019-12-02
White House officials won't confirm whether the president has discussed pardoning Hunter Biden,"On Thursday, White House officials refused to discuss whether there had been internal conversations about President Joe Biden pardoning his son Hunter or brother James should their foreign business dealings land them in legal trouble.

The Washington Examiner reported that when asked about this, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said, “That’s not a hypothetical I’m going to entertain. I don’t have anything to add.”

When asked about the president’s knowledge of his son’s and brother’s complicated international business dealings and financial interests, Bedingfield provided reporters roundabout answers and avoided engaging with the questions posed.

One reporter asked, “Is it your understanding it’s the president’s view that as he looks at all of Hunter Biden’s business dealings with his uncle, neither Hunter Biden nor James Biden committed any crimes or did anything that was unlawful?”

“We pointed to statements that were made in the fall of 2020 when we addressed these questions,” Bedingfield replied. “I don’t have anything additional to add from this podium.”

Since 2018, Hunter Biden has been under federal investigation to see whether he, or his business connections, broke tax law, laundered money, or broke foreign lobbying laws in holding meetings and conducting business in places such as China and Russia.

Hunter Biden denies any wrongdoing and has not currently been charged with any crimes.

The US Attorney’s Office in Delaware, however, is seeking grand jury testimony concerning income he received from foreign entities, notably while he was serving on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company.

The federal prosecutors are also reportedly investigating Hunter’s drug and alcohol abuse, his frivolous spending habits, and his state of mind in 2018 to determine what sort of defense he would make in a potential criminal tax case.

Recently, both the New York Times and the Washington Post published pieces acknowledging the validity of Hunter’s infamous laptop. For months, leftwing legacy outlets suppressed stories about Hunter’s laptop.

In October 2020, when the New York Post first reported on the contents of the laptop’s hard drive, the story was smeared as “Russian disinformation” by prominent legacy outlets. Then-candidate Joe Biden used these reports as a shield to dismiss questions regarding his involvement n Hunter’s questionable business dealings.

However, now that the legacy media now longer has an aversion to investigating Hunter’s laptop, for whatever reason, the Washington Post has confirmed that a Chinese energy conglomerate paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter and his uncle, James Biden.

There is little remaining disagreement about the authenticity of Hunter’s laptop or the content on its hard drive.



However, it remains to be seen whether the shady business dealings discussed on his laptop can be tied to the president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-officials-won-t-confirm-whether-the-president-has-discussed-pardoning-hunter,2022-04-03
White House physician who served under Obama calls for Biden's immediate resignation,"A former White House Physician, who served in both the Obama and Trump administrations, said that President Joe Biden is not mentally fit to serve as president and ought to immediately resign.

On Friday, the physician in question, Ronny Jackson, said, “Biden doesn’t know what’s going on with Ukraine. He Doesn’t know what’s going on with ANYTHING! He’s not cognitively capable of leading. He needs to RESIGN before our country suffers anymore.”

The doctor’s comments are in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine which continues to disrupt the geopolitical balance of power.

Jackson, a Republican, currently represents Texas’s 13th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives and has raised questions about Biden’s cognitive ability in the past.

In late February, Rep. Jackson called for Biden to take a cognitive test and said that he is “not fit to be our president right now.”

Fox News reported that Jackson said, “The whole country is seeing his mental cognitive issues on display for over a year now, and there’s really no question in most people’s minds that there’s something going on with him, that he’s not cognitively the same as he used to be and, in my mind, not fit to be our president right now.”

The congressman continued, “Every time he gets up and talks to the American people, it’s not just the American people that are watching him speak, it’s the whole world, and that’s part of what the problem is here. He looks tired, he looks weak, he looks confused, he’s incoherent, and it sends a message of weakness all over the world, and they’re seizing up on that.”

Last July, he predicted that Biden would eventually resign from the presidency due to his declining cognitive abilities.

He said, “There’s something seriously going on with this man right now, and, you know, I think that he’s either going to resign, they’re going to convince him to resign from office at some point in the near future for medical issues or they’re going to have to use the 25th Amendment to get rid of this man right now.”

Last January, Jackson slammed Biden for ignoring a question about his mental health and suggested that him doing so was an indication that something was “wrong” with the president.

Biden ignoring this question led Jackson to demand he sit for a cognitive examination.

Jackson said, “I am demanding he have a cognitive test NOW. There’s too much on the line, we need to know!”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-physician-who-served-under-obama-calls-for-biden-s-immediate-resignation,2022-03-12
White House press secretary Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration is not monitoring the stock market amid Wall Street's longest losing streak in 99 years,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the Biden administration is not monitoring the stock market on a regular basis as the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its longest losing streak in 99 years.

While speaking to reporters, Jean-Pierre said that “nothing has changed on how we see the stock market,” which is “not something we keep an eye on every day, so I’m not gonna comment on that from here,” the Epoch Times reported.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 5%, while the Dow Jones shrank by 4% last Wednesday. On Thursday, the Dow Jones dropped more than 440 points during the morning trading hours.

Earlier in 2022, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Joe Biden “does not look at the stock market as a means by which to judge the economy.”

The stock market’s historic plunge was triggered, in part, by selloffs of major corporate retailers like Target and Walmart. Target lost nearly 25% of its value after it reported earnings fell short of forecasts made by analysts largely due to shipping costs that high fuel prices and inflation have exacerbated. Other major retailers also saw significant losses in recent days.

Rising interest rates, spiraling inflation, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and a slowdown in China’s economy have reportedly caused investors to reconsider the prices they’re willing to pay for a wide range of stocks.

The rampant selloffs lasted for eight consecutive days marking the longest weekly losing streak on Wallstreet since 1923, CNN reported.

The S&P 500 — a much broader index than the Dow Jones — posted its seventh-straight weekly loss marking the index’s longest slump since March 2001. The S&P 500 briefly entered a bear market on Friday after recording a 20% loss from the all-time high that it reached this past January.

The last bear market occurred two years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recent market conditions will mark the first time since then that new investors could experience true economic shrinkage.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said, “From inflation to a hawkish Fed, to war, to supply chain issues, to China on lockdown, to a slowing economy, there are many reasons stocks have done as poorly as they have recently.”

Detrick suggested that a “bounce back” is likely, however.

He said, “If we get any good news, a big bounce-back rally is likely.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-press-secretary-jean-pierre-said-that-the-biden-administration-is-not-monitoring-the-stock-market-amid-wallstreet-s-longest-losing-streak-in-99-years,2022-05-21
"White House targets GOP critics, says they benefitted from PPP forgiveness","Republicans have been lambasting the Biden administration's plan to cancel massive amounts of federal student loan debt, but on Thursday, the White House fired back at several GOP lawmakers by saying that the Republican figures had benefitted from Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness.

The PPP program was meant to help buoy businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The official White House Twitter account retweeted a clip in which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia had described student loan cancellation as ""completely unfair.""

""Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven,"" the White House tweeted.

The White House also targeted GOP Reps. Vern Buchanan of Florida, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.

In response to the White House, Mullin tweeted, ""Another ignorant attack from a career politician who has never created a single job. 74 days before midterms, Joe Biden is targeting business owners for protecting their employees from government lockdowns. President Trump always supported American workers and job creators.""

The White House also retweeted a post in which Matt Gaetz of Florida appeared to ridicule the idea of the U.S. shelling out billions more to aid Ukraine — ""Congressman Matt Gaetz had $482,321 in PPP loans forgiven,"" the White House tweet declared.

""So it is now the White House's position that if the government forces you to shut down your business and provides you just compensation to keep people employed, that's the same thing as you failing to pay the college loans you voluntarily undertook. Geniuses,"" tweeted conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, editor emeritus of the Daily Wire. ""As long as the White House is targeting businessowners who were locked down and who used PPP to pay their employees, let's find out how many top Democrats have student loans they're about to pay off with your money,"" he added in another post.



Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of the Dispatch, tweeted, ""The @WhiteHouse is going all in comparing PPP loan forgiveness to student debt forgiveness. It’s a terrible analogy because A) PPP loans were designed to be forgiven if conditions met & B) They were designed **by Congress.** What Biden is doing is lawless fiat *and* bad policy.""

Leon Wolf, managing editor of TheBlaze, tweeted, ""Loans made by the government to bail out businesses that were forced by the government to temporarily close their doors are not the same as student loans, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-says-that-republicans-who-criticize-the-biden-admin-s-student-loan-cancellation-plan-benefitted-from-ppp-loan-forgiveness,2022-08-26
"White House briefing on Ukraine invasion to TikTok influencers, claims Russia hacked 2016 election","The White House welcomed popular personalities from the Chinese social media platform TikTok to deliver a briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the influencers. During the briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pushed a claim that the 2016 election was ""hacked"" by Russians.

The White House spoke to 30 ""top TikTok stars"" on a Zoom call on Thursday, according to the Washington Post.

The White House has been closely watching TikTok's rise as a dominant news source, leading to its decision to approach a select group of the platform's most influential names. This week, the administration began working with Gen Z For Change, a nonprofit advocacy group, to help identify top content creators on the platform to orchestrate a briefing aimed at answering questions about the conflict and the United States' role in it.

Psaki told the influencers, ""Thank you all for everything you're doing. I mean, use of your platforms to educate, to inform, to debunk, to demystify, during what is a very tumultuous, heartbreaking time in the world is remarkable, and we recognize and value all of your platforms.""

The platform the influencers use is the Beijing-based short-form video app TikTok – which has been scrutinized for potentially having security risks. The Department of Defense stated that the social media app features ""potential security risks associated with its use."" In 2020, the U.S. Army, and Navy prohibited TikTok from being used on government-issued phones. Last July, the massively popular social media app gave itself permission to collect biometric data of U.S. users – which includes faceprints and voiceprints.

Jules Suzdaltsev – a TikTok personality who was born in Ukraine – claimed the officials at the meeting dodged hard questions and said, ""The energy of the call felt like a press briefing for kindergarteners.""

One of the influencers at the briefing on the war in Ukraine is Ellie Zeiler – an 18-year-old with over 10.5 million followers on TikTok where she typically does dances and makeup tutorials.

""I’m here to relay the information in a more digestible manner to my followers,"" Zeiler told the Washington Post. ""I would consider myself a White House correspondent for Gen Z.""

During the call with the TikTok influencers, Psaki claimed that Russia ""hacked"" the 2016 election in which Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.

""If you look back at 2014, and frankly even 2016, when Russia invaded Ukraine and then in 2016, when they, you know, of course, hacked our election here, we did not do that, we did not declassify information,"" Psaki told the group of TikTok stars.

Fox News notes, ""While Russian hackers were behind the stealing of emails from Democratic officials like John Podesta, there is no evidence that they tampered with election results as part of the 2016 hacking spree.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence investigated possible Russian influence on the 2016 election and released a report in 2017.

""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,"" the DNI investigation found.

""Russian intelligence accessed elements of multiple state or local electoral boards,"" the report stated. ""Since early 2014, Russian intelligence has researched US electoral processes and related technology and equipment.""

""DHS assesses that the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying,"" the report declared.

Coincidentally, Russia is also using high-profile TikTok influencers to push its narrative regarding the invasion of Ukraine, according to a report from Vice News.

The outlet reports that there is a ""coordinated campaign to pay Russian TikTok influencers to post videos pushing pro-Kremlin narratives about the war in Ukraine."" Vice News also claims that there is a secret Telegram channel run by the Russian government that ""gave potential contributors a step-by-step guide on how to circumvent TikTok's ban on uploads from Russian accounts.""

This isn't the first time the Biden administration has turned to TikTok influencers.

In December, President Joe Biden appeared in a TikTok video with the Jonas Brothers to promote Americans getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was widely panned as being ""cringe.""

Last August, the White House enlisted ""Gen Z"" social media influencer Benny Drama to be Psaki's ""intern"" to help spread awareness about COVID-19 vaccines with a viral TikTok video.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-tiktok-russia-election,2022-03-12
Prince Harry criticizes 'rolling back of constitutional rights' in US,"Prince Harry denounced the ""rolling back of constitutional rights"" in the United States during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday.

The U.K. royal was delivering a keynote address for Nelson Mandela International Day when he criticized the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ended the constitutional right to an abortion, calling it part of a ""global assault on democracy and freedom.""

""How many of us feel battered, helpless in the face of the seemingly endless stream of disasters and devastation?"" Harry asked, calling the past year ""a painful year in a painful decade.""

""The few weaponizing lies and disinformation at the expense of the many,"" he continued, mentioning the COVID-19 pandemic, global warming, and the war between Ukraine and Russia before touching on the U.S. Supreme Court's abortion decision.

""From the horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of constitutional rights here in the United States, we are witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom, the cause of Mandela’s life,” he said.

Harry's pot shot at America riled up conservative commentators, who questioned why a British royal was lecturing Americans about their constitutional rights.

""If I was a direct descendent of George III, I would be careful about lecturing an American audience about the inadequacies of their constitutional rights,"" said Douglas Carswell, CEO of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy and a former member of U.K. Parliament.

The Federalist's Sean Davis tweeted that Americans ""stopped carrying what emasculated British royals think about our rights 246 years ago.""

""You lost your say 247 years ago pal,"" said Victoria Coates, a distinguished fellow with the American Foreign Policy Council.

""Letting voters, rather than 8 unelected justices, decide state abortion policy constitutes a 'global assault on democracy,' says trophy husband of retired B-list actress,"" Washington Examiner columnist Tiana Lowe tweeted, referring to the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle, a former Hollywood actress.



Harry married the U.S.-born Markle in 2018 and the couple currently lives in southern California. Markle is an outspoken advocate of progressive political causes



After the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution does not guarantee a right to abortion in its landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization opinion, Markle was one of many celebrities to condemn the ruling.



""This is about women’s physical safety. It’s also about economic justice, individual autonomy, and who we are as a society,"" Markle said in an interview for Vogue. ""Nobody should be forced to make a decision they do not want to make, or is unsafe, or puts their own life in jeopardy. Frankly, whether it’s a woman being put in an unthinkable situation, a woman not ready to start a family, or even a couple who deserve to plan their family in a way that makes the most sense for them, it’s about having a choice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/who-asked-you-harry-descendant-of-king-george-iii-criticizes-rolling-back-of-constitutional-rights-in-u-s,2022-07-18
"Whoopi Goldberg gets frustrated with Alan Dershowitz for making reasoned arguments, says ‘I’m cutting you off,’ then insists he show her respect","ABC's ""The View"" has made for some juicy daytime television over the past several months, and Wednesday's episode featuring impeachment defense attorney and Harvard professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz continued that trend.

During the video interview, Dershowitz was responding to a question from co-host Joy Behar when Whoopi Goldberg had apparently reached her limit on patience during his long-winded and historically reasoned answer.

Goldberg interrupted Dershowitz and proceeded to mock him while he tried to speak. Then moments later, she insisted that he show her some respect.

Here's a clip from the segment provided by The Daily Caller:

youtu.be

""You still don't think any of this is impeachable. But the only people who actually agree with you are on your defense team, and 75 percent of Americans want to hear from [John] Bolton,"" Behar said, referring to claims made in the former national security adviser's forthcoming book in which he alleges President Trump told him directly of a quid pro quo with Ukraine.

""So why should we listen to you?"" she asked.

""Well, I made the constitutional arguments,"" Dershowitz answered.

""I'm not arguing about witnesses, what I'm saying is the charge of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power are not within the constitutional terms 'high crimes and misdemeanors,'"" he said.

""You're the only constitutional scholar who goes with that line. There is not one other that agrees with you, not one,"" Behar pushed back.

""Let me be very clear about that. In 1867, the dean of the Columbia law school—"" Dershowitz began to say, before Goldberg jumped in.

""Wait, Alan. In 1492, you know, Columbus sailed the seas of blue,"" Goldberg interrupted, singing and waving her hands in mockery. ""But, listen, I need to move on.""

Evidently, understanding the historical views on what should constitute an impeachable offense was not a priority for Goldberg. Perhaps Dershowitz should've known.

""No, no, no, you're not going to get me to move on until I make this point—"" Dershowitz insisted to no avail as Goldberg proceeded to speak over him, insisting that there was no time for his answer.

Dershowitz continued anyway.

""Shortly after the Constitution was enacted, the dean of the Columbia Law School said that the weight of authority was in favor of it being a crime. Now the academics all say it isn't. Why? Because Donald Trump is being impeached. If Hillary Clinton were being impeached, they'd all be on my side,"" he said as Goldberg continued to interrupt him.

""Are you done?"" Goldberg then asked. ""OK. You're saying you need a crime or criminal-like behavior—""

""Not me. That's what the framers said, of the Constitution—"" Dershowitz retorted.

""So I'm moving you on or I'm cutting you off,"" Goldberg clapped back to cheers from the audience. ""One or the other is going to happen. I don't want to make this contentious but we only have several minutes.""

""You're laughing,"" she observed, before insinuating that Dershowitz should respect her.

""I've always been respectful to you and you've always been respectful to me,"" she said.

Wife of Russian prisoner and WNBA star Brittney Griner speaks out as fears grow that Putin will use the former Olympian as a 'high-profile hostage',"The wife of WNBA star and Russian captive Brittney Griner says that she and Griner's team are tirelessly working to get the basketball star home after the celebrated Olympian was detained at a Russian airport at least three weeks ago for reportedly having a cannabis-filled vape pen on her person.

The longer Griner spends incarcerated in Russia, the longer fears continue to grow over the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin will use the WNBA star as a ""high-profile hostage,"" the Daily Mail reported on Sunday.

What are the details?

Wife Cherelle Griner on Saturday night shared an update on Instagram, writing, ""I love my wife wholeheartedly, so this message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life. I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details. Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.""

""Your prayers, and support,"" she added, ""are greatly appreciated.""

According to the report, Eveyln Farkas, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine, said that she fears Russia may use Griner as a ""high-profile hostage,"" and noted that if the U.S. wants Griner out of jail, ""Russia is going to have some terms.""

""It could be a prisoner swap,"" she added. ""They could also use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.""

What else?

Griner's agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, told the outlet that the basketball star's team is in ""close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her fears, and the WNBA and NBA.""

""As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern,"" Colas added in the statement.

During a Saturday press conference, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said that she is working hard to return Griner to the U.S.



""Brittney Griner is a United States citizen, she was a guest in Russia ... and I will be demanding her release,"" she said. ""I don't want to disregard a sovereign nation, but Putin has disregarded sovereign nations his entire service in this world and anyone that is killing and attacking and destroying Ukraine, their neighboring country — that does not bother them has no right to hold Ms. Griner. Period. If there is challenges and concerns about her actions, it should be dealt with diplomatically and she should be released.""

She continued, ""I believe that at this time, in the midst of war, how dangerous being Moscow, how dangerous it is to be in Moscow prisons ... it is no place for her. I would call upon Russia at this time to really stop harassing U.S. citizens, but more importantly to release those that are there and to not claim any upper hand or any sense of character in the pillage of murder and terroristic actions against the Ukrainians.""

A timeline

The Daily Mail reported that Griner played for UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia before the WNBA took a two-week hiatus in early February for the FIBA World Cup qualifying tournaments. Griner was said to have ""made her last communication"" in posting a photo to Instagram on Feb. 5.

On Feb. 11, President Joe Biden called on all Americans to evacuate the region. It is believed she was taken into custody around that time, and by Feb. 24, Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

On March 5, the Russian Federal Customs Service announced that it detained a ""two-time Olympic basketball champion"" on suspicion of drugs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wife-of-russian-prisoner-and-wnba-star-brittney-griner-pleads-for-russia-to-return-star-home-as-fears-grow-that-putin-will-use-her-as-a-high-profile-hostage,2022-03-06
Wikipedia cofounder Larry Sanger says site is bias propaganda,"Wikipedia is reportedly the fifth most popular website in the world with 6.1 billion monthly visitors. Many people click on the site to get quick and reliable information on just about any topic. However, the co-founder of Wikipedia has issued a warning that the online encyclopedia has a bias and can't always be trusted to provide the truth.

Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia along with Jimmy Wales on Jan. 15, 2001. Sanger said that Wikipedia originally offered neutral information on topics without obvious bias, but he said that changed ""especially over the last five years or so."" Sanger claims that things changed when Wikipedia became a household name.

""Because there is a lot of influence, Wikipedia is known now by everyone to have a lot of influence in the world,"" Sanger said in an interview on the ""LockDownTV"" show. ""If only one version of the facts is allowed then that gives a huge incentive to wealthy and powerful people to seize control of things like Wikipedia in order to shore up their power. And they do that.

""So there's a very big, nasty, complex game being played behind the scenes to make the article say what somebody wants them to say,"" the Wikipedia co-founder said.

Sanger said, ""Wikipedia is pretty reliably establishment in its viewpoint, which is ironic considering its origins from a couple of libertarians, who – at least in the beginning – were really tolerant and open to anti-establishment views being canvased in the article.""



""Can you trust it to always give you the truth? Well, it depends on what you think the truth is,"" Sanger told host Freddie Sayers.

""The word for it is propaganda,"" Sanger said.

Sanger gave an example of political bias on Wikipedia, ""The Biden article has very little by way of the concerns that Republicans have had about him. So if you want to have anything remotely resembling the Republican point of view about Biden, you're not going to get it from the article.""



Sanger explained that the article about President Joe Biden is extremely long, but there is only a short paragraph about the Ukraine scandal and Hunter Biden's overseas dealings.

""What little can be found is extremely biased and reads like a defense counsel's brief,"" Sanger claimed about the internet encyclopedia.

Sanger, who left Wikipedia in 2002, said the site is biased against conservatives.

""You can't cite the Daily Mail at all. You can't cite Fox News on socio-political issues either. It's banned,"" he said. ""So what does that mean? It means that if a controversy does not appear in the mainstream center-Left media, then it's not going to appear on Wikipedia.""

Sanger, who turned 53 on Friday, was asked about information about COVID-19 being shared online.

""If you look at the articles that Wikipedia has, you can just see how they are simply mouthing the view of the World Economic Council or World Economic Forum, and the World Health Organisation, the CDC and various other establishment mouthpieces like Fauci — they take their cues from them…There's a global enforcement of a certain point of view, which is amazing to me amazing to a libertarian, or a liberty-loving conservative,"" Sanger said.



Sanger gave his opinion on the increase of power and influence by Big Tech.

""We trusted outlets like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube with our data, and allowed them essentially to take over the media world,"" he said. ""What we trusted them with was our liberty and our privacy, that basically that they weren't going to shut us down. But they stabbed us in the back, essentially.""



Wikipedia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

In May 2020, Sanger wrote an article titled, ""Wikipedia Is Badly Biased,"" in which he shows the glaring differences between the Wikipedia entry for former President Barack Obama and former President Donald Trump. He also claims that Wikipedia has ""pretty egregious instances of bias"" in its article about Jesus Christ.

Last month, Sanger wrote an article titled, ""Wikipedia Is More One-Sided Than Ever,"" where he claims that Wikipedia has a bias in its coverage of major stories such as Trump's impeachments, Biden's scandals, Antifa and Black Lives Matter riots, and the alleged election irregularities.

Germany dismantles wind farm for coal mine expansion,"A wind farm in Germany is being demolished to make room for a coal mine expansion.

German energy giant RWE is tearing down wind turbines to expand a neighboring coal mine in an effort to deal with the country's energy crisis. The area of the wind farm near the small town of Lützerath will be used to expand the Garzweiler open pit mine in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The wind farm features eight wind turbines. One wind turbine was dismantled last week, two more are scheduled to be deconstructed some time next year, and the final five will be taken down by the end of 2023.

RWE officials admit that the move appears to be ""paradoxical.""

""We realize this comes across as paradoxical, but that is as matters stand,"" RWE spokesperson Guido Steffen said in a statement.

The Ministry of Economy of North Rhine-Westphalia added, “If Lützerath were to be preserved, the production volume required to maintain the security of supply over the next eight years could not be achieved, the stability of the opencast mine could not be guaranteed and the necessary recultivation could not be carried out.""

In addition, RWE will reactivate three lignite-fired coal units that were previously on standby.

""The three lignite units each have a capacity of 300 megawatts (MW). With their deployment, they contribute to strengthening the security of supply in Germany during the energy crisis and to saving natural gas in electricity generation,"" RWE said in September. ""Originally, it was planned that the three reserve power plant units affected would be permanently shut down on September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2023, respectively.""

Germany’s cabinet approved the decision to revive the unused coal units after energy prices skyrocketed because of the sanctions issued due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

North Rhine-Westphalia and RWE had previously declared they would stop using fossil fuels by 2030.

Climate change activists are furious about the transition from wind power to fossil fuels.

Last week, there were thousands of demonstrators who participated in protests against high energy prices in six German cities: Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Hanover, and Dresden.

As of September 2021, 60% of Germany's gas came from Russia, but last month it was down to zero.

Reuters reported, ""Germany imported 37.6% of gas from Norway in September compared with 19.2% in the same month last year, while Dutch deliveries climbed to 29.6% of imports from 13.7%, data from utility industry group BDEW showed.""

Last week, BASF – the world’s largest chemicals group by revenue – announced that the company will ""permanently"" downsize in Europe because high energy costs have made the region increasingly uncompetitive.

""The European chemical market has been growing only weakly for about a decade [and] the significant increase in natural gas and power prices over the course of this year is putting pressure on chemical value chains,” BASF chief executive Martin Brudermüller said on Wednesday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wind-farm-germany-coal-mine,2022-10-31
"GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik gets witnesses to admit Hunter Biden's Burisma post spelled 'conflict of interest,' argues he should testify","During the public impeachment hearing Tuesday, National Security Council adviser Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his counterpart for Vice President Mike Pence, Jennifer Williams, agreed that Hunter Biden's post at Burisma had the ""appearance of conflict of interest"" after Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) pressed the issue.

House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had recently blocked GOP efforts to call Hunter Biden to testify before Congress despite his apparent conflict of interest as a board member of the politically corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma.

Stefanik was probing the issue Tuesday, citing the witnesses' closed-door testimonies in which both Vindman and Williams described anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine as a key aspect of the United States' policy toward the eastern European nation.

Stefanik directed the focus toward Burisma, pointing out that in 2014 during the Obama administration the first anti-corruption investigation partnered between the U.S., the U.K., and Ukraine was into Burisma's owner.



""Lt. Col. Vindman, you testified that you were aware that Burisma had questionable business practices, that's part of its track record,"" Stefanik continued with confirmation from Vindman, before moving on to Hunter Biden's involvement on the board of governance for Burisma, of which Vindman acknowledged he was aware.

""I know my constituents in NY-21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of [former Vice President Joe Biden] sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma,"" Stefanik noted. ""The Obama administration State Department was also concerned.""

""Yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests,"" Stefanik stated.

""Do you believe that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?"" Stefanik asked both witnesses. Both responded, ""yes.""

Stefanik noted that every witness who has testified and has been asked that question has answered affirmatively.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/witnesses-admit-bidens-conflict-interest,2019-11-19
WNBA commissioner says Brittney Griner situation unfolding in Russia is ‘unimaginable’,"WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said on Monday that WNBA star Brittney Griner is in an “unimaginable” situation while detained in Russia on drug possession charges.



Griner has been incarcerated in Russia since February after she was reported to have had hash oil on her person at a Russian airport

What are the details?

Engelbert said that she and the league are tirelessly working to bring Griner home from the former communist country, TMZ Sports reported.



In remarks ahead of the WNBA draft, Engelbert said that little has changed regarding Griner’s legal status.



“I know we’re all frustrated, but we do need to be patient,” she said. “The players have been amazing at following the advice they’re getting and we’re getting in order not to jeopardize her safety in any way.”

She added, “This is an unimaginable situation for BG to be in. She continues to have our full support. Certainly, we’re trying everything we can, every angle, working with her legal representation, her agent, elected leaders, the administration. Just everybody in our ecosystem to try and find ways to get her home safely and as quickly as we can.”

A Moscow court announced in March that it opted to extend Griner's arrest until May 19.

Griner has pleaded not guilty to the drug charges.

In March, Evelyn Farkas, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, said that she fears Russia may try to use Griner as a ""high-profile hostage"" and added that if the U.S. wanted Griner out of jail and safely back on U.S. soil, that Russia would likely have some ""terms.""

""It could be a prisoner swap,"" Farkas explained. ""They could also use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wnba-commissioner-says-brittney-griner-situation-unfolding-in-russia-is-unimaginable,2022-04-12
"Woke hockey reporter suggests NHL player who refused to wear LGBTQ colors should return to Russia, fight Ukraine: 'Go back where you feel more comfortable'","E.J. Hradek, senior reporter for the NHL Network, suggested during a Wednesday broadcast that Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov should return to Russia and even fight Ukraine after refusing to wear LGBTQ colors during a pregame warm-up this week for religious reasons.

What's the background?

Provorov declined to skate before Tuesday's ""Pride Night"" game since his teammates were wearing rainbow colors for their warm-up, ESPN reported. The 26-year-old defenseman told reporters after the Flyers' 5-2 home win over the Anaheim Ducks that he intended ""to stay true to myself and my religion,"" the sports network said.

""I respect everyone,"" he told reporters, adding that he's Russian Orthodox. ""I respect everybody's choices.""

What did Hradek have to say about Provorov?

During an ""NHL Now!"" broadcast, Hradek had a few ideas about what Provorov could do if he doesn't want to take woke marching orders here in the U.S., including returning to Russia.

“Ivan Provorov can get on a plane any day he wants and go back to a place where he feels more comfortable, take less money, and get on with his life that way if it’s that problematic for him,” Hradek said.

The NHL Network reporter noted that Provorov ""has been in North America for a long time"" after having played two seasons in Manitoba, Canada, in the Western Hockey League and now playing in his seventh season for the Flyers.

“If this is that much of a problem for him to maybe assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community and here in this country, that’s okay — listen, you can feel any way you want. But the beauty is, if it bothers you that much, there’s always a chance to leave. Go back where you feel more comfortable,"" Hradek continued, before suggesting that Provorov join in the Russian war against Ukraine. ""I understand there’s a conflict of sorts going on over there; maybe get involved.”

OutKick said it reached out to the National Hockey League for comment regarding Hradek’s statements about Provorov but didn't hear back.



How are folks reacting?

A number of Twitter commenters have more or less declared war against Hradek and his ideas. Some examples:

""'Assimilate' is a terrible choice of words. No one should be forced into wearing gay pride gear. Sounds a bit authoritarian, no?"" one user said. ""Coming from someone who is all for gay marriage.""

""You are such a douche for criticizing someone for sticking by their beliefs,"" another commenter said. ""It’s called being honorable; you should try it sometime.""

""Telling him to go back if he can’t assimilate into the USA? Do you feel same about those who come to the USA but never learn English? Should they go back to their county of origin?"" another user wondered.

""The minute you punish/cancel those of differing viewpoints, you lose all credibility because when you take that step, it [shows] that your idea/concept is failing, and you can only 'win' by force,"" another commenter said.

""Yes...berate others until they behave how you want. They can't have an opinion. That's the leftist way,"" another user sarcastically pointed out.

Anything else?

ESPN writer Greg Wyshynski — who penned the sports network's initial story about the controversy and also blastedProvorov on Twitter — wrote a follow-up piece about the NHL's ""social activism partner"" You Can Play, which wants to ""work with"" Provorov after he ""negatively impacted"" Pride Night.

You Can Play COO Kurt Weaver told ESPN he's disappointed by how the Flyers and coach John Tortorella handled Provorov's refusal to wear the LGBTQ colors. Tortorella said he didn't consider benching Provorov and respected his personal beliefs.

""The concept of 'team' can mean a lot of things. I think more coaches have to ask what that cohesion of a team means to them,"" Weaver told the sports network. ""At what point does a decision like this that a player wants to make cross over into basically not showing up for your job? I think [Tortorella] did what a coach needs to do, which is support his player's decision. But I would hope that, behind the scenes, there's some more direct conversations around what it means to be a teammate.""

Weaver also weighed in on Provorov's faith as his reason for not visibly supporting the LGBTQ community.

""Players who do this sort of thing have a very short perspective on what it means. For me, religion is about charity and inclusion,"" Weaver added to ESPN. ""This wasn't just about a player and a jersey on a patch of ice. What else was affected by this? Visibility and proximity is what breeds understanding and inclusion, and those things were negatively impacted by this. It's disappointing to see that's the outcome from this.""

Woman suing Hunter Biden in paternity suit reportedly worked as stripper at club he frequented,"The woman who is suing Hunter Biden in a paternity suit worked as a stripper in a strip club that Biden frequently attended, according to a report from Page Six.

Lunden Alexis Roberts sued Biden, son of presidential candidate Joe Biden, claiming that he was the father of her infant son. He denied the claim, but a DNA test proved her accusation was true.

The report that Roberts is a stripper is based on numerous sources who place Hunter Biden at the the Mpire Club in Washington D.C., and who also recognize Roberts as the dancer ""Dallas.""

Roberts is a native of Batesville, Arkansas.

A worker at the Mpire Club remembered working alongside Roberts and described her to Page Six, saying, ""She has a heart of gold and is a smarty-pants.""

""She was really sweet,"" said the bartender of Roberts.

Hunter Biden has become the center of a political firestorm over his involvement with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, at the time that his father was the vice president.

Joe Biden bragged at one point to an audience that he helped pressure the Ukrainian president to fire a prosecutor that he said was corrupt. Allies of the president point out that the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was looking into corruption at Burisma at the time, which could be a massive conflict of interest.

Hunter Biden has also admitted to struggling with a drug addiction.

Xi Jinping sends a message to Kim Jong-Un seeking to promote friendly relations and build 'a new situation' that changes the global pecking order,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has reached out to the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, seeking to promote friendly relations.

Xi sent a message to Kim saying that the Chinese government was ready to come to a “common understanding” with North Korean leadership as the two nations work to build supportive and friendly relations under “a new situation,” Fox News reported.

Xi’s message to his North Korean counterpart was in response to Kim congratulating Chinese leadership at the close of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, “In the message, the respected Comrade Kim Jong-Un extended heartfelt warm congratulations to General Secretary Xi Jinping upon the splendid proceeding of the Beijing Winter Olympics as a novel and special grand sports festival.”

Despite enthusiastically applauding the Chinese Olympics, North Korea was prohibited from participating by the International Olympic Committee over the country refusal to participate in last Summer’s Tokyo Olympic Games over COVID-19 concerns.

Kim said that North Korea and China are “frustrating the undisguised hostile policy and military threat of the U.S. and its satellite forces by strengthening the bilateral strategic cooperation and unity.”

The North Korean leader said he was committed to “more firmly consolidate the [North Korea]-China relationship into the invincible one.”

The message of friendship between the two communist countries came just one day after Xi offered his “support” to Russian President Vladimir Putin as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

During the Beijing Winter Olympics, Xi and Putin had an in-person meeting where the two leaders agreed to cooperate and potentially advance each other’s goals.

They issued a joint statement that said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.”

This agreement between China and Russia marks the most detailed and aggressive statement the two countries have made as they collaborate to unseat the United States as the global hegemon.

In recent days, North Korea has allegedly resumed development and testing ballistic missiles as it continues developing nuclear weapons.

Business Insider reported that Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said, “frequent launches” have been coming from North Korea since the outset of 2022. The minister believes that North Korean leadership resumed testing its missiles this winter because the international community was more focused on the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine.

He said, “If North Korea deliberately carried out the missile launch while the international community is distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such an act is absolutely unforgivable.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/xi-jinping-sends-a-message-to-kim-jong-un-seeking-to-promote-friendly-relations-and-build-a-new-situation-that-changes-the-global-pecking-order,2022-02-27
"Biden admin finally admits it was 'wrong' about historic inflation a year too late, then clarifies","President Biden's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted this week what has been plainly obvious to most Americans for the last 18 months: The Biden administration was wrong about seriousness of the nation's historic inflation crisis.

""I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,"" Yellen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. ""As I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn't — at the time — didn't fully understand, but we recognize that now.""

Yellen's way-too-late admission came in response to a question from the CNN anchor about comments she made in 2021 in which she regarded rising inflation as only a ""small risk.""

President Biden and others in his administration, too, downplayed the crisis for months last year, insisting the steady rise in consumer goods was only ""transitory"" and unavoidable. The administration even went so far as to pitch the situation as preferable.

Officials characterized the problem as only a temporary consequence of the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as surging demand outstripped supply and the global supply chain suffered.

But Americans disagreed, as they saw inflation continue to skyrocket, eventually reaching levels not seen in 40 years. Economists pointed to the administration's exorbitant social spending as the primary culprit.

Finally, on Tuesday, it appeared the administration was ready to take some of the blame — but with caveats.

In a clarifying statement issued to CNN following the interview, a Yellen spokesperson attempted to reframe her boss' comments in a more politically advantageous light.

""The Secretary was pointing out that there have been shocks to the economy that have exacerbated inflationary pressures which couldn't have been foreseen 18 months ago, including Russia's decision to invade Ukraine, multiple successive variants of COVID, and lockdowns in China,"" the spokesperson said. ""As she also noted, there has been historic growth and record job creation and our goal is now to transition to steady and stable growth as inflation is brought down.""

Yellen's remarks came the same day that Biden met with her and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the Oval Office. The president's team has been busy shifting blame for inflation from the COVID-19 pandemic to the Russian war in Ukraine.

But Americans are not convinced.

In a survey published this week, a majority of general election voters (59.9%) claimed that ""President Biden's policies and spending"" are the top factors causing increasing inflation in the country. Just 31.6% agreed that the war between Russia and Ukraine is the top reason.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/yellen-i-was-wrong-inflation,2022-06-01
'You'll love chapter 14': John Bolton hypes upcoming book while accusing White House of 'censorship',"Former national security adviser John Bolton made his first public appearance since the impeachment trial of his former boss, President Donald Trump, on Monday, but he did not disclose many details during his speaking engagement at Duke University.

Instead, Bolton hyped the contents of his book, insisting to the audience, ""You'll love chapter 14,"" and said he hopes his memoir is not ""suppressed"" under the Trump administration's ""censorship.""

What are the details?



Bolton's book, titled, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,"" is still undergoing analysis by the Trump administration, after the former national security adviser submitted the manuscript for a standard prepublication review.

Last month, the National Security Council notified an attorney for Bolton that an initial review found the manuscript ""appears to contain significant amounts of classified information"" that must be removed prior to publishing or any other kind of disclosure.

""I hope it's not suppressed,"" Bolton said of his book to the crowd in Durham, North Carolina, on Monday, according to Bloomberg News. ""This is an effort to write history, and I did it the best I can. We'll have to see what comes out of the censorship.""

Details from the unpublished draft of Bolton's book were already reported by the New York Times, where the outlet claimed President Trump told Bolton ""in August that [the president] wanted to continue freezing $392 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including [Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden].""

The New York Times report led Democrats to call for Bolton's testimony during the impeachment trial of President Trump in the Senate, as the president's conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prompted House Democrats to launch the probe against President Trump in the first place.

When asked on Monday whether Bolton considered President Trump's call with Zelensky to be ""perfect,"" Bolton simply replied, ""You'll love chapter 14.""

Anything else?

The Department of Justice has disputed assertions made by Bolton in his book, and President Trump blasted the memoir as ""nasty and untrue.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youll-love-chapter-14-john-bolton-hypes-upcoming-book-while-accusing-white-house-of-censorship,2020-02-18
"YouTube takes down Rand Paul video naming alleged whistleblower, vows to delete all mentions of the name","YouTube removed a video in which Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) named the alleged whistleblower who raised the alarm about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, leading to his impeachment, according to The Hill.

Additionally, YouTube has made it clear it will remove all ""videos, comments, and other forms of content that mention the leaked whistleblower's name"" because they violate the site's community guidelines. A company spokesperson said hundreds of videos and tens of thousands of violating comments have already been removed.

Paul has repeatedly attempted to publicize the identity of the alleged whistleblower, believed to be CIA analyst and former National Security Council aide Eric Ciaramella. During the impeachment trial, Chief Justice John Roberts refused to read a question containing Ciaramella's name.

Paul accused YouTube of censorship, and noted that while he mentioned Ciaramella's name, he didn't specifically call him the whistleblower.

""It is a chilling and disturbing day in America when giant web companies such as YouTube decide to censure speech,"" Paul told Politico. ""Now, even protected speech, such as that of a senator on the Senate floor, can be blocked from getting to the American people. This is dangerous and politically biased. Nowhere in my speech did I accuse anyone of being a whistleblower, nor do I know the whistleblower's identity.""

Most mainstream media outlets have refused to name Ciaramella, although the specific refusals of officials to mention the name logically point to the likelihood that he is indeed the anonymous whistleblower.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) refused to allow impeachment witnesses to answer questions that even pointed in the direction of referring to Ciaramella, creating an almost comical scenario in which Schiff actively concealed the whistleblower's identity while simultaneously claiming not to know his identity.

Mentions of Ciaramella's name have not been allowed in congressional hearings, even when they do not allude to him as the whistleblower.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-takes-down-rand-paul-video-naming-alleged-whistleblower-vows-to-delete-all-mentions-of-the-name,2020-02-13
Amb. Yovanovitch admits she was prepped on Hunter Biden and Burisma by the Obama administration,"During her public testimony in the impeachment inquiry Friday, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch admitted to being prepped on how to answer questions regarding Hunter Biden and his involvement with Burisma by the Obama administration before her Senate confirmation hearings.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) pressed the issue during the second day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

Stefanik asked Yovanovitch about the first time she was personally made aware of the apparent conflict of interest — that is, when Hunter Biden accepted a paid role on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, at the same time his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, led policy goals in the region.

""You testified that in this particular practice Q & A with the Obama State Department, [that] it wasn't just generally about Burisma and corruption; it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?"" Stefanik asked.

""Yes, it is,"" Yovanovitch confirmed.

""The exact quote from your testimony, ambassador, is, quote: 'the way the question was phrased in this model Q & A was, ""What can you tell us about Hunter Biden's, you know, being named to the board of Burisma?'"" Stefanik said.

""So, for the millions of Americans watching,"" the congresswoman continued. ""President Obama's own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden's role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation.""



""And yet our Democratic colleagues and the chairman of this committee cry fowl when we dare ask that same question the Obama administration was so concerned about. But we will continue asking it,"" she concluded.

President Trump's concern about Biden's involvement with Burisma has been the center of the impeachment inquiry in the first place.

Republicans have been frustrated by the Democrats, who are stonewalling their efforts to investigate the Bidens' involvement with Burisma in the impeachment inquiry.

Democrats say that the inquiry is specifically interested in the phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging him to investigate corruption in Ukraine, which would include possible corruption at Burisma, and Trump's alleged withholding of military aid to Ukraine barring an investigation into the Bidens.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/yovanovitch-prepped-on-hunter-biden-and-burisma-by-obama-administration,2019-11-15
Fire erupts at Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine during Russian shelling; firefighters are under gunfire,"Editor's note: The original version of this story, based on reporting at the time, said that a projectile struck a non-operational reactor at the plant. Subsequent reports have clarified that only non-reactor buildings were struck. There is no indication at this time that there was ever a risk of radiation leak due to the attack.



A fire has broken out at Europe's largest nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine, and firefighters are reportedly unable to reach the site because they're being shot at by the Russian military.

Officials are worried that if the facility is damaged, it could result in a nuclear disaster. The plant supplies about 25% of the country's energy.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said that a Ukrainian regulator reported no elevated radiation levels yet at the plant.



Tuz went on to say that firefighters have been unable to reach the fire site because they are being fired upon.

""We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,"" Tuz warned. ""There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.""

Video from a livestream at the plant appeared to show explosions and a fire but it was too blurry and grainy to see much detail. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted that Russian soldiers had breached the main building at the plant but he later said that there were conflicting reports.

The claim that the firefighters were being shot at was made in a Facebook post by Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Energodar where the plant is located.

Ukraine was also the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history at the Chernobyl nuclear energy plant in 1986 when the country was under control of the Soviet Union. That site was captured by the Russians earlier in the invasion of Ukraine.

"Closed door testimony blows a 'massive hole' in Democrats' impeachment narrative, says Rep. Zeldin","Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) told reporters that the closed door testimony before Congress on Thursday blew a giant hole in the narrative by Democrats on their rationale for impeachment.

Zeldin was speaking to reporters about the testimony of former State Department official Kurt Volker.

""Honestly, I don't believe that this impeachment inquiry, personally I don't believe this impeachment inquiry should have been launched the way it was, when it was, it was launched before any member of Congress was able to read the whistleblower's report,"" Zeldin said.

""It was released before any of us, any member of Congress, or the American public, was able to read for ourselves the transcripts,"" he explained.

Volker resigned as special envoy to Ukraine after the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani revealed texts from Volker that he said proved the State Department was encouraging Giuliani to seek help from Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

Zeldin said Volker's testimony unraveled many Democratic claims, and specifically named Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

""Now what we're going to see with one person after another coming before these committees of jurisdiction are blowing massive holes inside of the theory, the narrative that chairman Schiff has been providing to the public,"" Zeldin continued.



""For example, when he says that President Trump was asking President Zelensky to manufacture dirt on the Bidens, today blows a hole in that argument,"" he added.

""When you are making the claim that the president was asking for a quid pro quo with President Zelensky, today is blowing a massive hole in the middle of that allegation,"" Zeldin concluded.

Zeldin added in a tweet that Volker was ""candid, genuine, informed,"" and described him as a ""solid witness!""

The president approved of Zeldin's statement and tweeted a video of his comments from his official social media account to his 65 million followers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zeldin-says-volker-testimony-blows-up-impeachment-narrative,2019-10-04
Zelensky decries NATO's refusal to establish no-fly zone,"As Ukraine strives to defend itself against a Russian invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared that NATO will have blood on its hands for declining to establish a no-fly zone.

The outlet also reported that Zelenskyy said the leadership of NATO has given ""the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages, refusing to make a no-fly zone.""

Zelenskyy's pointed remarks come as Ukrainians bravely fight to defend their nation in the face of a destructive and deadly Russian onslaught.

In his speech, Zelenskyy called on the United States to implement and enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, provide additional aircraft and military defense systems to the country, and create a new security alliance that would reshape the global balance of power.

Zelenskyy also appealed to President Biden, as his American counterpart, and insisted that he take up the mantle of ""leader of the world"" and defend other nations that wish to be free.

""I'm addressing President Biden,"" he said, ""You, the leader of your nation, I wish you to be the leader of the world.""

""Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace,"" Zelenskyy added.

The Ukrainian president called on American lawmakers to recall September 11, 2001, when ""independent territories"" became ""battlefields"" and ""when innocent people were attacked – attacked from the air.""

He asked them to reflect on the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor that dragged the United States into the Second World War, saying that ""in [America's] great history you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians understand us right now when we need you right now.""

Zelenskyy said, ""Pearl Harbor, the terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it.""

Zelenskyy used these events to connect the United States' past suffering to the ongoing bombardment that Ukrainian cities currently endue.

""You could not stop it,"" he continued, ""Our country experiences the same every day. Right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now, various Ukrainian cities.""

Zelenskyy proceeded to implore the United States to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace. He said that Russian forces ""use drones to kill us with precision.""

He asked Congress, ""Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?""

""You know that they exist, and you have them, but … not in Ukraine, not in Ukrainian sky,"" Zelenskyy added, ""They do not defend our people.""

Zelenskyy's calls for a no-fly zone appear to have had some effect, as prominent members of Congress prepare to pressure Biden to implement one.

"Zelenskyy headline US military conference, ask defense contractors for more weapons for Ukraine","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address the most important U.S. defense contractors at a significant military conference in the United States later this month. Zelenskyy will be a keynote speaker at the military conference in Austin, Texas.

Zelenskyy and H.E. Oleksii Reznikov – Ukraine’s Minister of Defense – will speak virtually at the National Defense Industrial Association's annual Future Force Capabilities Conference and Exhibition on Sept. 21.

Reuters said Zelenskyy is ""expected to make an appeal for more weapons for his country's defense against Russia.""

Zelenskyy will speak during the Future Force Capabilities Conference and Exhibition as ""he rallies international support for his country's fight against the Russian invasion,"" according to the press release.

""Zelenskyy is expected to discuss Ukrainian defense needs and the critical primacy of the United States in advanced technology and hardware for the fight,"" NDIA added. ""His speech marks a rare moment for the Eastern European leader, as he directly addresses American military leaders and the defense industrial base.""

Zelenskyy will have an opportunity to speak directly to some of the most important American military manufacturers. NDIA's has board members from defense industry behemoths such as Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and L3Harris Technologies.

Raytheon and Lockheed Martin jointly produce Javelin antitank weapons that have been used by Ukraine against invading Russian forces.

The Hon. David L. Norquist – NDIA’s president and CEO – said of Zelenskyy, ""NDIA commends the inspiring and courageous stand that President Zelenskyy, H.E. Roznikov, and all of Ukraine have taken against Russia’s invasion. Together with the administration, Congress, allies, and partners, we will continue to support Ukrainians in their efforts to secure lasting freedom.""

The conference will be hosted by the Armaments, Robotics, Munitions Technology Divisions, and the Global Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) community.

NDIA said of the military conference, ""This event will convene a variety of attendees to foster creative interdisciplinary conversation and collaboration. Accordingly, it marks an unparalleled opportunity to maximize your expertise and interests across multiple focus areas by hearing from a team of top leaders in government, industry, and academia amid capabilities briefings, keynote remarks, panels, technical paper presentations, exhibits, and a live-fire demonstration.""

On the organization's website, the National Defense Industrial Association said it ""drives strategic dialogue in national security by identifying key issues and leveraging the knowledge and experience of its military, government, industry, and academic members to address them.""

""For more than 100 years, NDIA has provided a platform through which leaders in government, industry, and academia can collaborate and provide solutions to advance the national security and defense needs of the nation,"" the NDIA website stated.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the U.S. was sending $2.8 billion more in aid for Ukraine and other European countries threatened by Russia.

Also on Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the U.S. was sending $675 million in heavy weaponry, ammunition, armored vehicles, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems to Ukraine.

The U.S. government has approved over $53 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, according to The Hill.

Reuters reported on Saturday, ""Ukraine is negotiating for a $1.5 billion loan tranche from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to purchase natural gas, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Telegram on Saturday in a summary of a call with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-defense-industry-conference-weapons-aid-ukraine,2022-09-10
Ukraine says kill squad sent to assassinate president has been 'destroyed',"A Ukrainian defense official announced this week that a kill squad sent to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been ""eliminated"" by the country's armed forces, according to a Telegram post from Ukrainian authorities.

Oleksiy Danilov, chief of the country's National Security and Defense Council, reportedly said during a briefing on Tuesday that Ukrainian officials had recently been made aware of a ""special operation"" that was to be carried out against Zelenskyy by an elite Chechen special forces unit, known as the Kadyrovites.

The Kadyrovites are a highly-skilled paramilitary organization in Chechnya, a semiautonomous republic in Russia, that often carry out violence at Russian President Vladimir Putin's request. According to National Review, they are accused of a number of human rights violations and abuses.

Danilov said Ukrainian leaders were tipped off about the assassination plot by a group of sympathetic Russian agents with the enemy country's Federal Security Service.

""We are well aware of the special operation that was to take place directly by the Kadyrovites to eliminate our president. And I can say that we have received information from the FSB, who today do not want to take part in this bloody war. And thanks to this, I can say that Kadyrov's elite group was destroyed directly, which came here to eliminate our president,"" Danilov said, according to a Google translation of the Telegram.

The Ukrainian leader went on to say that the Kadyrovite group had been divided in two, with one being destroyed in Gostomel, near Kyiv, while the other was ""under fire.""

The Washington Post reported that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed on Monday in a Telegram post that two of his servicemen had died while six others were injured during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, neither the Chechens nor the Kremlin has attributed the losses to a foiled assassination attempt.

Since the launch of the invasion, Zelenskyy has claimed that Russian forces designated him and his family as top targets in the offensive and that Russian kill squads were actively seeking to assassinate him. Nevertheless, he vowed to remain in the capital, Kyiv, and stand alongside his people.

Even when the U.S. government reportedly offered to evacuate Zelenskyy out of harm's way, the president stood by his decision to stay.

""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" an ""upbeat"" Zelenskyy declared in response to the offer, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-kill-squad-destroyed-ukraine-says,2022-03-02
Zelenskyy rejects the possibility of a Ukrainian ceasefire despite Putin's openness as grain supply issues threaten global food shortages,"This weekend, the leaders of France and Germany pleaded with Russian President Vladimir Putin for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine to no avail as Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy each refused to make concessions to their counterparts and end the fighting in the eastern regions of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pleaded with Putin to begin “serious direct negotiations” with Zelenskyy to reach a “diplomatic solution to the conflict,” the New York Post reported.

In response, Putin said that the West is complicit in perpetuating the violence because of its “dangerous” efforts to supply Ukraine with munitions, military equipment, and financial support. Putin warned Macron and Scholz that the West’s continued support for Ukraine risks “aggravation of the humanitarian crisis.”

Scholz and Macron also sought the release of 2,500 prisoners of war captured by Russian forces and an end to the Russian blockade of the port of Odessa. Ending the blockade of this port is crucial to normalizing global agricultural supply chains as it normally handles millions of tons of grain each year.

Despite Putin’s insistence of “the openness of the Russian side to the resumption of dialogue” with Ukraine, the Russian president moved forward with efforts to expand the size of his military and signed new legislation that will eliminate the upper age limit of the men recruited by the Russian military.

The new law passed the Russian Duma on Wednesday and will allow Russian citizens over the age of 40 to enlist. It also removes restrictions that previously limited the Kremlin’s hiring of foreign mercenary fighters.

Zelenskyy, who spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently, said that the ongoing invasion of Ukraine could cause a global food crisis.

Zelenskyy said, “We must work together to prevent a food crisis and unblock [Ukrainian] ports.”

Nearly 22 million tons of grains are stranded in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to blockade Odessa and other ports, Zelenskyy confirmed.

As fighting continues in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Russia has claimed victory over Ukrainian cities and continues to advance forces throughout the region, Zelenskyy refused to accept any possible ceasefire that would forefit lands previsouly belonging to Ukraine. Echoing previous statements, Zelenskyy promised that Donbas would be “Ukrainian again.”

Zelenskyy said, “We have to increase our defense, increase our resistance, and Donbas will be Ukrainian again. Even if Russia will bring all suffering and ruination to Donbas, we will rebuild every town, every community. There’s no real alternative.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-rejects-the-possibility-of-a-ukrainian-ceasefire-despite-putin-s-openness-as-grain-supply-issues-threaten-global-food-shortages,2022-05-28
Zelenskyy honored Ronald Reagan Freedom Award,"The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute has announced that it is bestowing the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy has valiantly rallied Ukrainians to bravely stand in defense of their sovereign nation amid a Russian invasion — the Russian onslaught has wreaked death and destruction, leaving many Ukrainians dead, including civilians.



The foundation said Zelenskyy is the eleventh recipient of the honor, which it described as its ""highest recognition.""

Zelenskyy is being recognized ""for his courageous fight against tyranny and for his indomitable stance for freedom and democracy,"" according to the foundation.

""Appropriately, our 40th President was privileged to bestow the first Ronald Reagan Freedom Award upon Mikhail Gorbachev at the Reagan Library on May 4, 1992. Other Reagan Freedom Award winners since then include General Colin Powell, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, His Majesty King Hussein I, Lady Margaret Thatcher, President George H.W. Bush, Natan Sharansky and President Lech Walesa,"" a press release noted.

Zelenskyy has been calling for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

""We repeat everyday: 'Close the sky over Ukraine!' Close it for all Russian missiles, Russian combat aircraft, for all these terrorists. Make a humanitarian air zone,"" Zelenskyy said, according to subtitles on a video of Zelenskyy's remarks.

""We are people and it is your humanitarian duty to protect us, protect people. And you can do it. If you do not do that, if you at least do not give us aircraft for us to be able to protect ourselves, there can be only one conclusion: You also want us to be slowly killed.

Zelenskyy says he will continue pursuing peace despite atrocities committed by Russian forces,"Despite the potential war crimes carried out by the Russian military on the people of Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he would continue to push for peace.

The New York Post reported that Zelenskyy said, “No one wants to negotiate with a person or people who tortured this nation. It’s all understandable. And as a man, as a father, I understand this very well.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensely condemned for possible war crimes carried out by the Russian military that were uncovered as its forces withdrew from the areas around Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.

As they regained ground in the areas surrounding Kyiv, Ukrainian forces uncovered mass graves filled with civilians in the suburbs surrounding the city. They also found surface streets littered with the corpses of civilians.

Many of the slaughtered civilians bore marks of torture and execution. Civilian bodies were found with their hands tied behind their backs, and many had seemingly fatal gunshot wounds at the base of their skulls.

Russian forces have also bombed civilian gathering places such as train stations and medical facilities.

Zelenskyy said, “We don’t want to lose opportunities, if we have them, for a diplomatic solution.”

He added, “We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war.”

The Russian forces that withdrew from Kyiv are currently believed to be regathering in preparation for an attack on Donbas in Ukraine’s eastern region.

Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces currently fighting their Russian counterparts in the eastern regions of Ukraine are in “the heart of the war.”

He said, “It’s beating. We’re fighting. We’re strong. And if it stops beating, we will be in a weaker position.”

Zelenskyy is reportedly frustrated with the lack of military equipment being supplied to Ukraine by the U.S. and its allies in Western Europe. He indicated that he was grateful for what had been done for his country but suggested that much more needed to be done by the wealthy nations allied with Ukraine.

He said, “Of course, it’s not enough,” when asked whether the supplies his country had been given up to this point was enough to turn the tide of the war in Ukraine’s favor.

Despite Zelenskyy’s insistence that he is actively working to make peace with his Russian adversaries, when presented with the opportunity to make peace in mid-March he rejected the offer.

Israeli leadership, serving as diplomatic emissaries, conveyed to Zelenskyy that if Ukraine were to alter its constitution in a way that permanently committed the country from joining NATO, recognized Crimea as Russian territory, and recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, then Russia would end its invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-says-he-will-continue-pursuing-peace-despite-atrocities-committed-by-russian-forces,2022-04-10
"Zelenskyy vows revenge after Russian forces murder fleeing mother, 2 children: 'We will find every bastard' who attacked our people","In an impassioned address following the death of a mother and her two children who were attempting to flee a battle zone, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to hunt down ""every bastard"" who has attacked his people during Russia's unprovoked invasion.

What are the details?

News of the Ukrainian family's tragic death spread online over the weekend as snapshots poured in depicting Russia's assault on civilians attempting to cross a damaged bridge near the Irpin River as the fighting moved closer to their homes.

Photos and video obtained by the New York Times and others showed mortar fire hit the bridge as families ran across, killing four people: A mother, her teenage son and 8-year-old daughter, and a male family member.

Zelenskyy raged against the heinous attack on Sunday.

""A family was killed in Irpin today. A man, a woman, and two children. Right on the road, when they were just trying to get out of town, to escape,"" the president said, according to the Guardian. ""The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine! We will not forgive. We will not forget.""

""We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed 'start,'"" Zelenskyy continued.

""There will be no quiet place on this Earth for you, except for the grave,"" he threatened.

What else?

Elsewhere in the broadcast, Zelenskyy reportedly called on the west to do more to aid Ukraine as his people suffer under Russian atrocities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has continued to deny reports that his military is targeting civilian populations, but reports showing otherwise have surfaced frequently since the start of the invasion.

That latest attack on the damaged bridge connecting Irpin to Kyiv constituted an obvious murder, according to the Ukrainian leader. For days, families in Irpin and surrounding towns have been milling around the bridge, which has served as a last line of escape from areas where Russian troops are pressing in on the capital.

Multiple outlets reported that an attack on the bridge could not have been anything other than a targeted civilian attack.

""This is murder. Deliberate murder. And I have not heard a reaction from any world leader today,"" Zelenskyy said during the Sunday broadcast, the New York Post reported.

He added that the ""audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal that sanctions against Russia are not enough.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-vows-revenge-after-russian-forces-murder-fleeing-mother-2-children,2022-03-07
Zelenskyy warns of a 'third World War' if peace talks with Putin don't succeed,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin fail, it will mark the beginning of “a third World War.”

While speaking with CNN host Fareed Zakaria, Zelenskyy said that he is “ready for negotiations” with Putin to try to end the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I’m ready for negotiations with him,” Zelenskyy said through a translator. “I was ready for the last two years.”

“I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,” he added.

Zelenskyy went on to say that he would try any method of negotiation that would bring about an end to the conflict. He suggested that if it didn’t come to an end through negotiation, the conflict would lead to greater calamity.

He said, “We have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin, but if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.”

Noting that diplomatic dialogue does not always yield immediate results that please public appetites, Zelensky said, “All the people that think this dialogue is shallow, that is not going to resolve anything, they just don’t understand that this is very valuable.”

He added, “If there is just [a] one percent chance for us to stop this war, I think that we need to take this chance. We need to do that.”

During the interview with Zakaria, Zelenskyy noted that the Ukrainian military is digging its heels in and fighting back against Russian forces, dealing a “powerful blow” to the invading army.

Zelenskyy also lamented the ongoing loss of life being caused by the conflict.

He said, “In any case we are losing people on a daily basis, innocent people on the ground. Russian forces have come to exterminate us, and to kill us.”

“We have demonstrated the dignity of our people and our arm that we are able to deal a powerful blow,” he continued, “We are able to strike back, but unfortunately our dignity is not going to preserve the lives.”

It is likely that the bloodshed will continue as neither side appears willing to give in to the demands of their counterparts.

Previously, Russian leadership offered to end its invasion of Ukraine if Ukraine agreed to cease military actions, change its constitution to ensure its neutrality on the geopolitical stage, recognize Crimea as Russian territory, and recognize the currently Russian-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Zelenskyy rejected this offer.

And, as peace talks drag on, so to does the bloodshed.

The defiant last message to a Russian warship from 13 soldiers who refused to surrender a Ukrainian island is going viral,"The story of 13 Ukrainian soldiers who refused to surrender their island to a Russian warship and their final defiant message is going viral.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy confirmed the story in a statement Thursday that said the 13 soldiers would be honored for their bravery.

The soldiers were defending the small island of Zmiinyi located in the Black Sea. A Russian warship ordered them to lay down their arms and surrender peacefully.

""This is a Russian military ship. I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary victims. Otherwise we will open fire on you,"" the Russians reportedly told them via radio.

""Russian warship, go f*** yourself!"" was the reply.

The Russians opened fire on the island and killed all 13 soldiers.

""All the defenders of the island of Zmiinyi died, but did not surrender,"" the president later confirmed.

""All of them will be named Heroes of Ukraine,"" he said.

A reported recording of the exchange was posted to social media and was widely circulated.

The incident was compared by some to that of the 300 Spartans in antiquity who died defending their homeland against invading hoards of Persia. Zmiinyi island translated to English means Snake island, inspiring some to draw parallels to America's own Gadsden flag.

""May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever,"" said Zelenskyy.

Putin is fighting a battle on his home front as well as anti-invasion protests have roared to life on Russian soil. Some reports say as many as 17,000 people have already been arrested in the demonstrations flaring up across Russia.

CNN’s Brian Stelter’s lack of self-awareness in segment on FBI Director Wray is cringeworthy,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



On Tuesday, during a discussion of 'current' FBI Director Christopher Wray's remarks about 2016 Ukrainian election interference, CNN media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter and his colleagues took swipes at non-mainstream media sources and touted their own reporting as truthful. It was cringeworthy.

In his comments, Wray denied that the FBI had any evidence of Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election – as an aside, Director Wray, please look here. Wray then said he thinks ""it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information and to think about the sources of it."" That set Stelter and CNN New Day host Alisyn Camerota into a discussion about non-traditional media sources.



Stelter, with a giddy smile, told Camerota, ""We are expected now in this Facebook and Twitter world to go and figure out the truth ourselves. It's all been laid at our own hands."" After adding that it can be ""empowering,"" Stelter concluded that the director of the FBI was saying, ""Don't believe right-wing media.""

Of course that means that we should only believe media sources like CNN.

Camerota added that ""it's about news literacy, and you have to know the difference between a real journalist and a real news program and somebody who is just telling a story.""

Real journalism? Like CNN? Which had to retract yet another ""bombshell"" report as a result of the Horowitz report? This time it was the 2017 report that the FBI used a FISA warrant to surveil Paul Manafort during the Trump campaign. CNN corrected its false and erroneous reporting only after the IG report came out.

In September, National Review's Victor Davis Hanson outlined the habitual problem CNN has had with the truth in the Trump age.

On BlazeTV's ""The News & Why it Matters"" overtime segment (BlazeTV subscription required) Tuesday, host Sara Gonazales, Stu Burguiere, the Daily Wire's Josh Hammer, and I discussed the tone-deafness and complete lack of self-awareness of Stelter and Camerota.

I outlined how the notion of a ""professional journalism"" class that should be the only people entrusted with the truth is a dream of the elites in New York, Washington, and Hollywood. Sen. Dianne Feinstein even floated a licensure scheme for real journalists in the past.

The real problem that elitists like Wray, Camerota, and Stelter have is with people doing their own research and coming to their own conclusions. That is the job of real journalists, not the people, and certainly not ""right-wing"" media figures they disagree with.

Don't worry, though. Brian Stelter will continue to have disgraced former news anchor Dan Rather on his program as a ""reliable source"" of truth.

Drudge pushing junk ‘opinion’ about Mike Lee and his impeachment vote,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



It's no big secret that conservatives have been tuning out the Drudge Report, as the once massively popular conservative aggregator has taken an anti-Trump tone. A fantastical opinion piece claiming Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) might vote to remove Trump, shared by the Drudge Report on Thursday, is a textbook example of why this is happening.

As you can see in this archived version of the Drudge Report from Thursday night, in the first column, seven stories down, is the headline, ""Utah's Lee Would Vote to Remove?"" The link takes you to an opinion piece by Bloomberg's Jonathan Bernstein, hosted by Yahoo, that argues that he's ""even more convinced"" that Lee will be ""one of the three or four most likely Republicans to vote to convict and remove Trump"" from office.

Contrast that fantasy with what Lee told BlazeTV's Glenn Beck on his radio program Thursday. Lee said, ""I commend the president. I support the president. This president has actually been the most respectful and the most restrained in his use of military power as commander in chief. More so than any other president in my lifetime. And I respect him for that.""

Then there's what Lee told Beck in the beginning of December, ""This is absurd. … They [the House] shouldn't pass articles of impeachment because he hasn't done anything impeachable. He hasn't done anything that violates the law. He hasn't even done anything that's wrong. He's just had a conversation that involved a foreign leader, and there was nothing wrong with that. So no, they shouldn't pass articles of impeachment.""

There is no chance Mike Lee would vote to convict Trump on charges he's already said are junk. Bernstein is living in a fantasy world, and the Drudge Report has used him to help push its newfound anti-Trump agenda.

The Drudge Report made a name for itself fighting the leftist media narrative, but all too often lately, it seems to be pushing it.

Media in overdrive to label 2016 Ukrainian election interference as ‘conspiracy theory’,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



The media have bought the left's narrative of what happened in the 2016 election — hook, line, and sinker. Anybody in the public square who does their own research, uncovers facts that undermine the narrative, or publicly declares an unwillingness to accept it shall be scorned. The latest media target is Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana.

On Monday, CNN tried to take Kennedy to the woodshed over his comments on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" about Ukrainian government support for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Here's how NewsBusters explained it:

Let's look at a few examples. On At This Hour, host Kate Bolduan allowed Congressman and fellow liberal John Yarmuth (D-KY) to falsely claim that, regarding attempts by Ukrainian officials to express support of Hillary Clinton in 2016, Kennedy ""was bringing up magazine stories yesterday that apparently don't exist.""



Andrea Mitchell can say otherwise, but the facts laid out by The Federalist's Chrissy Clark are real articles with real claims about Ukrainians wanting Hillary Clinton to win (including that infamous Politico item).

CNN kept going. According to NewsBusters, the chyron used under its reporting said that Kennedy was ""spread[ing] debunked conspiracy theory that benefits Russia."" CNN continued that Republicans were trying to shift blame to Ukraine from Russia.

CNN senior political commentator and Obama administration alum David Axelrod even said, ""The other person who's very happy with it is Vladimir Putin, of course, who would love to see the blame for what happened here in 2016 shift to the Ukrainians.""

Memo to CNN et al.: Both can be true. The Russians could have interfered in the election to sow discord in the United States, and Ukrainian officials could have interfered and been openly rooting for Hillary Clinton. Those two things can both exist.

Glenn Beck and his team have extensively researched what went on in Ukraine in 2016. They have copious notes and have shared them with the public. The media just aren't intellectually curious enough to follow facts where they lead. They've tried to paint anyone affiliated with Beck as spouting ""conspiracy theories,"" including a former Boston-based journalist who tried it on me.

The media has the narrative, and woe those who stray.

You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



There's a silver lining to the climate alarmists' war on coal. It means there's a lot more for Santa to deliver to the members of the mainstream media who have obfuscated, lied, and been downright biased all year.

Yes, the media have been biased and full of fake news for decades, but as its Russian collusion hoax fell apart and it continued to willfully obfuscate Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, the media kicked it up a million notches.

As I shared Monday, the Intercept's Glenn Greenwald showed just how dishonest the media have been regarding the FISA abuse story. Instead of being aghast at the erosion of constitutional rights the investigation into President Donald Trump was littered with, the media reveled in it and, even after shown how bad it was by the inspector general, kept on cheering and attacking Trump.

Then there is the protection of the Democratic Party and its relationship with the government of Ukraine during the 2016 election. As people like journalist John Solomon and BlazeTV's Glenn Beck uncovered evidence of serious misdeeds by the Obama administration and Democrats, the media continued to obfuscate and call it an unfounded conspiracy theory.

Those are just some of the daily biases the propaganda wing of the left has proffered this year. You aren't imagining things: The media are getting more biased by the day.

Santa Claus knows all and sees all. So he knows just who's been naughty. And in 2019, nobody's been naughtier than the media. That black trail you'll see in the sky is just Santa, on his way to the homes of mainstream journalists, dropping off their sacks of coal for Christmas.

CNN reported, ""The phone records, which are labeled in the report's endnotes as coming from AT&T, show a web of communications between Solomon, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Ukrainian American businessman Lev Parnas, Nunes and the White House's budget office.""

Get that? Not only did Schiff obtain a journalist's call records, he obtained the call records of the ranking member of his committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). Which is particularly rich coming from Schiff, who is alleged to be a serial leaker.

Instead of expressing dismay that a journalist's call logs were obtained by a congressional investigator, media types are piling on Solomon, calling into question his reporting, which was extensively sourced with primary documents from Ukraine and other sources.

On Nov. 18, Politico media reporter Michael Calderone wrote about how The Hill, which published Solomon's reporting on Ukraine, has opened an investigation into that reporting and vows to correct it, if necessary.

CNN media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter tweeted Monday that ""the Hill's editor emphasizes that Solomon's work is being examined."" He also retweeted a tweet from Politico reporter Kyle Cheney regarding the phone call records obtained. So Stelter knew about the phone records as the primary means of bringing Solomon's name into the record.

Solomon's crime, to the media and leftist elites, is that he dared to investigate fully a counter-narrative that seems to be true. That is not allowed in Washington, where the elite narrative is the only one that matters.

Furthermore, Schiff has crossed the Rubicon with this line of inquiry. He has set a precedent. Don't be surprised if Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) obtains call records of Schiff and other media sources. Also, don't be surprised when people like Brian Stelter start carping about that being an abuse of power.

Wolf Blitzer afraid proof of FBI criminal actions during Russia probe may make people believe it’s true,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



On Thursday, CNN reported that an FBI lawyer is under criminal investigation for altering documents used to obtain a FISA surveillance warrant in 2016 on a Trump adviser. Of course, that has led the media, and CNN's Wolf Blitzer in particular, to express concern that the disclosure might ""provide ammunition to the President and his allies that this whole Russia investigation was criminally wrong.""

That's Wolf Blitzer's concern: That the revelation there were illegal activities surrounding the Obama administration's Justice Department spying on a rival political campaign may lead people to believe that the spying happened.



And it isn't just Blitzer. In the original written report from CNN, the author threw this in as the second paragraph:

The possibility of a substantive change to an investigative document is likely to fuel accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that the FBI committed wrongdoing in its investigation of connections between Russian election meddling and the Trump campaign.

Don't worry, though, Deep State supporters. The completely trustworthy Washington Post has chimed in that the criminal conduct ""did not affect the overall validity of the surveillance application.""

The Left and its media allies have ignored the fact that the Obama administration's Justice Department spied on a rival political campaign. They relentlessly attacked LevinTV host Mark Levin for bringing it up based on the media's own reporting. They have painted those warning about it as conspiracy theorists.

If the Justice Department inspector general's report shows multiple acts of criminality by politically motivated members of the FBI and other agencies, what will be exposed is something that will make Gordon Liddy and the boys' burglary at the Watergate Hotel look like amateur hour.

The media is in for a rude awakening on Dec. 9, when the report is expected to be made public.

"1,000 days of media-Democrat collusion to overturn Trump’s election","WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

One thousand days ago, Donald Trump was sworn in at noon as the 45th president of the United States. Every waking moment since, the mainstream media and Democrats have colluded to overturn the results of a duly conducted election by trying to gin up support for impeachment. No matter how hard they've tried, the American people are still not buying it.

The push to overturn the 2016 election started immediately after the media dried its tears the morning after the election. But it really gained momentum shortly after the inauguration: 999 days ago, Politico ran an op-ed about the ways Congress could ""curb"" Trump's power. In it, the author outlined a road map for impeachment. The day after the inauguration.

The media's biggest fetish for the first two years of Trump's presidency was, of course, the now debunked theory of Russian collusion. The nightly network newscasts spent 2,284 minutes of coverage on collusion during the first 791 days of Trump's presidency. NewsBusters calculated that to be an average of three minutes every night.

CNN was even worse. During some periods of time, over 90 percent of its programming was dedicated to collusion.

The media has also been willing participants in Democrats' propaganda operations. You'll remember that the media had disgraced porn lawyer Michael Avenatti on 254 times in one year, with CNN leading the way with 121 appearances.

Now that we know there was no collusion, the media have transitioned to Ukraine-gate. On Sept. 24, CNN even had a ""helpful"" graphic showing how many Democrats purportedly supported an impeachment inquiry. The following day, Politico ran a story claiming that a majority of the House supported an impeachment inquiry.

Fast forward to Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said there will be no formal impeachment inquiry vote in the near future. She said this after a meeting with her caucus. As Blaze Media congressional correspondent Nate Madden noted in his morning newsletter, ""If Pelosi and company had the votes to authorize an impeachment inquiry on the House floor, it would only make sense that they hold the vote to do so at this point.""

They don't have the votes, no matter how the media try to spin this.

For 1,000 days, media elites have woken up each morning, looked in the mirror, and said, ""Today's the day we're gonna finally get Trump."" For 1,000 days, they've failed to hit that mark. Don't worry, though, there's always tomorrow.

Intellectually incurious …

When it comes to what really happened in Ukraine over the past decade, the mainstream media have proven once again that they are intellectually incurious lemmings. The media take their cues from the Democratic Party. In a GlennTV live special Thursday night, BlazeTV host Glenn Beck showed how the media are willfully ignoring the full Ukraine story.

Beck showed how the Democrats and their media allies are focusing on one small part of the story ­— Donald Trump's phone call where he mentioned the corruption of Joe Biden and his son in a sweetheart gig with a Ukrainian natural gas company. They are ignoring the full picture, which shows how the DNC colluded with the former Ukrainian government to attack Trump in 2016.

The levels of corruption that Beck has found, and fully documented at his website, are staggering.

Beck shows how the media were handed the gift-wrapped Ukrainian collusion story by then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders in early 2017. The media, of course, ignored it. But the Ukrainian press and government has not.

Beck's special laid bare just how biased the media have been in their coverage of Trump and the incessant drumbeat of ""scandals"" they try to sell.

YouTube's Crowder censorship 'ought to raise some eyebrows' …

TheBlaze managing editor Leon Wolf dug into claims by BlazeTV host Steven Crowder of YouTube's censorship of his channel. According to Wolf, what he found ""ought to raise some eyebrows.""

Wolf was able to replicate searches where Crowder's videos were not the first ones that surfaced when you searched for them.

Conservatives have long suspected that YouTube has been trying to limit the reach of conservatives. Wolf shows that in some instances those suspicions are warranted.

Glenn Beck: Media’s cover-up for Biden and Obama admin. ‘most misleading lies I’ve ever seen by the media’,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

On Wednesday, BlazeTV host Glenn Beck continued to look into what really happened in Ukraine during the 2016 election and regarding the Bidens. In the special, Beck tore apart what he termed the mainstream media's ""most misleading lies:"" their insistence that Obama administration officials never gave Ukrainian prosecutors a ""do not prosecute"" list.

At the core of the story of what happened in Ukraine in 2016 — regarding both the election and Joe Biden's son Hunter — are the actions of the Ukrainian prosecutor and how they were guided by U.S. officials. In his first Ukraine special, Beck outlined how American diplomats told Ukraine who it could not prosecute.

The mainstream media have said that this is a lie, that a Ukrainian official, Yuriy Lutsenko, who replaced the ""bad"" prosecutor that Biden didn't like, recanted his statement that a no-prosecute list existed. The mainstream media including the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal offered ""facts"" to show this was the case.

The Journal said, ""Mr. Lutsenko later retracted the allegation."" Beck followed the trail to a Ukrainian site that FactCheck.org used to call the claim false.

Beck explained that the original Ukrainian source said that no person was given a written list of the names, but it was just orally transmitted. Basically the whole mainstream media fact check centers around whether or not a physical list was given of people not to prosecute, not whether or not it was discussed at all.

PART 2: MEDIA LIES ON UKRAINE…Proof Joe Biden DID fire Shokin for Hunter, Burisma Investigation youtu.be

This reminds me of the infamous quote by character Martin Lomasney, an old-school political boss from Boston in the novel ""The Last Hurrah"" about Massachusetts politics: ""Never write if you can speak; never speak if you can nod; never nod if you can wink.""



The media is stuck on what the meaning of the word ""list"" is.

Groundhog Day 2: Impeachment Boogaloo; the media downplay their own reporting to own Trump,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Today is the day the media and leftists are going to really get President Donald Trump, version 1,027. In their best impersonation of Bill Murray, every day since the inauguration, they've gotten up, looked in the mirror, and said, ""This is the day we do it."" And every day they've failed to convince their fellow Americans that Trump deserves to be removed from office.



On Wednesday, with the start of public ""impeachment hearings,"" their version of ""Groundhog Day"" enters a new phase, ""Groundhog Day 2: Impeachment Boogaloo.""

One of the key pieces of information that the media have been trying to obfuscate is that, as BlazeTV host Glenn Beck has shown, Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.

For example, take this piece at Politico by Kyle Cheney and Natasha Bertrand about Alexandra Chalupa, the DNC operative at the heart of Ukrainian collusion allegations. The article is subtitled, ""Alexandra Chalupa is at the center of unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.""

About those ""unsubstantiated claims."" They stem from an article at — wait for it — Politico in January 2019. The article highlights the ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump"" in the 2016 campaign. They aren't ""unsubstantiated.""



But that didn't stop BuzzFeed News from downplaying the article and basically throwing its authors, Ken Vogel and David Stern, under the bus.

So what the media is saying is that its own reporting is suspect. Which is the same thing it did when ""LevinTV"" host Mark Levin put together, from mainstream reporting, that the FBI was collecting the communications of Trump campaign officials.

The media will do anything in their power to get rid of President Donald Trump — including eating their own.

'Morning Joe' now Dem activist? …

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough has gone from being a Republican congressman to a Democratic political activist, all because Donald Trump once hurt his feelings. On Monday morning, Scarborough told Princeton professor Eddie Glaude that the way to fight Trump and Fox News is to register people to vote and turn them out.

Scarborough is just one of the many voices on MSNBC engaging in pure partisanship over objective news.

Joy Reid dreams of President Pelosi …

A week ago I highlighted how the left was going to quickly move to find a way to make Nancy Pelosi president. On Saturday, the leftist dream moved off the pages of the Washington Post onto the MSNBC screen. During a segment on ""AM Joy,"" hosted by MSNBC's Joy Reid, the panel explained how impeachment could lead to a President Pelosi.

These are not going to be isolated instances. As time goes on, more and more people are going to jump on the Make Pelosi President bandwagon.

Chuck Todd loses it …

The media hate anyone veering off their narrative. Chuck Todd, the host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" proved the point on Sunday's program. Todd went after Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) for suggesting the intelligence community may be anti-Trump.

During the interview, Johnson told Todd that he ""ought to ask [former CIA] Director [John] Brennan: What did Peter Strzok mean when he texted Lisa Page on Dec. 15, 2016?"" According to the Daily Wire, ""Johnson [then] read from a text message that Strzok sent Page in which he speculated that the CIA was behind leaks for political reasons.""

Todd couldn't see what this had ""to do with Ukraine.""

It's simple: Members of the intelligence community have been involved in a yearslong crusade to get Trump removed from office. The text highlighted that campaign and the bias. The sentiment in the intelligence community has everything to do with assessing the new claims coming from ""whistleblowers.""

Oh, and like clockwork, Brennan went unhinged against Trump again over the weekend.

MSM reporting on the State Dept.’s Hillary email report is a textbook case of media bias,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

In a Friday news dump, the State Department released the findings of its investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business. State found nearly 600 violations of sending classified information over the unsecured server. Thirty-eight people were identified as having done wrong. But you wouldn't know that if you consumed just MSM headlines.

Here's how a variety of news organizations headlined the story:

NY Times: ""State Dept. inquiry into Clinton Emails finds no deliberate mishandling of classified information""

Washington Post: ""State Department probe of Clinton emails finds no deliberate mishandling of classified information""

Politico: ""State Dept. finds no 'systemic' classified violation in Hillary Clinton private-server emails""

Vox: ""Clinton's email practices were risky but not malicious, State Department finds""

You get the idea. Clinton really didn't do anything wrong. CNN's Jeffrey Toobin apologized, "" As a journalist, I regret my role in blowing this story out of proportion.""

Out of proportion? Nearly 600 pieces of classified information were sent unsecured over the internet. But in Toobin's words, ""no big deal.""



This is how the government and media collude to run their narrative on a story, folks.

U.S. attorney's investigation 'not clear' …

On Saturday, NBC News reported that the Department of Justice's probe into the origin of the Russian collusion narrative has expanded. Its reporting is full of blatant bias calling into question the legitimacy of the probe.

This is how they do it. Here's the subhead of the article, ""If U.S. Attorney John Durham is conducting a criminal investigation, it's not clear what allegations of wrongdoing are being examined.""

""A review launched by Attorney General William Barr into the origins of the Russia investigation has expanded significantly amid concerns about whether the probe has any legal or factual basis,"" is how the lede is worded.

John Durham is one of the Department of Justice's most successful U.S. attorneys at rooting out corruption. But the media wants you to think he's running a rogue investigation.

What type of investigation would you trust? One that had frequent leaks like the so-called Russian collusion investigation? Or one where the lead attorney keeps the media in the dark and goes about his job?

Trump campaign to sue CNN for bias and false advertising,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

On Wednesday, Trump campaign lawyers sent a letter to CNN demanding ""substantial damages"" for the network's biased coverage of the Trump campaign and President Donald Trump, using the recent Project Veritas undercover reporting as a basis.

In the letter, the campaign's legal team said, ""Never in the history of this country has a President been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called 'mainstream' news, as the current situation.""

According to the Washington Examiner, ""While media is typically protected by the First Amendment, [Trump attorney Charles J.] Harder said the bias he cited at CNN was a violation of the Lanham Act 'by constituting misrepresentations to the public, to your advertisers, and to others' to distribute 'truly fair and balanced' news.""

The Lanham Act covers false advertising in the U.S..

This is certainly a novel approach. What the Trump campaign is alleging is that CNN represents itself to the public as a neutral provider of news. And by continuing to be slanted, and at times downright wrong about the president, that has hurt his personal reputation.

The campaign's attorneys have given CNN time to respond before they file legal action.

There are serious First Amendment issues to work out in this case. But it's not about the final legal verdict. It's about showing the hypocrisy of CNN.

Unfounded …



In its coverage of the Mick Mulvaney press conference Thursday, Politico casually threw this whopper into its reporting: ""In a whirlwind 40-minute news conference, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the U.S. aid was withheld at least in part because of a request to have Ukraine investigate unfounded allegations that foreign countries assisted Democrats in the 2016 election.""

""Unfounded?"" Perhaps the folks at Politico haven't seen BlazeTV host Glenn Beck's special on what really happened in Ukraine. Or his extensive documentation of it. Or maybe they haven't seen Ukrainian prosecutors pleading with U.S. officials as far back as April 2019 to take the evidence they've collected of the Democrats' collusion with Ukrainian officials.

To answer the question: Yes, folks at Politico have seen all of this. But they don't want you to see it. So they obfuscate and continue the lie.

Credible allegations …

On Friday, the media worked itself into a frenzy regarding a whistleblower report about an alleged phone call between President Donald Trump and a world leader. The Wall Street Journal reported that the leader in question was the president of Ukraine, and the phone call involved Trump asking for the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden's son's dealings in the Ukraine. The media ran with the story all weekend.

To be clear, if the president threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine for an action of that government regarding a U.S. citizen that's troubling. What the media isn't telling you is the exact thing that then-Vice President Joe Biden reportedly did to get the Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into his son fired. Biden is on video bragging about getting the prosecutor fired.

I said, ""You're not getting the billion."" I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ""I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.""

BlazeTV's Glenn Beck spoke with The Hill's John Solomon who broke the story in April. Beck then went to the chalkboard to explain what happened further.

Politico touched upon the Biden scandal but also ran cover for him by saying, ""Shokin was widely regarded as corrupt at the time,"" and that ""no evidence of wrongdoing has emerged.""

Not only is the media barely reporting on the Biden scandal. One of the few outlets that did is openly running cover for Biden.

Can you imagine Politico writing a story like that about Trump?

Can't make this up … It's ""upfronts"" week for television networks, where broadcasters highlight the upcoming fall season in an effort to secure advertisers. It's one of the biggest events of the year for the television industry. So naturally, NBC News, in an apparent effort to fight the #FakeNews label, featured … Brian Williams?

In what TVNewser called a ""roughly four minute"" segment, the disgraced former ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Williams was featured alongside other NBC News and MSNBC talent. If you've forgotten, Williams was demoted off of the flagship newscast for fabricating stories. He apologized and now appears on MSNBC.

Faced with growing distrust of the news media for pushing false and misleading stories that fit an agenda, NBC News chose to highlight someone it demoted for lying.

You can't make this up.

Collusion never dies … Despite the special counsel Robert Mueller report finding no collusion, the media are still fixated on the Russian collusion narrative and still running cover for the deep-state actors that birthed it. Over the weekend, the Washington Post and CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" tried to keep the flames burning.



First up is Aaron Blake's article in the Post that tried to call out any attempts to get to the bottom of how the FBI investigation of a political campaign started. Titled ""The GOP's increasing embrace of Trump's Russia conspiracy theory,"" Blake's article used the FBI general counsel at the time the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign to say that the investigation and how it started were all above board. Well, then, if one of the top FBI officials at the time tells us that the FBI is not corrupt, we have to believe him. Right?

Then, CNN media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter had Carl Bernstein on his ""Reliable Sources"" television program to talk about the current state of the Trump presidency. Bernstein's take: ""Many Trump-related story lines are converging, all of them convoluted, but many pointing in the same direction toward presidential abuses of power."" Also, Bernstein said that Trump is the ""most authoritarian president in our history.""

Maybe Bernstein doesn't remember the internment of Japanese-Americans or even the use of tanks to attack a religious organization's compound in Waco, Texas? Or even putting a man in jail for a video that you wanted to blame for the attack on the Benghazi compound? Chances are he does, and this is just more propaganda.

WTF MSM!? The Cannes to Hollywood sex trafficking pipeline,"



WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Even after Weinstein … Next week the yearly Cannes Film Festival begins on the French Riviera. It's one of Hollywood's most important industry events, where films are screened, deals are cut, and, according to The Hollywood Reporter, human trafficking victims are identified and lured into a trap using the promise of film roles as bait. Even after Harvey Weinstein was outed, THR says, this is happening.

Here's how THR reports what happens:

Another form of sex trafficking that is bubbling under the radar on the Riviera but obvious to most producers in the know is one in which non-U.S. citizens meet film industry connectors on the Cannes yacht circuit. The go-betweens help the would-be actresses, often still in their teens and hailing from countries ranging from Britain to former Soviet bloc states, gain legal entry into the U.S. and land a small or nonspeaking role in an American movie. The unspoken quid pro quo is that once in the U.S., they are lent out — sexually — to other powerful industry men. With the threat of her H-1 visa being revoked, the actress effectively can't say no or go to the police …



… In fact, the producer says it should raise a red flag any time you see a foreign-born actress with no credits suddenly make her way into a U.S.-shot movie. ""No one would legitimately pay for the H-1 visa for that kind of role. No way. It costs four or five thousand bucks,"" he says. ""As a producer, there's no chance that there's this one-liner that should be a local hire [and] that we're going to go with a first-timer from Ukraine and get a work visa for her.""

Remember it's these degenerate Hollywood types, who prey on the hopes and dreams of young women, who host Democratic candidates at fundraisers and attack Donald Trump as amoral.

CNN's Comey town hall … The totally nonpartisan folks at CNN took the occasion of the second anniversary of the firing of disgraced former FBI Director James Comey to host him in a town hall. Comey took the opportunity to take continued swings at Trump and even tried to insinuate that the discredited dossier was true, especially the pee tape.

Here are some of the highlights or lowlights, depending on your point of view:

But remember, folks, CNN wasn't pushing an agenda with this town hall. The media weren't trying to keep their hopes of Russian collusion alive. In other news, I'm opening up an Everglades real estate company that has some land you may be interested in.

Letting the cat out of the bag? …

The Washington Post just broadcast its impeachment fantasy for the whole world to see. From the moment President Donald Trump's inauguration was over, the Left and its media allies have been trying to remove him. Now the Post reveals the endgame dreams of the Left: President Nancy Pelosi. The paper published an op-ed that lets you know ""it could happen.""

Not content with merely removing the duly elected Trump for the crime of winning an election, the Left is now openly wondering how Nancy Pelosi could become president, skipping a hypothetical President Pence altogether.

Here's the close:

And yet, Sorensen's memo will be an essential - if not the only - guidebook for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., should she find herself getting closer to the Oval Office. The vice president appears to be a witness, at least, to the affairs under investigation, so the prospect of the House speaker's ascension is not as remote as it seemed just a week ago. If Sorensen's advice sounds somewhat quaint, it is only because we have drifted so far off the course set by previous presidents and the Founding Fathers.



No matter who succeeds this president, or when, the Sorensen memo is a road map to restoring the dignity, integrity and basic function of the nation's highest office. The chaos created by the current occupant's heedless, indulgent and volatile leadership - if it can be considered ""leadership"" - calls for attention to the national interest and preparation to avoid the kinds of hasty, unwise judgments and actions that can result in catastrophic mistakes. Although from another time, the Sorensen memo offers sage counsel for undertaking such preparations and a plan to steady our careening country and get it back on track.

This has never been about Donald Trump. It has always been about restoring the Left's power that Trump threatens. The WaPo once again proves that point.

ukraine commentary,"As the internet continues to be flooded with news about Russia's war against Ukraine, the public's mistrust of the media grows as well. Discerning truth from propaganda seems an increasingly daunting task.

Background



Ukraine is a small country that sits between Russia and Europe. Until 1991, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. After declaring independence from the USSR, the nation has since wavered between Russian and European associations.

During the Obama administration, the United States accused Russia of meddling in the business of the Ukrainian government. A leaked phone call between U.S. diplomats exposed Russia's meddling as well as an embarrassing admission by U.S diplomats.

In 2014, Ukraine is said to have communicated hope for major non-NATO ally status with the United States. Major non-NATO status is given by the U.S. government to non-NATO counties and offers financial and military advantages.

U.S. involvement in Ukraine often is described as an effort to expand western democracy into a nation that could otherwise fall to Russian control. To help understand this issue, it is essential to understand the meaning of ""democracy."" Here are the characteristics of a democracy:

The people elect their representatives.

The people enjoy civil liberties.

The government has an independent judiciary.

There should be an organized opposition party.

All must observe and uphold the rule of law.

Citizens in a democracy have rights and the responsibility to participate in the political system.

There is a real question about whether what the United States has been doing in Ukraine meets the criteria for expanding democracy.

The first clip that illustrates what has been happening dates back to 2014 and comes against a complicated backdrop. After gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine has wavered between a show of support for Russia and the West. In 2014, pro-western groups formed in Ukraine and led to an embarrassing leaked conversation involving Victoria Nuland, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.

In the original coverage of this video, U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland made headlines for a rude comment about the European Union; however, journalists buried the lede in the story. The clip showed Washington discussing meddling in the Ukrainian government with U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt — something that the Obama administration denied it was doing.

The National Endowment for Democracy, a non-profit on a mission to promote democracy worldwide, decided that Ukraine's democratically elected president Yanukovych was undermining its goals and began to socially engineer Ukraine's future by supporting the opposition and strengthening the country's democratic institutions.



Militias in Ukraine

In this 2018 video, Vice reported the stalemate between Ukraine's military and Russian-backed separatists where ""civilians are left to pick up the pieces.""

Following Russia's takeover of Crimea, the Russian military moved in and began training Russian-backed separatists. But Ukraine's army was not prepared to fight separatists and called on citizens to take up arms and defend Ukraine. Years later, Ukraine claims to have disbanded civilian militias.

Evidence suggests that militias in Ukraine have not been disbanded, making western military assistance problematic. Although Putin's claim that he invaded Ukraine to ""denazify"" it was almost certainly pretextual, it is doubtless true that Ukraine does, in fact, have a neo-Nazi militia problem. Before the current conflict erupted, this problem was widely reported on by such outlets as The Guardian, Yahoo, and Reuters. Multiple reports have accused the American CIA of having trained these neo-Nazi groups, and there is a real question how much control, if any, the Ukrainian government is actually able to assert over them.

Consequences of western involvement in Ukraine?

American political scientist and international relations scholar Joseph Mearsheimer wrote that Putin's move to take Crimea in 2014 should have come as no surprise. Ukraine waivered between joining the E.U., the west's growing encouragement of a pro-democracy movement.

""The West's triple package of policies—NATO enlargement, E.U. expansion, and democracy promotion—added fuel to a fire waiting to ignite. The spark came in November 2013, when Yanukovych rejected a major economic deal he had been negotiating with the E.U. and decided to accept a $15 billion Russian counteroffer instead. That decision gave rise to antigovernment demonstrations that escalated over the following three months and that by mid-February had led to the deaths of some one hundred protesters. Western emissaries hurriedly flew to Kyiv to resolve the crisis. On February 21, the government and the opposition struck a deal that allowed Yanukovych to stay in power until new elections. But it immediately fell apart, and Yanukovych fled to Russia the next day. The new government in Kyiv was pro-Western and anti-Russian to the core, and it contained four high-ranking members who could legitimately be labeled neofascists."" -

In Mearsheimer's view, Russia and the West have been fighting over Ukraine — a fight which Russia believes that it must win in order to ensure its survival. According to Mearsheimer, Western involvement in Ukraine has led to disastrous consequences for the Ukrainians because of the existential threat it posed to Russia.

Coup or Revolution?

This clip highlights Ukraine's one constant theme of Ukraine's history — Ukraine wants to be a sovereign nation that will fully subscribe to the highest European standard while building relations with Russia that are just and fair.





Connecting the Dots

While the United States' interest in Ukraine has, at times, proven to undermine Western principles, for Russia, a Ukraine-NATO alliance would be a massive defeat. It seems probable that Putin will go to great lengths to make Ukraine appear unfit for NATO. The United States has funded much of the military training exercises over the years to prepare the aspiring country for a NATO alliance. Considering the time and money invested, the United States must learn from mistakes made during the Obama administration and stop undermining the democratic process. Ukraine should decide on Ukrainian elections without outside influence.

Alaska: The Most Important State of the 21st Century,"In March of 2021, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Anchorage, Alaska, where they participated in a series of high-level and highly contentious talks with their Chinese counterparts, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi.

Six months later, the US Coast Guard unexpectedly encountered four Chinese warships off the coast of Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, inside the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Chinese vessels were reportedly conducting military and surveillance operations.

While Alaska is often an afterthought to most Americans, these events taken in tandem highlight the state’s growing strategic importance and should be cause for everyone to reevaluate how they think about The Last Frontier.

On March 30, 1867, The United States reached a deal with Russia to purchase the Alaska territory for a cool $7.2M, roughly the equivalent of $111M today. The treaty, negotiated by Secretary of State William Seward, was originally dubbed “Seward’s Folly” due to the Alaskan landmass’ reputation as an icy wasteland. However, perception quickly changed in 1898 following the discovery of gold in the territory. Alaska became the 49th state admitted into the Union in 1959.

Alaska is only the 48th most populous state, being home to just under 740,000 people, and in terms of GDP, it ranks slightly lower at 49th. This plus the fact that for long periods of the year a portion of the state is bathed in total sunlight or shrouded in 24-hour darkness might make it difficult to understand exactly how such a place could logically be described as “The Most Important State of the 21st Century.”

The explanation is quite simple: location, location, location.

To understand the geostrategic importance of Alaska one need look no further than a map.

Situated at the crossroads of the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, the Bering Strait off Alaska’s west coast plays host to two of the world’s most potentially lucrative shipping routes. The Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route.

Currently, both routes are largely unnavigable because they are frozen for most of the year. However, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Arctic Ocean is likely to be ice-free in the summers by 2050.

In fact, temperature increase in the region has already allowed for periodic shipping. In 2013, a Danish coal ship became the first-ever commercial freighter to navigate the Northwest Passage en route from Vancouver to Finland. By opting for the Northwest Passage over the traditional route, which would have taken it through the Panama Canal, the Danish freighter was able to shorten the journey by 1,000 nautical miles, transport 15,000 more tons of coal, and save $80,000 in fuel costs.

The thawing of the Arctic will connect North America with Europe’s largest port, Rotterdam, via the Northwest Passage. It will also connect Rotterdam to Yokohama via the Northern Sea Route.

These routes, being much shorter and cost-efficient than the ones that currently exist, will see a massive influx in shipping traffic over the next century, and by necessity, put Alaska, and the United States, at the choke point of two vital shipping lanes.

It's not just sea traffic, either. Alaska already plays a crucial role in air shipping. Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage serves as the 4th-busiest cargo airport in the world. And with tensions between Russia and Western nations increasing, Airlines may opt or be forced to avoid Russian airspace on international routes. This opens Anchorage as a prime layover destination, a mantle which it occupied for much of the Cold War.

Alaska also holds the potential to be a massive player in the energy market.

As Western nations have levied a bevy of sanctions on Russian energy, Russia has responded in kind, especially towards Europe, by manipulating their exports of liquified natural gas (LNG). As Russia has traditionally been Europe’s largest supplier of LNG, the Europeans are set up for a rough winter.

To curtail demand, EU member nations have agreed to cut gas usage by 15% over the next seven months. A cold winter could cut into Europe’s LNG storage and seriously threaten the ability of normal Europeans to stay warm.

As Europe and other countries like Japan work to wean themselves off Russian energy, Alaska presents itself as a golden goose.

The National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska has approximately 2.4 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, and it’s estimated that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is sitting on 10.4 billion barrels of oil. For reference, the European Union uses about 18.3 million barrels of oil per day. Alaska is also home to about 37 trillion cubic meters of natural gas reserves. Europe used about 400 billion cubic meters in 2021.

Of course, Alaska alone can’t make up for the exit of Russian energy, and there are plenty of issues when it comes to exporting LNG from the state, including a lack of pipelines. However, increased production in Alaska would immediately lower global prices and allow for other producers in the United States to export their own supply. This, however, is all dependent on the US government actually allowing exploration of Alaska’s reserves, which the Biden administration seems to have no interest in doing.

Alaska plays a major part in the United States’ ability to be energy secure and alleviate the burden of our allies having to rely on murderous and rogue dictatorships. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a premium case study.

Militarily, Alaska may prove even more important. In a 1935 address to Congress, General Billy Mitchell, widely regarded as the father of the air force, said, “I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.""

Today, America’s biggest strategic rival is undoubtedly China. The remainder of the century will be shaped based on the outcome of the power struggle between Washington and Beijing. That’s just the reality of the world we live in.

Alaska is by far the closest US state to East Asia. In fact, Anchorage is more than 1,000 miles closer to Beijing than Honolulu and more than 2,000 miles closer than San Diego. This kind of proximity could prove crucial if China was to make advances on Taiwan or other hot areas in the Pacific, like the Senkaku Islands.

Alaska can also be considered the northernmost edge of the First Island Chain. This string of islands runs from Borneo in the south to the Aleutian Islands in the north. This chain serves as the first line of defense against China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) projecting power into the Western Pacific.

It should come as no surprise then that the United States has nine military bases in the state, including three Air Force bases located in Anchorage, The North Pole, and Denali. Clear Space Force Station in Denali is one of the US military’s most strategically important bases as it serves a vital role in defense monitoring for the west coast. It also serves as the first in a series of detection outposts that monitor enemy ballistic missiles and inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Fort Greeley near Fairbanks is also one of America’s most important bases as it’s home to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System. These interceptors are capable of detecting, tracking, and destroying ballistic missile threats before they reach larger population centers on the US mainland.

Given China’s growing interest in the arctic and its surveillance activities near Alaska, it should be clear that China understands the geostrategic importance of America’s largest state. Leaders in Washington should do the same and increase investment in, and development of, Alaska.

Alaska is a priceless gift that was acquired for pennies on the dollar. When this kind of fortune befalls you, it’s wise not to squander it.

"Commentary: No matter who wins Tuesday, expect to hear a lot of claims that the winner is 'compromised' and more chatter about the 25th Amendment","Saturday is not only Halloween, but quite appropriately marks the one-year anniversary of the formal House vote to open up a ridiculous impeachment inquiry — the culmination of a post-2016 election vendetta, as I point out in ""Abuse of Power: Inside the Three-Year Campaign to Impeach Donald Trump.""

After the Democrats Russia-Russia-Russia obsession crashed and burned with the completion of a special counsel report, they moved to the country next door to try to remove him from office.

Knowing what we know now, turning the focus of the scandal onto Trump for his call with the Ukrainian president might have been the best way to mask a larger problem with Joe and Hunter Biden. The FBI reportedly has been investigating Hunter and his associates for possible money laundering since 2019.

Moreover, as interested as Trump (and at one point the media) were in Hunter's capers in Ukraine, the bigger story could be China. One of Hunter's partners, Tony Bobulinski, said on Fox News, if elected, ""I think Joe Biden and the Biden family are compromised,"" when it comes to dealing with China.

Thus, we are in a place in 2020 that isn't so different from where we were in 2016. Whoever wins the presidency on Tuesday will be followed into the White House with suspicions he is compromised by a foreign adversary. Also, expect talk of the 25th Amendment to come into play.

Recall Democrats claimed even before the 2016 election that Trump could be compromised by Russia. After Trump was elected, Democrats went to town on a vast conspiracy theory that manifested into a costly investigation that found no such conspiracy between Trump's campaign and the Russian government or operatives. If Trump wins again, Democrats will almost certainly find a way to blame Russia as at least one factor.

Biden has always been chummy with China, prompting some Trump supporters to tag him ""Beijing Biden."" That concern about being a compromised president will increase if the former vice president is elected Tuesday. While the Justice Department is part of the executive branch, it's not easy to shut down an FBI investigation. Who can say how far this reported probe of Hunter Biden and his associates might lead? It might — as the Russia collusion probe of Trump — turn out be much ado about nothing with regard to a potential President Biden. Or it could be much more substantive.

Concurrently, while Democrats began impeachment-in-search-of-reason starting immediately after Trump's election — considering emoluments, Russia, James Comey's firing, Stormy Daniels and mean tweets before settling on Ukraine — many Democrats pondered the 25th Amendment as plan B, as also noted in ""Abuse of Power.""

In 2017, Rep. James Raskin (D-Md.) proposed a bill on the 25th Amendment to oust Trump. He recently proposed a similar bill — endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — for the next president. House Democrats claim the legislation isn't for Trump but for whoever the next president is. It could be a means of hedging their bets.

Previously, Democrats tried to push a narrative that Trump is crazy and will likely continue to make this claim if Trump is re-elected.

If Biden is elected, the cognitive issues already being talked about will gain heightened attention. In this case, the notion might even have some bipartisan buy-in. Republicans and conservative commentators have been more eager to raise it in an election year. But Democrats have oddly put forward a legislative framework for using the amendment against whoever is the next president.

So, on a policy level, there are some big differences between Trump and Biden. But, regardless of who wins, expect to hear a lot of chatter from the opposition party about a president compromised by a foreign adversary with scattered talk about invoking the 25th Amendment.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/biden-trump-compromised-25th-amendment,2020-10-30
Commentary: The media's exoneration of Biden's Ukrainian dealings gives him the benefit of the doubt he does not deserve,"By now, the supposedly objective fact checkers in the mainstream media have nearly completed their race to fall all over themselves declaring that there is absolutely no indication that Joe Biden did anything wrong in connection with the firing of Viktor Shokin, former head prosecutor in Ukraine.

""No evidence,"" they have repeatedly cried. ""No evidence that Biden did anything wrong."" Never mind that, as of now, there is likewise ""no evidence"" that President Donald Trump asked for a quid-pro-quo from the Ukrainian government in the form of foreign-aid-for-an-investigation-of-Hunter-Biden.

According to the media, when there is ""no evidence"" concerning something Trump allegedly did, that is a good reason for everyone to dig in as deeply as possible, so that we can make absolutely sure nothing untoward happened. On the other hand, when there is ""no evidence"" that Joe Biden did something wrong, if you ask questions that any reasonably curious person might ask about a situation, you are a conspiracy theorist spreading smears.

The media's feverish exoneration really actually goes beyond giving the benefit of the doubt to Biden and crosses into the realm of defensiveness and ostrich-head-in-the-sand-land, but the central lynch pin of the exoneration comes down to the media's willingness to believe Joe and Hunter Biden when they say that Hunter Biden never discussed Burisma Holdings — or the Ukrainian government's investigation into same — with his father.

The Washington Post's ""fact check"" into the issue — written by noted Ukraine expert (please detect the sarcasm) Glenn Kessler — notes that a central fact of the Biden defense is that Joe and Hunter never discussed Hunter's work with Burisma Holdings. Initially, both camps denied that any such conversation occurred, until a New Yorker profile on Hunter Biden emerged in which he admitted to having at least one conversation with Joe about it. Noting this, Kessler (doing his dutiful part to carry Joe Biden's water) still declines to say Biden lied about this because, even though Hunter Biden admitted to the conversation, ""Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.""

Well, technically true. Joe Biden hasn't admitted it yet. Perhaps an enterprising journalist working for a large-budget, Democrat-friendly publication like the Washington Post might feel inclined to confront Joe Biden with the fact that his son is on record admitting to such a conversation, and ask whether Joe Biden has any comment on that, but that's probably asking too much of the Washington Post. Better to just somehow leave it that Trump is the liar in this particular scenario, as Kessler did.

Here is the thing: the media's blind willingness to take Joe Biden's word for what happened would constitute professional laziness and malpractice even if it were the ordinary, run-of-the-mill politician. But in this case, we know, based on repeated instances of history, that Joe Biden is a serial fabulist.

It is often claimed that Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign was derailed due to accusations of plagiarism in his speeches. That is maybe about half true. It is true that Biden plagiarized speeches, but that is often considered to be a relatively menial sin in politics. What really doomed Biden was not that he plagiarized rhetoric, but that he plagiarized portions of speeches that included him describing himself in situations that never happened. In other words, it wasn't just that he stole lofty lines to inspire people, it's that he was constantly telling stories about himself that were simply not true.

It's a habit that Biden has never really rid himself of. In fact, it's already been established that he did it with respect to this very story. A central aspect of Biden's bragging was that he made the supposed threat to the Ukrainians while in Ukraine. He even dramatically stated that he was going to be on a plane back to the states in a few hours, and if Shokin wasn't fired before he boarded the plane, then Ukraine wasn't going to get the money.

The problem, of course, is that Joe Biden did not go to Ukraine at all in March 2016. He did meet briefly with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the White House — two days after Shokin had already been fired.

Put simply, Biden's interaction with Poroshenko did not happen the way he claimed it did. Frankly, it was probably not even close. Even Obama administration officials have groused in recent days that Biden has vastly inflated, conflated, and exaggerated events related to the firing of Shokin since he left office.

I am at a loss to understand why the word of a man with such a lengthy history of making up facts to suit his own ends — including key details in this very story — should be so worthy of blind trust by a media that likes to pretend that it is dedicated to investigating and uncovering the truth.

One further thing needs to be noted in connection with this story. The media has likewise pretended that Biden's word is more or less irrelevant to this story because there is a lot of evidence that the international community wanted Shokin dismissed due to corruption anyway.

It is true, as far as it goes, that there was considerable international pressure to remove Shokin. And it is true, as far as it goes, that there appears to have been corruption in Shokin's office. But as with all things involving Ukrainian politics, it isn't just as simple as, ""Well his office was corrupt and everyone wanted him gone anyway, so there's nothing to see here."" And the American journalists who are suddenly pretending to be experts in Ukrainian politics because they've done a little research on wikipedia are beclowning themselves by pretending to understand the intricacies of the Ukrainian political game.

See, corruption is not only a fact of life in Ukrainian government, but it is also considered more or less par for the course in the Ukraine for the government to use its prosecutorial powers to go after the political opponents — including the well-connected quasi-state mega corporations and the oligarchs who run them — of the ruling power. In fact, this very fact of life is exactly why companies like Burisma Holdings paid politically well-connected people who have no experience in the natural gas field (like Hunter Biden) comfortable sinecures to sit on their boards, as kind of a bulwark against their own corrupt state and politically motivated reprisal investigations.

And so, while Shokin may well have been corrupt, and while everyone may have wanted him removed, he may also have been the very worst possible person to have in office, from the standpoint of Burisma Holdings.

I'll be honest with you: I don't know whether that's true because I'm not an expert in the internal workings of Ukrainian politics circa 2016, and I wasn't present for Burisma Holdings board rooms discussions. But I'll tell you this: neither is Glenn Kessler nor any other member of the American media who has written ""fact checks"" confidently proclaiming that Biden is innocent and everything was totally above board knows, either.

In a sane world, with a media that was truly interested in reaching the truth, well-funded organizations like the Washington Post and CNN would be sending reporters to Ukraine to dig into original documents, confronting Joe Biden with Hunter's statements about their conversations, and trying to dig up records to uncover the truth about what happened.

Instead, they seem mostly compelled to just give Joe Biden the benefit of the doubt.

And there's almost no one who deserves it less.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/biden-ukraine-benefit-doubt,2019-09-29
"The Bidens, Burisma, and Hillary: More back story on ‘Kyiv/Washington gravy train’","A year after the Democratic House voted to impeach President Donald Trump, we're finding out more about witnesses in the impeachment hearings, the Biden family, Burisma Holdings, and now even Hillary Clinton's campaign.

My book ""Abuse of Power: Inside the Three-Year Campaign to Impeach Donald Trump"" explains that Burisma hired Democratic-leaning lobbying firm Blue Star Strategies, which contacted top State Department officials in February 2016 and dropped Hunter Biden's name as a board member in attempting the make the case there is no evidence of corruption from the Ukrainian energy firm. The book details why Hunter Biden's work for Burisma sparked State Department concerns from officials who thought it would complicate then-Vice President Joe Biden's diplomacy in Ukraine.

Blue Star Strategies apparently kept working for its client in both the U.S. and Ukraine, according to new information released by government watchdog group Judicial Watch, which sheds some new light on the events of 2019 and the Democrats' effort to oust Trump from office without an election.

On Sept. 3, 2016, State Department official George Kent sent an email to then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and other officials stating that then-Ukraine Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko told him Blue Star Strategies CEO Karen Tramontano offered him meeting with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. ""He confirmed he had been pitched by Blue Star, not sought them out,"" Kent's email said.

""Blue Star CEO Tramontano's pitch was that she could gain him access to high levels of the Clinton campaign,"" the Kent email continued, adding, ""and that was appealing – to meet the possible next Presidential Chief of Staff.""

Tramontano was a top White House official under former President Bill Clinton before heading Blue Star Strategies. Kent suggested Lutsenko not take the offer to be in contact with the campaign, suggesting it was unlikely he would gain such access so close to an election, according documents obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The subject line from Kent said, ""Lutsenko now likely not to go to DC with Blue Star, other Ukr issue comments."" Kent said he talked to the prosecutor about the suspected corruption by Burisma, the Clinton Foundation, and ""the media attention being paid at present to the Kyiv/Washington gravy train.""

In 2019, Democrats and media pundits claimed talking about Hunter Biden was a distraction from Trump's impeachment. ""Abuse of Power"" contends that Trump's impeachment was a distraction from the Biden family problems. This is particularly the case now that we know Hunter Biden is under federal investigation for other business deals — though probably not Burisma.

Both Kent and Yovanovitch were witnesses in the House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings. Kent was the most forthcoming about his concerns regarding Hunter Biden's job on the board of Burisma, getting paid $50,000 at a time the company was facing corruption allegations.

""This smoking gun email ties Hunter Biden's Burisma's lobbying operation to an influence-peddling operation involving the Clinton campaign during the 2016 election,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a public statement. ""This further confirms the Obama-Biden-Deep State targeting of President Trump was to cover-up and distract from their own corruption.""

Yovanovitch told the House committee in her October 2019 testimony that she knew little about Burisma and that ""it just wasn't a big issue."" In October, Judicial Watch released State Department records that include a briefing checklist of a February 2019 meeting in in Kyiv between Yovanovitch and Sally Painter, co-founder and chief operating officer of Blue Star Strategies.

Last Friday marked one year since House Democrats voted almost along party lines, with four defections on at least one of the two impeachment articles. But impeachment was the culmination of what Democrats sought to do since Trump was elected in 2016. When the Russia case fell apart, Trump's imperfect phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would suffice. As it turned out, the phone call gave Democrats an avenue for two political goals impeach Trump and (for the time being) protect the Bidens.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/bidens-burisma-hillary-kyiv-washington-gravy-train,2020-12-21
Chip Roy: Not one additional penny for federal tyranny,"America is not right.

America is not right because she is being pulled apart — pulled apart by Democrat politicians intentionally breaking down America’s long-standing norms, her institutions, and her economic and military superiority. Too harsh?

Dangerous cartels are pouring fentanyl and trafficked human beings into our communities and undermining national sovereignty through a purposefully uncontrolled, wide-open southern border. Bureaucrats at the IRS, FBI, and “public health” agencies are running amok, targeting taxpayers and political opponents and firing Americans quite literally for making their own health care decisions.

Our self-inflicted energy crisis is sending prices through the roof, weakening our grid, and sabotaging national security. Health “care” has been handed over to insurance companies and is too expensive and increasingly unattainable for millions because of a politically motivated focus on “coverage.” Our schools are literally teaching children to apologize for their country under the tenets of critical race theory and to reject the “radical” idea that there is a difference between man and woman. And even our military is facing a recruitment crisis in the wake of the incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan because it is increasingly prioritizing wokeness over lethality.

Yet the GOP needs to look in the mirror, too.

Republicans too often join Democrats to write blank check after blank check to fund every last bit of this radicalism, fueling rampant inflation in the process. Worse, they offer only “big talk” political campaign rhetoric and tepid, aging ideas more suited to advancing corporate and defense industry largesse. And big corporations are happy to oblige – profiting off crony capitalism and knowingly advancing an environmental, social, and governance movement that is actively destroying small businesses, free enterprise, and liberty. And all of this is steamrolling a working class who are left to wonder what happened to their country.

Enough.

Republicans must prove to the American people that we will no longer be complicit in this deconstruction of America. But it is simply not good enough to say, ""Trust us and put us back in charge."" We have to mean it. We must stand up. And we must demonstrate that we will fight for the people who sent us to Washington after telling them we would.

We can do just that, one final time before the upcoming election, by pledging to our constituents that we will not provide one more penny to fund the tyranny carried out by the Biden administration.

The tools to take action are readily available to us – it’s just a matter of Republicans finding the collective will to use them. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress absolute authority over federal spending. James Madison, the father of the Constitution, wrote, “This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people …”

Federal funding for fiscal year 2022 expires on September 30, and Congress will have to decide whether to pass either short-term funding with a “continuing resolution” or a full appropriations package for 2023. But neither of these bills can pass without Republicans' votes.

Here’s how this will work. Democrats will say something like, “We can’t pass appropriations by September 30, so we’ll do a short-term continuing resolution until mid-December, throw a little money at Ukraine, etc., and then we can handle this after the election.”

Republicans must loudly and emphatically reject this business-as-usual approach. Don’t hide behind Ukraine or whatever the “emergency” of the day may be, and do not cower in the corner fearing that we may be “blamed” for a government shutdown. Just say no.

Therefore,House and Senate Republicans should pledge to reject any continuing resolution that expires prior to the first day of the next Congress, as well as any appropriations package put forward by Democrats this year, whether it’s before or during the upcoming “lame-duck” session.

This would empower the American people to decide – through the November elections – how taxpayer dollars should be spent by the new Congress that begins in 2023.

Any member of Congress who wrings his hands about this approach should be prepared to explain to the American people why he supports funding a bureaucracy that is fundamentally at odds with their freedom, security, and prosperity.

Republicans should explain why they are willing to give nearly $60 billion to petty tyrants like DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who lied to Congress when he claimed DHS had “operational control” of the border. Border Patrol has apprehended over 3 million illegal migrants since President Biden took office, 1 million of whom have been released into the interior U.S., with roughly 900,000 known “gotaways.” And cartels are trafficking increasing amounts of deadly fentanyl, which caused 71,000 “overdose” deaths in 2021, into our communities and schools.

Perhaps Republicans should explain why they are in favor of providing$13 billion in annualfunding to an IRS that just received an $80 billion windfall to hire 87,000 new agents. Voters also may wonder why Congress continues to give $11 billion to the FBI each year without demanding that it not target parents for voicing concerns about their kids’ schools at the behest of a radical organization that equated them to domestic terrorists.

Speaking of schools, Congress still gives about $80 billion to a Department of Education that pumps money into schools that are failing our children and filling their minds with radical racial and gender ideologies. Not to mention student loans – where we will be giving a middle finger to hard-working Americans who paid off their federal loans or never took them in the first place by forcing them to pay hundreds of billions to pay off other peoples’ debts.

Do Republicans approve of the “public health” agencies – over $6 billionto fund the NIAID run by Tony Fauci – that forced schools to shut down altogether, doing immeasurable harm to children at all age levels? Or the nearly $9 billion given to a CDC that pushed for businesses to close and for masks to be worn at all times, which are just two of the colossal mistakes the agency made in its COVID-19 response?

And do Republicans support giving nearly $10 billion to the EPA to press its regulatory boot on the necks of American energy producers while families are struggling to fill up their gas tanks and pay their power bills? Or the billionsin subsidies to weather-dependent renewable energy sources that make grids – in states like Texas, of all places – less reliable, or the millions in tax credits we provide to rich liberals so they can buy $70,000 electric vehicles and then preach to you about it?

These are just a few ways that federal bureaucrats use bipartisan congressional funding to undermine the well-being of Americans every day. Step one is for Republicans to refuse Democrats the ability to pass another massive appropriations package this Congress. Step two is for Republicans – if Americans grant us the majority in the House next year – to aggressively expose the federal bureaucracy and demand commonsense reforms and policies for the benefit, not the detriment, of the American people.

Not one additional penny for this radical Congress and administration.

Commentary: America will be memory-holed if we do not act,"I've been telling you for months that Sweden is the way. It has been the control case for the efficacy of lockdowns and masks, and with each passing day it serves as a light in the darkness defining the path to true science, public health and precious freedom.

But in a world of petty tyrants and jesters, Sweden may as well be the lost city of Atlantis. It has been memory holed by no less than much of the scientific community itself in too many Western countries (including our own), as well as progressive dreamers who just a year ago would have celebrated Sweden's secular accoutrements.

Because this was never about science. It was about power and control.

Which brings us to our next control case that is being flushed into oblivion because it doesn't serve the interests of dystopian wanderlust. That would be our very country. The United States, the only country ever founded on a creed, has been striving in various forms since the 18th century to prove that the better angels of our nature could win out so that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""

But if I may be so bold as to go further than President Lincoln, the national dream has always gone well beyond simply not perishing while holding its place as just one option among equals. No, flourishing, and fantastically so as a shining city on a hill calling out to all mankind, has always been our land's God-breathed rendezvous with destiny.

That's why, like with Sweden, it must be memory holed by its domestic enemies, the rot within us that is on a relentlessly suicidal journey. There simply can't be road maps left lying around that point people the way to true north when the transgendered, upside down world of their warped minds are now so close at hand. Thus, it shouldn't surprise us that one of the primary ways of burning those road maps is by following the devil's lead.

In other words, they lie like their spiritual father — the father of lies.

Namely, if they are guilty of something, they will try to hang you with it. Joe Biden and his son in bed with Ukraine and China becomes President Trump's colluding with Russians. Journalism as persistent left-wing propaganda and group think becomes Twitter and Facebook claiming conservatives are the real source of bias. To the point of censoring the spokesperson for the President of the United States and one of the oldest newspapers in the nation, the New York Post. Amy Coney Barrett claiming she loves the Constitution and that she will interpret it as it is written becomes ""The Handmaid's Tale"" come to life. Webster's Dictionary even rallied to the cause of chaos last week and changed the definition of the word ""preference"" overnight, in order to keep the crazy train running on time.

It is a “Did God really say?"" memory hole of unknowing and unreality that we are currently choking on just as we did all the way back at the beginning of creation. The dishonesty is so thick that, as with some pilots who become disoriented because they don't trust their instruments, regularly people passively taking it all in are literally spiraling to their death while thinking all along they are on the straight and narrow. We have been given paradise, yet we think it chains.

America used to fight against that tide with extreme prejudice, and its citizens' First Amendment rights were its primary weapons. Where there was a loud voice of decay and decadence ringing out, eventually there would be a counter and more often than not, the good would win out in the end. It's how slavery, American's original sin, was defeated. If America could prove true to its founding word against that scourge, its status as a control group for self-government could survive anything, couldn't it?

Not if we sit passively by and no longer care to take our turn as a people to stand a post for liberty. If we act, we will win and prove once again that this “Republic, if we can keep it"" is a far greater calling in our hearts than “trust the experts while we Netflix and chill.""

But we must act. Because it isn't the Constitution itself and its implied civic machinery, as vital as it is, that is the control group. That is merely the weapon, and it doesn't come with an autopilot. We, the people, are the control group. And as with guns, the weapons of government can be wielded by either righteous or wicked men.

So which are we? And what are you prepared to do?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-america-will-be-memory-holed,2020-10-16
Commentary: Check out the left-wing lawyers who were helping the unelected bureaucrats who sought to take down President Trump,"One of the attorneys for the anonymous whistleblower that sparked a presidential impeachment kept a lid on his client's identity as best he could, but kept no such secret about his own intentions — as Mark Zaid openly called for a ""coup"" in 2017. The whistleblower's other lawyer in 2019, Andrew Bajaj, also tweeted in 2017, ""we're there"" for invoking the 25th Amendment.

The early intentions of Zaid and Bakaj were widely known. But they weren't the only far-left lawyers behind the unelected government bureaucrats in the attempted election nullification caper (aka impeachment), as revealed in ""Abuse of Power: Inside The Three-Year Campaign to Impeach Donald Trump."" Most of the impeachment witnesses who testified before the House Select Committee on Intelligence in late fall 2019 were represented by lawyers steeped in Democratic politics and some associated with extremist causes.

Among the rare witnesses with direct knowledge of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was then-National Security Council official Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman — who came very close during testimony to admitting he told the whistleblower about the call.

David Pressman represented Vindman. After mid-level roles in the Clinton White House and State Department, Pressman went to work in the early 2000s for the extreme left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center. While there, Pressman was involved in the center's campaign to take down a monument to the Ten Commandments outside the Alabama State Judicial Building. He returned to government in the Obama administration, and President Barack Obama eventually named Pressman as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Security Council for special political affairs in 2014.

In stark contrast to Vindman, former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch had zero direct knowledge of either the Trump-Zelensky call or Hunter Biden's work for Burisma. She seemed to be there to be a sympathetic witness. Her lawyer was Lawrence S. Robbins, who previously represented Jane Sanders (wife of Sen. Bernie Sanders) during an FBI investigation of her handling of finances when she was president of a Vermont college that went bust. Robbins also represented several associates of Bill and Hillary Clinton during the Whitewater investigation of the 1990s.

Moreover, Robbins was a public cheerleader for impeachment since at least mid-2018, as he wrote an op-ed for Politico calling for Trump's ouster from office for allegedly violating campaign finance laws in paying Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about their fling. After the Mueller report's release, Robbins again demanded Trump's ouster for obstruction of justice, even though the report cleared Trump and his campaign of the underlying matter of Russia collusion.

Lee Wolosky represented former NSC official Fiona Hill. Wolosky was on the NSC for the Clinton White House and then joined the Democratic law firm of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, famous for litigating on behalf of Al Gore in the Bush v. Gore lawsuit for Florida's electoral votes in 2000. Obama appointed Wolosky U.S. Special Envoy for Guantanamo, to lead efforts to close the U.S. detention facility for terror suspects there — which never happened.

Not all the lawyers were in the tank for Democrats. William Taylor, who became the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine after Trump fired Yovanovitch, hired Never-Trumper John B. Bellinger III, a former legal advisor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was among 50 former Republican national security officials who signed an August 2016 letter saying, ""None of us will vote for Trump.""

The assorted lawyers advising impeachment witnesses, for the most part, had a clear-cut desired outcome. That's not to say they weren't serving their clients best interest considering none of the witnesses identified a finite high crime or misdemeanor that Trump committed.

None were more up front about their motives than the whistleblower's lawyers — with the possible exception of Robbins.

On Jan. 3, 2017, weeks before Trump's inauguration, Zaid tweeted, ""#coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion. #impeachment will follow ultimately."" On May 9, Zaid tweeted about Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton: ""Johnson (1868), Nixon (1973), Clinton (1998) impeachment hearings. Next up @realDonaldTrump (2017)."" Zaid was off by a couple of years. That June, marking 45 years since Watergate, Zaid tweeted: ""And 45 years from now we might be recalling stories regarding the impeachment of @realDonaldTrump. I'll be old, but will be worth the wait.""

Bakaj on August 2017 tweeted, ""The 25th Amendment concerns @POTUS' inability to discharge the powers and duties of office. Says nothing about mental health. We're there."" Bakaj interned as a college student for the Senate offices of Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer. He also held government jobs at the Justice Department, CIA inspector general's office, and the U.S. embassy in Kiev.

Zaid and Bakaj were involved in the project ""Whistleblower Aid,"" co-founded in 2017 by John Tye, who also previously worked for the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center, as well as the climate change activist group Avaaz. Tye also maxed out to Hillary Clinton in 2016, giving $2,700. Whistleblowers calling out government misconduct is great, but the founding of the group in 2017 cast doubt on just how nonpartisan it was.

The fact is, just as certain members of Congress and liberal nonprofits were rather public in paving the way for a Trump impeachment for something — anything, what was less transparent is the legal community in and around the D.C. swamp was also ready to pounce. ""Abuse of Power,"" reveals these motives and others that long preceded a Ukraine phone call.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-left-wing-lawyers-impeachment,2020-09-11
Commentary: Diplomacy — if we can keep it,"Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) foreign policy beliefs have been ruffling feathers on the left and the right since he took office in 2011.

Like his father before him, Rand is no stranger to criticism from both sides of the aisle when it comes to his cautious and conservative foreign policy views.

For decades, politicians in the Republican and Democratic parties have beat the war drums against the Middle East and pretty much any other nation that dares to differ from the U.S. culturally or politically. While there are certainly times when military conflict is warranted, the United States has abandoned the restrained and cautious foreign policy of George Washington.

Since 9/11, the United States has sent tens of thousands of troops to fight wars in the Middle East, with many soldiers being younger than the wars they fight in. Too many of our men and women in uniform have left the United States to fight the “War on Terror,"" a war that has largely undefined goals and an ambiguous end date.

While President Barack Obama promised to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he failed to do so, instead expanding the United States' involvement in the conflicts and authorizing use of U.S. forces in Syria as well, all the while spending trillions of dollars in the process. Thousands of American troops remain actively engaged in these conflicts.

With regard to Russia, Obama pretended to adopt “tough guy"" rhetoric and policy positions against Russia, with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hoping to follow in his footsteps with her own run for office, but during their tenures both failed to bring about any significant change from the Bush administration. In fact, they made things worse — making illicit deals with the Kremlin with promises of “more flexibility"" after the 2012 election.

In Sen. Rand Paul, America has an alternative.

Perhaps the most memorable example in recent history of an American politician engaging Russia directly with firm dialogue was when President Ronald Reagan successfully negotiated with Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall in the '80s.

It was under Reagan that “peace through strength"" was exemplified in the modern era, and for arguably the first time, the country saw that a nation does not have to dominate its foes on the battlefield in order to triumph.

Today, the United States and Russia possess about 90 percent of the world's nuclear warheads.

Like Reagan, Paul knows that peace talks with Russia are vital if Americans want to avoid a foreign war that neither nation would win.

“We should have more dialogue with Russia ... we need better dialogue so we won't have an accidental nuclear engagement,"" the senator, who has consistently lobbied for an end to expensive foreign wars, said.

Paul's views have seemingly steered U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump toward a new direction.

Trump has adopted a new tone that will surely resonate with the American people, arguing that it is time to “bring the troops home"" and end the useless foreign wars that the U.S. is currently involved in.

Since the budding friendship began, Trump has called for the withdrawal of American troops in Afghanistan and Syria.

After Trump announced that U.S. troops would be removed from Syria, Paul was one of the few who praised Trump's decision.

Trump noticed, and doubled down on his decision to bring the troops home, tweeting a quote from Paul:

It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he's right...The generals still don't get the mistake.

Paul also defended President Trump's attendance at the controversial Helsinki Summit last year, maintaining that dialogue and diplomacy with Russia can help combat Islamic terrorism and potentially end the war in Syria.

“Russia doesn't need to be considered our friend. But we certainly have overlapping interests — Syria, Islamic terrorism and energy — that require us to have an open dialogue and relationship,"" Paul wrote in a recent op-ed for Politico.

While Paul hopes the United States will continue to engage in diplomacy with the Kremlin, he comes from a position of strength when criticizing Russia as well, authoring an op-ed in 2014 that slammed Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a “gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community.""

In this regard, Paul shows the world that peace can be obtained without sacrificing or diminishing the democratic values America holds dear.

“Politicizing international affairs is a dangerous game, but that hasn't stopped far too many in Washington, who seem to have forgotten that a vital part of keeping America safe and secure is avoiding war through strong and consistent diplomacy, from playing politics,"" Paul said.

In calling for an end to the foreign wars the United States seemingly finds itself ever-immersed in, Paul embodies the “real patriot"" George Washington referred to in his farewell address, steering President Trump's foreign policy toward a cautious neutrality with other nations while distancing American troops and resources from endless conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-rand-paul-diplomacy-ideas,2019-02-11
"Commentary: Hey, suburban women, you're being played","This week in the cesspool of utter madness that is swallowing up a once great nation...

A former partner of Hunter Biden has confirmed that the drug addict was inserted into high places within Chinese and Ukrainian business circles in order to trade access to then-Vice President Joe Biden for cash. You may remember China as the country that poisoned the entire world with the coronavirus earlier this year and Ukraine as the nation used as a foil to impeach Donald Trump. But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

Speaking of the coronavirus, a Danish newspaper has reported that three of the largest scientific journals in the world have refused to publish for the purpose of peer review (aka scrutiny) the first major scientific study investigating the efficacy of masks as a deterrent for viral spread. Damn, Fauci would be proud. That's some quality memory holing right there. Maybe the mask study will find Sweden down at the bottom of the upside down. But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

In other memory hole news, Twitter blocked the accounts of Trump coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas, the New York Post, the press secretary for the president of the United States, the Babylon Bee, and the Senate Judiciary Committee for crimes against humanity such as free speech, funny jokes about ducks, accurate medical expertise, actual journalism, and uncovering government corruption. But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

You know whose Twitter account hasn't been blocked? Jeffrey Toobin. One of CNN's most celebrated progressive propagandists, he was caught masturbating while on a Zoom call with his colleagues. Not only was he not fired, but multiple newspapers wrote editorials defending his actions as commonplace and that Toobin was being unfairly maligned due to prudishness and spite. And this is all after Toobin was previously, ahem, exposed for bullying a colleague's daughter whom he impregnated into getting an abortion, then refusing to pay child support. #metoo used to be an actual thing, right? Darn memory hole again. But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

What's that you say about harassing women? The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee are boycotting a vote to approve a Catholic mother of seven who graduated top of her class as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court because, well, she's a Catholic mother of seven. Didn't Amy Coney Barrett get the memo about how God, babies and two genders are everything this nation was founded to destroy? But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

Destroying education is also fun. Just ask the Karens in some of the nation's largest school districts who are insisting that no one return to in-person class until August of 2021. None of the science or data supports that, so obviously the teacher's unions are full speed ahead. Like in California, where they want to ""dispel the myth that male and female sex organs are different."" Sounds totally normal. But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

And lastly, the Avengers actors were given untold Thanos snaps this week after even the most leftist among them proved unworthy of the woke mob's lust for hatred. When Chris Pratt declined to join his fellow cast members at an event to endorse Biden, he started taking abuse on social media. Then, to their great credit, the Biden-supporting cast members rallied around Pratt and endorsed him as a nice guy who was afforded all the same rights they were. Which, I'm sure you can guess, pissed off the woke mob even more than they originally were with Pratt, including the vile trashing of Zoe Saldana, a black women. But sure, suburban women, Trump is your problem.

Oh, and don't forget Biden wants 8-year-olds to transgender themselves.

Suburban women have a clear choice, and it's not really Trump versus Biden. Because while Trump isn't your problem, it's also fair to say he might not really be your solution in many ways, either. But — and this is a very big but — he just isn't ""them.""

Them? A reality-hating tribe that is clearly willing to throw out, burn, loot, and destroy whatever you think a woman is. None of it fundamentally matters to them. It is dark, decadent power they worship at an altar where femininity not only isn't valued, it is designated for the pagan memory hole along with everything else that is good, true, and beautiful.

Laws don't matter. Science doesn't matter. Life doesn't matter. God doesn't matter. Decency doesn't matter. And Biden was necromanced into the role of Democrat candidate for president because he would unquestioningly serve such chaos.

So who, suburban women, are you voting for again?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-suburban-women-being-played,2020-10-23
Commentary: Turns out 'never-Trumper' Lt. Col. Vindman's problem with elected governance is what set impeachment in motion,"Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who likely set impeachment in motion, recently declared himself a ""never-Trumper"" in an interview with NBC News — though he claims it's a newfound faith, and with some irony is blasting the White House for a leak.

Readers of ""Abuse of Power: Inside The Three-Year Campaign to Impeach Donald Trump"" will find the Army officer and National Security Council official was almost certainly the source to the anonymous whistleblower (named in the book). Further, the book details how Vindman also had trouble with the notion that a duly elected president sets foreign policy.

""I think it is appropriate to question his role. You don't question his service. We thank him for his service to the nation and his service in uniform,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said in an interview for the book released last month. ""But it is appropriate to question his testimony and his participation in this. We have finished this entire thing, and no one knows yet who is the whistleblower.""

Indeed, during his House Intelligence Committee testimony, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) asked, ""Lt. Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25 phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25 or the 26, and if so, with whom?""

Vindman answered: ""I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call.""

Nunes asked the obvious follow-up question, and Vindman responded, ""Department of State, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, who is responsible for the portfolio of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and an individual in the intelligence community.""

Nunes, the committee's ranking Republican, asked for the intelligence agency before committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) cut him off. ""I want to make sure there is no effort to out the whistleblower,"" Schiff said.

The oddity was that Schiff and Vindman professed they did not know who the whistleblower was. Yet, Schiff feared Vindman would reveal the identity of someone the lieutenant colonel didn't know.

""When you watched the testimony in the House, it was interesting to see how Adam Schiff tried to block Alexander Vindman from answering questions,"" Blackburn said to me. ""He admitted that he had talked to people outside of the White House. And, then Schiff would not allow him to answer who those individuals were.""

Based on Vindman's testimony, it was fairly clear the whistleblower either got the information from Vindman or someone who talked to Vindman about the July 25, 2019, call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Odd twist

So it's an odd twist that during his NBC News interview, Vindman accused the White House of leaking information to congressional Republicans about the Ukrainian government offering him a job as the country's defense minister.

During the same interview aired Monday, Vindman said of the Trump-Zelensky conversation, ""I suspected, as soon as I heard the call, that if this became public that the president would be impeached."" What a coincidence that it became public after Vindman talked to someone in the intelligence community who happens to be as anonymous as the whistleblower.

Vindman added to NBC, ""It seemed wrong, it seemed corrupt, and frankly I suspect that it could have been criminal."" Even this was a departure from his House testimony, where he declined to say the call constituted bribery. This came as Democrats tried to use bribery in rhetoric before realizing they had too weak a case when it wasn't clear if Trump was supposedly bribing Zelensky or Zelensky was supposedly bribing Trump.

Before Vindman's public testimony where he nearly admitted to informing the whistleblower, it was Vindman's secret testimony in the SCIF that Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican and certainly no Trump loyalist, said ""crystalized"" the impeachment debate for him.

""I couldn't look away"" from the Vindman SCIF testimony, Massie recalled in an interview for ""Abuse of Power.""

""Lt. Col. Vindman could never allow the elected government to get in the way of his policy goals,"" Massie recalled. ""He was agitated that the president didn't follow his talking points.""

Vindman told the three House committees behind closed doors he began to get uncomfortable when Trump veered from talking points.

""I started to get, I guess — this was not in the preparational material that I had offered,"" Vindman said.

Vindman went on to say, according to the transcript of the SCIF testimony, ""he's the president of the United States, he can sets [sic] the policy — but I kind of saw increasing risk as we moved on.""

Massie said he heard Vindman say, ""kind of sets the policy,"" not ""can sets the policy."" That makes a big difference to a constitutionalist like Massie, who added, ""I was certain I heard 'kind of.' They could have screwed it up. I'm not certain they didn't change it deliberately."" Either way, Massie's memory would be grammatically correct.

Vindman's transparent focus on talking points were ultimately telling of what only the third presidential impeachment in American history really boiled down to — a policy disagreement.

""This is why the whole thing is a policy difference. He was upset with the president, that the president had twice chosen to not follow his talking points,"" Blackburn said of Vindman. ""This is something that upset him. And the commander-in-chief has the ability to set foreign policy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-vindman-set-impeachment-in-motion,2020-09-18
"Deace: Crystal Ball 2022 — Top 10 predictions of what will, and won't, happen in the new year","It’s time to renew my annual tradition.

I like to start off each New Year putting my anemic forecasting skills and substandard intellect to the test, by analyzing current cultural trends and then issuing my top 10 predictions for the next 12 months. These won’t just include the world of politics, but pop culture, sports, and more. If it turns out I get any of these right, a year from now I shall take full credit. But if I’m proven unworthy once more, rest assured I shall disavow all knowledge of this exercise. If you’d like, feel free to go back and see how last year’s predictions did by clicking here.

And with that, let us begin:

10. An unsettling year in foreign policy.

Russia takes over Ukraine and China topples Taiwan, with each choosing to strike in response to the weakness projected by the Biden presidency. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Bennett doesn’t last long in Israel, toppled by a populace tired of COVID tyranny. Speaking of which, anti-mandate protests in places like Germany, Austria, Australia, and New Zealand will turn violent, as governments there continue to both ignore and trample on the rights of the people.

9. The Green Bay Packers win Super Bowl 56.

This was my preseason pick, and I’m sticking with it. Green Bay has been the most consistent team all season long. Plus, wouldn’t it be downright serendipitous for Aaron Rodgers to be rewarded for pimping ""Atlas Shrugged"" and trolling woke scolds with his second Lombardi Trophy?

8. For the second straight year, a Spider-Man movie will be the top-grossing film at the box office.

This time it will be ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"" the much-anticipated sequel to its 2018 Oscar-winning predecessor — which some (myself included) believe to be the best animated film ever made.

7. ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" will surpass even ""The Mandalorian"" and inspire Disney to make a surprising feature film announcement.

Disney will release ""Obi-Wan Kenobi on Star Wars Day, May 4, and the series will be so celebrated and beloved that by the end of the year Disney will make a follow up surprise announcement about the next feature film in the Star Wars universe — a movie based on Darth Vader’s exploits and exploration of the Dark Side of the Force set during the same time period.

6. Omicron destroys the Covidstan narrative.

The strain will show the coronavirus is finally attenuating, and it spreads so much throughout the country that herd immunity is finally achieved. By summer, several European countries will return to close to normal, and that debate will be raging here as well. Which leads to my next prediction ...

5. There will be open dissension within the Democratic Party about whether to smartly choose the Omicron off-ramp.

Every Branch Covidian cultist is a Democrat, but not every Democrat is a Branch Covidian cultist. The Democratic governors of Colorado, Kansas, and Connecticut have already sent some signals that they’re ready to sell their Covidstan stock now before it shorts out. And in an election year, they won’t be alone as a growing chorus of Democrats up for re-election realize they are doomed in November if they can’t return the country to some form of normalcy in time to boost the economy and overall mood. However, in the end, the gravitational pull of their Branch Covidian/Twitter/Woke/Cable News base will prove to be too strong, and systemically Democrats are incapable of choosing sanity. Which leads to my next prediction ...

4. Republicans surpass the net gain of House seats won in the Contract With America election of 1994.

That was the biggest mid-term election for the Republican Party since the historic landslide of 1894. The Contract With America led to a 54-seat gain for Republicans in 1994, and Republicans will eclipse that in November with the American people tired of COVID, malaise, divisive messaging, economic downturn, and a feeble president.

3. Cracks in Trump’s base continue to emerge because of the jab.

As jab mandates grow increasingly unpopular, and the jab itself becomes increasingly ineffective, Donald Trump’s ego and loyalty to his base will clash consistently for the first time since his political ascension. Several high-profile Trump loyalists will publicly break with the former president on what he considers to be his crowning achievement (Operation Warp Speed), and at least one Trump rally will be disrupted by discontentment with the jab. At the same time, Trump doubles-down on the belief he’s the Winston Churchill of COVID who saved Western Civilization from the virus. Which leads to my next prediction ...

2. Republicans also emerge with a narrow Senate majority, which causes Trump to badger Mitch McConnell into announcing his retirement.

After months of sniping with his base over the jab, Trump decides to change the subject and attempts to reunite his base by going beyond rhetoric to all-in on an effort to topple McConnell — whom Trump's base rightfully loathes — as Republican Senate leader for life. The move works, and McConnell announces his retirement from the Senate. However, the long-overdue lancing of the Ditch boil comes at a hefty price. Trump agrees to elevate his surprising ally in this fight, the one and only Lindsey Graham, to become McConnell’s replacement. Because it can always get worse.

1. DeSantis dominates

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posts a double-digit victory in his re-election campaign, and by the end of the year polls show he is the most net-favorable Republican politician in the country. Which only increases the intrigue and odds he will indeed challenge Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-crystal-ball-2022-top-10-predictions-of-what-will-and-wont-happen-in-the-new-year,2022-01-10
Deace: Crystal ball 2023,"10) One active member of Congress will come out as trans. We've got openly homosexual members of Congress. We've got a bisexual senator, and she might be one of the best public servants in D.C. if we're being honest (although that's a low bar). We've got a congresswoman who probably married her brother. And we even had a polyamorous ""throuple"" congresswoman recently, too. So what trail remains to be blazed along the rainbow road? Why, only the unholy grail of tranny madness itself, of course! To paraphrase the great prophets AC/DC, on the highway to hell there are neither stop signs nor any speed limits.

9) ""Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse"" will be the top-grossing film at the box office. I'm making this prediction for the second year in a row, because this film was supposed to come out last year but got delayed to 2023. Its predecessor might very well be the greatest animated film ever made.



8) The Buffalo Bills beat the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl. I'm picking this one mainly for existential reasons, for these are the only two franchises in NFL history to go 0-4 in Super Bowls. So why not pit them against one another in a ""somebody has to win"" scenario of cosmic proportions?

7) Putin doesn't survive the year. While I wouldn't advise getting your information on this war from our ""muh Ukraine"" media, you don't have to fawn over Zelenskyyyyyyyyyyyy in his green shirt to realize there's simply no way Vladimir Putin thought this war would stretch into a second calendar year. Putin is already 70, and it takes consistent projection of strength to reign over a thugocracy ruled by oligarchs and crime lords. If he can't put Davos/Soros/Zelenskyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to bed soon, Putin may be the one waking up with the horse's head in his bed.

6) China reaches the fork in the road: Either the current regime invades Taiwan, or a younger, more Gorbachev-like faction will rise to power. COVID destabilized not only the West, but its origin country, China, as well. The last couple of years we've seen Chinese citizens jump from high-rise buildings to avoid starving to death during zero-COVID lockdowns and national protests of the regime's draconian policies. Speaking of the regime, it has its own internal turmoil, too. This will be the year all these prevailing winds come to a head; it's just a matter of which direction they go. Either the existing regime doubles down and attempts to finally spread its hegemony to longtime nemesis Taiwan, or we will see a new, more open generation of Chinese leadership, similar to what Gorbachev represented during the final ""perestroika"" phase of the old Soviet Union. Granted, even the current cutthroat Chicom regime permits a more open society than the pre-Gorbachev USSR did, but you get the analogy.

5) Riots will be planned in Florida to try to disrupt Ron DeSantis' second term as Florida governor and his looming presidential run. The Spirit of the Age cannot afford to let DeSantis' second term build on the success of his first, let alone the potential that he could export what he's done in Florida to the entire country as president. Since it can't beat him at the ballot box, or in the arena of ideas, look for the Spirit of the Age to stage some ""mostly peaceful protests"" in the urban streets of the Sunshine State to try to destabilize his administration and prospects.

4) The Florida grand jury will, at a minimum, recommend fraud charges against Pfizer and Moderna. If there was a case to be made against all the mounting data about the dangers of the jab and failure of Operation Warp Speed, you would see our Wormtongue media conjure it by now. Except there isn't, which is why hashtags like #DiedSuddenly have to be censored and memory-holed. Well, that seal is about to be broken by the Florida grand jury convened by the state supreme court at the request of Governor DeSantis. I don't foresee any way, if they're serious about looking at what's out there, that jurors come back with anything less than fraud charges. Of course, I'm in favor of even more punitive charges and penalties, which is why next month I'm coming out with this.

3) Trump will become the clear underdog in the GOP presidential primary.The 2024 GOP primary polling has already been trending toward DeSantis since his Reagan 1984-like landslide in the 2022 midterms, to the point that DeSantis has already gone from upstart to, at a minimum, the clear number two in the race behind former President Trump. I'm not the first person to compare the Trump-DeSantis dynamic to the biblical tale of King Saul and David, and this year we will see a similar transition of public perception and power.

2) Major names will leak from Epstein's black book. I don't know how this will happen, but 12 months ago no one knew that Elon Musk was gonna buy Twitter and then immediately begin to empty its chamber of secrets, either. Truth, like life, eventually finds a way. The Creator is truth incarnate, and even in its fallen state, His creation ultimately tilts in that direction. Ghislaine Maxwell was originally sentenced to life in prison for sex trafficking to no one, apparently, but in 2023 we will learn at least some of the someones.



1) The ""Nefarious"" movie will FINALLY come out and will turn a profit. It's been seven years since we sold the movie rights to my 2016 book, ""A Nefarious Plot,"" about a demonic takeover of America. Finally, though, the wait is just about over. At long last we're going to show you this movie in 2023, and you are about to see the high lord of hell in all his demonic glory. I couldn't be prouder of how it turned out, and I hope you agree and the movie makes a profit — since my company paid for its production!",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-crystal-ball-2023,2023-01-06
Deace: Tim Scott would make a better snitch than senator,"

I got some attention this week for kneecapping South Carolina Senator Tim Scott in my response after he sheepishly – and I’m being kind there – responded to the raid of former President Donald Trump’s home with a plea for letting the system do its work before jumping to conclusions.

Oh, you mean the system that brought us locking you down while they went on vacation. That made you wear masks when they didn't. That shut down your churches but kept the rainbow orgies going. That jabbed you with side effects and canceled you on social media for complaining about it. That take private planes while making your gas unaffordable. That is actively attempting to erase our own southern border while obsessing about Ukraine’s. That anointed Russian collusion as a certainty but couldn’t be bothered to know what a Hunter Biden is. That assassinated Brett Kavanaugh’s character while letting Merrick Garland go wild labeling concerned parents as domestic terrorists. That U.S. citizens who protested their government on January 6 are now rotting in prison without due process while groomers run wild in our government schools.

You want me to put my faith in THAT system, Sen. Scott?

Because I’ve got other plans, and quite frankly, they aren’t negotiable with the likes of appeasers like you. For example, if the GOP wins Congress in November, it should do nothing less than shut down the entire federal government until the persecutions and banana republic nonsense I laid out above stops. Because if Senator Scott's flaccid fraternity continues to fund this fascist monster after all this, we all might as well move to Ukraine.

Here is the fundamental question on the table for the Republican Party: Do you finally hate what Democrats are determined to do to the country more than you hate your own base?

Still need help working through that pickle? Well, as always, I’m here to help.

Consider for a second that when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stepped up to keep sexual deviance out of the curriculum of elementary school students, it was labeled by the Democrats/groomers as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill and they subsequently began shouting the word ""gay"" like feral children throughout the halls of their statehouse.

Yet now, when monkeypox is running amok within the gay community, the very same people who shouted ""gay, gay, gay"" are suddenly a tramp stamp of those three ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" monkeys. How dare you say gay and monkeypox in the same sentence, and who cares if the CDC is doing it even though we loved its COVID propaganda?

Can you see it now, Senator Scott? The lie is the point. The undoing of reality is the goal. There is no system to trust.



We are meant as citizens to simply accept that the power belongs to somebody else, and the longer we complain about that, the more painful the hurt will be. That why Donald Trump is about to be frog-marched. Not because the system is working, but because the system has been utterly destroyed.

At this point, Senator Scott, I'd have more respect for your limp-wristed pleas to ""let this play out"" if you were actually in on the plot. Because you'd make a far better snitch than senator, if this is what you really think.

Repeat after me, Senator Scott: Hail Hydra.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-tim-scott-better-snitch-than-senator,2022-08-11
Don't these false or misleading reports lack 'authoritative reporting'? Where's Twitter's ban-hammer?,"On Wednesday, the New York Post published an explosive report on emails the Post claims were obtained from a computer belonging to Hunter Biden. The emails appear to provide more details on Hunter Biden's ties to Ukrainian energy company Burisma and contradict claims from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden that he never discussed his son's foreign business dealings.

Critical questions have been raised about the Bidens' ties to Ukraine and whether the Democratic candidate previously used his position as vice president to benefit his son financially.

The New York Post story quickly became controversial with many journalists disputing the details of the story and questioning the Post's sources. But outrage was triggered when social media platforms stepped in to prevent users from reading the story and drawing their own conclusions about the Post's reporting.



Facebook acted first, questioning the veracity of the Post's report and announcing that distribution of the story on its platform would be limited until an independent fact-checker finished reviewing the Post's work. Twitter acted next, initially giving some users a warning label stating ""headlines don't tell the full story.""

Then Twitter went further. Engaging in what the New York Post called ""extraordinary censorship measures,"" Twitter banned users from tweeting the story, from retweeting it, and even from sharing it in direct messages. The New York Post's Twitter account was locked and subsequently other prominent Twitter accounts that shared the story were locked as well, including the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Twitter also banned a follow-up report from the Post on emails relating to ""lucrative"" deals with China.

The explanations offered by Facebook and Twitter for their censorship claim that the platforms' policies are intended to prevent the spread of misleading or inaccurate information. Twitter in particular made the determination that the Post is not a source of ""authoritative reporting.""



""Given the lack of authoritative reporting on the origins of the materials included in the article, we're taking action to limit the spread of this information,"" a Twitter spokesperson told the Washington Examiner Wednesday.

In a statement published by Twitter, the company changed its story and said the ban was put in place because ""images contained in the articles include personal and private information — like email addresses and phone numbers — which violate our rules."" The images of emails published by the post contain unredacted email addresses. Additionally, Twitter views the emails reported by the post as ""violations of our Hacked Materials Policy.""

""Commentary on or discussion about hacked materials, such as articles that cover them but do not include or link to the materials themselves, aren't a violation of this policy,"" Twitter said. ""Our policy only covers links to or images of hacked material themselves."" The company explained that this policy, created in 2018, ""prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization.""

This public statement made no reference to Twitter's original rationale for suppressing the New York Post story: That it lacked ""authoritative reporting.""

How does Twitter determine what constitutes ""authoritative reporting?"" The standard clearly isn't suppressing misleading or inaccurate information. If that were the case, why were the following stories were never censored by Twitter?

A February 2017 story from the New York Times alleging that the Trump campaign had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence was riddled with ""misleading and inaccurate"" information, FBI notes revealed. The story was based on unsubstantiated claims from anonymous sources and was never updated to reflect how it became discredited.

CNN claimed in June 2017 that then-FBI Director James Comey would, in congressional testimony under oath, dispute a claim made by President Trump that the FBI director had assured the president he wasn't under investigation. Comey did not dispute the president in his testimony and CNN was forced to issue a correction to its story.

The New York Daily News in 2018 published a report claiming the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter was ""trained by the NRA."" In reality, the National Rifle Association had absolutely nothing to do with the shooting.

After the Parkland shooting, CNN misleadingly claimed in a graphic posted on Twitter that 22 ""school shootings"" had already occurred that year. The inaccurate number was inflated by including accidental discharges of firearms on school campuses, gang violence, domestic violence, and university shootings and incidents that did not even include pupils.

Remember the massive Cambridge Analytica scandal covered in-depth in by CNN and others in 2018? The UK investigation into digital marketing firm found that allegations of colluding with Russia to influence the results of the Brexit referendum and break U.S. campaign laws were unfounded.

The New York Post's Sohrab Ahmari highlights how the Mueller Report's release in April 2019 debunked several media narratives that were shared on social media without censorship, including reports that Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort met with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London; that Jeff Sessions lied when he said he didn't meet the Russian ambassador as a Trump surrogate; that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Kremlin officials; that Trump ordered Cohen to lie to Congress; and, of course, the salacious and allegations from the Steele Dossier. All inaccurate or false stories.

In 2019, CNN, the Washington Post, and other outlets pushed a false narrative that high school student Nicholas Sandmann had provoked an encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips in Washington, D.C., near the Lincoln Memorial. The media claimed that Sandmann and others taunted Phillips, claims which viral video showed were false. The Post and CNN went on to settle million-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by Sandmann.

In September 2019, the New York Times published a smear of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The Times wrote about a previously unreported sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh from his undergraduate days at Yale, but failed to mention that the supposed victim did not recall the alleged incident.

In January this year, MSNBC host Al Sharpton repeated claims from a discredited study suggesting that there was an increase in hate crimes in counties that held Trump rallies.

In April 2020, Politico issued a lengthy correction and apology for falsely claiming that President Trump owed ""tens of millions"" to the Bank of China. Tweets propagating the original false story remain undeleted.

In September 2020, The Atlantic published claims from four anonymous sources that President Trump referred to a cemetery for fallen WWI soldiers as ""filled with losers."" Over 20 witnesses went on-the-record to dispute the Atlantic's account.

From these examples, which can still be shared on Twitter's platform, it's clear that ""authoritative reporting"" does not mean accurate or well-sourced material.

It's code for ""stories the censors at Twitter agree with."" An unfavorable report about Joe Biden doesn't qualify.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/dont-these-false-or-misleading-reports-lack-authoritative-reporting-wheres-twitters-ban-hammer,2020-10-15
Eric Metaxas: Character still counts. 'Trump. Now more than ever',"As a Christian, what do you see as the main argument for Donald Trump in 2020?

That he's not Joe Biden, or Kamala Harris (or whoever she picks for veep when the ref waves his arms signaling it's all over for Joe, which seems imminent). Any Americans who can fathom what will befall this country — and the world — if these principle-free career politicians are elected at this historic moment of crisis could not dream of voting for them. But because mainstream journalists have become proud traitors to their profession — and country — many voters are unaware of what's at stake.

But to answer your question more accurately, Christians believe we should be less concerned about ourselves than about others. We are never merely to think of our self-interest and “Christian issues,"" but rather to vote for the good of the entire country, and for the future of liberty around the world. So even when we speak of the egregious attacks on religious liberty by the Democrats, we are inevitably thinking of the larger issues of liberty for all Americans. Nonetheless, we might touch on the oft-cited issue of “character,"" which is of course important to all people of faith, and to Americans in general.

Which brings us to the baffling fact that despite claiming to be a “practicing Catholic,"" Joe Biden promises to do all he can to expand abortion into the ninth month of pregnancy. We should also remember that it was he who pushed President Obama to legalize same-sex marriage, long before this monumental redefinition of a millennia-old institution was accepted by the majority of Americans. Even more dramatically, Biden would force teaching unscientific transgender ideology to our youngest children, even advocating for 8-year-olds to have gender reassignment surgery if they choose — against their own parents' wishes. For anyone posing as a Catholic, this is an astonishing level of hypocrisy and indicates less someone of “character"" than someone of unbridled — and frightening — political ambition.

Christians are commanded to care about the poor, so a robust economy and opportunity are inescapably vital issues. And Biden's demonstrated weakness in standing up to the aggressive cancel-culture socialists and Marxists in his party — to the point of selecting the most radically leftist of all 100 senators as his running mate — will promptly soccer-kick our economy toward Venezuela. This will further devastate the poorest urban communities that his party has claimed — and failed — to represent for five decades, and whose jobs have often gone to the illegal immigrants his party has welcomed with open arms. Nor has Biden done more than give cranky lip-service to law enforcement, despite violent mobs regularly destroying American cities, and harming the very black lives he claims to care about.

A lot of evangelicals cite Trump's tone as a barrier to voting for him. How do you respond?

This is what we call ""straining at a gnat to swallow a camel."" In other words it is either sheer pietistic lunacy, or it is self-deluding moral contortionism masquerading as a concern for civility. For context, it's worth recalling the “tone"" — and “character"" — of some much-praised Democratic presidents. LBJ was likely the most foul-mouthed, bullying, and unapologetic hayseed racist ever to occupy the highest office in the land; while his dashing patrician predecessor JFK routinely brought prostitutes into the White House, despite himself also posing as a “Catholic."" FDR had a mistress throughout his presidency and with the press' help hid his inability to walk across a room for four terms. Obama only hid his cigarette addiction from voters, but repeatedly and brazenly lied that anyone who wished to keep their health insurance policies could do so, historically increasing government control over our lives. If smooth-talking deception is acceptable, perhaps the straight-talking and sometimes “harsh"" Trump is not what we are looking for.

On this subject, we may recall that when running for president in 1988, Biden proudly reeled off a flurry of dramatic whoppers about his academic record, and when caught in these lies was forced to drop out. Which gets us back to the issue of “character."" Biden's prolific and serial plagiarism in political speeches is so broadly established that it's never mentioned anymore, nor is it worth mentioning that he committed adultery with his current wife while she was married to another man. But it is worth mentioning the single most consequential and horrifying of Biden's character issues, that he has used his power as a U.S. Senator — since the Nixon administration — and then as VP to funnel millions of dollars in phony “jobs"" and “business contracts"" to his closest unqualified relatives, some percentage of whose profits appear to have magically snaked their way back to him without leaving any plausibly undeniable trail.

Even worse, he committed these sins with Russia, Ukraine, and China, who is unquestionably our most powerful political adversary, and whose atheist communist dictatorship evilly persecutes anyone of faith, including murdering many Muslim “political prisoners"" for their organs, which they then sell at a huge profit to wealthy Saudis. (Ailing Saudi oil sheiks don't wish to use the organs of dirty non-Muslims, and are willing to pay top dollar for the hearts and lungs of young and healthy Uighyur Muslims.) China also generally oppresses it's 1.4 billion subjects with state-of-the-art technology sold to them — or simply stolen from us — under Biden's “watch"".

But let's suppose against the dizzying evidence that all of this is merely “Russian disinformation,"" as if the Russians preferred Trump to Biden, which is inevitably a comedic proposition. Nonetheless, most people of faith would still greatly prefer a sometimes “harsh-toned"" ace pilot in the cockpit to a below-average but polite one. The stakes for us all are simply too high.

Some have cited Trump's immigration policies to claim he's not truly pro-life. How do you respond?

I assume such claims are a combination of sophistry and ignorance, and so first of all I guffaw out loud, which is hard to do in a written medium — but some ideas are simply that funny. To those whose best argument is that this president is “racist,"" we must say that by ending the startling lunacy of “open-borders,"" Trump is doing the right thing for people on both sides of the border. The ugly facts are that the sadistic and criminal “coyotes"" (N.B. not literal animals) make extraordinary profits by smuggling into our country vulnerable women, whom they usually rape, and children, whom they sometimes also rape and who, once in the U.S., they pretend are their own children, often selling both the women and children into sex trafficking. Democrats willingly ignore this concatenation of evils because it suits them politically, knowing most illegal immigrants — when given the chance — will vote for them. This self-serving cynicism is even uglier than the criminal horrors they ignore. Reading the situation correctly and taking action on it has certainly cost Trump politically, as real courage often does.

What issues has Trump championed that should make evangelicals want to choose him in 2020?

This too, is an issue principally of character. Trump in the last election claimed he would appoint “pro-life"" justices to the Supreme Court — which no Republican had ever dared to say. Many sneered at this, saying that he would say anything to get elected and would never follow through on any such promises. But he did follow through, and beyond the wildest expectations of any pro-life voters, installing three pro-life justices in four years. He also spoke in person at the March for Life, something no president had the courage to do. So his stance on life is only one reason, it is deeply compelling and dispositive, just as standing against Slavery was in our last election of such unprecedented consequence. And of course some believe that standing against the murder of the unborn is itself alone an issue of “character,"" whether one claims to be a Catholic or not.

Doing what one promises is also a character issue. Many presidents emptily claimed they would put the U.S. Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem, and shamefully did not. Trump did, despite the “nattering nabobs of negativism"" who insisted it would bring about war in the Middle East. In fact, precisely the opposite that has happened. Trump has so dramatically increased peace between Israel and her neighbors that he has earned four Nobel Peace Prize nominations.

He has also creatively and courageously stood up to China, North Korea, and Iran, in the process dramatically reversing the craven and failed policies of the Obama/Biden administration, and putting these rogue nations on notice that America is not to be trifled with. These successes have utterly unhinged the ineffective bureaucrats in the State Department, who prefer presidents to rubber-stamp the antique and flatulent policies they recommend decade after decade.

At America's best moments, those suffering in totalitarian countries have gotten profound encouragement from our bold stand for freedom, and because of Trump's stance they do now. Those suffering in the Soviet gulag similarly drew inspiration when Reagan — also defying the fruitless advice of the Deep Statists — declared “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" Such contrarian and often heroic wisdom is called “leadership"", and in this hour we need it especially desperately. Putting it another way, we may recycle a political slogan from the year Joe Biden first won election to the Senate: “Trump. Now more than ever.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/eric-metaxas-trump-now-more-than-ever,2020-10-30
Horowitz: Are the Ukraine biolabs connected to the coronavirus gain-of-function research?,"This is not about your feelings toward Putin or Ukraine. It’s about the ethics, morality, and trust of our own government. Last Tuesday, undersecretary of state for political affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ""Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.""

Now the World Health Organization is calling on Ukrainian officials to “destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,” due the ongoing risk of explosions during the war.

Given that millions of Americans have been killed or injured long-term by a virus that was likely created by gain-of-function research in a similar lab in Wuhan, isn’t it important that we have a full accounting of how many other gain-of-function labs our government holds, in which countries, and what exactly they are doing with them? This is not about justifying Putin’s invasion as somehow the savior of humanity against biowarfare. It’s about understanding the origin of the virus that clearly was not natural and destroyed our lives and how to ensure this won’t happen again.

It’s now clear that, at a minimum, the U.S. was heavily involved in developing and managing these biolabs in Ukraine. NewsPunch has recovered about a dozen documents deleted by the U.S. embassy in Kiev detailing the U.S. funding of multiple biolabs throughout the country.

A deleted web article from BioPrepWatch.com on June 18, 2010, which was recovered by National Pulse, titled, “Biolab Opens in Ukraine” explains how Obama, while serving as an Illinois senator, along with Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, helped negotiate a deal to build a level-3 bio-safety lab in Odessa, Ukraine, in 2005. The article was included in Issue No. 818 of the U.S. Air Force Counterproliferation Center’s Outreach Journal.

What was being done there? A 2011report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences’ Committee on Anticipating Biosecurity Challenges of the Global Expansion of High-Containment Biological Laboratories explained it was a project between the United States Department of Defense and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine focused on “preventing the spread of technologies, pathogens, and knowledge that can be used in the development of biological weapons.” It had a permit, according to the report, “to work with both bacteria and viruses of the first and second pathogenic groups.”

A separate document detailing Ukraine’s biolab network from the BioWeapons Prevention Project explains they were studying Ebola and “viruses of pathogencity group II by using of virology, molecular, serologica and express methods.” Additionally, the lab provided “special training for specialists on biosafety and biosecurity issues during handling of dangerous biological pathogenic agents.”

So, who runs these labs? Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, a Bulgarian journalist, identified biotech company Metabiota Inc., which is heavily supported by Google, in an extremely detailed article back in 2019 as the main player in the Ukrainian labs. It’s a company that tracks the trajectory of outbreaks and sells pandemic insurance, but also seems to have its hand in the actual labs that, as we painfully learned the past two years, might be the source of some of these outbreaks.

The US Company Metabiota Inc. has been awarded $18.4 million federal contracts under the Pentagon’s DTRA program in Georgia and Ukraine for scientific and technical consulting services. Metabiota services include global field-based biological threat research, pathogen discovery, outbreak response and clinical trials. Metabiota Inc. had been contracted by the Pentagon to perform work for DTRA before and during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and was awarded $3.1 million (2012-2015) for work in Sierra Leone – one of the countries at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.

Indeed, in August 2018, Metabiota, which was created in 2008, announced it had been awarded a subcontract from Black & Veatch (B&V) to support the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) in Iraq. Black and Veatch is the Kansas City-based engineering firm that is listed as the contractor on one of the DOD-funded veterinarian biolabs tasked with working on “pathogens,” among the documents recovered by NewsPunch from the U.S. embassy in Kiev.

How does this all come back to our concern of COVID 2.0 and another lab leak? Last year, the San Francisco-based Metabiota predicted a 47%-57% chance that there will be another pandemic that will kill even more people than COVID. What do they know that we don’t?

A 2016 investigation by CBS found that World Health Organization officials believe Metabiota screwed up the Ebola response in Africa and that there was ""absolutely no control on what is being done."" U.S. health official Austin Demby, who was dispatched to the Metabiota shared lab in Sierra Leone by the CDC, reported that ""the cross contamination potential is huge and quite frankly unacceptable,"" after allegedly witnessing used needles littering the floor, the lack of an ultraviolet light for decontamination, and not enough space to process blood samples safely. CBS also quotes a representative of Doctors Without Borders who claims she saw cross-contamination and lack of proper hygiene and protective gear as workers moved from the lab to houses.

Do you still feel comfortable with a company like this involved with DOD-made biolabs in Ukraine? Well, what if I told you their leadership was tied into the central players in the Wuhan coronavirus gain-of-function research and funded by ... Hunter Biden?!

The CEO of Metabiota is Dr. Nathan Wolfe, a virologist who has been a member of the official journal of EcoHealth Alliance, the company at the center of the gain-of-function research on coronavirus spike protein binding from day one. According to his LinkedIn profile, Wolfe “has been honored with a Fulbright fellowship, the NIH Director’s Pioneer Award, [and] a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.” Like a quote from a horror film, Wolfe explained his enterprise in an interview with the Edge in 2009 as follows:

If you want to think about my work, one way to think of me is as a curator of microbial collections. I have these massive repositories. I have sites all around the world that are aimed at collecting interesting microorganisms, and then I enter into collaborations with different groups. Instead of coming to look at my beetle collections, I send them specimens that I think they are likely to find of interest, and they study them for novel agents. Really it's sort of a microbial museum. As a consequence, I have a very low footprint in the USA. I have an office not much bigger than your suite. It's not huge. Even though my enterprise is very costly to sustain, it is very easy for me to move around.

Years ago, none of us would have thought much of this. But given the suspicion that EcoHealth Alliance created SARS-CoV-2 out of a similar repository and “microbial museum,” not in the United States but as an “enterprise” around the world, we should probably be suspicious of what Metabiota is doing in Ukraine.

Then, of course, there is Hunter Biden. The National Pulse has found financial reports revealing that the investment firm of the “first son,” Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners, led Metabiota’s first round of funding, which amounted to $30 million, and that “Former Managing Director and co-founder of RSTP Neil Callahan – a name that appears many times on Hunter Biden’s hard drive – also sits on Metabiota’s Board of Advisors.” Callahan is also the co-founder of Pilot Growth Management, which is Metabiota’s current top investor.

In EcoHealth’s 2014 annual report, Metabiota is listed as a partner on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) “PREDICT” project, which seeks to “predict and prevent global emerging disease threats.” This included the infectious disease research in Wuhan together with “bat lady” Shi Zhengli.

The National Pulse also reveals that “Researchers from Metabiota have also been listed alongside EcoHealth Alliance personnel on a 2014 study on henipavirus spillover, 2014 study on Ebola monitoring, 2015 study focusing on herpes, and 2015 study on viral diversity.”

So, Peter Daszak, EcoHealth, Nathan Wolfe, Metabiota, Hunter Biden, Wuhan lab, and Ukraine all tie together in some way. And now U.S. and WHO officials are warning of clearly some very potent pathogens floating around in these U.S.-run Ukrainian facilities. What is the average American supposed to think of our government in this case?

In the past, we would have understood that our government was perhaps working on important viral research or perhaps working on bioweapons to deter our enemies. But now that we know our lives were destroyed because of a leaked virus that most likely came from a similar cast of characters in similar Chinese labs, if not some of the same players, how are we supposed to trust our government in Ukraine? This question should bother us independent of what Russia and China say and regardless of the invasion. What is our government doing in Ukraine, and likely in many other countries, and how do we know these places are not ticking time bombs like the Wuhan lab?



Ironically, our government used Ukraine to distract from the atrocities committed at home with the creation of COVID and the response to it. However, it appears that the focus on Ukraine might very well bring attention right back to the origins of the last catalyzing global event they seek to erase from our memory. They might just get exactly what they wanted – a little too much. Regardless of what happens with the war, we need to know if Ukraine is the new Wuhan.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-are-the-ukraine-biolabs-connected-to-the-coronavirus-gain-of-function-research,2022-03-14
"Horowitz: Army recruitment down 23% amid mandates, as Army tosses requirement for high school diploma","No high school diploma? Be all you can be in the military. No COVID shot after years of meritorious service? Goodbye, as we ask illegal aliens to take your place. That is the state of play in the U.S. military.



The time has come for Republican “defense hawks” to finally show some concern for the quality, morale, and mission of the military, not just throw endless money at it while the military self-immolates, expels those who don’t get Pfizer’s shot, and then complains that it can’t meet its recruiting goals. Last week, the Military Times reported, “The Army has hit 40% of its recruiting goals this year, with the struggle to fill the ranks seemingly so grim the Defense Department reduced its planned total force size because prior recruiting goals were out of reach.”

Pentagon officials announced that across the military branches, annual target recruitment goals are down 23%. To accommodate growing recruitment problems, the military is offering more financial benefits rather than emphasizing the motivation of patriotism, because clearly, in this environment, it doesn’t work. Now they are abolishing the requirement for a high school diploma or GED as a prerequisite to joining basic training for those who sign up before the end of this fiscal year. That’s how desperate they are to meet recruitment benchmarks.

Here’s a novel idea: Before we lower standards to appalling levels, how about we stop kicking out some of the most seasoned, battle-hardened soldiers for not getting the shots? Up to 40,000 National Guardsmen risk expulsion from the force if they fail to comply with the mandate by tomorrow. That is 13% of the National Guard – and as much as 30% in some states. So, our government would rather recruit those without high school diplomas than relent on a mandate for a shot.

It’s important to remember in the context of recruiting new teenagers that some of the most patriotic military families are those who did not get the shots, especially among teenagers. Those 16- to 18-year-olds who didn’t get the shots in the past year made the right choice, even based on the original risk-benefit analysis. Yet all those young boys who didn’t want to risk myocarditis cannot follow in the footsteps of their fathers or grandparents. Instead of embracing these kids from a pedigree of hundreds of years of U.S. military service, the Pentagon is looking to further reach out to illegal aliens to serve in the military.

Which brings us to the fiscal year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This is considered a must-pass bill because it’s been signed into law every year going back almost to WWII. Republicans have so much leverage to fix this problem and abolish the mandates and other policies that are destroying morale in the military and motivation to join it. Yet all they do is use their leverage to fight for more money to throw at the military rather than change the corrosive policies. After all, an authorization bill is not an appropriations bill and should be more about policy than money.

Last Thursday, every single Republican on the House Armed Services Committee voted for the NDAA, after Democrats and several RINOs voted down an amendment to block the vaccine mandates. Republicans are proud that they tossed another $37 billion into the Pentagon coffers, raising the spending for the national defense budget to an unfathomable $850.4 billion. But to what end? It contains another billion for Ukraine, ironically a country with a low vaccination rate.

Republicans think they are being pro-military and patriotic by passing the NDAA unconditionally and offering a raise to the troops, but the current and potential recruits would much rather join a military that doesn’t mandate every Pfizer product for eternity, groom them into transgenderism, teach them white people are racist, and send them to fight for every other country’s border but our own. They seem more concerned about performing abortions than about combat readiness. Perhaps focusing on those issues instead will solve the recruitment problem among the patriotic families who led our nation in recruitment based on family tradition.

According to the Pentagon’s 2020 propensity report, only 11% of teens and young adults, between 16 and 21 years old, planned on future service in the military. The top three reasons respondents gave for joining the U.S. military were: pay/money, pay for future education, and travel. Defending the country was not among them. And for good reason. Kids who come from the sort of families who would join to defend the country would not exactly be drawn to a military that gives tutorials on how to create safe spaces for pronouns. Thus, bribing people with endless monetary benefits is the only recruitment tool left to “be all that you can be.”

Republicans have the leverage to hold up both the defense appropriations bill and defense authorization bill in the Senate until the mandates are ended. Additionally, Republicans governors should assert their Title 32 control over their respective national guardsmen to prohibit any discharge on account of not getting the shots. They should also use all of the printed federal dollars that are going to fund Pfizer and other illogical COVID policies to create a state-based (non-federalized) guard as a landing place for those discharged from the military, like Gov. Ron DeSantis did in Florida.



At some point, money can’t buy you a moral, competent, and combat-ready military if we are left with a pool of recruits who perhaps need the allure of free castration surgery and hormone therapy to join. The feds can print an unlimited amount of money, but they can’t print warriors.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-army-recruitment-down,2022-06-29
"Horowitz: Black lives don’t matter to BLM, as thousands more killed by homicide since 2020","It had even more corporate and cultural support than the vaccines and Ukraine. It was the greatest juggernaut in politics that even ensnared many Republican politicians. Yet never have we seen a movement that accomplished the opposite of what it was purported to do in such a short time frame. It turns out that as a result of the BLM-induced crime wave, reversing a generation-long trend of reduced crime, there were thousands of excess black homicide victims, a body count that is still climbing.

Hannah Meyers, director of the policing and public safety initiative at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News’ Emma Colton that there were nearly 2,500 excess black murders in 2020 over the previous year and the 10-year average. Here is a breakdown of the data from Fox:

In 2019, at least 7,484 Black Americans were murdered. That number shot up to at least 9,941 murdersin 2020, meaning there was an increase of 2,457 Black Americans murdered over the previous year.



The number of Black murders was also far higher than White murders in 2020. The FBI data shows there 7,043 White people murdered that year, meaning 2,898 more Black people were killed compared to Whites.



Between 2010 and 2019, there was an average of 5,954 White murders, which is roughly 16% lower than the 10-year average of Black murders. During that same time period, an average of 6,927 Black Americans were murdered each year, meaning Black murders shot up by 43% in 2020 compared to the previous 10-year average.

What is evident from this analysis is that there were two periods of abnormal increases in black homicides: one in 2015 after Ferguson and Freddie Gray and then a much sharper increase in 2019 with George Floyd. In other words, every time they promote the anti-police and anti-incarceration message, it backfires, and black people are harmed the most.

Preliminary numbers from 2021 show an even greater increase in homicides. And given that major cities like Baltimore and Philadelphia set new records, it’s very likely that black victims accounted for an even greater share of the excess.

Republicans stupidly squandered the Trump years trying to outflank the Democrats on de-incarceration in an effort to pander to the black vote. They wrongly focused on the fact that blacks are disproportionately incarcerated, even though that is an unfortunate reflection of the crime rate. What they should have focused on is that black victims of crime are disproportionately affected by jailbreak policies. Despite composing just 13% of the population, they account for the majority of the homicide victims. Releasing career criminals ensures that the body count goes up.

Just how badly did the establishment Republicans misread the politics of crime? In a recent Pew Research poll, when asked an open-ended question about the most important issue to their community, the black respondents chose crime and violence as the No. 1 issue, even ahead of the economy. Just 3% chose racism! This trend persisted across most groups, with every age group over 30 choosing violence over the economy as the top issue of concern. “Violence or crime is the most mentioned issue among both those who say being Black is extremely or very important to how they think about themselves (18%) and those who say being Black is not as important to how they think about themselves (13%),” concluded Pew.

Not surprisingly, income and education status played a role:

Black adults with a college degree or higher are less likely (14%) than those with lower educational attainment (18%) to say violence or crime is the most important issue in their community. Meanwhile, the top community issue mentioned among Black adults with lower or middle incomes is violence or crime (20% among lower income, 16% among middle income).

Thus, elitist Republicans and Democrats who are only around high-income college-educated white people couldn’t care less about crime because many of them live in gated neighborhoods. So they can afford to virtue-signal over incarcerating black criminals while ignoring the plight of the victims of crime.

In reality, if policymakers really wanted to help black communities, they’d deal with the most important factor leading to both the disproportionate rate of criminal behavior and victimhood among black people: gang violence. According to the FBI, “Criminal gangs commit as much as 80 percent of crimes in many communities.” A decade ago, it was estimated that 1.4 million gang members from over 33,000 gangs “are responsible for an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions and up to 90 percent in several others.” Again, given that most victims of violent crime are African-American and most gang recruiting is in their neighborhoods, the gangs are the biggest security threat to black neighborhoods.

Most of these individuals are career violent criminals who are often picked up on gun crimes. Yet the same politicians who claim to detest guns will give these criminals a slap on the wrist. It is by that pool of criminals that the blood of African-Americans is spilled in big cities every day.

A group of Yale doctors recently published an article in the British Medical Journal titled, “Racism as a leading cause of death in the United States.” “The excess deaths associated with race can be understood as a toll that is in large part a result of racism in the United States,” lectured the pediatricians in what should be a medical journal. “There is no biological reason, independent of social context, that Black people should die younger than White people.”



Indeed, they are correct. It is the obsessive racism that focuses on color of skin rather than justice, deterring crime, and punishing career criminals that is most responsible for homicide being the leading cause of death for black people under 35, according to the CDC. The homicide rate for black males 18-34 was 17.7 times higher than the rate for white males the same age. How come nobody cares about that disparity? Well, therein lies the ultimate racism.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-black-lives-dont-matter-to-blm-as-thousands-more-killed-by-homicide-since-2020,2022-04-20
Horowitz: What conservatives must do following the FBI raid on Trump,"Watch out, Democrats, Republicans are about to take over the House. And if we are still free by next January, they will hold hearings and send fundraising emails on how they can’t do anything meaningful to restore democracy until they win the next election in 2025. Or will this time be different?

Watching all the GOP leaders foam at the mouth and sputter with anger over the FBI raid of Trump’s home is hilarious. For the same reason Democrats didn’t feel deterred from taking this action in the first place, they will go undeterred for the next one, which is why the FBI followed up the next day with seizing the phone of Rep. Scott Perry. The GOP simply refuses to do what it takes to harness national attention on the issues that matter and induce an inflection point in society. Not only do they decline to hold up must-pass bills, but they have consistently worked with Democrats on numerous other bills to forge Biden’s legacy for free.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell initially didn’t even make a statement regarding the unprecedented raid and awkwardly declined to comment when first questioned about it. Only later on Tuesday did he meekly call for an explanation for the raid. Presumably, he still thinks Ukraine is the most important issue. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy threatened to subpoena AG Merrick Garland next year when, seemingly, Republicans win back the House.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise promised to hold the FBI accountable next year.

But how is this going to change anything? We can’t wait until then to restore democracy, and hearings, while useful, will not be a big-enough blunt instrument to arrest the onslaught against human rights. Talk is cheap. Enough about hearings, fundraising emails, and obsessively focusing on the next election. Here are steps that must be taken immediately to deter the federal police state:

States must block the FBI from political persecutions: Republicans like to direct our attention to the next federal election while obfuscating the fact that they already command supermajority control in 20 or so states. For the most part, the federal government is irremediably broken and will not be fixed with an election. States need to interpose against federal tyranny. State legislatures should convene emergency sessions and pass laws barring the FBI from operating within their states to investigate or apprehend political dissidents.

One such bill has been introduced in Oklahoma by state Senator Nathan Dahm. SB 1166, the “Prohibition on Political Prisoners in Oklahoma Act,” would prohibit the federal government from transporting through the state any January 6 prisoner not charged with a felony. Remember, this is not just about Trump. The Biden administration views Trump’s supporters as the #1 terrorist threat and will continue to target them for contrived or nebulous crimes motivated 100% by political persecution.

Creation of state guards: Florida recently created a state guard that cannot be federalized. Other states must follow suit and make it clear they will use the guard to confront any federal officials – be they FBI, DHS, ATF, or IRS – who prima facie target political opponents.

Sheriff’s posses: Connected to the previous point, we must begin declaring sanctuary counties in which sheriffs will work together with the citizenry to form citizen posse units. Their job will be to defend victims of federal persecution within the counties at a moment’s notice.

Block the fiscal year 2023 budget bill: Republicans aren’t even promising to block the budget bills to repeal the 87,000 IRS agents when they win back the House, much less doing so in September, but there is no time like the present. It’s time to force a national inflection point. Democrats still need 10 Senate Republicans to pass a budget bill. Republicans should hold up any budget bill until there are policy riders prohibiting the use of funding for political persecutions, the hiring of new IRS agents, the funding of Pfizer and Moderna, and any COVID mandate.

Slash the budgets of the FBI and ATF: Rather than just holding hearings, Republicans must pledge next year to pass a budget bill slashing the budgets of these rogue agencies and channeling those reduced funds to a very narrow purview of dealing with career violent felons and Islamic terrorists, for example.

In other words, we need a synergistic response from Republicans at both the state and federal levels. In a perfect world, the GOP governors would hold a joint press conference and discuss the trend of FBI raids on ordinary citizens – not just Trump – simply for holding different political views from the regime’s. They would commit to working together to interpose against the federal tyranny, rather than just campaigning on it.

The federal government doesn’t have the authority to violate due process and human rights, as we’ve witnessed for the past two years of COVID fascism. No, we don’t need merely to win federal elections in order to undo that tyranny; states can stop it in its tracks now. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution (Art. VI, Cl. 2) states that the “Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land,” but only when exercising power “in pursuance” of its Constitution authority.

St. George Tucker explains this clause in his commentaries to clearly infer that “a law not limited to those objects, or not made pursuant to the constitution, would not be the supreme law of the land, but an act of usurpation, and consequently void.” Mind you, this clause was referring to legitimate laws passed by Congress. How much more so it would apply to arbitrary executive edicts.

The notion that we must wait for federal elections to fight back is absurd. Thomas Jefferson, in his Kentucky Resolution of 1798, noted that elections were only reserved as the tool to redress grievances of federal policies within their delegated authority. “That in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general government being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy,” writes Jefferson. What if the feds clearly abuse their authority by monitoring, surveilling, and arresting people for political crimes or by making them wear masks on their faces?

“But where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every state has a natural right, in cases not within the compact [casus non foederis] to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them.”



It’s time for the governors to stand up and teach the Biden administration about the natural right of states to govern most non-foreign-policy issues. We don’t need to wait until 2025 to restore human rights and the rule of law. We live in extraordinary times and face unparalleled threats to our liberty, which require an unprecedented response. If Republicans will just hold hearings and fundraisers, they as may as well combat domestic fascism by sending more money to Ukraine, a move Mitch McConnell would be all too eager to embrace.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-conservatives-fbi-trump-raid,2022-08-10
Horowitz: Conservatives must finally break free from the stranglehold of fake Republicans,"The problem for conservatives headed forward is not so much mail-in ballots as it is mail-in Republicans.



If Haggai the prophet were around today, he’d likely chastise conservative voters as follows: “Consider your ways: You have sown much and you bring in little. You eat without being satiated. You drink without getting your fill. You dress, and it has no warmth. And he who profits, profits into a bundle with holes.”

No matter how much the Republican Party cheats on its base – committing sins that the eyes cannot unsee – conservatives continue to slavishly genuflect to the party’s every whim and offer to carry water for Republicans. They treat Republican politicians as the masters rather than the servants. They believe we must support them at any cost rather than understanding that they need our support to even exist, because Democrats already locked up the voters they truly desire. Conservative influencers continue to view themselves as loyal Republicans and refuse to explore any blunt force trauma to this perfidious party that would force a cathartic moment when either we finally take over the party or we have a critical mass to either start a new one or use the GOP only for ballot access but form a party within a party.

The scope of the problem is not limited to a few RINOs. In fact, we are the RINOs. With the exception of a handful of Republicans who accidentally win office, almost every elected Republican is either indifferent or downright on the other side of the issues that really matter, in the way they matter, and at the time they matter. Just consider that only one senator and only one governor are fighting the issue of our time – biomedical tyranny. Or the fact that not only did a bunch of Republicans vote with Democrats to codify gay marriage as a right against religious liberty, but not a single leadership member in either party spoke out against it and none whipped against it.

In order to secure our votes, they pretend to be with us on the issues that don’t matter, or in the way and at the time they don’t matter. Then they employ a brilliant tactic to keep us on the plantation – threaten us with the prospect of the Democrat winning, the very same Democrats they work with on the issues that matter.

Cunningly, the Republicans understand that while they have no problem working with the Democrats, their base is truly revolted by and fearful of the Democrats. Hence, the argument of “but the Democrats” resonates the most precisely with those most likely to rebel against the perfidious party leadership. Thus, they have created a never-ending zero-sum game. The more the GOP commits perfidy and works with the Democrats on the issues of the time, the farther the political landscape and Overton window shift to the left. The more disquiet and fear instilled in the base about the Democrats further winning, the more the base is hoodwinked into voting Republican without doing any much-needed political surgery.

If you take this vicious cycle to its logical conclusion … it has no conclusion – other than us inexorably becoming wards of Klaus Schwab’s AI transhumanist kingdom. Because whether the issue is COVID, Ukraine, marriage, immigration, spending, global warming, no matter how much the Republicans screw us, they can always turn around and say, “Well, it’s going to be worse if the Democrats win.” In reality, it’s the GOP that acts as the forward advance guard or the getaway car for the Democrats – it’s a one-two step in which the Democrats could not succeed in what they are doing without a veneer of bipartisanship so that they won’t own the blame or fallout of their destructive policies.

Conservative talk show hosts and news influencers need to be asked: What is their plan to stop this cycle of failure and degeneration? And is there no limit to the perfidy of the GOP or particular Republicans that will finally prompt them to stop voting for them? Until conservatives are willing to shoot the hostage, they will never wield any leverage over the Republicans. McConnell and company rightly wager that Republicans will always come back to them because they have nowhere else to go. Jared Kushner said as much to Trump in advocating that he deviate from the MAGA agenda on certain issues.



As we explore multiple ways to shake up the party, particularly at the state and local levels in solid red states first, we must be willing to make it clear that at some point there is a bridge too far. Remember, the establishment torpedoes our candidates in the rare instance that they win the primaries. They not only refuse to support them but openly undermine them. We must return the favor.

The interesting thing about the Republican Party in the way it’s currently constituted is that it not only hates its base, but it increasingly does not appeal to independent voters, despite the fact that Democrats don’t really appeal to them either. Now is the perfect time to begin running respectable candidates with new ideas on an anti-elitist message but devoid of the typical divisive labels to appeal to a broad subset of the electorate who are deeply dismayed with the status quo of the duopoly. There is no silver bullet, but here is a rough outline of things that must be done concurrently:

A pledge against elite globalist Republicans: We don’t need perfection, but when you have Republicans openly undermining us on the key issues of the time, we need a petition of hundreds of thousands of Republican voters pledging they will never vote for them – primary or general election. A good place to start are the 12 Senate Republicans who voted to force gay marriage and its accompanying rainbow jihad against the church upon our communities. Almost all those 12 Republicans are in solid red states and undermine us on many other issues too. For example, Thom Tillis, who is a liberal pretty much on every issue, is also working on an amnesty bill with Democrats. It needs to be made clear that these people will never have our support.

Run independent candidates in the general election: So does this mean you just “let the Democrat win”? That should not stop us from running truly independent candidates in the general election for statewide office who have a broader message and have not been attached so much (or at all) to the Republican Party. I offered a blueprint for this in the Pennsylvania Senate race, when it became clear that Oz was both a leftist and unelectable, that we should have run someone from the medical freedom movement and strip the labels of “conservative” and “liberal.” We need to break the paradigm of the binary uniparty, and we only need one race to break this impervious monopoly. Also, unlike an official new party, it’s fairly easy to get on the ballot as an independent in most states. And nothing appeals more to swing voters these days than the label “independent,” which is something all of us who hate the status quo – from traditional conservative to populists or disenchanted classical liberal – should embrace.

Continue to run primaries with better focus: Where possible, we should still run in Republican primaries, but focus more on governors than on the House or Senate. The federal government is lost. We need to focus on getting more governors like Ron DeSantis in red states, yet at present we have not even a single one. Our entire primary focus should be on governors for red states like Utah, West Virginia, North Dakota, Indiana, and Missouri, which are all up in 2024 but have lackluster GOP governors. There is an immediate opportunity in Kentucky, which has its election next year and is currently held by a Democrat. So far, Savannah Maddox, the most conservative member of the legislature, appears to be the best candidate. And again, when the result of the primaries is unacceptable to us, we should look for independent candidates with a broad appeal. This strategy has promise not only in solid red states but in swing states as well. As for downballot offices – from state legislature to school board and county positions – it’s hard to have a slate of independent candidates with enough money and name ID. We can probably only target this strategy of running independents initially for statewide office. So, for lower offices we will have to run Republicans; however, we need candidates who don’t consider themselves as Republicans and are merely using the party for ballot access – the same way the party uses us for our votes. For legislative bodies, we should make it clear that these candidates will form their own caucus and use their leverage against GOP leadership when needed, almost rendering it like a parliamentarian system. Once elected and having achieved notoriety, they can consider switching to independent, similar to what Kyrsten Sinema has just done after leaving the Democrat Party.

Switch from popular primaries to state conventions/caucuses: In swing states, the Republican brand is not only fraudulent but also toxic. In red states, the brand is still intact, but most red states are run by perfidious Republicans. I can write an entire book on how it’s nearly impossible to knock off Republicans in a primary without a scandal, and even most open seats are hard to win. They have all the money and use it to fool voters by running on our issues with no intent of fulfilling their promises. There is one way to change this cycle of failure. Rather than forcing candidates to raise millions of dollars, money only the bad guys have, they should go through a caucus or convention system whereby voters in precincts elect a representative to vote for them at a convention. The activists know who the frauds are. If you had a Utah-style convention in a state like Texas, Gregg Abbott would have lost his primary. This is the only way to get in a critical mass of non-Republican Republicans in one election cycle. Several years ago, I wrote an outline explaining how this would work.

Focus activism and pressure over issues, not just elections: The way to create a political environment either for primary challenges or independent runs is for conservative voters – who are busy with life, work, and family – to actually know just how bad their GOP governor and legislators are. We need a focused pressure campaign to expose the issues and personnel during legislative sessions so people realize in their deep red districts just how long their Republican representative has been faking it. Every policy opportunity in every legislative session must be exploited, and every bad policy from executive branches in red states must be pointed out and pressure brought to bear on the two-faced Republicans to “convert or die.” Getting active on the issues, especially at the state and local levels, which are less saturated with activism than Congress, is more impactful than elections.

There is a common denominator to all of these action items. They require a mindset that we are the masters of the GOP, not its servants. We must start holding Republicans’ feet to the fire, not carrying water for them. We have no obligation to them. There is a middle ground between continuing the same failed GOP game for the rest of our lives and immediately starting a new party. We make it clear that the Republican Party as it is currently constituted is dead to us, and we act in our own interests. The above ideas are just the beginning of an outline of what that practically looks like. Some of my colleagues in this business might be content to continue playing the game, but for me, I’m done.

Horowitz: Don’t say COVID? Why the media is now avoiding COVID coverage like the plague,"Florida media figures have been accusing Gov. Ron DeSantis of promoting a phantom bill they dishonestly call the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. But, in fact, they would like him to abide by a bizarre new dictate in the world of media censorship: “Don’t say COVID.” Yes, the very topic that they held like a shark grasping its prey for nearly two years is suddenly taboo, as the USA Today-owned Palm Beach Post ran a headline titled, “Is Ron DeSantis addicted to COVID?” Yet if you understand what is going on with the safety and efficacy of the shots, it’s quite obvious why they no longer want to discuss the issue, which is precisely why we should never stop talking about it.

Throughout the past two years, whenever there was a spike in deaths in a given part of the world, every American was treated to an endless barrage of panic porn warning them to take “precautions” to ensure we were not hit next. That paradigm has magically changed. As the virus continues to rage throughout east Asia, a region that was largely spared from the wrath of the pathogen until now, the media no longer wants to warn of impending doom.

“Well, that’s because we already have natural immunity here, whereas in east Asia, many people are being exposed for the first time,” you might retort. That is a very logical hypothesis, but to suggest it necessarily concedes the point that it is natural immunity, not the vaccines, that convey protection, given that most east Asian countries have higher vaccination rates than the U.S.

From day one, South Korea was touted as the country that did everything right – from sophisticated contact tracing and quarantine to disciplined mask-wearing and high vaccination rates. Yet, for the first time, South Korea now has more people critically ill with COVID than the United States.

Obviously, one would still rather be in South Korea’s position overall during the past two years, but the new trend begs the obvious question. Why is South Korea, by far, worse off than ever before, precisely after nearly all adults are vaccinated? 87% of the population has at least one shot and 62% have boosters, which likely means nearly everyone within the age range that could possibly experience bad outcomes has three shots. Just like Israel, the country is now administering fourth boosters. So, what gives? Why South Korea and other east Asian countries skated by without many deaths until now is still unclear — possibly the result of a healthy population, prior partial immunity, or sheer luck. But either way, why would it be worse than ever after having these shots?

Hong Kong has just reached its peak, but it has now suffered the worst death curve in the world over the past few weeks, after barely experiencing any deaths since 2020. While its vaccination rate is lower than that of South Korea, it’s still higher than the rate in the U.S.

At 280 deaths per day, Hong Kong is averaging the equivalent of over 12,000 daily deaths in the U.S., a number we’ve never reached.

As such, one can understand why the COVID fascists no longer want to discuss COVID. Not only were lockdowns and masks repudiated as effective tools to stop the spread, but the vaccine, at minimum, has been proven ineffective, if not downright harmful with possible pathogen priming or antibody dependent disease enhancement. Not exactly a record to brag about. Yet we must continue talking about it because American soldiers and health care personnel are still losing their jobs for not getting this jab. What if it’s these very shots that are responsible for more COVID cases?

Cases appear to be going up in some Western countries as well, including in the U.K. Where are they coming from? Every successive UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report released on Thursdays appears to show the negative efficacy of the vaccine intensifying each week. The data now show that between Feb. 13 and March 6, the infection rate per capita was the lowest among the unvaccinated for every age group. It was the highest in the triple-jabbed in almost every age cohort. For most age groups, the booster is now between -200% and -250% effective.



Is this perhaps why the U.K. is dropping all its restrictions on travel, despite the fact that cases are beginning to go up again? Authorities can’t afford to have us focus on the atrocities that have been committed over the past two years.

"Horowitz: Effort grows to block Chinese ownership of US land, but establishment Republicans oppose it","You control the food and farms, you control the people. This is why it is prudent at this time in history to begin social distancing from China.

According to USDA data, as of 2019, foreign investors owned at least 35.2 million acres of U.S. agricultural land. In other words, 2.7% of privately owned crop, grazing, and forest lands are owned by foreign investors. While the top foreign holders are from Canada and friendly European countries, Chinese owners controlled about 192,000 agricultural acres in the U.S., worth $1.9 billion, an amount that has grown rapidly over the past decade.

On the residential real estate side, according to the National Association of Realtors, Chinese nationals are the largest foreign buyers of property, totaling $11.5 billion in 2020 alone. Given that we now make everything in China, isn’t it obvious that we shouldn’t give the Chinese communists a foothold on our own soil to be used against us?

Food, energy, medicine – these are the things we must control in America by Americans. We cannot have China further manipulate our food supply at a time of looming scarcity. And eventually, the Chinese influence will grow further. China, which is the second largest foreign owner of land in Australia, bought an Australian island and then banned its Aussie residents from even living there. In 1993, China paid the Australian government to lease the Merredin airport for 100 years. Now China owns the airspace and Australian citizens can’t land in their own country without approval from the Chinese government.

To ensure we don’t have this problem in America, Rep. Chip Roy introduced H.R.3847: The Securing America’s Land from Foreign Interference Act , last year. The bill would categorically ban any member of the Chinese Communist Party from owning public or private real estate in the U.S. Obviously, with Democrats in control of Congress, a party that has members who literally sleep with Chinese spies, there is no prayer to get this bill passed. But it shouldn’t stop red states from instituting statewide bans on their own.

Last month, Arizona became the first state to embark on this goal. State Sen. Wendy Rogers introduced Senate Bill 1342, which stipulates that members of the Chinese Communist Party ""may not own real property"" in the state and that any deed such a member currently has is deemed invalid. Her bill was inspired by a narrower piece of legislation signed by the Texas governor last year banning people from China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia from accessing the electrical grid. That bill was born out of local outrage in response to a Chinese billionaire who purchased land to build a wind farm near Laughlin Air Force Base.

The Arizona bill passed the Commerce Committee along party lines on Feb. 16 and now awaits floor action in the Senate and then the House. However, numerous Arizona Republicans expressed reluctance to move the bill forward because they are scared of being mean to China.

On the other side of the country, South Carolina state Rep. Patrick Haddon wants to take the divorce from China a step further and divest all state ties to Chinese companies. “Every Chinese company, without exception, is either majority owned or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army,"" Haddon said in a recent press conference introducing a series of eight bills severing ties between the Palmetto State and China. ""Investing in Chinese companies and doing business with these companies, at the very least, contributes monetarily to the Chinese government as China is in the midst of a massive military buildup and modernization programs.""

H 4186 would ban all state financial incentives to certain companies owned in part by the Chinese Communist Party and prohibit any American company that does business with such companies from receiving state incentives. H 4841 would prohibit state and county governments from investing in certain Chinese companies. Several other bills would prohibit state pension funds from being invested in Chinese-owned companies. H 4845 bans Chinese companies from owning more than 100 acres of land within the state. Finally, H. 5009 would close the state’s commerce office in China and merge it with the office in Taiwan.

The ownership issue is of grave consequence. Not only do some Chinese nationals directly own land, but they also own large agribusinesses that own a lot of U.S. farm land. The most glaring example is Smithfield, the largest pork producer in the U.S. It was bought out by Chinese firm Shuanghui, now called WH Group, in 2013. The company now owns by proxy 146,000 acres of farmland in Missouri. As the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) observes, “Missouri had formerly banned all foreign ownership of agricultural land in the state, but one week before Shuanghui took over Smithfield, that rule changed to allow foreign entities to own up to 1 percent of the state’s farmland.”

So, what could go wrong with the Chinese owning the largest pork producer? As the CSIS reminds us, “When the pandemic hit, Smithfield increased pork exports to China even as the United States experienced widespread meat shortages due to supply chain disruptions and Smithfield closed some of its plants due to poor working conditions.”

Haddon’s bills are designed to designed to deter this from happening in South Carolina. These are the sorts of measures that one would expect to garner bipartisan support, yet in every state where they are proposed, every Democrat and many Republicans oppose them. It’s bizarre that during a time when both parties want to punish all Russians for the actions of Putin, they are dead set against divesting from China, which is more systemically evil throughout its government and is an even bigger strategic threat. Just within a week, five major Hollywood studios pulled the release of Russian films. But not a word on China, which is threatening to use Ukraine as an example against Taiwan.

The Post and Courier reports that Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is “lukewarm” to Haddon’s proposals and has some concerns about the bills. “We need to be careful and know what we’re doing,” McMaster said. “Because we do want to build trade in South Carolina and have all of our people working.”

Rep. Hadden, though, believes the skeptics are being short-sighted by refusing to embark on the process of weaning our dependency on China. “The politicians who don’t see the threat posed by the Chinese communist government owning vast amounts of American farmland are not paying attention.”

According to the Post and Courier, there are 42 Chinese companies with investments in the state worth nearly $500 million in capital since 2017. But this just illustrates how dangerously intertwined with and dependent upon China we have become. At a minimum, we should start by banning land ownership, which is much more of a security threat, especially as it relates to farming and the food chain. “America’s ability to produce our own food is fundamental to our national security, our economic health, and our way of life,” warned Haddon in an interview with TheBlaze.



The financial incentives and pressure from the establishment business community are consistently an obstacle to fighting back on values and security issues even in red states. Haddon has blunt words for those Republicans. “Politicians who are campaigning on economic development at the expense of our national security should be ashamed of themselves. South Carolina taxpayers should not be forced to fund tax incentives that go directly to the Chinese Communist government. That shouldn’t be a controversial position for conservative Republicans.”",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-effort-grows-to-block-chinese-ownership-of-us-land-but-establishment-republicans-oppose-it,2022-03-02
Horowitz: War on energy is the new COVID fascism,"As the British crown tightened its grip on the colonies, Samuel Adams warned in favor of an aggressive response by noting that “if we are voluntarily silent as the conspirators would have us to be, it will be considered as an approbation of the change.” Well, here we are, two years after the worst tyranny ever – not just a handful of small taxes but a complete lockdown of our lives and biomedical control of our bodies – and there has been no impetus to formally strip governments of their ill-gotten powers. It is therefore not surprising that the lockdown mindset is now being used to help promote and “solve” an energy crisis at the same time.

In preparation for Europe’s self-imposed energy crisis, Ravi Gurumurthy, chief executive of Nesta and former director of strategy at the U.K.’s Department of Energy and Climate Change, called on the U.K. government to impose “COVID-style” rationing of use of energy this coming winter.

“The scale of the crisis now requires a Covid-style response. In months, the government created the infrastructure to roll out vaccines nationwide. We need a similar national campaign to help every household cut their gas use by 20%,” warned Gurumurthy in a statement being echoed by all the green fascists. “The government must provide further support to households to reduce the impact of the rising price cap and bills. But the problem is getting worse and not going away. Subsidies are vital but with a series of difficult winters ahead, hand-to-mouth policies are not enough.”

In case you think this is just European-style totalitarianism, the trend is already beginning in California – except in this case it’s in preparation for a heat wave. California’s grid operator said it may have to ""issue a series of emergency notifications and “expects to call on Californians for voluntary conservation via Flex alerts over the long weekend."" In a statement issued Tuesday, the California Independent System Operator called on people to “set thermostats to 78 degrees or higher, avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles, and turn off unnecessary lights.” For now, these ideas might take the form of recommendations, but not for long. If people were willing to wear diapers on their faces in the heat to obtain basic services and shut down their way of life for months, it doesn’t even require a leap of the imagination to envision energy-related shutdowns.

The rich irony of this statement is that they are calling on people to stop charging their electrical vehicles just a week after California announced a ban on all gas-powered cars by 2035! Thus, this is not even just about cronyism and steering people toward one car vs. another; it’s about ending cars altogether and making “COVID” a permanent new normal, as was established by the “Great Reset.”

To fully appreciate what is happening here, one must study the origins of this latest crisis. Europe and the U.S. goaded the Ukrainian government into fighting Putin’s demands in a way they knew would never be sustainable, while concurrently cutting off all Russian energy without a commitment to ramp up their own fossil fuel production. This had the effect of inducing the worst supply chain shortage and inflation in energy of our lifetime. Clearly, this had nothing to do with protecting the Ukrainian people. The harm to the energy supply chain was not a bug of their plan, but a feature. After all, Diederik Samsom, chief of staff for Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s executive vice president, recently said, “The two basic needs of life – food and energy – we have paid way too little for in the past 40 years.”

Just as with COVID, where the virus was likely created through gain-of-function research and then the medical establishment blocked all early treatment for it to steer you toward the “solution” of total control and vaccine mandates, the Great Reset plan for energy (and likely food as well) is no different. The Great Resetters created an arbitrary crisis, then blocked the solution (oil, gas, nuclear, coal, etc. is the early treatment), and then turned to the people and say you must be willing to “sacrifice” in order to save humanity from the shortage, just like you had to lock down and get experimental shots in order to save Grandma. This is why Ukraine became the “next current thing” after COVID and why the Ukrainian flag replaced the mask and needles in the social media profile pics. It had nothing to do with regard for the Ukrainian people.

What sort of sacrifices do they have in mind? There is no limit to their transhuman agenda. James Bevan, chief of the U.K.’s Environment Agency, suggested that increased droughts will require people to drink more reprocessed sewage. “Part of the solution will be to reprocess the water that results from sewage treatment and turn it back into drinking water – perfectly safe and healthy, but not something many people fancy,” wrote the lead eco guru in the Sunday Times. Although he admitted it was unpopular, he stressed the need to serve the gods of scarcity. “We need to remember where it comes from: when we turn on the tap, what comes out started in a river, lake or aquifer. The more we take, the more we drain those sources and put stress on nature and wildlife.”

So, it will be sewage for water, along with bugs for protein, while using bicycles for cars when we are allowed out of our homes.

This all comes as the FDA, for the first time ever, approved an Omicron booster shot based on results from eight mice. We are now the lab rats. That’s why it’s so easy for them to “COVID” us on energy policy. We allowed gain of function to create draconian lockdowns, so now they are ensuring self-imposed energy scarcity will lead to rationing. Chief executive of Shell Ben van Beurden is now warning of “years” of rationing, not just one winter.

And of course, as the West wallows in scarcity and experiments in transhumanism, China is always looking to grow. In August, China’s coal-fired power generation reached a record 120 billion kilowatts per hour. The country is planning to expand up to 150 gigawatts of new coal-fired power capacity from 2022 to 2025.

America is the Saudi Arabia of coal. We should be able to flood the market with coal. Sadly, thanks to the war on coal production, intensified through climate mysticism, we have no hand to play as our government shuts off exports from Russia. Given that coal accounts for 35% of global electricity use and Europe gets 70% of its coal from Russia, the coal crisis is now worse than the oil crisis.

Rather than ramping up production, the U.K. plans to decommission all its coal power plants by October 2024. In the U.S., coal production has been declining steadily since 2007, and if the eco-fascists have their way, it will be extinct by the end of the decade. And no, it’s not because we don’t have God-given resources. Our coal reserves are estimated at 254 trillion tons, much greater than the reserves of China and Russia.

In other words, the legacy of COVID lives on. What COVID taught us is that governments were willing to block effective treatments in order to trap us into a false choice between dying from the virus or getting the shots. Likewise, with energy, they will dismantle our energy production to trap us into a false dichotomy of starving or freezing to death in the winter or living in their transhuman dystopia. They understand that you cannot control a people when food and energy are cheap and abundant, just like they understood that with medical care. Thus, in order to obtain complete control as they did during lockdowns, they need to tap the gods of scarcity.



The solution is to uproot all of the ill-gotten power our government grabbed during COVID and fully investigate the malfeasance behind the creation of the virus and its ensuing policies so that this same playbook cannot be used again. As founding father George Clinton, the very first governor of New York and fourth vice president of the United States, warned at the New York ratification convention in July 1788, “History does not furnish a single instance of a government once established, voluntarily yielding up its powers to secure the rights and liberties of the people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-energy-new-covid-fascism,2022-09-01
Horowitz: Florida judge creates constitutional right to ballot-harvesting while virtue-signaling over Ukraine,"You don’t have a right to breathe without gagging your mouth, but you do have a right to access mail-in ballots from private third parties indiscriminately mailed to your home. Put another way, government has to accommodate your convenience preferences for voting but can take action against your body and create apartheid for those who don’t engage in medical experiments. That is the worldview of Florida federal Judge Mark Walker.

SB 90, signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis last May, prohibited unsolicited mailing of ballots, drop boxes, ballot-harvesting by third parties, and the use of private money in the administration of elections.

In a racist, political screed that was more political than what is typically debated even in the political branches of government, Judge Walker of the Northern District of Florida declared much of SB 90 unconstitutional, thereby concocting a right to ballot harvesting, drop-off boxes without surveillance, and other government hand-holding of voters through the use of private organizations with a political agenda.

""For the past 20 years, the majority in the Florida Legislature has attacked the voting rights of its Black constituents,"" Walker wrote, thinking his unelected position is worth more than a democratically elected legislature.

Mind you, he could never cite any proof of intentional discrimination against any particular group. “Skilled and well-respected judges from multiple courts examined the provisions discussed above, and they all found that the Florida Legislature did not enact them with the intent to discriminate based on race,” conceded Walker. But then he ruled that because he believes it has “discriminatory effect,” “this Court cannot ignore other relevant evidence of intent just because it does not fit neatly under a particular factor.”

This is very politically convenient for him. Yet the fact that minorities tend to vote Democrat doesn’t vest Democrats with greater power or extra rights to mandate more voting procedures and conveniences any more than rural white voters could demand more conveniences in voting in more spread-out polling locations in the country because providing such service helps the Republican Party.

One could conjure up a disparate impact theory to attack any election law on the assumption that these administrative procedures will help or hurt one particular group based on their habits, culture, and location. But that doesn’t mean the law is discriminatory. For example, if Republicans succeed in gaming out early voting on Saturdays at rural gun clubs the same way Democrats have succeed in past get-out-the-vote efforts on Sunday with black churches, does that mean the state must provide early voting on Saturday?

Ironically, as Walker accuses the governor of discriminating against Latino as well as black voters on some provisions, he does concede that it’s not quite as bad. Why? “Latino Floridians are not particularly affiliated with either party,” he notes. Clearly, he is reading the polls showing DeSantis with a strong approval rating among those voters. Thus, the entirety of constitutional rights, according to Walker, hinges upon the voting preferences of voters. If black voters began to swing away from the Democrats as much as Latinos, I’m sure he would suddenly be fine with banning ballot-harvesting and drop boxes.

The judge’s opinion was rife with political rhetoric, citation of op-eds, and even a footnote virtue-signaling over how amazingly democratic Ukrainians are fighting for the right to vote. “The current war in Ukraine, in which the Ukrainian people are fighting and dying to maintain the freedoms we take for granted—namely, the right to have a voice and not to be ruled by a despot—provides a poignant reminder of both the value and fragility of democracy,” wrote Walker in the first footnote of the 288-page polemic.

In many respects he is not wrong. The voting model created by the Soros-backed voter fraud industry has actually made our elections very similar to those in Ukraine. When was the last time they had fair elections in Ukraine?

Walker has a history of acting as a super-legislature over voting issues and even had to recuse himself in one case because his wife served as the attorney representing the plaintiffs in one of the cases.

The entire premise of his opinion was built upon the fact that anyone who is not white is incapable of voting unless the government essentially allows voter fraud organizations to serve the vote up on a platter. At a time when negative inalienable rights are being terminated – you know, like the right to breathe or to access public accommodation without being subjected to medical experimentation – Walker is creating affirmative “rights” to active government assistance, of course, through the conduit of left-wing organizations.

Walker also mandated that the state submit any voter law changes to his highness for the next 10 years. Perhaps he will mandate internet voting one day. Or maybe he will render all votes of non-white voters for the Democrat Party even if they don’t vote, because, you know, that’s how they really want to vote but they are just incapable of articulating or acting upon it without the assistance of Walker’s allied street organizers.

Walker says that the ban on private groups acting like election judges is somehow tantamount to blocking people from handing out water at the polls. Yet other judges like Walker have turned down lawsuits from people forced to wear masks in order to vote. Rape victims and those with disabilities were told they couldn’t vote in many states without harming their breathing, yet if you don’t allow street agitators to offer solicitations of public ballots or a drop box outside an official election office, you are violating the Constitution and harming those with disabilities. Your rights don’t come from God; they come from government and can be added or deleted at the whims of tyrants like Walker.

We could dismiss this judge as one lone kook, but this is the prevailing ideology among the entire leftist political movement, and it’s most evident in legal circles. These people not only reject fundamental rights, but they have inverted constitutional rights completely upside down in order to enshrine their behaviors, political goals, and values as the new rights. You don’t have freedom from government, but you have a right to affirmative benefits they deem auspicious to their cause.

DeSantis perfectly summed up the screed disguised as a legal opinion. “There’s an old saying in law,” said Mr. DeSantis. “If you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have the law on your side, argue the law. If you have neither, you pound the table. Well, this is the judicial equivalent of pounding the table.” The governor believes that the decision will be overturned by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The question remains whether the damage will be done for the upcoming elections this cycle.



During the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, James Madison assuaged the concerns of his Virginia colleagues leery of a new federal government by noting that Congress wouldn’t interfere in election laws and procedures. ""It was found necessary to leave the regulation of [federal elections], in the first place, to the state governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of the people,"" stated the Founding Father. Imagine if he had been told that one day a single man from the unelected branch of the federal government could mandate ballot-harvesting by one party’s organizations.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-florida-judge-creates-constitutional-right-to-ballot-harvesting-while-virtue-signaling-over-ukraine,2022-04-01
Horowitz: Hunter Biden’s role in Ukrainian biolabs raises serious questions about gain of function and Ukraine policy,"Recent emails unearthed by the U.K. Daily Mail and the National Pulse reveal that during the last decade, Hunter Biden seemed to have a keen interest in pathogen research in Ukraine and using it as a tool for geopolitical affairs in that country. It just so happens to be that a pathogen connected to gain-of-function research destroyed the world, and then the next “big current thing” on the geopolitical stage was none other than Ukraine. Shouldn’t the American people get some answers as to why our government was so heavily involved – via the vice president’s son – in both pathogen research and Ukraine and to make sure Ukraine is not Wuhan 2.0?

Earlier this month, I detailed the known connections between biotech firm Metabiota Inc., responsible for the pathogen research in Ukraine, the DOD, and EcoHealth Alliance, along with the Wuhan lab most likely responsible for the leak of SARS-CoV-2. I also noted that Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), a subsidiary of the Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz-founded Rosemont Capital, gave Metabiota, a company accused of dangerous lab protocols during the African Ebola pandemic, its first infusion of cash a decade ago. Now, new emails from Hunter’s laptop demonstrate that his involvement in Metabiota and pathogen research in Ukraine was much deeper than just an initial investment.

On April 4, 2014, Metabiota vice president Mary Guttieri wrote an email to the younger Biden outlining how they could “assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia'” with their joint venture, according to an email from Hunter’s laptop obtained by the U.K. Daily Mail. That is quite a curious goal for a company that supposedly does scientific research and analysis about emerging pandemics.

The outlet also posted another email dated April 8, 2014, from Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi referring to a “science project” Hunter had pitched to him involving Burisma and Metabiota in Ukraine. “Please find few initial points to be discussed for the purposes of analyzing the potential of this as you called, 'Science Ukraine' project,” Pozharskyi wrote. Hunter sits on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company owned by corrupt billionaire Mikolay Zlochevsky, who fled to Monaco after he was put under investigation.

Hunter’s dad, as vice president, was in charge of our foreign policy with Ukraine in 2014 when all of this was occurring and when the U.S. government was backing the color revolution that led to the ouster of the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. It was at this time that the Defense Department began funding the Metabiota operations in Ukraine.

After receiving 18.4 million from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 earmarked for “Ukraine research projects,” “Metabiota has worked in Ukraine for Black & Veatch, a US defense contractor with deep ties to military intelligence agencies, which built secure labs in Ukraine that analyzed killer diseases and bioweapons,” according to the Daily Mail.

“It raises the question, what is the real purpose of this venture? It's very odd,” said former senior CIA officer Sam Faddis in an interview with the Daily Mail. “His father was the Vice President of the United States and in charge of relations with Ukraine. So why was Hunter not only on the board of a suspect Ukrainian gas firm, but also hooked them up with a company working on bioweapons research?”

Biden was so involved in Metabiota that one email written that same month in 2014 reveals that he and his business partner Eric Schwerin discussed subletting their office space to the San-Francisco-based biotech firm.

So, what exactly were they working on? Last week, the National Pulse reported that a feature in the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine’s 2016 AnnualReport recounts an October 2016 meeting involving U.S. military officials and their Ukrainian counterparts together with Black & Veatch and Metabiota staff to discuss the lab work. The discussion centered around “existing frameworks, regulatory coordination, and ongoing cooperative projects in research, surveillance and diagnostics of a number of dangerous zoonotic diseases, such as avian influenza, leptospirosis, Crimea Congo hemorrhagic fever, and brucellosis.”

The National Pulse cites a 2019 paper authored by researchers from Metabiota and three Ukraine-based institutes and funded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency sharing how they isolated a form of African swine flu using a pig from Ukraine in 2016. They also detail their research on Anthrax in animals in Ukraine.

Well, where else have we heard of Metabiota partners working on gain-of-function research of pathogens that typically are in animals? Oh yes, EcoHealth Alliance in Wuhan. In the past, Metabiota has worked with EcoHealth and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The zoonotic projects being described in Ukraine sound awfully similar to the gain-of-function work EcoHealth was involved with in Wuhan. In Feb. 2016, EcoHealth’s founder, Peter Daszak, explained the company’s zoonotic pathogen work as follows:

So as an example, first of all, we are only looking at viral families that include those that have gone into people from animals. So we narrow it down straight away. Then when you get a sequence of a virus and it looks like a relative of a known nasty pathogen, just like we did with SARS, we found other Corona viruses in bats, a whole host of them, some of them looked very similar to SARS. So we sequenced the spike protein, the protein that attaches to cells. Then we, well, I didn’t do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work, you create the pseudo-particles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses [to see if they] bind to human cells. And each step you move closer and closer to this virus could really become pathogenic in people. So you narrow down the field, you reduce the cost and you end up with a small number of viruses that really do look like killers. (C-Span, 1:16:22.)

Sure sounds a lot like the coronavirus that actually broke out several years ago and destroyed the world as we know it. Less than a month later, Ralph Baric, the UNC Chapel Hill biologist who spearheaded the gain-of-function projects for Daszak, co-authored a paper warning with certitude of the emergence of this disease. “The results indicate that viruses using WIV1-CoV spike are poised to emerge in human populations due to efficient replication in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures,” concluded the authors.

How did they know? And doesn’t anyone have a concern that the same players were up to no good in Ukraine, especially given Hunter Biden’s ethical problems and the fact that his dad, the vice president and now the president, was overseeing Ukrainian affairs during that time?

Recently, the National Pulse found, based on EcoHealth’s 990 filings and analysis by ProPublica, that the company’s investment income surged by 342% in the year of the pandemic. EcoHealth received millions of dollars from Fauci’s NIAD to work on “killer” viruses with the Wuhan Institute, creating “chimeric” viruses that spread in humans at rates “equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV.”



Now consider the fact that Metabiota’s CEO, Nathan Wolfe, penned an article in Time on Aug. 1, 2014, detailing his opinion on the Ebola outbreak in Africa and then literally predicted coronavirus as the next outbreak:

While Ebola virus won’t be the next global Andromeda strain, there are viruses out there that could be. Coronaviruses (like SARS) and influenza viruses (like the H1N1 virus of 1918) for example, show that some viruses truly can spread around the world in ways that will blindside and impact our entire planet. It is notable that a novel coronavirus, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and a novel influenzavirus, the H7N9 virus, receive very little attention from the international media. Perhaps as importantly, there are millions of still unidentified viruses in animal reservoirs, among which, almost certainly is a virus that we’d have no capacity to understand or stop were it to suddenly emerge today.

If we didn’t have a pandemic likely created by similar research – possibly by the same players – killing millions globally and injuring tens of millions of others, I wouldn’t be too concerned with these research projects in Ukraine. But given what has occurred, why is there zero concern from the media or the politicians about what we have been doing in Ukraine and elsewhere? And how does it shape our entire geopolitical worldview on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict? Inquiring minds would like to know.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-hunter-bidens-role-in-ukrainian-biolabs-raises-serious-questions-about-gain-of-function-and-ukraine-policy,2022-03-30
Horowitz: If only Republicans loved America as much as they love Ukraine,"We’ve had a revolution in this country for the past two years, in which constitutional and even human rights were suspended. To this day, a clot shot is being imposed on our soldiers in the military. Yet senators like Ben Sasse were dead silent as if in quarantine for two years. I didn’t even know some of them were still in Washington. We also have cartels killing Americans by sending over unfathomable quantities of deadly poison and criminal aliens. Yet crickets. But the minute Ukraine comes into the news, there is no amount of money and arms that is too much to bestow upon the country. Their only criticism of Biden is that he’s not sending enough aid quickly enough.

Oh, and inflation is just a figment of your imagination. So not only do they love Ukrainians more than Americans, they are actually increasing inflation with more printed money, plus prolonging a stalemate war that will result in more supply chain shortages and dead civilians.

After giving $13.6 billion to Ukraine, Congress nearly unanimously passed a lend-lease program to essentially lend any weapon aside from nuclear weapons to the dubious Ukrainian military, which is mixed with prominent neo-Nazi forces. But that wasn’t enough. Biden submitted a $33 billion weapons and aid bill to Ukraine, and congressional Democrats upped the price tag to $40 billion. Together with the first $13 billion, that is more than double the sum we spend on interest on the national debt.

So what is the GOP response? Yes, let’s get this done even faster, but our only objection is that it not be tethered to the $10 billion COVID bill. But that bill – which is a handout to Pfizer and Moderna, because, you know, they are quite poor – only bothers them because they want to use it as leverage to require Biden to keep Title 42 turnbacks at the border. They actually don’t oppose his COVID policy bills at all, just as they don’t oppose his Ukraine bill. And even with regard to the the border, Title 42 is kind of a tangential issue to the fact that our government is working with the cartels and that Republicans should demand that the $40 billion spent on Ukraine’s border be spent arming the Texas and Arizona National Guards against the cartels.

You see, Republicans, with all their feigned political combat against Democrats, will never fight the issue that matters, in the way it matters, and at the time it matters. In fact, when it actually matters, they are on the other side – not the side of America.

According to Roll Call, Sen. Lindsey Graham praised Biden for agreeing to split the COVID and Ukraine bills. “I don’t care, as long as the money is going to help the war cause,” he said. “It’s in our interest, defeating Putin is priceless.”

Yup, all the money, arms, and effort he would never put into defending Americans’ liberty from COVID fascism or our border from the cartels, he will use for Ukraine. The sky is the limit. He also called upon Russia to be designated as a state sponsor of terror, but of course no such call for designating the Mexican cartels that actually affect our security more than anything in the world.

Sen. Ben Sasse had no concerns about where this money is going and whether it is going to Hunter Biden’s extracurricular activities, such as the bioweapons facilities. No, everything in Ukraine is pristine and we “shouldn’t get bogged down in partisan politics.”

“This is really simple: If we want Ukraine to win, we need to continue to arm them to the teeth,"" he said. ""A clean Ukraine bill will have the votes. Let’s get this done.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear that “we need to do it quickly.""

“We all agree the most important thing going on in the world now is the war in Ukraine,” McConnell said at a press conference on Tuesday, announcing the bipartisan agreement with the president.

How is that for a bold contrast between the parties! Nothing here at home to worry about. But it’s worse than that. Their strategy for Ukraine is actually harming domestic policy.

Just hours after the text of the bill dropped on Tuesday, nearly three-quarters of the House Republicans joined every Democrat in approving the funding. Only 57 Republicans voted no.

As the central theme of their midterm election campaign, Republican leaders are decrying Bidenflation. However, they have supported nearly every major spending bill that has led to this inflation and have shown no sign of graduating to the next level of economic literacy. At a time of supply shortages, including in weaponry, they are sending stockpiles abroad to fuel a war in eastern Ukraine.

Moreover, so long as they fuel the war rather than bring about a solution that ends the fighting through Ukraine renouncing any future NATO membership and ceding the ethnic Russian areas, it will continue to exacerbate the pain of supply shortages across the globe. Imagine how many factories we could build for things like baby formula or fertilizer.



Instead, our funding is going to neo-Nazi nationalist groups that ran a “No to Capitulation” campaign against Zelenskyy’s own peace accord in 2019. Ironically, if not for the Azov Brigade we are now funding, there likely would have been no war.

Perhaps we can all self-identify as Ukrainians, and our Republican politicians will pay attention to those who’ve had their lives destroyed by Pfizer’s experimental gene therapy.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-if-only-republicans-loved-america-as-much-as-they-love-ukraine,2022-05-11
Horowitz: It’s past time to replace McConnell and McCarthy as leaders,"



It’s deja vu all over again. I have more gray hair and a few more kids, but it’s like nothing has changed since the last big GOP win 12 years ago. My wife made this political cartoon for a column of mine during the “Tea Party wave” election of 2010 to accentuate the point that there is no purpose in winning an election to empower leaders who believe in handing the ball of power to the defeated team on every issue that matters. Here we are 12 years later, and McConnell is still at the helm of the party, even as he stands against conservatives on every issue that matters.

Likewise, Kevin McCarthy was the House GOP whip at the time of the Tea Party, and he has overseen the failed GOP bouts in the majority ever since as both majority leader and whip. Now he wants a promotion after failing to deliver on a “first and goal” play this election. Will conservatives ever learn to clean up their own yard before focusing solely on the Democrats?

While many are relieved election season is over, there is another election right around the corner that will determine whether the GOP’s win of House control (and potentially the Senate) will mean anything in the real world. The Senate and House GOP conferences, the roster of representatives and senators serving next year, will determine who will serve as their leaders. The question is very simple: Do they want the leader who agrees with the morass we find ourselves in or someone who is at least promising to capitalize on the flip in Congress to challenge Biden and promote a very different agenda for the country?

Mitch McConnell is a man who believes that funding the corrupt WEF-backed Ukrainian government is the most important policy issue of our time. He paved the way for the greatest legislative victory of the Biden administration and has agreed to pass an omnibus bill in the lame-duck session, which will undercut the leverage of a new GOP House majority for an entire year. He even voted to give the FBI billions of dollars to “red flag” political opponents in the first gun control bill to pass in years. To top it off, he spent millions of dollars defending Lisa Murkowski against her conservative opponent in Alaska after she voted against Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

Both McConnell and McCarthy refused to whip against the bill forcing states to elevate homosexual relations as a fundamental right to redefine marriage, and McConnell’s allies plan to pass it in the lame-duck session.

As for McCarthy, while he is trying to reinvent himself, he is the man who oversaw the lamest GOP agenda of all time during the 2017-2018 era, when Republicans enjoyed trifecta control. If Republicans wind up winning both chambers in the end, they will still claim their leverage is limited without the White House. But McCarthy was in power when they had all three branches, and he oversaw a dynamic in which almost every budget bill was passed out of his chamber with minority Republican/majority Democrat support – all with his blessing.

McCarthy was part of the original “young gun” movement within the GOP, along with Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan, whose brand of Republicanism has long since been repudiated. Why is McCarthy somehow the survivor from the old guard to lead us in a new era that requires new thinking to confront a new globalist/corporatist agenda that his donors are largely on board with? McCarthy has been fundraising against conservative candidates in the primaries even in deep red districts for years. Finally, leading into this election, he put out an uninspiring, weak agenda that failed to even recognize that our basic freedoms have been assaulted by the biomedical security state, an omission from the campaign that allowed the leftists to co-opt the issue of saving “democracy” during a time when their party (with the help of McCarthy’s GOP) put us into a state of martial law.

Isn’t it time to nominate party leaders who know what time it is rather than those who fight the members who are speaking to the issues of the time?

Despite the lethargic GOP showing for such an auspicious environment, Republicans will still fully control the House and may possibly still control the Senate. The economy will only get worse, and the policies of the Biden administration will remain unpopular and will get even worse. Biden promised on Wednesday, “I’m not gonna change anything in any fundamental way.” Which means conservatives still have a prime opportunity to check his power through the right hearings, must-pass legislation, and the budget process. The margins might be smaller than hoped, but that shouldn’t fundamentally matter if we have an effective leader.

In fact, the smaller margins will allow the few brave conservatives to announce they will not vote for Kevin McCarthy on the House floor during the January 3 speaker’s election. Although the GOP conference will meet next week to privately vote on the party’s nominee for speaker, along with majority leader, whip, and other positions, the position of speaker requires a second vote from the entire House body. A speaker is only elected if he garners a majority of those present and voting in the chamber.



So if Republicans have an eight-seat majority, for example, nine Republicans voting for someone else could deny McCarthy the speakership. There is no risk of Pelosi or another Democrat winning, because a plurality is not enough. This would trigger a deadlock and force negotiations, which can begin today if McCarthy realizes there are enough votes to deny him the office.

The most influential form of activism at this point would be for conservatives to call their respective representatives-elect and demand that they support a new leader and publicly declare their opposition to McCarthy. Likewise, all GOP senators should be encouraged to vote for someone other than McConnell for Senate majority leader. Although that vote is private and only among the GOP members, there is no reason why senators should not be forced to go on the record to declare their support or opposition to McConnell.

We need leaders who know what time it is, but we also need our voters to understand we are living in a new era of activism, when merely coming out to vote is not enough. We need follow through every day in these two years.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-its-past-time-to-replace-mcconnell-and-mccarthy-as-leaders,2022-11-11
Horowitz: It’s time Republicans call Biden’s bluff on American energy before it’s too late,"The obsession and virtue-signaling over Ukraine has become such an orgy of emotional indulgence that it now rivals COVID, BLM, and Jan. 6 – the three most recent catalyzing moments in geo-politics – in its bipartisan intensity. The same players behind the over-indulgence of the aforementioned three events seem to have been too prepared to cherish this moment well beyond what any spontaneous human reaction to the invasion should have induced. Given that we now understand the motivations behind those three events, we should be very wary as to where the Ukrainian obsession is coming from and where it is headed – before it’s too late.

Let’s face it: Corrupt Western governments, the media, Big Tech, and all the other masters of Western civilization don’t suddenly have an affinity for an all-white, retro culture, and anti-vax country like Ukraine. The nation is not exactly the paradigm of social media wokeness. On the other hand, there has never been a greater obsession with glorifying a civilization with heroism, bravery, and altruism as there has been with promoting Ukrainian gallantry memes – to the point that most of the stories are fake. At the same time, even as Western leaders dote upon Ukraine as the most virtuous cause of mankind – to the point that they think this is the WWII Hitler/Poland moment – none of the Western countries have banded together to meaningfully fight on the ground with Ukraine.

After all, if we are to believe that Putin is the greatest threat to mankind and Ukrainians are already on their way to crushing Russia (but just need a little help), why do the actions of the European leaders not match their rhetoric? Never has there been such unanimity of opinion behind supporting one nation; never have they so praised that nation’s ability to fight off the enemy; yet never have they done so little to join the fight in a way that actually matters. This observation should concern us all, given that we now know COVID, January 6. and George Floyd/BLM were all given the same orgy-like media indulgence and led to a much broader harmful agenda. What is that agenda behind the Ukrainian fetish?

Perhaps the answer to these questions is that despite the virtue-signaling, the fight is not really on the ground in Ukraine. After all, if that were true, and the Ukrainians were as effective as they are made out to be, England, France, Germany, and a coalition of central European countries could easily unite and isolate Russia militarily. Clearly, they are trying to use Ukraine to manipulate their own citizens in Western countries to make “sacrifices” – similar to what they did with COVID. In order to prepare us for such sacrifices and make it the “moral thing to do,” they must first play up the Putin situation as they did COVID.

So, what is that sacrifice?

On Wednesday, the House passed H. Res. 956 – “Supporting the People of Ukraine,” which resolves, among other things, to “pledge to support working with Europe and international partners to bolster Europe’s energy security and reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports.” Notice it doesn’t pledge to ramp up energy production, just to reduce dependence on Russian imports. There are two ways of doing that. You can either increase your own supply – but Biden already inhibited energy growth – or you could decrease your consumption.

Remember, for years the globalists have been trying to institute a “green new deal” and destroy our freedom and productivity by replacing energy that works with “green” energy. They used global warming, and then climate change, to scare people into supporting the agenda, but as much as polls show people respond to it, in the deep recesses of their hearts they do not fear the climate.

What COVID taught these same Western oligarchs is that if you make people truly fear something, they will give up all their liberties, including even bodily autonomy. If you make something so virtuous with emotional indulgence on social media and bully and shame people into “protecting the other person,” they will be willing to unquestionably and immediately follow your every whim. What if they are making Putin the new WWII to immediately cut off Russian oil and gas without concurrently ramping up our own production, thereby forcing Western citizens to “make sacrifices” for the greater good? If they locked us down for a few months and successfully got us to cover our breathing holes and take all these shots, who’s to say they couldn’t get us to limit our driving and consumption of other products? And what if they used the carrot and stick – made energy so prohibitively expensive but had all the cronies lined up to incentivize a transition to “green” energy?

It’s not lost on the oligarchs that CO2 levels dropped 26% during the lockdowns. In 2020, fossil fuel consumption was the lowest in 30 years. Don’t you think the Bill Gateses of the world wish to repeat that pleasurable experience? Plus, through the advent of COVID fascism, they remade life with Zoom and acclimated us to living such a new normal without travel, connectivity, and human gatherings. If you don’t think they can’t make Putin such an emergency that would engender another version of this dystopia, you must have slept under a rock since 2020. I’m seeing so many conservatives get swept into the lynch-mob media feeding frenzy over Ukraine – even those who didn’t buy into the COVID lockdown narrative.

I’m not saying this is necessarily the play, but we better make sure it is not. And we certainly can’t assume people will not fall into the trap again. We already have a society now groomed to do what they are told for the “greater good” in a time of “emergency.”

When pondering the mistakes of the past two years, consider the following:

Putin is the new COVID.

Zelenskyy is the new Fauci.

Ukrainian soldiers are the new heroic health care workers.

Cutting off oil from Russia is the new social distancing.

Not using products that consume more energy is the new mask and public shaming.

Green energy is the new vaccine, and their companies are the new Pfizer.

But you know what the new hydroxychloroquine/ivermectin/early treatment is? Ramping up our own energy productivity so we can live in liberty without Russian and Iranian oil, not locking us down in order to fight Russia.

It’s time for Republicans to rectify this mistake they made with COVID. They should have called the bluff of the Western oligarchs from day one. “Well, if defeating COVID is the highest order of man,” Republicans should have asked, “then why not promote, rather than deter, early treatment options?”

With the White House pushing for $10 billion in funding for a tenuous and corrupt Ukrainian regime with no long-term strategic plan or objective, why not ask the following simple question: If we are going to place this funding in the budget, why not also insert provisions in the budget approving pipelines, permitting drilling, and ending the onerous freeze Biden has placed on coal-fired plants, fracking, oil refineries, and nuclear power plants? Why not work with friendly Alberta to get clean oil down the Keystone pipeline?

Republicans have already made it clear they don’t give a hoot about fighting our own border invasion in the budget or rectifying the mistakes they made with COVID fascism. Americans don’t matter. Ukraine is where it’s at. But if Putin is really the number one threat such that they are willing to give it their all, why not demand the GOP energy policy be placed in that same budget or supplemental emergency spending bill on Ukraine?



Why not make American energy production to be the “vaccine” for the “Putin virus” and regulate it with the light touch that we used to regulate Pfizer, not the intensity with which we stifle hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin? What about emergency regulations to approve permitting, drilling, and pipelines without the red tape? At least the oil, unlike the Pfizer shots, doesn’t go into our bodies.

The minute Republicans agree to pass the budget bill next week with the Ukraine funding – without any effort to secure true energy independence and end Biden’s war on American oil and gas – is the day they consign us to whatever plot the oligarchs have hatched.

Horowitz: Why is Kevin McCarthy not speaking out against impending omnibus that destroys his leverage?,"Record excess deaths and illness, record inflation, record supply shortages, record crime, record illegal immigration, a bureaucracy that surveils, spies on, and persecutes political opponents, and a collapsing culture that teaches grooming and racism in school. Never has an incumbent party been this vulnerable headed into a midterm election, and never has an emerging opposition party been granted so much political capital to change course following that election. Yet unless Kevin McCarthy, the presumptive speaker in waiting, uses his robust clout within the party to oppose the impending omnibus bill, the entire leverage and political capital of the midterms will become worthless.

Money (budget bills) talks, congressional hearings walk. House Republicans are salivating to hold hearings on some (but not all) of the aforementioned criminal acts of the Biden administration, but no relief will come to the American people absent the use of the budget process as leverage to force changes in funding and policy on the most contentious issues of our time. Republicans know all too well that any stand-alone messaging bill (much less a mere hearing) will die in the Senate and will not become law. Placing those priorities, however, in budget bills and standing behind them is the only way to force a national debate and brinksmanship over the issues that matter. But that leverage is now hanging by a thread.

In late September, 22 Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, voted for a continuing resolution to fund the government and all its immoral and illegal tyranny until December 16. Rather than filibustering the bill until our grievances are redressed or extending the deadline into next year so that a GOP-controlled House could rewrite the budget, they kicked it until right before Christmas break with the intention of passing an omnibus bill. Unless there is a massive campaign from inside and outside the GOP ranks, Republican senators will cut the legs out from under the new majority by funding Biden’s autocratic government without reforms all the way until fiscal year 2024.

One obvious player in this has been jarringly silent. Kevin McCarthy will likely become the most important Republican in America as the presumed speaker of the House next year. He will fully control the body of government closest to the people and the one that is fully controlled by the majority party. Of all people, he should have been lying down on the tracks in opposition to allowing Democrats to write the budget for the rest of the fiscal year, thereby undercutting his entire leverage to fight any of Biden’s extremely unpopular policies in the budget as soon as he commands the gavel in January. Yet he was stone silent and remains so to this very day. It was only the Freedom Caucus that demanded the budget be extended into early next year with an expiration deadline that would empower the new House majority.

Which begs the obvious question: What is McCarthy’s motivation in becoming speaker, and what exactly does he plan to do? If he fails to publicly call on McConnell to pass a simple CR in December rather than a full-year omnibus, that would be a sign that he views the budget leverage as a liability to be avoided rather than an opportunity – the only legislative opportunity – to bring our two years of grievances to the brink.

If McCarthy were true to his campaign rhetoric, he would demand that McConnell pass a CR until February. Here is how it would play out. As soon as he becomes speaker, he would work on a budget bill for the remainder of FY 2023 for a month. That bill would contain some or all the following provisions:

Prohibiting all funding for Pfizer and Moderna COVID products.

Ban on all bio-medical mandates, with civil and criminal fines for government workers who defy the law.

Prohibiting all funding for granting any release, transportation, or status to illegal aliens crossing the border.

Prohibiting all new funding for Ukraine.

Prohibiting all FBI actions taken against political opponents and severe defunding of most of the agency’s operations.

A complete reversal of the “Inflation Reduction Act,” along with the funding for the 87,000 IRS agents and the climate mandates.

A complete defunding of all mandates and regulations that encumber our energy, food production, and supply.

A complete defunding of all transgender policies in the federal government.

Every day, Republicans would give speeches and do media drawing attention to the devastating consequences of each of the aforementioned policies and why they need to be blocked and defunded. Then they would pass their version of the budget and dare the Senate and White House to decline to sign it in favor of promoting the terrible policies the American people just voted against.

Try to imagine the leverage McCarthy would command during those months. Let’s say Republicans win 52 seats in the Senate, 240 seats in the House, 30 governorships, and a record number of legislative chambers. They will never amass more political capital than at that critical juncture to finally fight for our prerogatives. Yet by remaining silent and allowing McConnell to kick that leverage until late next year, the election mandate will have dissipated. Moreover, with so many people dying from the COVID policies, lives destroyed from the energy and food crises, political opponents literally being rounded up by the FBI, and hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens pouring into the country every single month, we cannot afford to wait any longer.

Yet waiting is exactly what McCarthy wants. He wants to be able to wash his hands of any ability to actually effect change by having McConnell cleanly toss the fight before it begins. That way he can focus on non-must-pass stand-alone legislation that he knows will never go anywhere, along with hearings that will never bring policy changes. Then he will point to all of that amazing work and say, “Look, this is why we need to win the next election and get the presidency, at which point all will be good.”



Except all will not be good. I shudder to think what will become of us in two years from now based on how autocratic this government has become over the past two years.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-kevin-mccarthy-republican-leverage-omnibus,2022-10-19
Horowitz: McConnell helps Dems pass $280 billion Big Tech corporate welfare bill. Schumer betrays him in return.,"Few people in America were following the passage of the $280 billion handout for huge chip manufactures and the 5G industry, but the politics surrounding the bill, as well as the bill itself, perfectly exemplify the “uniparty” dynamic. To begin with, GOP leadership had no problem with this corporate welfare bill and worked together to craft it. However, McConnell promised to hold up the bill unless the Democrats committed to forgoing budget reconciliation, a process through which they can pass liberal priorities without the need for 60 votes. Well, McConnell and 17 other Republican senators eagerly provided the votes for the “chips-plus bill,” and Schumer responded by announcing his plans to pass budget reconciliation to remake our economy!

Leftists love over-taxing and over-regulating certain businesses while granting endless corporate welfare to other industries in order to create transnational monopolies. The semiconductor and 5G industries embody everything conservatives are worried about with the corporate masters – ties to China, privacy concerns, health concerns, outsourcing American jobs, creating monopolies, and funding woke global corporations that hate our values and use the funding as well as the technology against our best interests.

In comes the “chips and science” bill (HR 4346), a $280 billion package for the science and tech cartels that includes $54 billion in five-year grants for manufacturing and design of semiconductors and 5G wireless deployment, plus $24 billion in tax credits for new semiconductor manufacturing facilities through 2026 and funding authorizations to bolster U.S. scientific research. These are some of the wokest and wealthiest companies. Intel, which aggressively lobbied for the bill, already earned $79 billion in revenue last year. Yet 17 Republicans, including Leader McConnell, joined every Democrat sans Bernie Sanders and voted for this earth-shattering and expensive bill with lightning speed.

Even if one agrees there is a need to somehow pick winners and losers, we should have at least secured provisions ensuring that China can’t steal our technology, that the jobs and supply chain remain here in the United States, and that these companies can’t promote wokeness, and we should have addressed oversight issues of privacy and health concerns with 5G. Rather than addressing the insane regulatory burden that has broken our domestic supply chains, this bill will further incentivize and invest in the current globalist system that sells out America to China. Absent large-scale policy reforms, more funding of supposed “American” tech giants is tantamount to funding China. The GOP’s answer to everything we don’t like is to add more spending to it.





To make matters worse, in the final days, the bill added hundreds of pages and hundreds of billions of dollars to fund the broken “science” agencies that should be shuttered. This includes a five-year $102 billion authorization for the National Science Foundation, Commerce Department, and National Institute of Standards and Technology to increase investments, which represents a $52 billion increase in baseline spending of these bloated and unnecessary agencies. It also includes billions of extra funding for “basic energy sciences” and “environmental sciences.” It appears that McConnell and company still “trust the science.”

In other words, even in the minority under a very radical and unpopular Democrat regime, Republicans think that the base spending bills weren’t enough and desire to increase funding for everything that is wrong with government. Republicans will wax poetic today about inflation, yet when it came to the issues that mattered – COVID, Ukraine, and now a massive Big Tech bill – they not only fail to filibuster big budget bills, but they will even vote for new massive spending bills while in the minority. At least in the past they used to be righteous in the minority and screwed conservatives only after winning elections.

Although there are some House Democrats who are at least consistent in their hate for big business and will oppose this corporate welfare, Republicans plan to supply the votes.

This is part of a broader betrayal of passing red-flag laws, flirting with gay marriage, and passing an NDAA funding the woke and broke military that is mandating the shots on soldiers.

To add insult to injury, McConnell originally promised that if Democrats didn’t give up on plans to pass budget reconciliation, he would block passage of the chips bill. A budget reconciliation bill is the only maneuver by which Democrats could attempt to ram through a transcendent policy change without facing a filibuster, assuming they keep every Democrat senator in line. Yet McConnell then votes for the bill, and within hours of its passage yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced plans to pursue a reconciliation resolution.

After months of a stalemate with Senator Joe Manchin, Schumer announced plans to pass a $370 billion “climate and energy” bill, funding the Great Reset, three years of subsidies for the health care cartel under Obamacare, and more handouts for Big Pharma. They are calling it “the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” because it purports to pay for the spending with tax increases, and somehow that would reduce inflation.

Thus, when Democrats pass that bill next week and all these same McConnell Republicans vote against it, just know that McConnell gave up his leverage and is responsible for that massive tax-and-spend giveaway to woke industries because he agreed to pass another massive corporate welfare bill. Nor do they have any plans to hold up the NDAA or the fiscal year 2023 budget bill when it comes due at the end of September.

But fear not. Spend the next few months campaigning for this same party so that none other than a Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is waiting for you as the reward for your hard work.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnell-schumer-reconciliation-bill,2022-07-28
Horowitz: McConnell’s omnibus betrayal demonstrates the Senate was lost from day one,"For those feeling bad that Republicans didn’t win the Senate, you will now understand that Democrats already enjoyed supermajority control of the chamber, including command of the GOP leader himself. Every GOP Senate leader from McConnell on down has agreed to codify nearly every one of Biden’s spending priorities and affirm every single unconstitutional, harmful, and tyrannical policy for the entire remainder of the fiscal year, thereby sabotaging the leverage of the incoming GOP House majority.



What is scary about the past couple of weeks of budgetary negotiations is that even as Republicans and Democrats disagreed, they really agreed on 99% of the budget and 100% of the policies. They merely fake-jousted over $26 billion in broad generalized spending out of a $1.7 trillion budget. Essentially, both sides agreed to write the military a blank check of $858 billion for its woke and aimless policies. The only disagreement was that Republicans wanted to spend the same level as Biden on non-defense spending – $787 billion, while Democrats wanted to spend $813 billion. In other words, they were arguing over 1.5% of the discretionary spending budget.

So how did they solve the “impasse”? Democrat Pat Leahy and Republican Richard Shelby – both senators who will no longer be in the chamber for the remainder of the fiscal year – announced they would drop an omnibus bill in the coming days, while passing a seven-day stopgap bill so they can pass the omnibus next week. The top-line non-defense spending numbers will be somewhere in between $787 billion and $813, but they are keeping them quiet so members can’t complain!

This is the great suspense – the exact decimal point of a spending increase. Republicans like Biden’s budget top-line, which is 8% above last year’s levels for non-defense spending; Democrats wanted slightly more, and they split the baby. This perfectly encapsulates the uniparty.

Here we have a government that is spying on the American people, criminalizing political opposition and free speech, mutilating our kids, funding pharma’s biomedical security state on our bodies, working with the cartels to invade our country, handing our inheritance to Ukraine, and choking off our energy during an energy crisis. Republicans are content with all of that and are even fine with blocking Republicans in the House from dealing with these crises until next year. For example, our government is paying Pfizer yet another $2 billion for its COVID drug, for which there is no independent study showing it’s safe and effective. All they are fighting over is a few billion in extra general spending, when the malfeasance agencies being funded are already flush with cash even under the Republican proposal.

Hearings in the House can be meaningful if they serve as the hammer driving into the anvil of a budget deadline in which Republicans will defund the policies that are found to be harmful and unlawful in the hearings. Senate Republicans have taken that off the table for a full year. Just consider the border invasion issue alone. The Biden administration is preparing for up to 14,000 illegal aliens a day, which is an annualized flow of 5.1 million! The president will have no budget bill hanging over his neck to keep him in check.

On Wednesday, Rep. Chip Roy asked the Rules Committee to consider his stopgap bill that would fund government until Feb. 3. It was rejected. That should have triggered automatic Senate GOP opposition to the budget deal, but of course Senate Republicans have a lot more in common with their Democrat colleagues than they do with their voters.

The final bill will contain extra Ukraine funding because both sides agree to this insanity. McConnell said on Tuesday, unfortunately with merit, that “continuing support for Ukraine is the popular mainstream view that stretches across the ideological spectrum.” This is on top of the $60 billion – all without any oversight whatsoever despite everything we now know about the money pit. This, at a time when the public share of the debt is almost 100% of GDP, up from 35% in 2007, when we thought George W. Bush was a big spender.

Republicans balked at extra spending on COVID (beyond the unfathomable amounts already baked into the base budget), but only because they felt there were existing accounts that were unspent, not because the COVID agenda is killing us and needs to be banned.



Thus, the entire funding for this fiscal year and all the policies it encompasses were set in motion by a number of retiring senators, led by Richard Shelby (RINO-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee.

Interestingly enough, Democrats only have a two-vote majority in the House, due to recent vacancies. Yet nobody seems concerned that they will lose a single vote on a contentious issue like the omnibus. Why is it that only one “side” of the uniparty is always united?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnells-omnibus-betrayal-demonstrates-the-senate-was-lost-from-day-one,2022-12-15
Horowitz: McConnell’s shocking betrayal of the midterm mandate,"Americans could literally be drowning in a morass of a physical, cultural, and economic flood, but McConnell and the GOP elites would toss the last remaining lifeline to Ukraine. Not only are Americans placed last, they simply don’t matter to American politicians in both parties.



We are facing the nightmare scenario in which our own government is an enemy of the people. Our government officials orchestrate a cartel invasion of the country with millions crossing our border. They induce one life-altering catastrophic policy after another from COVID, attack our energy and food, groom a generation of children with gender-bending, and genetically engineer Americans like pieces of software. To top it off, they are unleashing 87,000 IRS agents upon us and sending the FBI to persecute political opponents. Yet not only won’t Senate Republicans hold up the budget bill until these grievances are redressed through defunding mechanisms and policy changes, they are actually adding new funding for Ukraine – the catalyst for the energy crisis – and more resettlement of unvetted Afghan refugees.

In other words, the only anomalous policy provisions added to what was supposed to be a stopgap bill pertain to spending money on foreigners, not Americans. To add insult to injury, they are strategically timing the expiration of the CR for Dec.16 during the lame-duck session, so that the defeated members can lock in an entire year of spending and possibly tack on transformational policies, undercutting the leverage of a future Republican Congress.

Typically, a stopgap bill places spending levels on autopilot unless it is peppered with “anomalies” to address specific expenditures. It appears that the only anomalies in this bill are for foreign entities. The bill provides an additional $12.3 billion in spending for Ukraine, with no understanding of what we are getting for our investment aside from an energy crisis. American taxpayers have become Zelenskyy’s private piggy bank. And Congress is doing this at a time when the Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged. Don’t our leaders want any answers as to who was involved before we send a blank check to that part of the world?

Then there are the Afghan refugees. The bill allows a $3 billion transfer for the State Department to resettle more Afghans. Both the DOD and DHS inspector generals have identified known terrorists who have been evacuated to the U.S. When questioned by the IG’s office, CBP officials rebuffed the request to “immediately” identify all the Afghans in the U.S., provide proper proof of vetting, and then develop a contingency plan for vetting in future emergency evacuations.

Specifically, the DOD IG’s report stated that they “could not locate some Afghan evacuees when attempting to report derogatory information to the DoD and U.S. government agencies supporting CONUS [Continental United States] safe havens.""



How could Republicans sign off on even more funding for refugees without demanding policy changes on security? Sure, the bill does throw $15 million at the FBI for vetting, but fails to specify a plan to do that. One has to wonder if that funding will go toward surveilling political enemies.

Here is the list of the 22 Republicans, including McConnell, who voted for cloture on Tuesday:

Blunt, Roy (Mo.)

Boozman (Ark.)

Capito (W. Va.)

Cassidy (La.)

Collins, S. (Maine)

Cornyn (Texas)

Cotton (Ark.)

Ernst (Iowa)

Graham (S.C.)

Grassley (Iowa)

Hyde-Smith (Miss.)

Kennedy (La.)

McConnell (Ky.)

Moran (Kan.)

Murkowski (Alaska)

Portman (Ohio)

Romney (Utah)

Shelby (Ala.)

Sullivan (Alaska)

Tillis (N.C.)

Wicker (Miss.)

Young, T. (Ind.)

What is shocking is how Republicans wouldn’t even fight against the hiring of IRS agents, which is probably the most unpopular policy of the Biden administration. They are instead touting a stand-alone bill they plan to introduce next year that will transfer funding from the new IRS agents to border security. But absent a plan to fight for this in the actual budget bill, it is nothing but a distraction. Kevin McCarthy hasn’t even joined the Freedom Caucus in calling for the budget bill to expire early next year so that a House GOP majority can rewrite the budget for the remainder of the fiscal year.

So, what will change next year? Perhaps someone can convince Mitch McConnell to send the IRS and FBI agents to Ukraine and spare us the persecution. After all, if he won’t do it for the sake of American rights, maybe the allure of fighting for Ukraine will make him do the right thing for the wrong reason.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnells-shocking-betrayal-of-the-midterm-mandate,2022-09-29
Horowitz: McConnell’s ‘wartime’ COVID investments come home to roost,"“Bidenflation” existed before he staggered into office on January 20, 2021. It was catalyzed when nearly every Republican supported the worst piece of legislation in American history on March 25, 2020, which set off a cascade of several other pieces of legislation underwriting, incentivizing, and consummating COVID lockdowns. The chief cheerleader of the bill at the time was none other than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the man whom Republicans are pining to see become floor leader once again next year to solve the inflation crisis. But in order to solve it, don’t we need to first acknowledge the cause and who was responsible?



Last week, Sen. Mitch McConnell tossed out the same tired bromide about Biden causing inflation with his $1.9 trillion reckless spending “on party line” last year.

What he forgets to tell you is that the bulk of the unfathomable levels of spending came from the worst legislation in American history: the $2.2 trillion COVID lockdown/Big Pharma bill that he ardently pushed for in March 2020, which at the time, represented half of the entire federal budget! That bill led to a cascading effect of unconscionable spending and tyranny that, between Congress and the Federal Reserve, unleashed more than $10 trillion on the economy.

At the time, McConnell praised it as “a wartime level of investment into our nation.” “The men and women of the greatest country on Earth are going to defeat this coronavirus and reclaim our future,"" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when announcing the deal that morning. ""The Senate's going to make sure that they have the ammunition they need to do it.""

Except, it wasn’t a wartime investment in production, it was an investment in lockdown, paying people not to work, imposing tyranny, and inducing a vicious cycle of Big Pharma failure that perpetuated both the pandemic and the economic misery. Milton Friedman famously described inflation as the result of ""too much money chasing too few goods.” Never was there a time in history when Congress voted to spend so much money to simultaneously shut down production and make goods scarce while lining the pockets of individuals and corporations with endless cash. As the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank conceded in March when groping in the dark for the culprit of the history inflation, “In seeking an explanation, we turn to the combination of direct fiscal support introduced to counteract the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.""

Because of the terrible COVID policies Republicans still refuse to acknowledge, the federal reserve went on such a bond buying spree that it literally increased the money supply by 40% and did this all while the same policies were shrinking output.

Hence, a lot of money suddenly chasing diminishing quantities of products.

What’s worse, these same Republicans then immediately jumped on the bandwagon of the “next current thing” by criticizing Biden for not giving enough money to Ukraine. It wasn’t just the over $50 billion we sent there without an understanding of the outcome we hoped to achieve, but it perpetuated a war and sanctions that are crushing supply chains, which further exacerbates the inflation. McConnell famously said in May that “the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine.”

Hence, McConnell carping about inflation now is akin to the arsonist lamenting the heat of the fire and dressing up as the firefighter. Obviously, Biden has done things on the regulatory side and through exacerbating the war on fossil fuels that aggravated this crisis, particularly as it relates to energy. But the foundation for this crisis was set in stone with the bills shepherded by McConnell when he was in the majority. And that date was not January 2021, but March 2020, when Republicans controlled two of the three branches.









Since March 2020, the gross debt has increased by over $7 trillion. It took from George Washington’s day to the first half of 2004 to accrue our first $7 trillion in debt. What is particularly jarring is that $6.5 trillion of that increase is composed of the “public debt,” not the “intragovernmental debt,” which we supposedly owe ourselves (most prominently the Social Security Trust Fund).

Which brings us back to the GOP senators and congressmen. Which programs would they cut or devolve to the state? What exactly would they do to combat the inflation and what systemic governmental reforms will they push that would address the enormity of the crisis? Combatting “waste, fraud, and abuse” or eliminating “pork” won’t cut it.

At least in 2010 during the Tea Party era, they claimed to oppose spending and then betrayed their promise. Today, they are not even acknowledging the issue of our time that caused the inflation. As such, how are we to believe anything would change on the other side of an auspicious election result?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnells-wartime-covid-investments-come-home-to-roost,2022-07-19
Horowitz: More VAERS-reported vaccine deaths in our military than COVID deaths,"Both political parties are salivating to draw our military into the Russia-Ukraine war, but neither of them seems to care about what our own leaders have done to these soldiers.

It is now abundantly clear from numerous data points that the shots have caused unimaginable injury among the general population. Military doctors have come forward to show the enormity of this damage in the military, yet the military has chosen to cover it up and tamper with their own health surveillance data in order to conceal the magnitude of the injury. Meanwhile, new data presented in a Florida federal court on behalf of a Navy SEAL demonstrates that, at a minimum, more people died from the shot than from COVID.

On March 10, attorney Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel presented data in court showing 127 VAERS-reported COVID vaccine-related deaths in the military in 2021. That is more than the 93 reported COVID deaths in the military since the beginning of the pandemic. And keep in mind, COVID deaths tend to be overestimated, while VAERS-reported deaths, especially in the military, are underreported. Even CDC researchers recently conceded that “the actual rates of myocarditis per million doses of vaccine are likely higher than estimated” by VAERS reports.

The military VAERS data was initially discovered by Dr. Jessica Rose, a biologist and mathematician who has likely published more information on VAERS than anyone in the world. VAERS has a box to check for those in the military to select upon submission, and she counted 127 reported deaths stemming from service members in 2021.

This safety signal from the universal reporting system is the most significant evidence to date that the DMED (Defense Medical Epidemiology Data) specifically monitoring the military, as originally presented by the whistleblowers, was correct when it showed a massive surge in injuries ranging from neurological and cardio to cancers and immune disorders. According to the military, though, the 2016-2020 baseline used by the whistleblowers was plagued by a glitch just at the time these military doctors pulled the information (not before and not after!) and the numbers for those years were always as high as those in 2021. The problem is that the VAERS data, by definition, indicate that 2021 had to have experienced a surge in injuries. It’s just a question of how much. Here is the VAERS data for vaccine-related hospitalizations in 2021 compared to previous years.

Again, with VAERS being woefully underreported, especially in the military with so much pressure against speaking ill of the injections, it makes sense that the diagnosis codes in DMED would be exponentially higher. Given the unprecedented vaccine injuries that we already have seen in the civilian world, and as indicated by the VAERS death and hospitalization data, it would make sense that there was a 37% increase in military hospitalizations in 2021 over the five-year average, as presented by the whistleblowers in the court case.

Here is the data from the whistleblowers as presented by attorney Tom Renz to Senator Ron Johnson showing a 37% increase with two months of 2021 still not reported. If the numbers for November and December followed the same trajectory, it would show a 55% increase in military hospitalizations for 2021 over the five-year average.

Now, here is the data the DOD is showing after fixing the alleged “glitch,” which now reveals no baseline increase whatsoever.

If you extrapolate the numbers for a full 12-month period, it would show a 2% decrease in hospitalizations over the five-year average. So the military would have us believe that not only did the baseline degree of vaccine injury we already know occurred in the civilian world not exist in the military, but they are essentially saying that COVID itself never made an appearance! Here we have the military expelling soldiers for not getting a shot for a virus they claim, based on their “new” data, never touched the health of the service members.

Until the Florida court hearing, Pentagon officials have not publicly issued a statement of narrative on how they claim their data glitched and why only for certain convenient categories and only for a period of time. They merely offered a few on-the-record sentences to PolitiFact. Thanks to Judge Douglas Merryday’s injunction on the vaccine mandate in Navy SEAL 1 vs. Austin, we will finally obtain discovery of the facts. However, the DOD is still dragging its feet. Officials failed to send a single doctor or representative from the military to testify in court.



Meanwhile, the plaintiffs called three military flight surgeons, Lt. Col. Peter Chambers, Lt. Col. Teresa Long, and Col. (Ret.) Stewart Tankersley, to the stand to discuss their experience treating mass vaccine injury in the military. When Liberty Counsel’s Mat Staver asked Lt. Col. Long a question about the DMED, she said, “I have been ordered not to answer that question.” Judge Merryday immediately asked, “Ordered by who?” She then testified that the night before, she was told by her commanders not to testify, which is likely a violation of the Whistleblower Act and constitutes tampering with the witness. Here is the report of the hearing from Liberty Counsel:

Staver then asked Dr. Long if the information the military ordered her not to testify to was relevant and important to the court and the public. She said, “Yes.” Staver then asked, “Why?”



Dr. Long paused, held back tears, looked at the judge and said, “I have so many soldiers being destroyed by this vaccine. Not a single member of my senior command has discussed my concerns with me. ... I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by talking about it. I’m OK with that because I am watching people get absolutely destroyed.”



Dr. Long said she is inundated morning, noon and night regarding people who have been injured by taking the COVID shots. Those injured are “predominantly pilots, and pilots have to meet one of the highest fitness standards.”



She also said she is aware of at least two people who committed suicide under pressure to get the shots and threat of punishment for refusal.



Dr. Long also testified that based on the VAERS database, deaths of military members from the vaccines exceed deaths from COVID itself.

The military’s only response was to send a Word document to their lawyer (with no letterhead or signature) explaining the “glitch” in the data. However, the statement of narrative raises more questions than it answers. Officials claim that “not all DMED queries were affected by the corrupt data.” Also, the corruption was only from August 2021 to January 29, 2022. Those were the dates that they knew the flight surgeons were pulling the data. Plus, it was only for 2016-2020, an arbitrary baseline pulled by the whistleblowers. In other words, the glitch was only for the categories and for the time period that they needed it to be glitched – nothing more, nothing less!

How much longer will Congress ignore the Watergate of the military?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-more-vaers-reported-vaccine-deaths-in-our-military-than-covid-deaths,2022-03-21
Horowitz: New gov’t watchdog report accuses DHS of settling Afghans with no vetting,"It sure seems like Novak Djokovic is the only one in the world not welcome in this country. Everyone else is fair game.

There is no right for a foreign national to immigrate to the U.S. as there is for an American to remain here unmonitored by the government. As such, it’s government’s responsibility to vet foreign nationals who seek entry, not to vet the political opinions of American opponents of the current president. Yet our government and national security apparatus have it completely backward. They spend all their resources focusing on targeting conservatives as the number-one threat to homeland security, while waving in tens of thousands of people from the most dangerous and radical parts of the world without proper verification, according to a new government watchdog report.

Remember the 80,000 Afghans the Biden administration resettled last summer? According to a new report from the DHS inspector general, U.S. Customs and Border Protection lacked “critical data” needed to properly screen these people coming from a source country of radical Islamic extremism. What sort of critical data?

We determined some information used to vet evacuees through U.S. Government databases, such as name, date of birth, identification number, and travel document data, was inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. We also determined CBP admitted or paroled evacuees who were not fully vetted into the United States.

Oh! So as Biden’s DHS focuses solely on “extremism” of domestic political adversaries as the number-one homeland security threat, officials have no problem admitting thousands of people from a country steeped in honor killings, sharia supremacism, and subjugation of women, as well as actual kinetic terrorist activities.

Even more shocking was the fact that when the IG’s office asked CBP for a list of those admitted or paroled for whom they lacked proper data (or even screening), officials conceded that no such list exists. In other words, they disappeared into the population. “As a result, DHS may have admitted or paroled individuals into the United States who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities,” concluded the IG’s report, released on Tuesday.

As always, the report offered CBP the obvious recommendation to “immediately” identify all the Afghans in the U.S., provide proper proof of vetting, and then develop a contingency plan for vetting in future emergency evacuations.

Pretty non-controversial recommendations, right? I mean, we can offer excuses about the chaos and time constraints endemic in the Biden administration’s refugee plan, but a year later, this should be the DHS’ top priority, right? Wrong!

“The report does not reflect the interagency nature of the vetting process, despite significant efforts and multiple attempts by DHS program officials, subject matter experts, and others to provide the OIG a comprehensive understanding of the extensive details related to the numerous facts and nuances of the unprecedented OAW vetting process,” wrote DHS official Jim Crumpacker in response to the IG’s recommendations.

I guess that settles that. It’s just simply too complicated to protect Americans from external threats. Yet somehow, it’s safe to say they don’t have a problem with interagency nuances when “vetting” American political opponents.

The DHS also asserts that it did indeed screen all the refugees (yes, perhaps enough to ensure they are not Trump supporters!). The problem is they failed to produce any of the supporting documents to the IG. Moreover, in February, the DOD inspector general released a report identifying at least 50 Afghans who pose ""potentially significant security concerns."" The reported noted that dozens of them who had ""derogatory information"" that would make them ineligible for parole were unable to be located.

What sort of derogatory information? We’re not even talking about those who believe women are chattel and infidels should be subjugated. That is likely a massive percentage of them. We are talking about concerns that “include individuals whose latent fingerprints have been found on improvised explosive devices and known or suspected terrorists and for which the NGIC sends derogatory information notifications to appropriate DoD personnel."" At the time of the report, only three of those individuals had been located.

Then again, perhaps our government is correct in asserting that these people had been vetted. It’s all a matter of what they find to be a threat and what they are looking for.

Ironically, nearly every prominent Republican supported this massive Afghan evacuation. These are the same neo-conservatives who believe we need to “fight them there so they don’t come here,” but the only way they can come here is if we bring them here. Then they feel guilty because we indeed are there fomenting more civil wars and creating unrest, and they feel responsible to bring all those people to our shores!

Importantly, this is only the opening act. The Biden administration’s modus operandi is to bring in huge numbers of people from any part of the world facing a war or disaster. Officials are planning to resettle 125,000 additional refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2023. Over 100,000 Ukrainians are expected to be admitted into the United States. Despite not being designated as official refugees, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, passed by Congress in May, makes the parolees eligible for refugee resettlement programs. So when the DHS says officials have no plans to create a contingency plan for vetting, it will be relevant every year during the next “current thing” that turns into a geopolitical emergency.



Then, of course, there is our own border. So far this fiscal year, there have been over 2 million encounters, over 500,000 gotaways, and over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl discovered. The degree of security risk all of this collectively poses is unimaginable, yet our government will continue to focus solely on we the people.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-new-govt-watchdog-report-accuses-dhs-of-settling-afghans-with-no-vetting,2022-09-12
Horowitz: NOAA fires unjabbed ‘hurricane hunters’ despite court injunction,"Republicans care only about Ukraine and act as if COVID fascism is over, but the reality is that the lives of many Americans are being destroyed because of the continued immoral Pfizer passport mandate on the military and government workers. Republicans used the fact that recent court orders have enjoined some of the mandates as an excuse for not fighting them in the upcoming omnibus bill; however, a source inside the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tells Blaze Media that highly technical hurricane scientists are being fired this week with little time left to replace these unique scientists. This person spoke to TheBlaze anonymously because she is not authorized to speak to the media.

To begin with, all federal workers without the jabs are still being subjected to harassment, discrimination, and a weekly testing requirement regardless of their prior infection status, and despite the fact that vaccinated individuals have higher case rates. Now, despite the fact that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to remove the injunction on the direct injection mandate on the federal workplace, workers for NOAA are being terminated this week.

The veteran scientist for NOAA provided TheBlaze with a copy of one termination notice of a hurricane hunter. The source has told TheBlaze that at least four individuals have received this letter.

The letter makes it clear that the employee was terminated for “failure to follow supervisory instruction” in getting the shots. Even though the employee submitted a copy of the appeals court decision, the supervisor uses the excuse of the subordinate not following orders as pretext for the termination. “I find that the instruction become [sic] vaccinated was clear with an established due date, and you had a duty to follow this instruction, and failed to do so,” wrote the supervisor in the notice of proposed removal. “This directly undermines the good order and morale of the workforce; I must have faith and confidence that you will follow instructions issued to you.” The termination was effective Monday.

The fact that some government agencies feel they can continue the illegal mandates underscores just how much destruction these policies continue to cause, despite the focus on Ukraine (as if COVID tyranny is over). The workers who were terminated were all highly qualified professionals who fly on a P3 aircraft during hurricane surveillance missions, including pilots, navigators, meteorologists, and engineers. Just how rare are these people? “The person who shared their termination information with me said that they had to open his job advertisement four times before he was hired because they were not getting qualified candidates,” said the source within the organization. “Not only do you have to have the experience/degree requirements, but you need to pass an FAA Aerospace Medical Physical, AND of course you need to be willing to fly through a hurricane. These are very specialized positions.”

The fired employees work for the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Lakeland, Florida, which is run by the NOAA Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO). AOC runs nine aircraft, but three are the designated ""hurricane hunters"" – two Lockheed WP-3D Orions and one Gulfstream IV-SP . The other aircraft are primarily used for environmental monitoring.

My source within the agency warns that it takes months to find replacements for these jobs and once the new employees are onboarded, fully training them will take two years. “Of the engineering group at the AOC, for example, there are only eight total employees: chief engineer, deputy chief, three aerospace engineers, and three electronics engineers. Two of the three electronics engineers are being terminated. How can the AOC fly successful hurricane hunter missions if 2/3 of the electronics engineers are terminated, and it can take FOUR job advertisements just to get ONE position filled?”



The veteran NOAA scientist further expressed concern that the loss of skilled and experienced employees responsible for collecting “measurements from hurricane hunter missions to get critical data into computer models to predict hurricane intensity, movement, and inland impacts such as rainfall, tornado potential, and winds will jeopardize public safety, plain and simple.”

“If there are staffing shortages, hurricane prediction will suffer, whether NOAA admits it or not,” she added. “If NOAA says that these terminations won't affect the mission, that's flat-out wrong, and they are relying on the strong work ethic of those left behind (NOAA scientists are incredibly dedicated) to pick up the pieces. This means remaining employees will be required to work additional hours under additional stress to fulfill the mission, jeopardizing their safety and the quality of their work.”

NOAA’s AOC human resources seems to be relying on a separate federal regulation under 5 CFR § 339.205, which potentially gives them the power to mandate vaccines on federal workers, which is not part of the current litigation, even though the spirit of the court injunction should still apply. Indeed, in a new job posting from AOC in Lakeland, the office makes it clear that the current mandate is unenforceable as long as the injunction is in place.

What is particularly absurd is that these same people were going on mission flights together throughout the pandemic. To suddenly require this outdated shot when the government has essentially declared the pandemic over reeks of political posturing rather than any regard for public health.

Two years after the infamous two weeks to flatten the curve, we are still suffering the damage of policies that flattened the workforce, economy, and health of so many Americans.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-noaa-fires-unjabbed-hurricane-hunters-despite-court-injunction,2022-03-08
Horowitz: Not so fast: 10 COVID biomedical fights that are still not over,"Many commentators have noted that the Biden administration and the media are using Ukraine as the seamless off-ramp from COVID fascism. However, it is quite evident that they are not exiting the road to bio-medical tyranny but are merely driving in a tunnel – out of sight from the majority of people but still inexorably headed toward tyranny.

Republicans are just as eager as Democrats to let this issue go. However, it is far from over. And I’m not just talking about seeking revenge, justice, and a Nuremberg 2.0-style event to punish those who are responsible for the deaths of countless people and for suspending democracy. Here are 10 ramifications of our government’s response to COVID that are STILL with us today. Democrats artfully got rid of the broad mandates that affect families every day, such as school masking. They can’t afford to head into the election alienating everyone with children in school. But individuals still suffering in smaller numbers? There are no signs of relief.

1. Military Mandate

To this day, soldiers are being kicked out of the military for a shot that is expired, causes a shocking amount of injury and death, and never stopped transmission even when it worked a little. There have been some court injunctions for part of the military mandate, but the requirement is largely intact. Moreover, if the mandate is not removed, it will likely affect an entire generation of children who rightfully chose not to get the shots. None of them will be eligible for military service. Given all the shocking information that has come out about the safety and efficacy of the shots in recent days, it is appalling that Republicans wouldn’t engage in a budget fight ahead of the March 11 deadline and demand a termination of the military mandate.

2. Health care worker mandate

Even the U.K. got rid of its health care mandate. Yet American health care workers are still being fired for not getting this dangerous shot for a virus most of them already got and for a variant that seems to have more of an affinity to infect those with the shot! Even those already forced into getting the shots are now being asked to get boosters! This is coming at a time of a severe shortage of health care workers. Medscape, the leading medical profession media, has finally admitted, “Antibodies derived from natural COVID infection are more abundant and at least 10x more potent than immunity generated by vaccination alone.” Yet those with natural immunity are being fired and those with the shots are told to come to work with COVID! Again, how can Republicans let this continue for even a day? Florida and Tennessee are the only states to have passed laws fining health care agencies for not accepting religious or medical exemptions.

3. Pushing the shots on babies and toddlers

Children under 5 are the final frontier of Americans untainted by this bioweapon. We already know from a New York State study that there is no possible benefit because the authors admit the shots have negative efficacy after six weeks for 5- to 11-year-olds. They cause a tremendous amount of injury and there is zero benefit. How can Pfizer be allowed to seek authorization for the shots? States must promise to block any distribution of these shots.

4. Masks on planes and in doctor’s offices

Even though masks have been thoroughly debunked as a tool for viral source control, the criminalization of human breathing on airplanes continues. Moreover, every hospital in every state is still requiring it on patients in duress from injury, physical illness, or even Alzheimer’s patients. The inhumane treatment is still in full force.

5. Genocidal blocking of treatment

Ironically, COVID is not over and we don’t know what is coming next. There are actually more recorded deaths today than there were when the mandates began. The same people who destroyed our lives for COVID now want to walk away from it while still leaving people without proper treatment options. Very few states have passed bills protecting doctors prescribing off-label drugs, and not a single state has passed a bill requiring hospitals to allow right to try or to ensure that pharmacies stop blocking prescriptions. In other words, we still don’t have medical freedom in this country.

6. Remdesivir must be pulled

It is appalling that remdesivir is still the standard of care in hospitals. States must move to immediately pull this toxic drug.

7. Patient Bill of Rights

Patients are being denied visitation from family members. Dr. Molly James, an ICU doctor who treated COVID from day one, reports that she has patients who are being denied visitation by their spouses because the hospital believes they are slipping them ivermectin. Yes, they are actually upset the patient is getting better! Every state legislature must pass an emergency bill requiring hospitals to allow visitors, allow patients to decline treatment, the right to access treatment, prevent hospitals from confiscating existing prescriptions and vitamins, and criminalize “medical kidnapping,” whereby they prevent a patient from being released or transferred.

8. Denial of organ transplants

People in need of organ transplants might not constitute a massive share of the electorate, but their lives still matter. To this day, they are being denied transplants on account of not getting a dangerous shot that fails to stimulate immunity for their health status, even if they already have natural immunity. How a single Republican-controlled state can allow this to continue for another day is barbaric.

9. Treatment for vaccine injury

Even if we look at the most conservative estimates of vaccine injury, given the fact that most adults in the entire country were given at least one dose, that means there are a ton of people in need of help. Pfizer’s court-released documents now reveal the company knew about thousands of categories of adverse events. Yet, because of the censorship, scientists can’t even publish papers on how to identify, diagnose, and treat injury. These people are in need of help, and it is disgusting to walk away from this travesty as if nothing happened. The government owes reparations to those people for the violation of the principles of informed consent. Moreover, states must establish injury-reporting centers, encourage doctors to treat patients, and welcome medical academics to promote their research diagnosing vaccine injury. And yes, the people behind the vaccine corruption need to be held accountable.

10. A complete audit of the injections

At this point, given everything we know (and still don’t know), it’s no longer OK to just oppose mandates. We need a full audit in every state of everything that is wrong with the vaccines. Unless there is something we are all missing, they need to be immediately pulled from the market. Absent such a movement, they will quietly be pushed by the government and medical establishment for months to come. Moreover, they are working on dozens of new mRNA vaccines that need an entire new sphere of oversight at the state level now that the FDA is compromised. Even for coronavirus, Biden is promising to deploy a new vaccine within 100 days. This model of “emergency” cutting corners on research, development, and trials is the “new normal” if we don’t stop it.

The March 11 deadline for Congress to pass the final omnibus bill funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year is the last point of leverage to force resolution of these issues. Madison referred to the power of the purse as “the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance.” We already know that the number one issue on the minds of perfidious Republicans is endless funding for Ukraine. Is it possible that they can muster up the same level of passion to redress a single one of these civilization-changing grievances from their own citizens?

Horowitz: One of the most powerful Republicans supports expanding funding for FBI J6 witch hunt,"Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) is a top appropriator and is likely going to be the Rules Committee chairman of the next Congress. In other words, he will control the flow to the floor for every bill and has a big say in in the entire budget process. He is also a man who believes we are not spending enough money on Fourth Reich agenda items, including the persecution of Trump supporters on January 6 – and beyond.

No Republican can feign ignorance about the truth of January 6 nearly two years later. It’s not that not a single authentic Trump supporter did anything wrong on that day. But it is abundantly clear that elements of the government had forewarning, there was robust FBI involvement in provoking it, people are being persecuted for peacefully protesting or merely being in the Capitol peacefully, and even the few who engaged in some degree of crime are being punished so disproportionately that if the standard were applied to BLM, there would be 1 million people in jail pretrial indefinitely.

As such, this inquisition needs to be shut down, especially now that we know from whistleblowers that investigators are planning to expand the investigation to anyone supporting the protest who wasn’t even at the Capitol.

Yet the DOJ is now asking Congress for even more funding in the upcoming fiscal year, according to NBC.

The Justice Department has called Jan. 6 “the most wide-ranging investigation” in its history, with more than 870 arrests so far. For 21 months, the investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, has largely been propped up with help from 93 federal prosecutors' offices from across the country who are volunteering personnel.

Even if you don’t believe the FBI and informants like Ray Epps created a setup and you do believe that somehow this was a legitimate attack, how in the world are there more than 870 people to rope in when most of those 870, at worst, simply walked into a public building or committed a misdemeanor? Yet shockingly, one of the most powerful Republicans is open to giving the bureau more money to investigate people who clearly did nothing wrong or might not even have been in the Capitol.

Some Republicans are open to it. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior GOP appropriator who objected to certifying the election results after the Jan. 6 attack, said he’s open to authorizing more money for the investigation.



“Those people ought to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I don’t have any problem giving the Justice Department the resources it needs to do that,” he said. “I don’t have any problem spending extra money to make sure that anybody that broke into this building is brought to justice.”



More money has already been spent on prosecution than on the damage to the bricks of the building by an exponential factor! Where is the call from Tom Cole to spend money investigating BLM rioters, including thousands upon thousands of people who committed violent crimes, often for weeks on end, including setting up autonomous zones in middle of cities? There was an estimated $2 billion in insurance claims from those riots. What about the hundreds of private businesses that were burned to the ground? Don’t they deserve justice? Then again, even those who attacked police officers were not punished with jail time, while people who put their feet on Pelosi’s desk sit in the gulag pretrial for two years. Meanwhile, judges are now preventing law-and-order prosecutors from pursuing cases against the most violent BLM thugs who surrounded motorists and smashed car windows on highways.

So what exactly would be funded by people like Tom Cole with an expanded investigation? Thanks to FBI Special Agent Steve Friend coming to Senator Grassley as a whistleblower, we know it won’t even be used for January 6. “ FBI domestic terrorism cases are being opened on innocent American citizens who were nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, based on anonymous tips to an FBI hotline or from Facebook spying on their messages,” reports the New York Post, based on Friend’s complaint. “These tips are turned into investigative tools called ‘guardians,’ after the FBI software that collates them.”



Thus, Cole and the other RINOs literally want to fund the dissolution of the foundation of democracy. And he will essentially be the next chairman of all the chairmen in the upcoming Congress.

Tom Cole exemplifies the GOP old bull leaders who will largely run the GOP-controlled House … into the ground. They accept all the premises of the Left on the major issues of our time – be it political persecution, COVID, or Ukraine. This is why they are in a rush to give Democrats everything they want in the omnibus bill before January rather than extending the stopgap bill into next year so that their own leaders will be able to write the budget and defund tyranny.

But then he turns around and uses broad bromides that the base wants to hear to project the image of a conservative.

However, how does Cole plan to fulfill his promise of fighting on the border or inflation (caused by Cole’s years of big government spending) if he refuses to deny funding to Democrat policies in the budget? Cole has made it clear that without control of 60 seats in the Senate and the presidency, Republicans can’t do anything. In response to calls from Rep. Chip Roy to use the budget bills and debt ceiling to fight for lower spending to reduce inflation, Cole recently told Politico that it’s dead on arrival.

But Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a veteran appropriator, offered conservatives a reality check in advance.



Even with a House majority, “the president is still the president,” Cole said, and “the filibuster is still there” in the Senate.



Cole added that his fiscal-hawk colleagues “don’t vote for the bills anyway, so they’ve sort of dealt themselves out of the game. ... They ask for things that are impossible to achieve in a process that has to be bipartisan.”



However, this is only true for legislation where you need three bodies of government to change a law. But to pass a budget with liberal priorities, the Democrats need all three branches to agree. With GOP control of the House and likely narrow control of the Senate, why should the Republicans be the first to blink on a budget showdown? If you take Cole’s assertion to its logical conclusion, it would mean that even with control of all three branches but one seat shy of a supermajority in the Senate, the GOP could not fight on budget bills. Indeed, this is what happened in 2017-2019, when Republicans controlled all three branches and old bulls like Cole sold us out on every budget bill.

If at this time next year you are just as disgusted with the GOP-controlled Congress as with Pelosi, just know it will be due to the handiwork of Tom Cole and his ilk who lend bipartisan support to every illegal, immoral, and tyrannical policy pursued by this administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-one-of-the-most-powerful-republicans-supports-expanding-funding-for-fbi-j6-witch-hunt,2022-10-25
Horowitz: Record infections in super-vaxxed UK seniors as double-vaxxed show negative efficacy against COVID death,"Just because Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the new Fauci, it doesn’t mean COVID is over. In fact, cases are surging in many European countries, and U.K. seniors are now experiencing record numbers. “Covid infections surge to record high for over-70s in UK” was the title of a Financial Times article from Friday. But how can there be record infections precisely after nearly every senior was vaccinated and 90% were boosted, even though many already have had prior infection? Or are the record infections because of the shots, not despite them, and does this mean that they are preventing people from achieving immunity?

Ireland is one of the most vaccinated countries in the European Union, yet hospitalizations are rising.

There are now more people in Irish hospitals than at any point in 12 months. Nearly 95% of all adults are fully vaccinated, and nearly 100% of seniors are vaccinated and boosted.

The number of COVID cases has nearly tripled in the U.K. since the nadir of the post-winter drop four weeks ago. Moreover, deaths are still hovering around 125 a day, whereas after the 2021 winter wave (with a much lower prior infection rate), deaths were nearly reduced to zero. Furthermore, Scotland, which has the highest vaccination rate of anywhere in the U.K. and is the only region with mask mandates, seems to be worse off than ever before. “Scotland recorded its highest infection rates of the pandemic so far, with one in every 14 people infected with the virus in the week to mid-March, up from one in 18 a week earlier,” reported the Financial Times.

Roughly 90% of all people over age 12 in Scotland have two shots, and 73% have boosters. Among seniors, boosters are nearly universal. Thus, there is nowhere to run or hide from the vaccine failures. The negative efficacy is out of control. What about protection against death? Well, we can’t exactly see where the deaths are coming from because Scotland conveniently stopped providing that data, but the U.K. government will still offer the weekly reports for a few more weeks.

According to the latest U.K. health surveillance report, roughly 95% of those over 70 are double-vaccinated and about 90%-93% of the age cohorts over 70 are boosted. Just 1.6% of the senior cases between weeks 7 and 10 of this year were among the unvaccinated, which is below the 5% share of the population pie they compose. The triple-boosted are 90% of the cases.

Although the shots do offer some protection for some people against critical illness for a certain period of time, numerous data points have shown that the protection not only wanes but goes negative. The U.K. data now shows that the double-vaccinated have negative protection and the triple-vaxxed are headed in that direction.

Table 12b shows COVID deaths within 60 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during weeks 7 through week 10 of this year.

As you can see, 15% of all the deaths were among the double- (but not triple-) jabbed, whereas only about 4% of this population falls into that category. That is straight-up negative efficacy even against death. Thus, they placed people into a position forcing them to get boosters; otherwise they would be worse off than with nothing! But what does that portend for the triple-jabbed? Remember how early on, it looked like the boosters accorded broad protection against death, even though cases skyrocketed among them? Well, now, 77% of all deaths among those over 70 are triple-jabbed! That is still somewhat below their share of the population, but not by much, and the gap is closing with every subsequent weekly report.

When it comes to case rates, the U.K. is now reporting that in some age cohorts, the triple-jabbed are more than four times as likely to test positive, which would net an efficacy rate of -300%!

Hence, they needed Ukraine to distract from the narrative, because clearly there is something unsettling going on with these shots. One would think that by now there would be enough built-up immunity from prior infection to preclude waves like this. Yet the data raises the question: Are the shots sliding back people’s natural immunity and creating some form of original antigenic sin and antibody dependent disease enhancement, in which the shots wipe out their T cells and innate immunity, thereby preventing them from enjoying durable immunity from prior infection? In other words, can this keep going forever in a vicious cycle of more cases inducing more vaccine campaigns, which in turn create more infections?

A recent study from Stanford published in Cell might shed light on this phenomenon. Researchers observed a decreased immune response to new variants among those vaccinated for the original strain because the shots are teaching the body to respond improperly. “We find that prior vaccination with Wuhan-Hu-1-like antigens followed by infection with Alpha or Delta variants gives rise to plasma antibody responses with apparent Wuhan-Hu-1-specific imprinting manifesting as relatively decreased responses to the variant virus epitopes, compared with unvaccinated patients infected with those variant viruses,” observed the Stanford pathologists. They note that the extent to which this causes original antigenic sin “will be an important topic of ongoing study.”

Contrast the week 11 report to the week 5 report from just six weeks ago. You will see that in most age groups, the case rates among the triple-vaxxed were between 1.5 and 2 times greater, not between 3 and 4 times greater as they are today.

One would think that with so much infection for so many months among this group, at some point it would exhaust the pool of eligible people and perhaps revert back to the unvaccinated having a higher case rate. But in fact, the opposite is true; it’s getting worse every week for the triple-jabbed, especially among seniors.

And we already know from an Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that the fourth shot won’t make things better. ""We observed low vaccine efficacy against infections in health care workers, as well as relatively high viral loads suggesting that those who were infected were infectious,” concluded the authors of the study comparing quadruple-jabbed Israeli health care workers to those with fewer shots.

It’s also important to remember that any degree of vaccine efficacy gleaned from any hard data or studies is factoring in the first 14 days post-vaccinated as “unvaccinated” and the first 14 days of the booster as double-vaccinated. It is already proven that this is a period of immunosuppression on the front end of the efficacy curve. Some have estimated that if you factor in those 14 days with elevated risk, there is negative efficacy for these shots out of the gate.



At the end of the day, we are 11 billion doses into this unparalleled global mass injection regime, and yet more than 72% of 6.1 million confirmed COVID-19 deaths have occurred since vaccine rollout. Half the deaths have occurred since mid-April, after all of the vulnerable population had ample time to get fully vaccine.

Perhaps this is why the U.K. Health Security Agency announced in this week’s report (p. 37) that “from early April onwards this section of the report will not be updated.” That’s the section with case and death rates by vaccination status.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-record-infections-in-super-vaxxed-uk-seniors-as-double-vaxxed-show-negative-efficacy-against-covid-death,2022-03-22
​Horowitz: Republican old bulls expose themselves as frauds on limited government,"After being in the minority for 40 years in the latter part of the 20th century, Republicans have controlled the House for 20 of the past 28 years. Yet the debt has climbed from under $5 trillion in 1994 during the “Republican Revolution” to over $31 trillion today. That’s not just an abstract number. It represents unquantifiable government control over our lives, inducement of entrenched dependency, distorting of our entire economy, creation of artificial monopolies in every vital industry, and a remaking of the national character. And no, this was not just due to the time Democrats controlled one or all branches of government. Now with this great opportunity to finally push a balanced budget, the whining from GOP moderates and fake defense hawks demonstrates exactly why the debt rises always got worse under their watch.



It seems like yesterday when I was writing press releases for Tea Party candidates in 2010 warning apocalyptically about the $12 trillion in debt and the unparalleled levels of spending during Obama’s first year. Now, we’d pine to go back to that level of spending. Yet Republicans are now upset that Speaker Kevin McCarthy promised conservatives that discretionary spending would be frozen at … the insanely high levels of fiscal year 2022!

This week, a number of well-respected Republicans have outed themselves as permanent supporters of endless spending and growth of government. It’s time for them to be honest and drop the vacuous platitude of standing for “limited government.” Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas called McCarthy’s deal on slashing funding “simply a non-swimmer.”

“I think we’ll come to the realization that the ’22 number was rolled off the tongue pretty well, but it’s a lift that we’re not going to be able to make,” Womack told reporters Caitlin Emma and Connor O’Brien last week.

So keeping the spending at Biden’s second year of post-COVID “total state” levels of government control is not enough.

The game Republicans have been playing for years to avoid shrinking (or even slowing the rate of growth of) the bureaucracies is to distract us by saying “entitlement” spending is the real problem (even though they have no intention of dealing with that either). The other trick is to assert that we can’t risk cutting military spending. So therefore we will continue working with Democrats to increase spending for all three categories: defense spending, non-defense discretionary, and so-called mandatory entitlement and welfare programs.

This way of thinking was perfectly exemplified by Womack and Buddy Carter, per Roll Call:

Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack, a senior appropriator and former Budget chairman, talks more like a Ryan Republican when he says discretionary programs aren't where the real money is.



""This whole notion that we're going to fix the fiscal trajectory of this country with food fights on discretionary budgets is intellectually dishonest, because that's not where the problem is. The problem is on the mandatory side, it's in entitlements,” he said. ""We are wasting a lot of time and effort if we are just going to focus on discretionary spending."" […]



He said mandatory spending has to be addressed, but in a way that doesn't cut benefits for current retirees or those retiring in the near future.



""The Dems are gonna . . . eat our lunch. They're gonna run commercials saying we're trying to cut Social Security,"" Carter said. ""No, we're trying to save it. We're trying to stabilize it.""



So, I guess we should just stop using the word conservative. We can’t cut anything because it’s not politically feasible, and discretionary spending is not enough.

“My concern, though, is in order to keep defense numbers, we’d have to have a 20% to 25% cut in non-defense,” Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) said. “Numbers are getting thrown around, $90 billion, $75 billion — there is nothing in our rules that are written that we have to have that kind of a cut. But I worry if you just look at the reality of how these appropriations deals work between defense and non-defense historically, that it could [happen].”

In reality, the intellectual dishonesty stems from the fake excuses and conservative double game played by those like Womack for years. Last month, former OMB Director Russ Vought published a 10-year budget plan that balances the budget doing just this – focusing primarily on non-defense discretionary spending. There are three fundamental flaws with the notion that you can’t balance the budget in ten years with this focus, and they are proven on paper by Vought’s budget.

1) The non-defense discretionary spending creates a woke and weaponized government that takes out hundreds of billions from the private economy and slows growth. So cutting those agencies has a multiplying effect in the long run and is not just chump change.



2) While none of us are advocating to bring military spending down from $800 billion to $500 billion, these phony Republicans define a cut as slowing the rate of baseline spending increases. Vought’s budget doesn’t cut military spending, but it does slow the rate of growth, especially after a massive increase this past year. As I’ve noted before, by reprioritizing our military deployments and deterrent to be against China instead of elsewhere, and ending most foreign aid and over $100 billion for Ukraine in just one year, we can actually increase spending on hardware to deter China while still slowing the overall baseline growth of the topline spending number. Vought demonstrates this in his budget. There are no pure cuts.





So when people like Appropriations Committee Chairman Kay Granger say things like: “There have been reports that House Republicans support cutting our national defense. Let me be clear — this House Republican does not support that position,” they are perpetuating a decades-long stratagem to continue growing government on the backs of pseudo patriotism and, worse, perpetuating an unreformed woke and broken military strategy.

3) Yes, cutting mandatory spending is part of the plan, but not all mandatory spending is created equal. Politicians purposely refer to all of it as “entitlement” spending, as if to say it’s untouchable. But the American people only view Social Security and Medicare as entitlements because of the payroll taxes. Although Social Security and Medicare are, by far, the two most expensive programs, topping $2 trillion annually at this point, there still is roughly $2 trillion in Medicaid, other welfare programs, and government pensions that we should be looking at for reforms. Mandatory spending minus those two programs is estimated to cost $11.8 trillion under the current ten-year baseline, highlighted red below:

It’s through cuts and reforms to those welfare programs that conservatives plan to achieve the balanced budget by the end of ten years.

It’s not like conservatives are even planning to balance the budget right away or pay off the existing debt. This is the bare minimum required to achieve balance without raising taxes, taking away programs people paid into, or causing excessive pain. All who oppose this should just come out and acknowledge they support endless government growth in perpetuity and can’t even stand by Obama-era levels of government largess. Stop campaigning as conservatives and stop lying about cutting spending.

The deadline for the debt ceiling fight will likely boil over during the early summer. This is the biggest opportunity in a generation to finally force a conversation about the purpose, direction, priorities, and size of our entire government. This is the fight and the leverage we have been waiting for. But for those who win elections pretending to be conservative while ensuring the status quo continues, this is a nightmare for which their only refuge is to hide behind the uniforms of our troops.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-republican-old-bulls-expose-themselves-as-frauds-on-limited-government,2023-01-16
Horowitz: Republicans want to throw endless cash at woke and broke military leadership,"When it comes to our military, Republicans have always been all about quantity, not quality. Now, after years of ignoring the cultural rot in our military and counterproductive strategic vision at the Pentagon, they are left groveling for endless new funding for a woke and broke military service.

To this day, we have an entire generation of our best fighters being denied entry into or removed from the military for not getting a shot that some military doctors are testifying caused mass injury among the ranks. Yet Republicans refused to use their leverage on the omnibus bill to repeal the mandates. Instead, they actually squandered their leverage on throwing more money at the existing morally broken military leadership so it can promote more critical race theory, green energy, persecution of Christians, vaccine mandates, and aimless missions depleting and exhausting our soldiers and resources on engagements that run counter to our national interests.

Headed into the fiscal year 2023 budget season, what do you think should be the top priority of Republicans? The border? Defunding Pfizer and Moderna? Actually cutting spending so we don’t turn into Venezuela? Ending wokeness in the military and using the military at our border and building deterrent against China? Nope. Asking for an even larger budget for the same military persecuting the best soldiers.

On Wednesday, 40 Republican members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees sent a letter to the president requesting that the budget proposal he releases next week establish a 5% increase over the inflation-adjusted FY 22 enacted level. Given that the enacted FY 22 level of defense spending is $782 billion, a 5% increase plus inflation would likely raise the level to approximately $880 billion.

Ever since I began covering federal budgets 14 years ago, defense spending was the holy grail for Republicans. Their desire to pointlessly increase spending without first addressing our strategic priorities always allowed the left to grow non-defense spending. They knew conservatives would never shoot the hostage, so they always ensured that spending on HUD, HHS, and the EPA would grow along with the Pentagon. This is how we have grown the leviathan that now controls our lives and bodies.

But what have we gotten in return for all of this? Absent policy reforms, funding the Pentagon today gets you the same wokeness as increasing the budget of the IRS, OSHA, EPA, all of the diversity offices throughout our government. We spent 20 years refereeing Islamic civil wars and now are in the process of refereeing a Slavic civil war. The hill to die on for Republicans in the last budget was even more money for Ukraine’s military than Biden requested; now it’s still about more military spending. But why won’t they use their leverage to actually make the military great again?

Emblematic of what has become of the military, defense officials dropped plans to include the leg tuck in the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) and to apply the standards equally to men and women. They conducted a study and found that about 44% of women failed the test from October 2020 to April 2021, compared to about 7% of men. As such, they plan to develop a two-tiered system with lower standards for women.

This is perfectly sensible for non-combat roles. Men are stronger, and it makes sense to have higher standards. But if we are going to literally place women in all ground combat units in an effort to eradicate all gender differences, then why are we lowering standards and why are we creating a two-tiered system? Either “men are women too” or they are not. Yet wokeness will be pushed by hook or by crook so they can have it both ways. I’m sure Putin is really scared of today’s American military.

We now have a military more concerned about women in combat and combatting toxic masculinity than about winning wars. We now have a military where you can’t carry a gun on your own base, but you must carry a mask and vaccine passport; where the government won’t pay for treatment of vaccine injury, but it will pay for castration operations. Patriots are being purged from the military en masse, morale is low, and suicides are at record highs.

But by far the worst aspect of our military is that officials are now dishonorably discharging some of the best soldiers for not getting an ineffective and dangerous shot that has likely caused untold injury in the service. I get heartbreaking emails every day from soldiers within a year or two of retirement who now face losing all their GI benefits, pension, and in some cases must pay back the cost of their training. Military doctors have been suspended for granting medical exemptions to those with medical conditions that are particularly prone to adverse reactions.

One veteran military doctor who joined the Army long before wokism was conceived told me he was removed from his position for not promoting vaccines to his soldiers/patients. He was replaced with someone who evangelized about toxic masculinity with as much passion as he pimped Pfizer’s clot shot.

Even if they don’t dishonorably discharge the soldier for not patronizing Pfizer, he is tagged as a bad apple simply for filing a religious exemption. So even if he ultimately gets the shots, he won’t be placed on good assignments and will never get promoted. Unlike civilians who can just quit and try to find a non-mandate company to work for, these active-duty soldiers have contractual agreements and are locked into a career of persecution and marginalization. It’s gotten so absurd that the Navy won’t deploy a destroyer because its commanding officer didn’t get this outdated shot.

Why is there zero concern from the GOP members on the Armed Services Committee about the quality of our military and how some of our best warriors are being purged? Why do none of them care about the DMED scandal and the military’s cover-up of health surveillance data? It’s safe to say these soldiers would rather you fight for the core of their existence in the military rather than just another pay raise.



For years, Republicans threatened to cut funding for domestic agencies as leverage against promulgating odious policies. Why won’t they treat the Pentagon the same way? Why not threaten to cut funding until critical race theory and vaccine mandates are eliminated instead of groveling before Biden to give them even more money? No amount of money can turn a woke wasteland into an effective fighting force. Unless the pernicious policies are overturned, the extra funding will only fuel the decline of the ethos, morale, and effectiveness of the military.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-republicans-want-to-throw-endless-cash-at-woke-and-broke-military-leadership,2022-03-25
Horowitz: Senate Republicans are about to nuke the entire purpose of a red wave,"Republicans seek office while Democrats seek power. And because Republicans want the office without any responsibilities, they specifically choose to strip themselves of any power needed to effect change so that they can appear powerless in the face of the challenges confronting us today. This is why Mitch McConnell and his ilk are seeking to destroy the only benefit to Republicans winning back Congress next year.



This week, Senate GOP leaders will agree to help pass a Democrat continuing resolution to fund government past the beginning of fiscal year 2023 into mid-December. This means that they will agree to fund all the terrible activities of the FBI and IRS, all of the COVID malfeasance, all of the Ukrainian money laundering, and all of the DHS’ smuggling of illegal aliens into American cities. In other words, this bill is one big “amen” to every unprecedented autocratic policy of our time. But it’s worse than that.

At a minimum, if Senate Republicans don’t want to filibuster the budget and fight for policy changes now, they should at least empower House Republicans who will likely control the lower chamber in January. Thus, they should sign off on a CR that funds the government with an expiration date sometime after January so that the new GOP Congress can address all the policy concerns in the budget with more leverage. After all, isn’t that the entire purpose of the election? It’s not like Republicans will ever have the votes to pass good bills, but at least they can hold up budget bills as leverage to effect change.

In comes McConnell and company, and they plan to strategically have the CR expire on Dec. 16, right before Christmas while members are rushing to leave the Capitol but before Republicans control the House. This will allow Democrats to permanently control the FY 2023 budget and every policy of the federal government all the way through next September, thereby undercutting the entire purpose of Republicans winning back the House.

This lame-duck omnibus will not only fund all of the current odious policies but will likely add new ones to the mix. Republicans are willing to fund all the current bad policies in the short-term CR and are only fighting over how much new funding for Ukraine and COVID they are willing to accept. But in any lame-duck omnibus, there is no limit to what Republicans are willing to accept.

Thus, Democrats long for power as a treasure to be immediately harnessed and used, whereas Republicans shun the opportunity to control power, particularly the key leverage of the budget process. They are deathly afraid of a February 2023 budget deadline with a GOP-controlled House and a conservative base demanding they defund the tyrannical Biden administration policies in the budget. Lame-duck chicanery is the best way for Republicans to “cleanly” avoid confrontation, and passing a CR this month that expires before Christmas is the first step.

McConnell and company have already betrayed conservatives on red-flag laws, endless Ukraine funding, and ceding all the leverage on budget bills, debt ceilings, and defense authorization bills. Now, Republicans are planning to codify gay marriage in a way that will force the rainbow jihad agenda on the states. Unlike during the Tea Party, they are not even promising to do better next year; they are cheating on us in broad daylight right before the election.

As a way to mollify the base for all the betrayal, Lindsey Graham is now playing up his bill to ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy. However, voters need to understand that Republicans are promising bills they will never have the votes to pass in exchange for supplying Democrats with enough votes for bad policies that Schumer wouldn’t be able to pass without GOP support. Republicans will never win the presidency along with 60 pro-life senators for years to come. The best they can do is block bad bills from passing and use leverage from the budget bills to push for conservative priorities. All victories for life will have to take place in the states. Yet at the same time, they are passing a bill that will ban states from defining marriage as marriage. The abortion bill is a complete distraction.

And where are the Senate candidates? Where are people like Pennsylvania GOP Senate nominee Mehmet Oz? If they are really itching to represent us in Congress, why are they not demanding that they be allowed to influence the budget for this upcoming year rather than handing another year’s budget – along with every policy that matters – to the Democrats? Their silence is deafening.



We all thought Republicans would at least wait until next year and then sell out, but now they are ensuring that there is no leverage left for the new majority.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-senate-republicans-nuking-red-wave,2022-09-14
Horowitz: Stop the pandemic treaty and global health fascism before it’s too late,"State, local, and federal bureaucrats’ control of our lives, liberty, and property without any due process, legal recourse, or legislative input was the hallmark of the Great Reset catalyzed exactly two years ago this week. Yet few states have passed meaningful reforms to immunize ourselves to such social transformation – and even bodily transformation – without representation from ever happening again. Now, global tyrants seek to create an international pandemic treaty that will globalize this tyranny, unless we stop it dead in its tracks today.

Last November, the World Health Organization held a special session of the World Health Assembly in Geneva to discuss the idea of creating a global pandemic treaty. In citing the need for such a treaty, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, identified the “‘me-first’ approaches that stymie the global solidarity needed to deal with a global threat.”

On Jan. 24, 2022, Tedros laid out before the WHO executive committee a “priority” to “urgently strengthen WHO as the leading and directing authority on global health, at the center of the global health architecture.” What would such a world look like? “We all want a world in which science triumphs over misinformation; solidarity triumphs over division; and equity is a reality, not an aspiration,” he added. He concluded, “We are one world, we have one health, we are one WHO.”

In other words, they want to ensure there are no experiment “control groups” like Florida or Sweden – no escaping the mew world health order. Given the way the words “misinformation,” “solidarity,” and “equity” have been used over the past two years, we’d be foolish not to take his threat seriously.

This is a broad but subtle theme we are beginning to see from leftist politicians and globalist media figures. The rights of individuals and the prerogatives of nation-states do not matter. And there is a need to fully indulge your nation’s time, talent, and treasure – up until and including the sacrifice of individual humans – to remain in solidarity with what the global cabal deems as the new raison d'etre – be it COVID, BLM, Ukraine, or the next big thing.

This sentiment is not just limited to European elites; U.S. politicians have recently expressed disgust for individual rights. During a debate over constitutional carry legislation in the Georgia House, Rep. Shea Roberts lamented, “We’re so self-centered. It’s my freedom, my rights, my my my ...”

Well, what if an international body could monitor your every action and your every expressed view and dictate life-and-death decisions affecting every aspect of your life, liberty, and property during a declared global event? Just look at the censorship and cancel culture that emanated from COVID, BLM, Jan. 6, and now Ukraine and understand that these sinister characters are only getting warmed up.

The first call for an international health treaty was in the form of a March 30, 2021, WHO headline, “Global health leaders unite in an urgent call for the international pandemic treaty.” The UN agency made it clear what “We’re all in this together” really means. “The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.” Making “everyone safe,” of course, requires worldwide totalitarianism. The WHO declared, “This is an opportunity for the world to come together as a global community for peaceful cooperation that extends beyond the crisis” in order to keep “everyone safe.” The declaration was backed by 25 heads of government and international agencies, including top European leaders Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, and Angela Merkel. And of course, the globalist puppet Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In a press release two months later, the European Council announced that “the EU supports start of WHO process for establishment of Pandemic Treaty.” Following the WHO summit in November 2021, the European Council wrote a report earlier this month lauding the plan “to authorize the opening of negotiations for an international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.” What is the purpose of such a treaty?

“More specifically, such an instrument can enhance international cooperation in a number of priority areas, such as surveillance, alerts, and response, but also in general trust in the international health system.”

Surveillance and trust! Doesn’t that sound familiar? No dissent will be allowed. National sovereignty and bodily sovereignty will be relegated to the ash heap of history, if they get their way. The EU is promising a progress meeting in August with the aim to adopt the treaty by 2024.

Make no mistake: This has nothing to do with public health and is not limited to pandemics. This is part of a systemic plan that they’ve largely succeeded in to use global bogeymen – be it a virus, an evil person, or movement – to centralize power, quell dissent, and induce social transformation without representation. This is why Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is now calling for a G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) to combat what he calls misinformation on Ukraine, which is the new COVID. Evidently, the RRM surveillance of citizens has existed for four years already. As the Toronto Star reports, “the initiative is “shrouded in secrecy” and has already existed since the 2018 G7 Summit hosted by Canada in Charlevoix, Que.

It was launched as a three-year pilot program “to identify, block and respond to threats targeting G7 democracies.” Canada leads the initiative “through a special unit within Global Affairs that analyzes threat patterns and trends” by monitoring social media “with a particular interest in understanding the disinformation landscape.”

Three years ago is around when the censorship online commenced, kicking into high gear with COVID. Now we are seeing the same censorship play out with Ukraine, as the very people complaining about misinformation are the ones continuously promoting false stories to goad American GIs into war on behalf of Ukraine.

Two years after the Great Reset began, have red-state governments learned their lesson? If they hope to remain sovereign and free, red states cannot count on Biden eschewing this global treaty when he is likely involved in it. We must create our own treaty among willing state and county governments to pass sanctuary declarations codifying human, civil, and constitutional rights into the constitutions and charters of these states and counties. Individual legislators in several states have introduced rough language as follows:



“An individual’s right to refuse any medical procedure, treatment, injection, device, or prophylactic may not be questioned or interfered with in any manner. Equality of rights under the law or access to places of public accommodation shall not be denied or abridged to any person in this state because of the exercise of the right under this section.”

Local governments must pledge to uphold all rights during a time of declared emergency and promise to block any federal enforcement of violations against free speech, the Second Amendment, bodily integrity, or freedom of movement – and that includes any international treaty. Let’s not wait until they unleash the next virus to build immunity against bio-medical fascism.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-stop-the-pandemic-treaty-and-global-health-fascism-before-its-too-late,2022-03-17
Horowitz: The massive invasion and human rights violations ... at our own border harming our communities,"We have the wealthiest, most sophisticated and brutal cartels at our border who surveil our side of the border with cutting-edge technology and bring over millions of impoverished aliens, thousands of dangerous criminals and gang members, and drugs killing over 100,000 Americans a year. Perhaps if we renamed Texas or Arizona “Ukraine,” we’d get Republicans to finally care about the issue.

It’s not that Putin hasn’t violated human rights and invaded a sovereign nation. It’s that the testosterone levels of GOP politicians go from 0 to 100 instantaneously when discussing the sovereignty of every nation but our own. Our government continues to refuse to release this year’s ICE immigration enforcement report, but the preliminary numbers paint a shocking picture.

We are on pace for roughly 700,000 illegal aliens to be released into our country in one year. Moreover, this open invitation has allowed the cartels to strategically distract our agents with babysitting while smuggling in thousands of people who are even more problematic. Consider the magnitude of Biden’s invitation to invade America. Look at the percentage increase in Border Patrol apprehensions of categories of criminals since Biden took office:

Notice the jump in apprehensions of convicted murderers and sex offenders. Now consider the fact that those people pay the cartels a significant sum of money to be strategically and surreptitiously crossed. Given their successful business model, it’s hard to imagine CBP apprehending more than a tiny fraction of these dangerous criminals. Every boatload of fake refugees our agents are forced to deal with is a strategic ploy for the cartels to cross over dangerous individuals. That is an invasion.

We will never know the full scope of the number of dangerous criminals who enter our country, but we can begin to quantify how much it affects our safety by looking back during the Trump administration when they were still apprehending them inside our country. If you go back to FY 2018, ICE apprehended criminal aliens who together racked up 542,798 criminal convictions and arrests. The numbers include 2,028 homicide offenses, 5,562 robberies, 11,766 weapons offenses, 50,753 assault charges, 76,585 dangerous drug charges, 80,730 DUIs, and over 12,000 sexual offenses.

Just ponder for a moment the immeasurable carnage caused by our senseless disregard for sovereignty and the number of nameless victims the media will never spotlight. This data doesn’t include those criminal charge categories that had fewer than 1,000. Only 29% of those were unconvicted charges, which likely means that the main focus of ICE removal operations, understandably so, is on convictions because they focus on the prisons and jails. Which means there are likely many more arrested for crimes who are not apprehended by ICE.

Also, keep in mind that ICE only has fewer than 6,000 deportation officers, a fraction of the size of the NYPD, and the largest number of illegal aliens live in sanctuary cities, which made it difficult for ICE to catch the largest number of criminal aliens.

As of the most recent ICE report, there were 3.26 million aliens under ICE's undetained docket. These are individuals who have been targeted by ICE for removal, which most likely means the overwhelming majority have criminal records in addition to immigration violations. That means over 3 million criminal aliens who were dangerous enough to be on ICE's radar remain in the country indefinitely without being deported.

As of 2018, there were more than 1 million illegal aliens who have already received final deportation orders, with another 1.5 million having already received deportation orders but who are in the process of seeking an appeal.

Even if we focused solely on the bad guys, we lack the resources to make a dent. As early as 2013, DHS estimated, based on ICE programs in local jails, that there were 1.9 million criminal aliens in this country and that 900,000 aliens were arrested every year. Chillingly, the report noted that ""550,000 criminal aliens convicted of crimes exit law enforcement custody every year"" and that ""this population of criminal aliens poses a major threat to public safety.""

Now consider the fact that this is all old data and preceded the worst border invasion in our history. Just since fiscal year 2018, we’ve apprehended 3.7 million at the border, of whom undoubtedly most were released and many more never recorded got away from agents. While we often complain that all illegal crime is avoidable and that not enough criminals are deported, we have still deported from the interior and at the border 1.8 million criminal aliens from 2007 to 2018. Can you imagine how many of them likely took advantage of the invasion of the past few years, paid the cartels enormous sums of money, re-entered our country and communities, and enriched these vicious cartels at the same time so they can more effectively control, surveil, and manipulate both sides of our border?

Nobody has ever endeavored to fully quantify the magnitude of crime, chaos, fiscal cost, and drugs and gangs in our cities as a result of this. It is astounding that we don’t try to ascertain the citizenship of every individual arrested, but back when ICE was still doing good work, they divulged some numbers in New York City from among those they lodged detainers against. In FY 2019, ICE’s New York bureau field office lodged 7,526 detainers for foreign criminals who racked up 17,873 criminal convictions and 6,500 criminal charges. The offenses included among those crimes were 200 homicides, over 500 robberies, over 1,000 sexual offenses, over 1,000 weapons offenses, over 3,500 assaults, and over 1,500 DUIs.

At the time, I noted the 200 homicides are astounding because there were only about 300 murders per year at the time. Not all of those homicides were committed in one year, but for ICE to have definitively identified aliens with 200 murder convictions or charges in just one year’s worth of detainers is simply astonishing.





Which brings us back to the border and the broader lack of prioritization of geopolitical threats by our political class. In January, Todd Bensman reported live from the Mexico-Guatemala border that the U.N. was handing out cash assistance to encourage migrants to invade our border. It’s this invasion that is facilitating unconscionable amounts of crime, drugs, sex trafficking, and gang and cartel activity at our border and in every major American city. Ranchers on our own soil live and work in constant fear. It’s hard to conjure up a greater, more comprehensive systemic threat to our sovereignty, security, culture, and human rights than the policies facilitating the border invasion.

While the media whips everyone into a frenzy over a foreign country over which we have little control and few options, they will never tell what is occurring at our own border. For GOP politicians to only care about what the media tells them to while ignoring the plight of our own people is a violation of their oaths of office.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-massive-invasion-and-human-rights-violations-at-our-own-border-harming-our-communities,2022-02-28
Horowitz: The new colonialism: Africa rebuffs US overtures to commit energy suicide,"Not content with the controlled demolition of our own natural resources, the U.S. government and Western oligarchs are seeking to keep Africa in the dark and are using climate imperialism to do so. After Africa largely rejected the mRNA vaccination agenda the past two years, the Biden administration is trying to impose the next “emergency” fiat on African countries by preventing them from developing their lands and using their energy resources to power their people. Thankfully, one African government sees the farce for what it is, and it appears that others will follow suit.



In July, the Democratic Republic of Congo put 30 blocks of oil and gas lands up for auction to potentially be used for drilling and other development. Earlier this month , U.S. “climate envoy” John Kerry implored Congo’s prime minister to back down on the auction of some of those lands for fear that Africa would actually get out of the dark and enjoy the lifestyle we experienced in the West until fairly recently. Last week, Environment Minister Eve Bazaiba flatly declined the request. ""Nobody can put pressure on us ... no convention in the world, not even the Paris Agreement, forbids a country from emitting CO2 for development reasons,"" she said in an interview with Reuters .

Commenting on the U.S.-Congo working group on protection of Congolese forests, Bazaiba chided the Western penchant for meddling. “This is not a working group in which a colonialist controls a colony,” she said. In other words, the Congo is not putting up with a new era of colonialism – except this time, rather than the West exploiting Africa for its gain, the West is seeking to force Africa to join it in committing civilizational suicide. Too bad American governors can’t say this to the Biden administration as the government seeks to federalize and lock up the lands in their respective states.

Ironically, the West is devolving into an uncharted post-development nation status and is regressing with acts of self-immolation by destroying its energy resources. Africa understands the power of industrialization — what African countries were lacking for a century — and wants to have what we all enjoyed until our governments were seized by energy masochists.

The Congo land-use rift occurred as Jeff Bezos' environmental fund, Bezos Earth Fund, is seeking to “conserve” 100 million hectares of land in Africa by the magical year of 2030 under the so-called AFR100 initiative. Bezos’ chief executive, Andrew Steer, had the nerve to frame this plan as the rich helping the poor rather than what it really is – the rich who can afford a greater degree of self-immolation exploiting the poor by locking up their resources in favor of useless wind and solar technology. ""Rich countries are going to have to play a bigger role on creating resilience on helping poor countries and poor citizens to adapt,” said Steer at a recent Reuters conference.

But as credulous as the Western parasites think the Africans are, they are not stupid. They have not bought into the ""climate emergency"" narrative, don't believe the policies will affect the weather, and understand that their alternatives to oil, gas, and coal, which are natural energy produced by God on this earth, don’t work and will perpetuate and exacerbate poverty in Africa. They are watching the rationing of gas in France and the coming heating crisis in all of Europe, built on a self-imposed destruction of Western energy resources.

Incongruously, as Germany and France wallow in their misery, they are offering $600 million to South Africa to push the same climate idiocy that caused this crisis. Africans have no plan to walk down the same path to geo-political masochism, especially as South Africa is beating inflation with its own coal-producing prowess .

At the upcoming climate conference (“COP27”) in Sharm El-Sheikh, African countries plan to push an energy development agenda that directly contradicts the Western countries. ""Africa has woken up and we are going to exploit our natural resources,"" said Uganda Energy Minister Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu, according to Reuters . ""There is no way you can develop any economy, any society without energy,"" said Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organization.

The Africans understand that there is no way to give power to 600 million sub-Saharan citizens without electricity and to almost 1 billion without access to clean energy for cooking by relying on wind farms and solar panels, which are very expensive and require so much infrastructure, ironically powered by traditional fuel sources, to operate.



In the ultimate display of irony, some of the same German leaders sponsoring green energy boondoggles and trying to rope Africa into their inane climate projects are now counting on Africa’s vast natural gas reserves to cushion the blow of their energy crisis. So why are they trying to sabotage the hand that might feed them? Old colonialist hubris?

Meanwhile, as the Biden administration implores Africa not to develop its oil and gas resources, it is begging the Saudis not to cut oil production until after the election. African leaders are starting to see through the politics of Western meddling. They don’t like the meddling, and they don’t like the example Westerners have set in their own countries. For once, Africa might be more enlightened than the West.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-new-colonialism-africa-rebuffs-us-overtures-to-commit-energy-suicide,2022-10-14
Horowitz: The new idolatrous utterance: ‘It would have been much worse without the shots.’,"It’s become the new holy sacrament. Anyone who gets another shot, after he or she inevitably gets COVID because the shot failed, utters a verse from the COVID cultist “bible” almost verbatim, the same as the next newly infected, boosted deacon of Covidstan’s official church.

Three Democrat politicians put out almost the same statement following their diagnoses with COVID in order to distract from the failures of their three shots:

Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “Thankfully, I am only experiencing mild symptoms & am grateful for the protection provided against serious illness that comes from being vaccinated & boosted.”

In a press release, Cory Booker said: “I’m beyond grateful to have received two doses of vaccine and, more recently, a booster — I’m certain that without them I would be doing much worse.”

Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), after contracting COVID from a trip in Ukraine, tweeted the following: “I’m thankful to be fully vaccinated and boosted and experiencing only mild symptoms (the vaccine is safe and effective).”

This seems to have become the standard oath of sacrament among boosted politicians getting the virus.

Isn’t it funny how COVID now has a 100% critical illness rate, so that anyone who gets it mildly can always tout the shots as effective? Safe and effective? When was the last time you heard of someone getting the pathogen shortly after having three shots against it? This is not normal.

Every time people like Joe Rogan or Dennis Prager, who didn’t get the shots but used early treatments, assert that they had milder cases because of their choice of therapeutics, they get attacked for not choosing the sacred therapeutic. Yet when the elected officials all coalesce behind the messaging of “it would have been worse” after getting COVID following the third shot, the media accepts that as “science.” I’d love to be a fly on the wall in the homes of these senators to see which therapeutics they are availing themselves of. I doubt they will leave their fate to chance – a diminishing chance that the vaccine works.

These cultist politicians are trying to distract from the broader point. Namely, that it appears those who get the shots are much more likely to get COVID, particularly Omicron, than those who did not get the shots. At least the pagans during the biblical era bowed down to things that simply didn’t respond. In this case, their idol responds, all right. According to data from Denmark, the vaccinated are more than twice as likely to get Omicron as the non-vaccinated. Just 8.5% of Omicron cases are among the unvaccinated, less than half their share of the population. With other variants, it’s approximately on par with their share of the population. What is so shocking is that even those who have gotten the boosters within the past month or two, and are in the bullseye of “vaccine efficacy” before it wanes, are still getting the virus in great numbers.

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, after testing positive for COVID despite (or perhaps because of) being triple-vaccinated, doubled down by saying Omicron is a reason to get vaccinated! “With the Omicron variant becoming increasingly dominant, I want to again urge Marylanders who haven’t yet to go out and get your booster shot as soon as possible,” said “Lockdown” Larry Hogan in a statement that in itself announced his positive test after having been “boosted.”



We now have entire college campuses that are microcosms of the COVID utopia the public health officials can only dream of. Everyone is vaccinated, most are boosted, and everyone must wear a mask in public. Yet there are huge outbreaks, to the point that Harvard and Cornell have switched to online learning for next semester. What about vaccines passports? Well, cruises full of people who could only sign up with a passport are now coming back full of COVID-positive people. What about states with the highest vaccination rates? Some of them have the highest case rates!

As for the question of symptom severity, aside from the fact that this is irrelevant to protecting other people, South Africa is the perfect control group against the theory that Omicron is mild because of the vaccinated. Denmark is ultra-vaccinated, while South Africa only has about a quarter of its population vaccinated. Both countries have experienced a wild Omicron outbreak, yet hospitalizations are low from this variant in both. The hospitalization rate decreased 91% in South Africa. The case fatality rate is estimated to be 19 times lower than during the last Delta wave. Thus, there is no way one can suggest that this variant is only mild for the vaccinated. The White House is warning of a dark, deadly winter from Omicron for those who are unvaccinated. Well, you can hold South Africa’s beer! The country is now getting rid of most restrictions and contact tracing with a recognition that “they are not likely to be successful.”

In other words, they recognize that human interventions have made no difference in this pandemic. The one human intervention that likely would have worked is early treatment. But to this day – no matter how desperate an image they show in public – they will never turn to what actually works. They would rather lead us to hell than follow to heaven.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-new-idolatrous-utterance-it-would-have-been-much-worse-without-the-shots,2021-12-21
Horowitz: The problem with the Republican Party … is the Republican Party,"Imagine how amazing things could have been had we woken up last Wednesday morning with Republicans winning 54 seats in the Senate and 250 seats in the House. We’d be off to the promised land, right? Wrong! Actually, from a policy perspective, we’d be in the same place we are today, sans the much-needed introspection that is taking place deep in the souls of conservative politicos – an introspection we’ve needed for decades. It’s not about Trump per se, and not even so much about McConnell and McCarthy. It’s that we are the true RINOs – Republicans in name only – in a party that has never shared our values for most of its history.



Here’s a useful political exercise to engage in right now at your desk. Take out two sheets of paper – one for each party. On the Democrat paper, jot down the names of Democrats who dissent from the party dogma on a single issue of our time. Perhaps you might consider issues like COVID shots, global warming agenda, medical freedom, homosexual and transgender agenda, immigration, crime, Ukraine, the World Economic Forum, and of course the traditional issues of guns, abortion, and taxes.

Now, challenge yourself to name a single Democrat who dissents in a meaningful way on any one of those issues, much less a bunch of them – even those from redder states and districts, not to mention those from deep blue districts. What you will find is that there is essentially not a single Democrat from a blue state who will be content even with Obama-era liberalism, and even the red-state ones are the same except for a couple of nuanced rhetorical images designed to obscure their true views.

Now turn your attention to the Republican sheet of paper. I’d ask you to jot down a list of the Republicans who dissent from conservatives in a meaningful way on any one of the aforementioned issues, but you would need an entire box of papers to list the thousands of names of state and federal GOP officials who are downright on the other side of numerous (if not a majority) of those issues. So, it would probably be more efficient to merely list the names of the Republicans who actually fight for us in a meaningful way on the issues that matter, in the way they matter, at the time they matter. On that account, you can probably tear off a corner of the paper for your list and still have plenty of unfilled space! Even the few Republicans who are good on one issue will usually screw us on another fundamental issue. This one might finally be good on medical freedom but crush us on gay marriage, or this one who is strong on social values will constantly shill for Ukraine or open borders.

In other words, we can’t have nice things.

Conservative influencers are now in a state of mourning because they didn’t see the beautiful red color filled in on the House and Senate maps with impressive numbers signifying dominant majorities, but if you want dominant majorities, let me show you the GOP majorities in the following red-state legislative bodies. (Note, there might be slight errors, because the exact numbers are still in flux due to final vote counts).

Alabama: Senate 27-8; House 77-28

Arkansas: Senate 29-6; House 82-18

Florida: Senate 28-12; House 85-35

Georgia: Senate 33-23; House 101-78

Idaho: Senate 28-7; House 59-11

Indiana: Senate 40-10; House 71-29

Iowa: Senate 34-16; House 64-34

Kansas: Senate 29-11; House 85-40

Kentucky: Senate 31-7 House 80-20

Louisiana: Senate 26-11; House 68-34-3

Mississippi: Senate 36-16; House 75-42-3

Missouri: Senate 24-10; House 111-52

Montana: Senate 34-16; House 69-31

Nebraska: Senate (unicameral) 32-17

North Dakota: Senate 43-4; House 82-12

Ohio: Senate 26-7; House 68-31

Oklahoma: Senate 40-8; House 81-20

South Carolina: Senate 30-16; House 88-36

South Dakota: Senate 31-4; House 63-7

Tennessee: Senate 27-6; House 75-23

Texas: Senate 19-12; House 86-64

Utah: Senate 23-6; House 61-14

West Virginia: Senate 30-4; House 88-12

Wyoming: Senate; 28-2; House 55-5

Here are 24 states with strong GOP majorities in their legislatures. In all but Louisiana, they either have the governor or the ability to govern from the legislature with veto-override majorities. Next year, they will likely flip the Louisiana governorship, and a year later they have a strong chance of flipping North Carolina, which is already one seat shy of a supermajority in one chamber. Also, there are 24 states with a partisan voter index based on presidential elections that are redder than Florida.

So ask yourself this: Why are we only talking about Florida as the paradigm of governing successfully? Why are all these other states that have been much redder for so much longer still promoting the corporatist woke agenda? Why do their respective departments of health still promote the COVID shots and their departments of education still promote the woke agenda? Why don’t these states look like the conservative mirror image of California, Maryland, and Massachusetts, where Democrats command lopsided majorities?

The answer is because most of the GOP governors and state legislative leaders are a controlled opposition or bought off by the very woke business interests tied in with the WEF globalist agenda. So, what are we going to do about it? What did we expect from narrow McConnell/McCarthy majorities at the federal level when they have failed to govern like DeSantis with supermajorities in so many states for so long?

This is the painful internal discussion we have needed for quite some time, but would have continued to be obscured had Republicans won big this past election. However, such a red wave would not have changed the fact that Republicans, even with larger majorities in many states, fail to stop the left-wing agenda even in the reddest parts of the country. For example, despite a 4-1 majority in the state Senate, the Indiana Republican governor is even participating in the global warming conference designed to destroy our energy and self-reliance. Democrats were almost completely wiped off the map in North Dakota, yet the GOP governor is quite cozy with Bill Gates.

Even in Florida with the best conservative governor of our lifetime, many of the state legislative Republicans, at least until now, have been lethargic at best. Hopefully, that will change during DeSantis’ second term, but it raises the question: Why are we not seeing the same push to transform the machinery of red-state government into an asset rather than a liability for our values as DeSantis did by appointing Dr. Joseph Ladapo surgeon general to make the health department advocate for medical freedom rather than the biomedical security state?

Imagine if there were 20 Floridas instead of just one. Imagine what that would do to deter the radical agenda in Washington and serve as a shining example for the rest of the country. I don’t think we could fathom such a dynamic. Even we cede all the swing states, we have ample power in the deep red states to challenge everything Biden does except for foreign policy. But we are not the Republican Party, and they are not us.

There’s no question that we need a reckoning about the mail-in ballots and how to win a presidential election going forward. But the immediate reckoning must focus on making red states red, making DeSantis the gold standard for every governor, and finding a way to either change the Republican Party through a reform of the primary process or run independent candidates and consign this party to the ash heap of history.

These are states where debates of “candidate quality” or mail-in ballots haven’t made a difference in shifting their orientation more and more to the right, even as other states become more democratic. For example, West Virginia just experienced a red wave, nearly wiping the Democrats completely out of the legislature. So what is the excuse for the continued promotion of left-wing policies in those states? It’s the Republican Party itself.



The entire shelf life of the Whig Party, the last failed party, was shorter than the 33 years the GOP has been around as a fake opposition party since 1989. Immediately after it became apparent that the Whigs stood for nothing on the issue of the time, it was ditched for, ironically, the creation of the Republican Party, following its failure to block the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. We’ve come full circle today with a new time of slavery to globalist transhumanism, biomedical security, transformation of human life, and the surveillance state. The GOP is at best inept in its opposition and at worst complicit in the challenges of our time.

Horowitz: The top committee chairs in a McCarthy House are the worst of globalists,"Most of the top incoming House committee chairmen reflect the values of Democrat voters more than Republican voters. That is the legacy of Kevin McCarthy-era leadership. It’s time for that to change, and it’s time to end the “next in line” country club politics of the GOP.



Mouthpieces for the failed GOP leadership are complaining that the fight for speaker is delaying potentially for a few days the amazing committee work they have planned. But with committee chairs like the ones lined up at present, it sure is worth spending a few days doing surgery on the gangrene globalists within the party rather than spending the next two years with chairmen who hate their base more than Biden does. It’s worth the time to ensure that we don’t wind up with the same chairmen we dealt with during the last GOP majority, when McCarthy was floor leader.

When Democrats select committee chairs, they choose members who not only fought in the trenches for every leftist cause, but who are particularly intrepid in advancing their agenda on the relevant subject matter under the jurisdiction of said committee. Picture Rosa DeLauro, Adam Smith, Maxine Waters, Jerry Nadler, and Adam Schiff. There was not a single Democrat chair who was moderate on a single issue. These people made most of the chairmen during Pelosi’s first tenure as speaker in 2007 seem like Barry Goldwater.

Republicans, on the other hand, choose people who thwart their conservative base on most issues, particularly those issues over which they will take charge as committee chairs. Let us take a tour of the new GOP House majority and examine the amazing fighters they have slated for committee chairs.

The Energy and Commerce Committee is considered one of the most powerful committees in economic and domestic policy. One would expect the rising chairman to be the most articulate foe of the global warming and green energy agenda. Instead, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who has a 60% Liberty Score, is the quintessential fusionist who likes to validate the global warming agenda and the need for green energy while merely opposing the most extreme measures of transitioning too quickly.

""I'm still learning,"" McMorris Rodgers recently told a climate fascist activist who asked about her position on global warming. ""I think (any regulation) needs to be smart. I think it's important to recognize we brought down carbon emissions.""

Exactly the “conservative” way of doing COVID, the “conservative” way of doing illegal immigration, the “conservative” way of doing Ukraine money laundering – always accepting the premise, parlance, and policies of the left as the starting point.

Applying Newton’s laws of motion to politics, this is not exactly the sort of equal and opposing force that is going to stop the green energy agenda, which is the biggest threat to our life, liberty, and property. This is not exactly someone who will end all green energy subsidies and global warming mandates. In her opening remarks at a subcommittee hearing last year, she perfectly summarized the limp GOP “agree to the premise” strategy that has helped destroy workable energy in this country for years. “We need a smart approach — rooted in reality — to secure a cleaner energy future,” she said. Just like with COVID, McMorris Rodgers believes we need to achieve the leftist agenda from the leftist premise, just more thoughtfully and efficiently. This is a core value of the Republican Governance Group (the RINO equivalent of the Freedom Caucus), of which she is a member.

What about Appropriations? This is the committee that writes the budget, which is even more important than legislation. That is run by original never-Trumper Kay Granger, with a Liberty Score of 51%. She is one of the biggest spenders in Congress. The 12 appropriations subcommittee chairs, known as “cardinals,” are also run by big-government Republicans who love Pfizer, Ukraine, and the FBI more than our border.

The other major A-level House committee is Ways and Means, which is responsible for all tax and revenue bills. The front-runner for that job so far is Vern Buchanan with a 57% Liberty Score.

What about Foreign Affairs? Michael McCaul, another Republican Governance Group member, is slated to take over, after his disastrous tenure as Homeland Security Committee chair the last time Republicans were in the majority. That is when they couldn’t get the border taken care of – even with trifecta control – and the few good things implemented were done administratively by Trump.

Armed Services will be run by Mike Rogers, who holds a 61% Liberty Score in one of the most conservative districts in the country. The core reason we get crushed on every government funding bill is because people like Rogers believe in unlimited funding thrown at the woke and broken military without any policy changes in return. He didn’t utter a word on the vaccine mandates in the military until months after it was too late. Now he is advocating that those who rebel against McCarthy should get kicked off committees.

Finally, there is the Rules Committee. In many respects, the Rules Committee is the committee of committees, because it determines which bills are voted out to the floor and under what rules and circumstances. The Rules Committee chairman is therefore the most powerful party leader after the speaker and majority leader. The incoming chairman, as I’ve already noted, is Rep. Tom Cole, who has a 50% Liberty Score. There’s almost not a single issue of importance on which he doesn’t agree with the Democrat premise, including the need for even more funding of Jan. 6 FBI persecutions.

Ever wonder why the House breaks all its rules and votes on bills less than 72 hours after reading them and doesn’t allow amendment votes? The Rules Committee can just waive the standing rules for that particular bill, which is usually for the most important pieces of legislation.

Thus, the House is broken and the GOP is broken. Keeping the same power players from the past failed GOP majorities is the definition of insanity. Demanding that people stand down for a few days of debate just to get the show on the road will ensure that this GOP majority is indeed just a show. It’s time we move beyond the “lesser of two evils” and the defeatist low expectations of “at least it’s Tom Cole and not a Democrat.”

If people really want change, at a minimum, they’d allow Freedom Caucus members – who represent the heart and soul of the majority of actual GOP voters – to run the Rules Committee so that our voices can be heard. Bills like repealing vaccine liability immunity will never receive a floor debate under the current structure because the McCarthy Republicans want to evince a conservative image without having to take Overton window-shifting votes.



It’s funny how today it’s almost consensus among conservative chatterboxes that Boehner was bad for conservatives and that McConnell is a subversive menace. But throughout the past decade when it actually mattered, many of these same voices called us the same names they are calling us today in defense of Kevin McCarthy. Do we really need to wait another two to four years to be proven right after the damage is already done, or will we finally take a few days to debate the purpose of this GOP majority and what most old-bull Republicans actually believe?

The same Republican voices who have come out of hiding and are slowly waking up to the lie of Ukraine after the policies caused immutable harm will come around on Kevin McCarthy one day – after it no longer matters and we are on to the next issue. As Mark Twain once said, ""In the beginning of a change, the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-top-committee-chairs-in-a-mccarthy-house-are-the-worst-of-globalists,2023-01-04
Horowitz: Time for red states to declare energy independence and thwart Biden’s embargo on US production,"Biden can keep his windmills and solar panels and keep making us beholden to Putin’s petro-tyranny monopoly; we will use our God-given resources to become independent and lower consumer prices. That in a nutshell needs to be the message of GOP governors.

Whatever one believes we can and should do now to deter Putin’s growing hegemony, American and European leftists are the ones who empowered him to begin with by funding the solar and wind energy boondoggles while declaring war on fossil fuels. God has given America enough fossil fuels to support all of America and Europe and make Putin a nobody. One of Trump’s greatest successes was the amazing oil and gas miracle, which charted us on a course to being within a few years of full energy independence. Biden reversed all of that. The only way to neutralize the fallout from Ukraine that most directly affects Americans – exacerbating already skyrocketing energy prices – is by unleashing the states to declare war on Biden’s war on energy production.

The oil and natural gas boom created under Trump was allowing us to break Russia’s monopoly and stranglehold over Europe’s precarious dependency on energy imports. With revenue from oil and gas constituting roughly 40% of Russia’s budget, neutralizing that monopoly would have mitigated any emerging threat Russia poses in economic dominance. Almost 27% of all of Germany’s energy consumed is supplied by Russia, which is why leading European countries have been completely neutered.

During Trump’s first three years, his “drill, baby, drill” policies led to over a 40% increase in American crude oil production per day. With more drilling fields opening up, more refining capabilities in place, and the future of pipelines to efficiently deliver the oil, we were on our way to energy independence. Then came the inane COVID shutdown under Trump, and subsequently, Biden policies choking off any opportunity to grow from the lost momentum of the shutdown, which has led to our production stalling out:

Concomitantly, our unstoppable increase in exporting of crude oil has also stalled out under Biden’s policies:

As for natural gas production, levels increased by nearly a third before COVID, but have stalled out and have not recovered the momentum since. The Energy Information Agency originally predicted a 72% increase in production in 2020, which never materialized:

Yes, COVID was the original culprit. But that is the point. In many respects, the loss of freedom at home as a result of America following (or leading) the world’s failed response to COVID is largely what weakened our country, military deterrent, culture, and resolve and gave rise to Putin’s opportunity. Putin is the end result of corrupt, emasculated, and self-immolating Western governments and cultures. Which is why we need to focus on uprooting those policies and restoring democracy back home before we worry about Putin.

However, as it relates to Putin’s energy advantage, that is clearly the result of Biden declaring war on energy exploration and production even post-lockdown. In just one year, Biden has done the following:

Is it any wonder why Putin felt he had the leverage to silence America and Europe while reclaiming the glory days of the Soviet Empire? Had Biden stepped on the gas pedal of energy production rather than applying the brakes, he could have deterred Russia with massive oil sanctions. Now he can’t do that because he made us all dependent on their oil.

Waiting for the federal government to properly deal with the energy crisis is like waiting for it to restore our liberties from COVID fascism. The solution is for red states to live up to their reputations and go it alone. Texas should work with states like Oklahoma, North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming to grow an energy production empire around the immoral federal regulations. Why is it that the government can give Pfizer a free pass to produce poison and inject it in our bodies, but it regulates gas and oil production to death?



While a few states passed weak versions of this idea last term, they need a bill empowering the legislatures to declare any act of the federal government they deem unconstitutional in the following realms to be unenforceable in the states:

Pandemics or other health emergencies. The regulation of natural resources, including coal and oil. The regulation of the agriculture industry. The use of land. The regulation of the financial sector as it relates to environmental, social, or governance standards. The regulation of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

The only way to leverage against authoritarians like Putin at this point is to push freedom in the states where we still can against our own authoritarians who have made us vulnerable to China, Russia, and other bad actors on the international stage. The fight against Putin begins at home.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-time-for-red-states-to-declare-energy-independence-and-thwart-bidens-embargo-on-us-production,2022-02-25
Horowitz: Top 6 demands to put Americans first in omnibus bill,"Our nation is at an inflection point like never before. Despite clear science and data indicating that our government is now responsible for countless deaths and injuries from vaccine mandates and the blocking of treatment, nothing has been done to rectify this for the future. We have a border that is wide open to millions of illegal aliens and cartel criminals. We have a government getting us into war with Russia over a corrupt Ukrainian regime, crushing consumers with inflation without any effort to boost American food and fuel production. And we have a budget bill that will not only ratify these policies, but spend even more money enforcing them and exacerbating the demise of the U.S. dollar.

In other words, it all comes down to the 2,741-page omnibus bill released late Tuesday night, which the House will vote on hours after it was posted online. It’s time to fix our government through the budget or shut down this ruinous government from destroying our lives. Let’s not forget that the inflation and supply chain crises were not originally caused by the Russian war; they were caused by COVID fascism and biblical levels of spending that devalued the dollar. Currently, both parties plan to solve the problem … by spending even more on COVID funding, spending $12 billion on Ukraine, and engaging in a proxy war with Russia and its oil exports without ramping up domestic production.

Republicans have the votes to block the omnibus bill in the Senate. Technically, they even have a majority, because Democrat Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.) is on medical leave. Here are the six demands they should make before passing a budget bill.

1) End of all COVID mandates: Workers, soldiers, health care professionals, and patients are still being forced to get the shots, despite everything that has been revealed about the safety and efficacy. All the vaccine and mask mandates still in place must be terminated. Yet not only does the omnibus bill fund every corrupt agency that is still promulgating these immoral and illogical policies, it gives another $15 billion to HHS to promote Pfizer, mass testing, and health surveillance. In total, the monsters at the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for the COVID disaster got a 12 percent funding boost, which will total $108.3 billion.

2) End emergency declaration: Ideally, the existing emergency statute should be repealed and replaced, but at a minimum the current emergency declaration and the invocation of the PREP Act that has induced all of this mischief and has handed our society over to Big Pharma must end.

3) Drill, baby, drill: Both parties seem to agree that we must dump $14 billion into Ukraine while cutting off Russian oil. Putting the prudence of these policies aside, it is indefensible to harm American consumers without first ramping up American production. This includes:

Approval of the Keystone pipeline;

Expansion of drilling in Alaska and federal lands and termination of moratorium on permits;

Removal of Biden’s recent global warming regulations on energy production;

Elimination of the ethanol mandate, which increases the price of fuel and food and harms independent oil refiners;

Ending the ban on financing of coal-fired power plants;

Ending all the existing barriers to fracking;

Ending restrictions on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission limiting its ability to approve natural gas pipelines;

Pulling out of the Paris climate accord;

Suspending the EPA seasonal fuel blend regulations, which would decrease refining and transportation costs.

4) Ban oil and gas from Venezuela and Iran: If we are going to ask the American people to sacrifice Russian oil and gas on behalf of the Zelenskyy regime, then shouldn’t that same sense of morality trump supply concerns when it comes to Iran and Venezuela? Yet the Biden administration plans on using them as alternative exporters of energy.

5) Defund spying on political opposition: The DHS has announced it is treating opponents of election fraud and COVID fascism as the highest terrorism concern. The DOJ is promising to work with local law enforcement to combat concerned parents standing up to licentious school board officials. How can we combat authoritarians overseas when our own government is engaging in tyrannical behavior?

6) Defund border invasion: Thousands of illegal aliens are being flown from the border to our communities rather than being removed. Over 62,000 were released in January alone. Any program designed to complete the criminal smuggling conspiracy of the cartels must be defunded, and Title 42 removals must be applied to all who come to our border.

The bottom line is that a vote for the current omnibus is a vote for more inflation, more medical experimentation, more mandates, an open-ended war with Russia from a position of weakness, and every other immoral activity funded by our government. Yet rather than secure these demands, what was the hill to die on for GOP leader Mitch McConnell? He bragged about raising Biden’s $10 billion Ukraine aid package to $14 billion. In other words, he doesn’t give a hoot about Americans and American issues. The only thing that elevates his testosterone levels is foreign interests.



Does anyone believe this will change when Republicans have the majority and the same GOP leaders control the floor process with the same decrepit values they harbor today? If anything, there is no time like the present. With a 27% approval rating, Republicans could fight on every one of these issues and have the public on their side. Except all of the bad guys are actually on the same side – Republicans and Democrats. Which leaves we the people without any avenue to redress our grievances.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-top-6-demands-to-put-americans-first-in-omnibus-bill,2022-03-09
"Horowitz: Understanding DeSantis, shocking election results, and the red-state revolution we need","There are three political parties in America: Republicans, Democrats, and Ron DeSantis. Democrats are extremely unpopular but were somehow, nonetheless, able to defeat Republicans (morally, if not tactically), who are essentially a controlled opposition. Democrats won big given the circumstances, but at the same time, Ron DeSantis, who is the most antithetical to what Democrats stand for, won big as well. What gives?



There is no way to sugarcoat the GOP crap show in this election. Republicans began this election season with first and goal at the Democrat end zone, with a 50-50 Senate and 212 seats in the House. Even a traditional modest midterm gain against the incumbent president – even with a good economy – should have been enough to flip both chambers. Add to it the fact that the economy, crime, tyranny, border invasion, and inflation have never been worse, there was so much malaise in America, and all the polls showed the GOP winning on every major issue, and we had the makings of a wave that should have swamped the GOP waves of 2010 and 1994.

Oh, and back then you had Democrat presidents who were charismatic and personally popular, as opposed to the deeply unpopular Joe Biden. Yet Republicans were essentially beaten by Joe Biden and John Fetterman to a draw, even though, thanks to reapportionment, Republicans might narrowly control the House.

When the historic results came pouring in from Florida quicker than any other state, showing a Democrat bloodbath, we all thought it was a harbinger of what was to come for the rest of the night. But that bloodbath never came, and to the extent it did, it was the other way around, when Republicans lost legislative chambers in Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Michigan. While the polls undersold the Democrat performance in almost every other state, they also undersold DeSantis’ already dominant position headed into Election Day in Florida. DeSantis successfully made himself almost like a new political party. And indeed, if you follow his views on the issues, there is a greater gulf between him and most prominent Republicans than between Republicans and Democrats.

Therein lies the problem. While it is puzzling that voters would choose Democrats given the state of the economy and security, let’s face it: Republicans barely disagree with Democrats on the issues. For most Republicans, it’s as if COVID never happened. Aside from a few throwaway lines, most Republicans never ran on the full extent of the problems with biomedical tyranny. Instead, they allowed Democrats to outflank them on “my body, my choice,” which should have been our message for the taking in a post-COVID world.

On Ukraine and foreign policy in general, there is barely any difference between the parties. Even as they ran strong on crime and illegal immigration, for most of recent history Republicans were for “comprehensive immigration reform” and “criminal justice reform,” only opting to superficially take the other side as an easy election talking point. They have no vision, and they stood for nothing. They produced nothing of the quality of Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America.

Yes, a few candidates here and there did run on something other than the weak GOP-controlled messaging, but they get swept away in the negative perception voters have of the party. Only DeSantis, with four years of internationally recognized, distinctly effective governance – particularly on the issue of our time – did the voters treat as a stand-alone entity. He was able to win the suburbs and even some urban areas.

In other words, Ron DeSantis is the control group that exposes the GOP as a controlled opposition. He demonstrated – not in Wyoming or Idaho but in a former swing state – that you can win over a supermajority governing coalition with sincere America-first policy that speaks to the people’s concerns and even changes their preexisting views by offering them something different from what the two pathetic parties are offering. This is how Republicans were able to lose the legislature in Michigan for the first time since 1983 but pick up supermajorities in Florida.

The problem with the Republican Party is not Trump per se, although it’s hard to see his mix of style, inconsistent messaging, and weak policies and personnel being the winning formula going forward. The conservative movement has a Republican Party and Fox News problem. Conservatives incur all the liabilities of those institutions without any policy or civilization benefit. How much longer are we going to be conservative souls trapped in the contaminated GOP body, servicing Republicans’ WWE-style fake fights with Democrats as they ensure the latter come out victorious on policy – and now even electorally?

So, the answer is to have DeSantis run for president, right?

While it’s hard to stand opposed to that proposition, and there is certainly nobody else on the horizon who sports this mix of policy benefits and electoral appeal, focusing on the presidential election is the wrong takeaway from DeSantis’ stunning victory. It’s the “Fox News mindset” of soap opera politicking as an end to itself. It’s not even clear that anyone can win with the country so brainwashed and the elections designed for Democrat mail-in shenanigans in all the right states. Moreover, the blue states have become like France, and the federal government is irremediably broken. Is it even worth trying to fix it and trying to govern over people who will never accept us in the long run?

The question everyone should be asking, however, is if half the states are as reliably red as the blue ones are blue, how come we don’t have leaders who govern like DeSantis in every one of those states? What would the country look like if the governors of Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alabama, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, and Idaho governed like DeSantis rather than a bunch of WEF-inspired technocrats? What would happen if every supermajority red-state governor used the machinery of state government to change the economies, culture, legal structure, and policies of the states the way Florida has done? What if every red-county government, school board, and health department reflected the values of the locals rather than the elites, as they currently do in most states aside from Florida?

The bad news is that the electorate is confused, angry, aimless, and divided. But that is also the good news. The same way we will never be able to crack the blue states, Democrats can’t crack the reliably red states. But almost all of them aren’t red in its pure sense, because the Republicans are frauds. So, before we ask how to beat the Democrats’ growing juggernaut in the formerly swing states, why are we not asking why we don’t have a DeSantis in every state with GOP supermajorities in the legislatures?



The answer will bring us back to the same point we’ve refused to confront for too long. The Republican Party, with few exceptions, is a controlled opposition. DeSantis accomplishing what he did in the third largest state with multiple urban centers demonstrates that we are being sold out in the R+20-30 rural states and have been for years. The soul-searching needs to examine more than what is wrong with the Republican Party: that the party itself is wrong.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-understanding-desantis-shocking-election-results-and-the-red-state-revolution-we-need,2022-11-09
Horowitz: VAERS myocarditis already 47% of 2021 in just first 2 months of 2022,"One of the most criminal aspects of the COVID regime was the decision to pressure low-risk teens into getting a shot that was known to cause cardiac inflammation. Myocarditis used to be a rare disorder discussed mainly in academic literature, but now it is everywhere. What have we done to a generation of young hearts, and what is being done to detect, diagnose, and treat the problem? Unless we can find an angle that ties in to Ukraine, our politicians, media, and medical establishment don’t care.

We are over a year into the known safety signals of this vaccine for myocarditis, and yet the shots still have not been pulled, even for younger males. In fact, it’s still a requirement in many colleges. Yet reports of myocarditis and pericarditis are so prevalent now that just in the first eight weeks of 2022, we’re already at 47% of the total VAERS submissions for 2021. There were 24,177 reports of pericarditis/myocarditis submitted to VAERS in 2021. In 2022, just through Feb. 25, there were 11,289 reports, which is nearly half of last year’s total. Here is the graphic presentation from Open VAERS:

The reporting to VAERS is very disturbing because the trend line of vaccination, especially for the younger people more prone to this heart inflammation, has halted to a trickle in recent weeks. So why are there so many more reports this year? There are likely two possible explanations. Either more people and doctors know about VAERS and know to look for myocarditis, or there is a time bomb with many more people now realizing they have heart problems months later. Either way, this means that the initial estimates of case prevalence were just the tip of the iceberg, and we are likely to see young hearts damaged for years to come.

What is so shocking is that several weeks ago, the CDC recognized the problem and attempted to get ahead of it by suggesting that “an 8-week interval may be optimal for some people ages 12 years and older, especially for males ages 12 to 39 years.” But historically, if we recognized even a fraction of heart problems from a shot, it would have been pulled from the market entirely! Yet here they are still recommending it, despite the fact that the virus poses low risk for this age group, notwithstanding the fact that the shot doesn’t stop transmission and that it is now outdated for the current strain of the virus!

If the reporting of myocarditis and pericarditis continues at this rate, we’ll see over 73,000 cases this year. And even if more people have become aware of VAERS, it is still woefully underreported.

It’s not acceptable (and never was) for the media and the pharma-paid “fact checkers” to automatically dismiss VAERS. It is our main pharmaco-surveillance tool and was put in place precisely to serve as the consolation to the public for Congress absolving vaccine manufactures of liability. Also, the data complements what we’ve learned universally from all the myocarditis vaccine studies – that it targets teens and early 20s more than other age groups and is more potent after the second dose. Here is the age breakdown of the VAERS reporting:

The CDC’s own researchers published a study in JAMA in which they clinically confirmed most of the myocarditis submissions to VAERS. As such, they concluded, “Given the high verification rate of reports of myocarditis to VAERS after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination, underreporting is more likely. Therefore, the actual rates of myocarditis per million doses of vaccine are likely higher than estimated.”

Moreover, now we have documents released via FOIA showing that Pfizer admits VAERS is a robust and legitimate safety signal reporting tool. In a document from March 2020 titled, “WAIVER REQUEST FOR FDA-DESIGNATED SUFFIX FOR BIOLOGICS,” Pfizer responds to an FDA consideration that the shots might need a new adverse event monitoring system by advocating that “Pfizer believes that an additional suffix for COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) would be burdensome and redundant as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has existing methods to ensure safe dispensing and optimal pharmacovigilance of vaccines.” They referred to the existing methods as “robust” and listed VAERS as one of the tools.

Thus, Pfizer can’t have it both ways. If VAERS was a good enough system to support its licensure agreement, then it must be held accountable for the blaring safety signals emanating from the existing system. We also now know that Pfizer knew of over 1,200 fatalities early on, adverse events in 23% of the trial group, hundreds of categories of severe adverse events, understood the injection does not stay in the injection site, and was aware of the fact that 16% of the lipid nanoparticles are deposited in the liver. Pfizer also lied and stated that the shots provide “Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,” as if it were a fully sterilizing vaccine. They also conceded early on in the newly released document (p. 24) that the inflammation increases with the second and third doses.

In other words, all this paints a picture that there is zero safety net for the public, and the sky is the limit in terms of the scope and severity of adverse events we will see in the coming months. The public already knows this, at least subconsciously, because we are now seeing warnings about cardio surveillance programs for athletes, as numerous athletes continue to drop suddenly.

For this academic year, the Orange County, California, public school system put out a new warning for its athletics department to now mandate electrocardiogram (ECG) screenings for all high school students signed up for athletic programs. The reason? “ECG screenings help identify athletes who are at risk for sudden cardiac arrest which is the leading cause of death in athletics.” Why beginning in 2021-2022? What changed? And why won’t they identify those who got the shots as the culprits? Well, some of these same California schools are stilling requiring this shot!

Unfortunately, electrocardiograms are often insufficient to detect myocarditis early on, according to several cardiologists I’ve spoken to who have been treating vaccine-induced cardiac injury. Cardiac MRIs are needed to detect scabbing, but insurance companies don’t want to pay for them. Our government has a responsibility to pay for cardiac MRIs in young males who’ve received the shots, so they can detect latent heart inflammation before it’s too late.

In 1999, when our government still cared about human beings, the RotaShield vaccine for rotavirus was pulled from the market after just 10,000 infants received it because of a suspected potential 1/2,500 risk of intussusception, a rare disorder causing the blockage of the intestines. At the time, the CDC strongly encouraged the use of VAERS to surveil the extent of the problem. Now, with hundreds of potentially dangerous ailments, they won’t stop the vaccine even for those at the lowest risk for COVID and the highest risk for myocarditis – even after the pandemic was declared over and even for a vaccine that no longer works.

Just how prevalent is myocarditis? In one emergency room at the University of Tel Aviv Medical Center, there were eight cases of myocarditis in a small age group after having received the shots, according to a study published in Circular. This was in February and March 2021, before practitioners were even on alert for this safety signal. In another study published in the Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, eight adolescents presented over the course of 36 days to Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami with perimyocarditis. These were just the people who presented within 4 days of receiving a dose of the Pfizer shot, shortly after it was approved for this age group.

Ironically, the longer we go on promoting and mandating the shots, instead of pulling them from the market – despite the dreadful degree of safety problems – the more it acclimates the public to the new normal of “sacrifice” and tolerance for an even greater degree of risk in order to “do the right thing.” Which raises the bar even further so that anything short of proving with the scientific method that 50% of people will die from it will be insufficient for pulling the gene therapy. We are like frogs in boiling water.



Nobody explained it better than Stefan Oelrich, head of Bayer’s pharmaceutical division, at the 2021 World Health Summit (at 1:37:25). Gleefully trumpeting the future of “cell and gene therapy,” Oelrich touted the mRNA shots as the first triumph of this technology. “If we had surveyed two years ago the public if you were willing to take gene or cell therapy and inject it into your body we would have probably had a 95% refusal rate,” said Oelrich with a twinkle in his eye. “I think this pandemic has also opened many people’s eyes to innovation in a way that maybe was not possible before.”

Indeed! The new normal. Just wait until the next mRNA and you will heartily embrace the taste of innovation.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-vaers-myocarditis-already-47-of-2021-in-just-first-2-months-of-2022,2022-03-11
Horowitz: Why are Republicans going along with the blank check for Ukraine?,"Over the past two generations of foreign policy blunders, our government has failed to formulate an exit strategy. Now, as it relates to the endless transfer of cash and arms to the capricious Ukrainian government, we don’t even have an entry strategy. Nobody could explain in a few coherent sentences what exactly we hope to accomplish, how our sacrifice will sustain anything in the face of inveterate ethnic conflicts in eastern Ukraine, or why it’s worth exacerbating the worst supply chain crisis in our lifetime. All Republicans know is that they want to trip over themselves to outbid Biden’s virtue-signaling on the dime of American taxpayers and consumers.

We thought Republicans learned their lesson from COVID legislation not to jump on expensive, civilization-changing legislation just to be on the “right side” of the new, ephemeral “current thing,” but we were wrong. When Biden pledged his original cash payments and weapons to Ukraine’s fractured civilization, Republicans demanded that he spend even more money. We got $13.6 billion out of that deal. Then all but 10 Republicans in the House just voted for an unconditional “lend-lease” weapons transfer program. Now Biden is demanding another $33 billion in spending, $20 billion of which will be more arms. Those are Iraq/Afghanistan level numbers.

There are certain basic questions anyone should be asking at this point. Republicans should start demanding answers to the following:

Where are the money and arms going, and how are they not going toward the neo-Nazi Azov brigade that will, in the small chance they defeat the Russians, continue persecuting the ethnic Russians and fuel an intermittent conflict with Russia in perpetuity?

Why has our government, and the Biden family in particular, been so obsessed with Ukraine for years, and how do we know this money is not going to fund the very same grifting elements behind the Russia collusion story?

Don’t we first want to investigate why the same players involved in the Wuhan research have been involved with the bio-labs in Ukraine and how this funding is affecting those endeavors and the corrupt people behind them?

Ukraine is on Russia’s border, and in the eastern part of the country, Ukrainians are Russian kinsmen. Especially after the sacrifice of the past few months, Russia is not budging. There is no way arms and cash will ever deter or dissuade the Russians. All they will accomplish is to continue to fuel the macro-war and more internal ethnic bloodshed with an uncontrolled flow of weapons. Short of a full-scale allied invasion against Russia, this “middle ground” of cash and weapons will actually fuel the worst outcome. How will this not result in more needless bloodshed?

Then again, forgetting about commitment of troops, the other European countries have barely devoted a fraction of the funding that we have. If the Europeans clearly aren’t worried about this being the “Poland and Hitler moment of 1938,” then why are we barreling head-first into the next Sunni vs. Shia-equivalent dumpster fire?

All the while, the more we fuel the war rather than encourage Zelenskyy to give up what is already given up, we will make Americans (and the world) suffer with endless supply shortages. The Western oligarchs have been open about the fact that prolonging the Ukrainian conflict will help transition us away from individual freedom and our abundance of fossil fuels. Diederik Samsom, chief of staff for Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s executive vice president responsible for energy policy, recently said that the “geopolitical imbalances” have made us realize “we have paid way too little” for food and fuel in the past 40 years.

As for the latter point, that might be an added feature to this strategy for the left, but conservative Republicans supposedly care about American taxpayers and consumers. So why are they, including Freedom Caucus members, unquestioningly joining this morass?

There is no greater ally to Ukraine than Israel, with tremendous cultural and economic ties. Israel has taken in a lot of refugees. But at the same time, the Israeli prime minister advised Zelenskyy to give in to Putin’s demands on the ethnic Russian territories and NATO membership. The Israelis understand that this cost is already sunk from years of weak NATO and U.S. policies that on the one hand poked the Russian bear relentlessly, but then weakened their own hard and soft power deterrents both on military power and energy independence – placing them at the mercy of the Kremlin’s demand.

Last Thursday, all but 10 Republicans voted for a bill (S.3522) that will allow the DOD to transfer any weapon of war aside from nuclear weapons to the tenuous Ukrainian government.

Do we even know where these weapons are landing? In a recent expose, CNN quoted a defense official who conceded, “It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time.""

""I couldn't tell you where they are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point,"" a senior defense official told reporters earlier this year regarding Mi-17 helicopters, 155 mm Howitzer cannons, Switchblade drones, and Javelin and Stinger missiles.

This after the Pentagon just admitted to leaving $7 billion in weaponry behind in Afghanistan.

So, after two decades of funding multiple sides of every Middle Eastern conflict, in which our weapons kept trading sides as quickly as Harper’s Ferry changed hands in the U.S. Civil War, we’ve learned nothing from our blunders? It’s no wonder the White House had to enlist the help of “TikTok stars” to propagate support for its Ukrainian escapade. Sadly, Republicans didn’t even need convincing.



And who are we supporting? Is the Ukrainian regime really worse than Putin? The civil rights violations are appalling. Have we even conditioned the aid to democratic reforms? Of course not.

Republicans and conservative media had a good laugh out of Biden’s horrifically incoherent, and essentially insane, statement attempting to articulate who and what we are fighting in Ukraine.

Horowitz: Why is only one state bucking the CDC?,"The last time I checked, there were 28 GOP governors, 23 of whom have Republican legislatures to back them up. Two years into the corruption, lies, and unscientific incompetence of the CDC, how is it that Florida is the only state where the health department is actively bucking the CDC?

Rather than serve as a state conduit for the CDC’s relentless misinformation promoting clot shots, quarantine, and masking, the Florida Department of Health is now a positive force for science and health. Under Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Gov. DeSantis’ newly confirmed surgeon general, the health department is actively issuing guidance encouraging doctors to treat patients early with what they find to work rather than relying on the same voodoo that has failed so many people for two years.

Last Thursday, DeSantis and Ladapo posted a video announcing several new changes to their guidance. The guidance includes the following five changes:

Pushing Back Against Corporate Masking for Employees

Advising Health Care Practitioners and Facilities to Reevaluate Status Quo Protocols in Favor of Scientifically Based Treatment Options to Benefit Patients

Updating Daycare Guidance to Limit Child Isolation to 5 Days

Updating the School Rule to Limit Student Isolation to 5 Days

Reducing Isolation for Floridians with COVID to 5 Days

Even in other red states where the governors claim to oppose the mandates, the departments of health continue to promote masks, continue to pressure people to get boosters, and continue to support quarantine. DeSantis has already banned school mask mandates, but he noted in several speeches in recent weeks how some big businesses continue to forcibly mask their workers, creating a quasi two-tiered serfdom system. Rather than simply announcing that we no longer “need” masks, DeSantis and Ladapo went after the entire premise of masking.

“Businesses are advised to no longer require facial coverings for employees, as there is no proven significant clinical benefit for facial coverings among the general population,” states the guidance.

To this day, deep red state departments of health continue to peddle discredited misinformation from the CDC that masks work against this virus. The twitter banner of the Alabama Department of Health still has a goofy mask montage promoting them with more passion than the Biden administration.

How is it that all these GOP governors claim to oppose the Biden administration, yet their own administrations continue to promote lies months after they were discredited? Medical freedom and COVID fascism are the issues of our lifetime, and these governors have ensured that there is not one iota of difference between the parties. Any governor who claims to oppose the CDC and Fauci but has his or her department of health disseminating this dangerous misinformation about efficacy and safety of the jabs or masks is a complete fraud.

Then there is early treatment. We already know that masks do not work and the vaccines waned last year and don’t work at all for Omicron. So, what does work? “If you take a look at Fauci, what he puts out, what he says you can do, he’s been very negative on a lot of treatments that have actually shown positive results,” declared the Flroida governor in the “Buck the CDC” video. “And so what Dr. Ladapo has done is made sure that practitioners understand that they have the flexibility, and they can use their judgment, to use off-label products in order to treat Covid-19.”

To that end, the Florida Department of Health sent out a provider alert to doctors, recommending they “exercise their individual clinical judgment and expertise based on their patients’ needs and preferences.” Why it has taken this long across the board is mind-boggling, but Ladapo did this on his first day after being confirmed to his position. Where are the other governors?



The guidance added this important line in bold type:

“If you are a health care practitioner who is aware of a hospital that is preventing licensed health care providers from using evidence-based care and exercising clinical judgment in treating patients, please report those instances to the Agency for Health Care Administration.”

So rather than putting doctors on notice to lose their licenses for saving lives, this guidance actually encourages doctors to contact the department if hospitals are preventing them from using standard clinical judgement in treating patients.

Too many GOP governors straddle the fence and proclaim their opposition to Fauci’s policies, but then their departments of health continue to put out misinformation while failing to discuss actual early treatment. Even last week, after so much information came out about vaccine injury, the Tennessee Department of Health recommended shots even for children as young as five, despite the lack of efficacy for Omicron.

Georgia is still going strong promoting these dangerous and needless shots on children.

Same game in Wyoming, which looks more like California:

South Dakota is even promoting boosters on children to this very day!

Its red-state neighbor to the north had the nerve to endorse the lie that somehow the shots prevent you from getting COVID and suffering potential heart problems, all the while failing to provide informed consent showing that the shots can also cause heart problems:

Just last Friday, Arizona’s Department of Health encouraged the shots even for people with prior infection and had the nerve to insinuate that it stops the spread!

Oklahoma is still touting boosters too.

Rep. Wendi Stearman (HB 4322) has a bill to prevent the department of health from advertising the shots.

On the same day, they promoted the #MaskUp fairy tale:

On the same day, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare promoted mask-wearing, months after its efficacy has been debunked.

As of a week ago, the Indiana health department was tweeting out messages that could have come straight from Biden and Fauci:

They even have the Spanish version to promote them on 5-year-olds:

There is now a wealth of evidence that everything the CDC has done was counterproductive and that many people need treatment help both for long COVID and for vaccine injury. Hospitals are still mistreating patients, kicking out spouses, and preventing them from giving them safe medications. Yet all these same governors who remain silent in the face of this humanitarian crisis are raucously shouting about Ukraine, and issue in which, as governors, they have zero impact.

With red states like these, who needs blue states?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-is-only-one-state-bucking-the-cdc,2022-02-28
Horowitz: Why the political class needs Ukraine to end discussion about COVID,"There’s a reason why Putin and Ukraine evidently cured COVID. They no longer want us discussing COVID because the daily revelations about the safety and efficacy of the shots – along with all the other lies about the pandemic – will create a frenzy of poignant and consequential questions from the public directed at elected officials. It’s precisely for that reason that we must not allow them to move on. They dragged us into COVID against our will; now it is our job not to allow them to distract us from it until justice is served.

COVID is not really over. In fact, it’s raging through all the countries in east Asia that seemed to escape it ... until they engaged in mass vaccination and are now suffering from their worst waves. It’s just that the gas has run out of the tank on all the fascistic policies – from lockdowns and mass testing/tracing to masks and vaccines. They figured they could mask the waning (and then negative) efficacy of the shots by promoting boosters, but now the boosters are turning negative in spectacular fashion because those people have depleted immune systems. Hence, the needle and mask Twitter banners had to be replaced with Ukrainian flags.

Hong Kong is a perfect example of why COVID cannot remain in the news. “Hong Kong hospitals can’t keep up with the deaths amid an Omicron surge,” reads the headline of a recent New York Times piece. “Dead bodies are piling up on gurneys in hospital hallways as Hong Kong’s health system is overloaded by its biggest Covid-19 outbreak of the pandemic,” claims the Gray Lady. Unlike Africa, which breezed by the other variants including Omicron, far East Asia is getting hit hard ... after having been mass-vaccinated:

What gives? Hong Kong, of course, did everything “right.”

But what is becoming abundantly clear is that not only are the vaccines following in the path of lockdowns and masks in terms of efficacy, they are going negative. The latest U.K. Health Security Agency report shows that the triple-vaxxed now have the highest case rates in almost every age group.

As you can see, the triple-jabbed are more than three times as likely to test positive for COVID than the injection-free population. The Daily Sceptic has conducted an in-depth analysis of the U.K. report and found that “while the death rate in the unvaccinated has been in a strong trend downwards since the start of the year, the death rate in the vaccinated has been trending upwards.” Again, why should this be occurring with the mildest variant if not for some form of pathogenic priming and original antigenic sin from a botched shot?

These numbers harmonize with Israel’s experience of vaccinating seniors more than any other country, yet experiencing far more excess deaths for seniors recently than during any other time of the pandemic. Here is the excess death data for those 65+ as presented by Euromono:

They are on the down slope because, perhaps, they finally achieved immunity, but isn’t this what the vaccine was supposed to prevent?

Then there is the news this week about the massive New York State study of vaccine efficacy for children. Previous studies from last year hinted at negative efficacy after 6-8 months, but this study found negative 41% efficacy for children 5-11 after just 6-7 weeks!

Remember, this is for a population that never needed a vaccine to begin with. It also comes at a time when ""the CDC has admitted it is withholding large portions of COVID data from the public because it fears the information could be misinterpreted,” according to the New York Times.

In other words, the scam finally met the end of the road. And this doesn’t even begin to explore the more serious issue of injuries and long-term problems from the shots. Between the military data, Israeli survey data, German medical insurance claims, and American life insurance claims, the data is coalescing around a shocking number of injuries that show VAERS reporting was lowballing the degree of injury. Recent reports about the vaccine potentially harming DNA repair and creating bone marrow suppression, and revelations of Moderna having patented a gene sequence several years ago that is now believed to be the driving force behind making the SARS-CoV-2 spike more pathogenic, certainly make any future news cycle focus on COVID less than auspicious for the powers that be.



Perhaps this is why there is such an obsessive clamor to emotionally indulge and exhaust the public with constant virtue-signaling about Russia and Ukraine without any constructive policies in our interests. They’d rather discuss enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine so they can distract the public from growing demands for a no-fly zone over our bodies.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-the-political-class-needs-ukraine-to-end-discussion-about-covid,2022-03-01
Horowitz: Will the omnibust finally push conservatives to rebel against the GOP?,"""Providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority for the United States right now according to most Republicans. That's how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment."" ~Mitch McConnell



Everything that is wrong with this country is embodied in the 4,155-page omnibus bill negotiated by Mitch McConnell and supported by the majority of Senate Republicans. Like all bills that fleece the American people, it was dropped in a massive cardboard box at 1:23 a.m. Tuesday morning and will be passed in less than two days. Just know it didn’t have to be this way, because Senate Democrats always needed 10 Republicans to help steal the fiscal year 2023 budget away from the newly elected GOP House. But the big question is: Now what?

After spending $60 billion on Ukraine, Biden demanded another $37 billion for this corrupt oligarch and his militias, which are saturated with neo-Nazis. So, Republicans compromised by giving him ... another $45 billion, because Senate Republicans are more supportive of the World Economic Forum agenda than even Biden. In other words, we’ve giving to Ukraine in less than a year almost as much as we’ve sent to Israel for decades. And it’s not like we have anything to show for it, like Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system.

Chuck Schumer was correct when he described the omnibus as ""overflowing with very good news"" for Democrats. It keeps every single tyrannical bureaucracy funded at record levels. Republicans are celebrating that in exchange they secured an extra $76 billion in defense spending. But it’s time conservatives come to grips with the fact that our national security apparatus is woke, broken, and even tyrannical, so record funding of $858 billion will just get you more deep-state corruption, surveillance of Americans, foreign escapades, and social experimentation.

Being pro-military was the hallmark of a Reagan conservative that informed the minds of the past two generations of conservative policy. However, conserving and even growing a military that is now irrevocably woke – a military where you must carry a vaccine card and mask on base but can’t carry a weapon, and a military where Christianity is scorned and transgenderism is embraced – is not conservative at all. Rather than Republicans throwing more money at a woke military, the time has come to starve it to death until its harmful activities are halted and structural reforms are put in place.

And speaking of national security, of course it funds border security … for other nations.

As for the 800-pound gorilla in the room – COVID tyranny – the CDC got an increase of $760 million, now sporting a budget of $9.2 billion to impose its biomedical tyranny and human experimentation on us. Most of the increases were specifically awarding those responsible for the COVID atrocities – programs like the Public Health Infrastructure and Capacity Program, the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund, Global Public Health Protection, the Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics Center, Public Health Workforce, and Data Modernization. But that’s nothing compared to Fauci’s NIH, which now has a budget of $47.5 billion, about as much as we allocate for Ukraine! And no, the $1.5 million allocated for the COVID-19 American History Project will not tell the story of how these agencies are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Who says crime doesn’t pay? Here’s a summary from the Senate Health Committee of who wins out most from the health care biosecurity funding:

The bill includes $3.3 billion for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), an increase of $560 million over fiscal year 2022. These investments will strengthen our nation’s biosecurity by accelerating advanced research and development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats, and fortifying our stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks, and other lifesaving medical supplies. These increases include $950 million, an increase of $200 million over fiscal year 2022, for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and $965 million, an increase of $120 million over fiscal year 2022, for the Strategic National Stockpile. The bill also includes $300 million, an increase of $35 million over fiscal year 2022, for Pandemic Influenza to improve the effectiveness of the flu vaccine and better respond to changes in flu strains.

It pays to be an arsonist!

But it’s not only the biomedical security state spying on and persecuting you. Under this bill, the FBI would receive $11.3 billion, an increase of more than $569 million. Not surprisingly, retiring Senator Richard Shelby (RINO-Ala.), the chief Republican negotiator, had an FBI building renamed the ""Richard Shelby Center for Innovation & Advanced Training."" This after he scoffed at Rep. Chip Roy’s allegation that he was busy naming monuments after himself.

It should be abundantly clear after this month that the Senate GOP leadership is subversive beyond repair and that Democrats have at least an 80-20 majority. But the House is amazing, right? Well, the Senate Republicans were only able to get away with this chicanery because they knew Kevin McCarthy and House leaders are putting on a performance theater for their base while hoping the bill passes. It is welcome news to find McCarthy trashing the bill in the eleventh hour – even agreeing to Chip Roy’s suggestion of opposing any future bill sponsored by a supporter of the omnibus – but here was McCarthy in September when it actually mattered?

We pointed out at the time that if the continuing resolution before Sept. 30 was not kicked into early next year, it would be nearly impossible to block the rush to pass an omnibus before Christmas. Senate Republicans know McCarthy was silent back then and voiced no opposition because he didn’t envision a battle for speaker at the time. They know he is not for real. The only way to play hardball with the Senate is to have a leader who is actually oriented towards our beliefs.

We’ve been playing this game for years. Republicans betray us on every issue that matters; conservatives grumble for a few days and then go back to carrying water for them. The time has come to finally pledge to vote against these people, including in general elections. This is the only leverage we will ever wield over them. They know we are on the plantation no matter how much they betray us, which is why we will keep doing this for the rest of our lives unless we finally declare “Never RINO.”



I laid out a multi-pronged plan to wean ourselves off the current Republican Party, which would require not just an aggressive primary plan but also a strategy to run independent candidates. However, we must begin by pledging to vote against anyone who supported the bill. There is so much focus on trying to defeat Democrats Joe Manchin and Jon Tester in red states, but it’s an even bigger imperative to defeat Republicans like Wicker in Mississippi who voted for the omnibus and is ruining a solid red seat.

McConnell and his minions are wagering that, as always, the tough talk from conservative noisemakers is just bluster and will blow over quickly. Who will prove them wrong?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-will-the-omnibust-finally-push-conservatives-to-rebel-against-the-gop,2022-12-21
"Horowitz: With record food prices, time to repeal the ethanol mandate now","One could not have thought of a more irrational idea than taking 40% of the corn grown in this country and shoving it into our engines, thereby raising the cost of both fuel production and food. Corn is the beginning of the food chain, and with the worst crisis of food and fuel pricing ever, why on earth would Congress not immediately repeal the renewable fuels standard?

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was a Bush-era boondoggle passed by Congress in 2005 to force consumers to buy only transportation fuel blended mostly with corn-based biofuels. The original RFS required 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be blended by 2006, but that target was expanded to 36 billion in the 2007 energy bill. Despite years of subsidies, mandates, and tax credits, the industry has failed on the promise of energy independence and a cleaner environment and has left us with higher food and fuel costs.

In fact, the RFS annual targets were never met, so the EPA created a costly RIN (renewable identification number) credit system forcing independent refiners to essentially pay ransom for these credits for not meeting the target. Big oil companies then make a killing off the speculation market of those credits, while independent refiners go out of business. As such, we never achieved more than 20 billion gallons of renewable fuels in any year, but we did cause numerous small oil refiners to go out of business, deplete fuel output supply, and destroy blue-collar jobs.

Almost all the biofuels are created from corn, soybeans, and sugar – with corn taking up the lion’s share of the market. Venture socialist market distortions induced by the government caused so much farmland to be requisitioned for this ineffectual fuel and diverted from cattle feed, thereby driving up the cost of food. According to a study cited by the Heartland Institute, families are forced to pay $2,055 more for food every year because 40% of the corn crop – the antecedent of the food chain – is used for fuel. A study from PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2012 – when ethanol production was just 14.5 billion gallons per year – found that restaurants pay $18,000 more per year.

The lower fuel mileage from adulterated fuel with less energy content and the billions in extra costs to the restaurant industry because of the higher cost of beef, thanks to scarcity of cattle feed, were harmfel effects of the policy from day one, but are downright devastating during this inflation crisis. According to Robert Bryce of the Manhattan Institute, ethanol is proportionally 2.4 times less efficient than unblended gasoline. Thus, we are adulterating the black gold that has become gasoline to ensure we need even more of it at a higher price!

In other words, if we’d flush that corn down the toilet, we’d be better off than with the RFS in place. However, what’s even better is using the abundant corn we have to flood the domestic and global corn market, thereby alleviating the pressure on chicken and beef prices. Wheat prices have already set a new record, and corn prices are close to an all-time record, up 25% just since the beginning of the year. Ukraine is responsible for 16% of the world’s corn exports, and it supplies the EU with 60% of its corn. It is time to get the corn out of our engines and into our food and cattle feed supply.

Ethanol is not the only way we waste our food supply. For years, our government has de facto paid farmers not to grow crops by enrolling up to 25 million acres annually in the Conservation Reserve Program. The program has incentivized wealthy land owners to buy up land from real farmers to keep it dormant in order to save the planet from the weather! Trump promised to cut $9 billion in the phony conservation program, but the 2019 farm bill he signed expanded the number of acres under the program rather than cutting it. The program does nothing but enrich wealthy land owners and further inflate the cost of land, just like any subsidized asset bubble, all the while reducing the supply of crops. The omnibus bill Congress is passing this week increases funding for this counterproductive program across the board.

God has blessed America with an abundance of food and energy, not only to sustain our people but enough to support much of the world. Yet the same way woke energy policy, rooted in pseudo-science, inducing poverty, and growing oligarchic power have impeded our energy production, likewise, woke agricultural policies have limited our food supply. And obviously, an attack on our energy supply is going to further exacerbate the pressure on food prices, which rely heavily on all forms of transportation.



But while our government is finding every way it can continue to make Americans feel the pain of rising costs for food and fuel, guess who is working on buying up the food supply for their people? The Chinese, of course. Bloomberg is reporting that China is buying up U.S. soybeans and corn: “Chinese buyers recently booked about 20 cargoes of American soybeans and about 10 shipments of corn, according to traders who asked not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. The buying spree reflects robust demand in the top importer as worries over supplies grow following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and weaker-than-expected supply from Brazil, the world’s biggest soybean producer.”

This is reminiscent of China buying up the meat during the supply chain shortage induced by the 2020 lockdowns. China always plans ahead to boost its people, while our government seeks to inflict pain on its people. This once again demonstrates that the real war our elected officials must focus on is the political one right here at home.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-with-record-food-prices-time-to-repeal-the-ethanol-mandate-now,2022-03-10
MacIntyre: Mitch McConnell and the iron law of oligarchy,"Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell proudly announced that sending billions of dollars to Ukraine was the “number one priority” for Republicans during a press conference in which he celebrated passing a massive $1.7 trillion spending package. The longtime GOP figurehead was one of the central players responsible for engineering the disastrous 2022 midterms after redirecting crucial campaign funds away from promising candidates like Blake Masters in Arizona because he was not content to parrot tired establishment talking points.

The Republican base has understood for a long time that McConnell is a disgrace, but despite Mitch's betrayal of GOP voters at every opportunity, he sits comfortably ensconced in his position of power. The Kentucky senator acts against the wishes and interests of conservatives on a regular basis without any fear of losing his seat or his leadership position. If popular sovereignty allows the people to hold leaders accountable, why is someone so reviled by his own base so confident in the safety of his power?



In his book ""Political Parties,"" Robert Michels explored the behavior of representative governments and why their voters seem to have such a difficult time holding them accountable. The political theorist begins by making some observations that might seem obvious but for some reason are quickly forgotten whenever the pundit class starts debating the motivations of political actors.

According to Michels, no organization is ever ruled by the entire body of that organization. Be it a church, a bowling league, a business, or a political party, an organized minority of members always takes control of the institution. Even when organizations are earnestly constructed on the principle of democratic input and accountability to the body of members, a central group always emerges of leaders who actually guide the actions of the organization.

The natural fact of leadership is not itself an indictment of democracy. The emergence of a leadership class is a universal feature of every human endeavor, and the Founding Fathers were not blind to this fact. They organized the republic around representative and not direct democracy, understanding that in a nation the size of the United States, it was impossible to run the government without set of leaders who, at least for a time, dedicate their attention to operating the state in the interests of the people.

If over time, however, as the franchise expands and the democratic influence over the republic increases, the interests of the leadership class become less, not more, aligned with the interests of the average voter, then the feasibility of popular sovereignty may be called into question. If the democratic process inevitably leads to the installation of a leadership class completely insulated from consequences of that process, is democracy even possible?

As Michels studied socialist worker parties in Europe, the major democratic force of his time, he noticed a consistent pattern emerging. Average laborers with a gift for oration were consistently elevated by their fellow working-class party members to speak and organize on behalf of the collective. These trade-union organizers often had humble backgrounds and genuine interests aligned with those who elevated them. As the organization becomes more complex and its management more demanding, these gifted individuals had to become specialists who devoted their time to the operation of the party and leave their previous lives as daily laborers.

This change in vocation was their first break from the interests of the workers, but would be far from the last. These professional representatives quickly discovered that they could not achieve the ends their constituents demanded with the meager power they had, so the acquisition of additional power became the new goal. The interest of gaining more power was often at odds with the immediate interest of their constituents, but it could be justified because in the long term, the purpose of acquiring power was ultimately to deliver on the promises leadership had made to party members. The more expertise and power the representatives acquired, the more indispensable they seemed to the ends of the party, even as their own interests diverged more radically from those of the people they theoretically served. According to Michels:

The democratic masses are thus compelled to submit to a restriction of their own wills when they are forced to give their leaders an authority which is in the long run destructive to the very principle of democracy. The leader’s principal source of power is found in his indispensability. One who is indispensable has in his power all the lords and masters of the earth. The history of the working-class parties continually furnishes instances in which the leader has been in flagrant contradiction with the fundamental principles of the movement, but in which the rank and file have not been able to make up their minds to draw the logical consequences of this conflict, because they feel that they cannot get along without the leader, and cannot dispense with the qualities he has acquired in virtue of the very position to which they have themselves elevated him, and because they do not see their way to find an adequate substitute. Numerous are the parliamentary orators and the trade-union leaders who are in opposition to the rank and file at once theoretically and practically, and who none the less continue to think and to act tranquilly on behalf of the rank and file.

While it may feel odd for conservatives to relate to a European workers' party in the early 1900s, the description of how a leadership class separates from the interests of its voters should sound strikingly familiar. The situation for the Republican base is even more dire, as most of the base would be willing to replace McConnell, but the skill, power, and connections that he has acquired have made him all but invulnerable to the democratic process.

Instead of making himself indispensable to the GOP base, he has made himself indispensable to his fellow Republican politicians and, more importantly, to the donor class that funds them. Mitch McConnell has insulated himself by prioritizing the needs of the oligarchical class that actually drives the agenda of the GOP over the needs of the voters that legitimate the Republicans through popular sovereignty.

This phenomenon is not unique to Mitch McConnell, the GOP, or American politics but rather an inescapable fact of the human condition. That is why Michels sums up this natural tendancy of social organization as ""The Iron Law of Oligarchy."" Democratic systems, just like all human governments, will ultimately be led by an elite class capable of more complex organization.



The social scientist did not see this as reason to abandon the effort to reduce, as much as possible, the autocratic tendencies of human organization. It is instead a warning about a critical aspect of all societies. Every nation will be run by a set of elites, and forgetting this truth allows the ruling class members to hide the truth of both their power and their motivations. An elite will always emerge to lead in every civilization; the important questions are, ""Do their interests align with the good of those they watch over, and can they be held accountable if the answer is no?""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/macintyre-mitch-mcconnell-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy,2022-12-29
Commentary: The media that cried 'wolf' is about to get surprised again,"If you watch most of the cable news channels, or read the websites associated with most major media outlets, you would be forgiven for thinking that the Trump administration was on the verge of ending.

Spoiler alert: it isn't.

At the time of writing this article, CNN.com alone has nine (count them, nine) stories about the impeachment ""crisis"" in the top left block of their website alone. MSNBC.com is even more captured by wall-to-wall impeachment bonanza: over twenty stories on their main splash page. And at NYtimes.com, literally everything that appears above the fold is about impeachment.

You can tell by the feeding frenzy that the media thinks they have another Watergate on their hands, and that this time they really have something that is going to finally topple the hated Trump from office before his four years (or maybe eight) are up.

I wonder if they notice that the public seems more or less unmoved by their efforts. The RealClearPolitics average of polls for Trump's approval rating has actually become more positive for the president since the news broke a little over a week ago. Even among polls that were taken with voter samples that were exclusively from mid-week, after the scandal coverage was in full swing, there was little or no change in Trump's approval rating.

The media is completely convinced that this scandal is the end of the Trump administration, while the public thus far seems to be reacting with a disinterested yawn.

I wonder when (or if) they are going to realize that their ability to lead the public around by the nose ended long ago. After decades of clearly agenda-driven coverage, America just doesn't trust the media to tell them what is or is not a big deal anymore. If this story had taken place back in 1972, Trump would indeed be in very serious trouble. By now, hordes of elected Republicans would be jumping on the impeachment bandwagon, afraid of universally negative coverage in the press.

But now, neither Trump nor any other elected Republican fears — or has reason to fear — negative coverage in the New York Times.

The reason for that is pretty simple: this same media has predicted the end of the Trump administration probably a dozen times before.

They predicted it would end during the initial staff shakeups that saw Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus hit the exits. They predicted it would end when Rex Tillerson and Gen. Mattis departed. They confidently predicted it would end when the Mueller report was released. At one point they even seriously suggested that Trump's cabinet was considering invoking the 27th Amendment to replace him due to his behavior on Twitter.

I've frankly lost count of the ""Trump administration imploding"" or ""Trump administration unraveling"" hot takes I've read over the last 3 years. And the public, it appears, has likewise gotten pretty sick of it as well.

Trump is Trump, his administration is what it is, and the American public seems to have more or less gotten used to both Trump, and the media's non-stop blaring criticism of him. At the end of the day, they're going to be content to judge him at the ballot box next November.

I don't really know what the final investigation into this Ukraine business is going to reveal. I would not be surprised if it found out that Biden was corrupt, and/or that Trump behaved improperly. Who knows; maybe there is a real wolf this time.

I bet a week from now they will be sitting around wondering, ""Why isn't anyone listening to us? Don't they know how important we are?""

They only have themselves to blame.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/media-cried-wolf-trump,2019-09-28
Pelosi tainted the Jan. 6 committee by filling it with extreme partisan Democrats,"If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is legitimately concerned about the integrity of the House investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, she might have taken a closer look at extreme partisans she named to the select committee before ousting others.

Her appointments include Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), respectively the team captains for the House managers in the first and second impeachment trials of former President Donald Trump.

""Until Trump got elected, I had respected Adam Schiff as the ranking member and thought he was there to make sure our intelligence community was doing things right and that we were on top of things as far as the threats to America, then I saw it go to predominantly being out to go after this president of the United States."" House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Brad Wenstrup (Ohio) said in an interview for my book ""Abuse of Power.""

The select committee is beginning to look more like ""Impeachment 3.0"" as Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) once called it. Jordan along with Rep. Jim Banks (Ind.) were the two Republican appointees to the committee that Pelosi banished in her words, ""with respect for the integrity of the investigation,"" and ""with an insistence on the truth."" As a result, GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) pulled his other appointees from the select committee.

The last person anyone would turn to regarding ""integrity"" or ""truth"" is Schiff, who has only proven continuously to be a parody of himself and grew more unhinged in recent years.

In the first public hearing about the Trump-Ukraine phone call that led to the first impeachment, Schiff dramatized a phone conversation to strengthen the impeachment case. After being called on it, he backed down claiming it was ""at least part in parody.""

Before that, he spent about two years insisting the House Intelligence Committee was privy to ""ample evidence"" that Trump colluded with the Russian government in the 2016 election cycle that the rest of the public was not. Schiff said on MSNBC that he can't ""go into particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now.""

These claims were, of course, proven wrong by special counsel Robert Mueller's final report.

Who can forget the anti-Trump zeal that allowed Schiff to be pranked by a Russian comedy team offering him information about compromising ""naked pictures of Trump"" from Moscow as the smoking gun the California congressman was looking for?

Schiff's repeated claims didn't reflect well on the committee, said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who was chairman of the Intelligence Committee during the first two years of the Trump administration.

""We've been very clear during the process we didn't have the information he talked about,"" Nunes said in an interview for ""Abuse of Power."" ""The Intelligence Committee is traditionally nonpartisan and has generally not performed in the public domain, except for instances such as the Iraq War. But typically, it has been about national security issues or issues we can't talk about publicly.""

The Wall Street Journal editorialized of Schiff, ""no one should ever believe another word he says.""

As for Raskin, he arguably has some expertise on the matter considering the second impeachment was over the Jan. 6 riot that Democrats call an insurrection.

Raskin is far less a comical figure. But his partisanship and antipathy for the 45th president come close to matching that of Schiff.

In 2017, Raskin actually proposed a commission to examine Trump's mental health. His bill for a commission gained 56 Democratic co-sponsors. As an insurance policy just before the 2020 election, Raskin — with the backing of Pelosi — also proposed legislation concerning the 25th Amendment as a means of removing a president.

Notably, on Jan. 6, 2017, Raskin didn't exactly respect the election process, as he attempted to block the certification of Florida's electoral votes. And, as far as the select committee being on the side of law and order opposing uprisings, Raskin accused police that tried to quell the summer 2020 riots of ""intimidation and violence.""

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a former House manager in the first impeachment trial, is also a member of the select committee.

Another select committee member, Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), has seemingly missed the point on past cases of violence. After radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015, he blamed it on the ""epidemic of gun violence"" during a January 2016 speech.

Jan. 6 was a horrific day and shouldn't be minimized as a Capitol tour. Yes, some were just taking selfies, but others were assaulting law enforcement, had zip ties, and chanted threats — not to mention theft and property damage.

Still, those on the left shouldn't exaggerate it as similar to the Civil War, as when Pelosi actually claimed the rioters ""nearly succeeded in overthrowing a presidential election"" and the ""future of our democracy is on the line.""

More should be learned about the profound security breakdown so it doesn't happen again, but a bipartisan Senate report by two committees, citing across-the-board intelligence breakdowns, provided much of the information House Democrats claim they want to investigate.

Instead, Pelosi scuttled any chance for a bipartisan probe with a credible outcome by whittling the makeup of the committee down to seven Democrats and Republican Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.).

The select committee will likely be a partisan blaming and finger-pointing session with a final report lacking any public confidence. That was certainly an avoidable outcome.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/pelosi-tainted-the-jan-6-committee-by-filling-it-with-extreme-partisan-democrats,2021-07-27
What Pelosi's Taiwan Visit Means for American Grand Strategy,"At just after 10:40 p.m. local time, on Tuesday night, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi landed at Taipei’s Songshan Airport.

Pelosi’s touchdown marked the highest level American visit to the Island since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich traveled to Taiwan in 1997. Though many comparisons can certainly be made, much has changed surrounding the geopolitical circumstances in East Asia.

Gingrich’s visit came just over a year after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, so to say the political environment at the time was tranquil would no doubt be an overstatement. However, when compared to current circumstances one would have to say the stakes of the Pelosi visit are markedly higher.

One notable reason for this is the increased strength of Beijing over the preceding 25 years. In 1997, China’s GDP was $961B, it’s now nearly $15T. Its military spending was $15.7B, today it’s more than $250B. In 1997, China possessed zero aircraft carriers, and today, it fields two combat-ready carriers with a third on the way.

Perhaps more telling of the changing landscape is Chinese rhetoric. In the late 1990s, China was still operating from former Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous dictum, “Hide one’s capabilities, and bide one’s time” (tao guang yang hui). Deng’s belief essentially advocated for China to hide in the background while it amassed power, and only when the level of power was sufficient should Beijing look to take a leadership role.

Well, under Xi Jinping that time has arrived, at least as far as the current leadership in Beijing is concerned. According to internal documents, China seeks regional and then global domination, and it sees the US as the biggest hurdle in its way. However, it doesn’t take access to classified documents to understand China’s intentions. Its leaders and diplomats are more than comfortable with being publicly aggressive and antagonistic towards the US.

And, on top of the rhetoric, China continues to try to expand its influence abroad via Xi’s keystone policy: the Belt and Road Initiative--which promises infrastructure and economic growth in developing economies, but more often results in high-interest debts that recipient countries can’t pay back. This means that China is able to take over projects and land in these countries, as it did in Sri Lanka when it was granted a 99-year lease on the Port of Hambantota after Colombo defaulted on its payments.

In short, America is dealing with a much stronger, more ambitious, and increasingly more aggressive China than it was in 1997.

Given the circumstances then, what does Pelosi’s visit signal regarding America’s overall strategy? Why would she choose now to go, and what will change now that her trip has concluded?

The skeptic would say that Pelosi’s trip was born out of her own political calculation. Her party is floundering, and her position as Speaker will almost certainly come to an end in November, so it wouldn’t be particularly out of the realm of likelihood that she saw a trip to Taiwan as a chance to lionize herself. In fact, these considerations are almost certainly at the forefront of Pelosi’s motivation.

This becomes even more likely when one considers that President Biden was initially not too fond of the idea. Given his atrocious approval rating, it definitely doesn’t hurt Pelosi to move against his wishes.

Anyway, answering this question would require getting inside Pelosi’s head, and that seems like it might be a confusing place to wind up. But the fact remains, she did make the trip, and regardless of her individual intent, it does signal to both our allies and enemies in the region.

Since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Washington has practiced strategic ambiguity. While it refuses to commit to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion, it also has left that option in play. The goal, of course, is to deter Beijing while also discouraging Taipei from formally declaring independence, which would almost certainly trigger immediate retaliation from China and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

While Biden’s national security spokesman John Kirby insisted that Pelosi’s trip was actually upholding the status quo, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone in Zhongnanhai that agrees. And the evidence in this case, as exemplified by the trip itself, leans in the direction of Beijing’s interpretation.

Pelosi’s trip included meetings with the foreign ministry, leaders in the semiconductor industry, and a press conference with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen.

The joint press conference was filled with political speak regarding economic exchange and budding relationships, very par-for-the-course type of stuff. But in her opening remarks, Pelosi did, perhaps subconsciously, point out the contradiction in America’s Taiwan policy.

""Let's just put it in perspective. Four decades ago, the Taiwan Relations Act was built–in building a strong bond between our two countries: advancing our shared interests of governance, economy, and security, while respecting the ""One China"" policy. Our solidarity with you is more important than ever, as you defend Taiwan and their freedom.”

Well, which is it? Does America support the ""One China"" policy or Taiwan’s right to self-determination? Because those positions are increasingly mutually exclusive.

When Pelosi notes that American solidarity with Taiwan is more important than ever, she’s absolutely correct. But substantively, what is America doing to address this need?

For all the reasons this article has addressed already, coupled with CCP’s long-held belief that China’s rejuvenation will only be complete after the absorption of Taiwan, it’s imperative that the US change its strategy vis-a-vis Taiwan and East Asia in general.

As Elbridge Colby points out in his newest book, America’s top foreign policy goal should be preventing another state from gaining regional hegemony, most chiefly China in Asia. This is due to a combination of China’s power in comparison to other potential regional threats like Russia, as well as Asia’s overall importance. For instance, when it comes to global GDP, Asia’s share trumps that of Europe’s, and the gap is only growing.

In short, Colby’s well-substantiated claim is that once China achieves hegemony in Asia, it will have the ability to drastically manipulate the American way of life and potentially seek to project its domain across other regions.

While China is busy in a multitude of theaters in its attempt to achieve hegemony, the most important and crucial prize in Beijing’s eyes is Taiwan. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan, while not sufficient, is absolutely necessary to achieve this goal. Therefore, it’s imperative that America prevent this from happening.

While Speaker Pelosi’s trip is undoubtedly symbolic, it does nothing to actually address the systemic problems that are developing in the region.

What is required of Washington to protect Taiwan and deny China’s bid for hegemony goes far beyond official visits and political posturing. It requires concrete change in the way America conducts foreign policy.

Understanding then, that Asia is the most important theater in the world, it would behoove decision makers in Washington to make choices that reflect this reality. However, instead of consolidating more resources in the Pacific, the US is increasing its commitments to Ukraine and Europe.

At a June NATO summit in Madrid, Biden committed to the Ukraine effort for “as long as it takes,” and on Tuesday, John Kirby announced the US would send an additional $550 million in military aid to Kyiv. This brings the figure to more than $8 billion in total aid since Russia launched its invasion. The US has also increased its troop deployment in Europe to 100,000, up from 80,000 pre-invasion.

As admirable as the Ukrainians are and as noble as it might be to want to support their cause indefinitely, the truth is that these moves are counterproductive. They pull resources and focus that should be concentrated in Asia.

By effectively concentrating military resources in Asia, the US will signal to China that it is committed to the region and denying Beijing’s ambitions. In the same breath, Washington should also change its Taiwan policy, and officially discard any adherence to the ""One China"" policy.

Strategic ambiguity served a purpose for much of the Cold War era, and it was even understandable in the 1990s when there was at least a hope that China would reform and Westernize. However, with the Soviet threat long gone and the theory of a liberal China thoroughly dispelled, the ""One China"" policy serves no purpose. It merely handicaps potential cooperation between Taipei and Washington.

A continuing insistence on refusing to commit to the Asian theater, and the perpetuation of word games to appease Beijing will only lead to confusion and uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait and all of East Asia. This confusion will not reduce, but significantly increase the likelihood of conflict with an increasingly emboldened China.

America should take a note from China and develop a grand strategy focused on broad horizons, not merely political considerations of the day. The first step in doing so is realizing that Asia, and not Europe, will dominate the 21st century and China is the main threat to the order America has sacrificed so much to build.

By accepting this premise, one can’t reasonably argue defending Taiwan isn’t of paramount concern to the American people.

While Pelosi’s trip in itself doesn’t solve or even address these issues in a meaningful way, it does provide the opportunity for the US to seriously consider what its relationship with Taiwan should be and what its overall strategy should look like.

China has certainly taken note of the visit and responded in bombastic fashion.

Shortly after Pelosi departed Taipei en route to Seoul, China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, tweeted, “The US is the provocateur, and China is the victim. The US side colluded with Taiwan and made provocations first, whereas China has been compelled to act in self-defense.”

And, the spokesman for the State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, exclaimed that Tsai and her ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) were “pushing the island into the abyss of disaster.”

The Chinese response hasn’t just been talk, either. According to the South China Morning Post, China announced starting Thursday it would begin live-fire drills in seven locations surrounding Taiwan’s coastline, effectively blockading the island.

Pelosi’s visit provides much-needed momentum and reflection for policymakers in Washington, and it mustn’t be squandered. There are only so many more opportunities for America to come to terms with its geopolitical reality. China already has, and the clock is ticking.

"Prather: Tomorrow, let's set the record straight","Let’s discuss the state of the country as we head into tomorrow’s 2022 midterm elections.



America is setting records, folks. We are truly in uncharted territory with the current administration in Washington, D.C. Under Joe Biden’s absent-minded, addle-brained, and dementia-ridden leadership, we are seeing record inflation in every aspect of our lives. From fuel prices to groceries, the value of our dollar is melting faster than the chocolate chocolate-chip ice cream cone Joe is inevitably licking right at this moment. We have a president who won’t face the nation, won’t face real questions, and won’t face the facts.



America is deteriorating before our eyes, and our freedoms are being taken away. These are not records that I want to set. Free speech has been throttled in the name of ideological acceptance and inclusivity. Facts are racist. Jokes are hate speech. Common sense is rationalized away as antiquated. Complex and critical thinking is obsolete, and this generation of Americans has been dumbed down by being spoon-fed fast-food garbage information by mainstream talking heads 24/7 for the last 40 years. The fringe controls the airwaves and the agenda. Unelected bureaucrats and shadowy billionaires run our government and politicians, while said politicians make careers out of getting elected and subsequently make millions of dollars pandering to and pilfering off of the American citizen. They even prove day after day where their misguided priorities lie, as they care more about Ukraine than the United States.



The people in charge right now say that they are the party of science, yet they deny biology, worship at the altar of climate change , and blame every one of America’s ills on some imaginary form of systemic racism. God and guiding principles have been replaced with the exaltation of man and his every whim. Our unborn are treated as an unimportant inconvenience, and the sanctity of human life means nothing. People who have the constitutional right to defend themselves are treated as criminals when they do so. In public schools our children are exposed to sexualization like never before, and many are even encouraged to question their gender identity on a regular basis. They are taught that they are inherently racist and that society is doomed unless they learn early and often to self-condemn and self-flagellate and make apologizing for their ancestral sins their practiced agenda for the remainder of their lives.



These last few years, we have been subjected to medical tyranny, corporate tyranny, big tech tyranny, judicial tyranny, big government tyranny, bureaucratic tyranny, educational tyranny, and mainstream media tyranny, and I’m sitting here trying to figure out at what point we start spilling tea into the harbor.



We’ve lost our sense of national identity and pride, and thus we have also lost our sense of destiny. This generation of Americans will leave behind the destructive and tragic wake of a cultural storm unprecedented in human history. When America falls, who will be there to fill the vacuum where freedom once held sway as the dominant paradigm and pursuit? The evils of communism and Marxism and their glorification of man’s inhumanity to man will rush to fill that empty void, and great will be the death toll that ensues.



While the left in America continues to prop up its puppets like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and proposes candidates with the oratorical and leadership skills of an orangutan, like John Fetterman in Pennsylvania or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, those among us who claim to color with a more reddish hue will unfortunately continue to bow to the lifelong career worthlessness of a Mitch McConnell or a Lindsey Graham and pursue a cult of personality, rather than embrace the principles of small government and true conservatism.



What will tomorrow bring? Will we see a legitimate “red wave” that forces a more honest type of man or woman to hold Big Brother accountable, or will we simply see more of the same pandering to power and political and cultural ideology that glorifies the fringiest and cringiest among us?

While people care more about celebrities leaving Twitter than they do the state of a nation, I can’t say that I’m hopeful regardless. Our Constitution and Bill of Rights have gone largely ignored, to the point of being abused with great regularity by those who claim to represent “we the people.” But how would ""we the people"" know, since we’ve never read and certainly never learned either one?





I pray that the people of these formerly United States will show up and vote in a margin that far exceeds Big Brother’s threshold of cheating, that genuine accountability can be brought back, and that the guilty parties will ultimately pay for the true sin that lives among us: the sin of destroying the greatest idea and country that have ever graced human history.



While Washington, D.C., and big government tyranny are setting records across the nation, tomorrow we have the opportunity to set the record straight. What will happen? We shall see.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/prather-tomorrow-let-s-set-the-record-straight,2022-11-07
The media has overplayed its hand in trying to remove Trump ​,"The same media that delighted in an Obama presidency riddled with gashes of corruption, the notion of a Hillary Clinton presidency, a witch hunt against President Trump by the intelligence community, and a Russian collusion narrative that failed to pay off for Democrats to reverse the 2016 election are now fervently pushing for a bogus impeachment inquiry.

Although I didn't support Donald Trump during the primary election, after observing how the one-party media has conducted themselves for the last three years, I'm left with no other choice but to support a president who has been unfairly battered by the press.

I witnessed the way the coastal elites belittled his supporters in the media and him throughout the 2016 presidential election.

At first, I didn't think he had a chance, and I wasn't exactly enthused with the idea of a Trump presidency. The mudslinging and reality TV persona just wasn't for me.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was my choice in the primaries then each of the candidates fell like dominoes.

I still wasn't on board with the idea of Trump until the bias in the media and in academia intensified after he clinched the nomination and began debating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the national stage.

I now find myself in the middle, like many Americans. She was corrupt and disingenuous, and he was, well, Donald Trump, with all his character flaws.

But as 2016 continued to unfold, and November drew nearer, Americans witnessed how the media colluded with the Democratic National Committee when a presidential debate question was leaked to Hillary Clinton's camp and how Hollywood elites stooped to unprecedented lows never seen before all to destroy Trump and his family and catapult another corrupt Clinton into the White House.

What was more infuriating was the blatant attempt to demean the Americans who supported him and the valid concerns they held about the state of the economy, immigration, health care, voter fraud, and taxes by labeling them racists and half of them ""a basket of deplorables.""

The media bullied these people, and I, for one, have no patience for bullies, primarily when it's directed at Americans who are understandably frustrated with the system and who feel like they've been forgotten for so long.

Clinton had the media wrapped around her finger, and she still lost.

The media misled the public every day about how Clinton was going to shatter the ""glass ceiling."" She was and still is a real icon to feminists. 2016 was going to be their year – until it wasn't and the upset that night as the results of the election trickled in was undoubtedly satisfying for many to watch because Trump had upended their plans by a landslide.

The media not only misled the American public but misread them once and for all -- or so I thought.

The ironic thing about the media and Clinton loyalists is that they couldn't care less about the corruption surrounding former President Barack Obama, the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton, and the now grotesque actions of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

They seem to have amnesia about Whitewater, Benghazi; the women Clinton smeared who accused her husband of sexual misconduct, Uranium One, the Clinton Foundation, Bill's ties to disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the targeting of conservative organizations by the IRS under the Obama administration, and Obama's terrible reputation with journalists.

These same hacks are willing to assume the worst in Trump with even less evidence for the sake of overturning the results of the 2016 presidential election all because they despise him.

It was all about a faux champion of women's rights occupying the White House, who is more corrupt than any other female politician in the history of the United States.

Throughout 2016, the polls told us Hillary Clinton would win the presidency in a landslide. Remember the 92 percent likelihood? Who could forget?

And remember when Hillary said she feared that Trump wouldn't accept the results of the election?

She said, ""To say you won't respect the results of the election, that is a direct threat to our democracy.""

Now she's doing what she alleged Trump would do had he lost, and with no pushback from journalists.

She's currently on a book tour slamming the president, by the way.

Then, the media told us Russia meddled in the election and that the 62 million Americans who voted for President Trump were illegitimate.

Trump has been in office for nearly three years, and all the Democrats and their cohorts in the media have done is try to undo this presidency.

They pursued impeachment by way of collusion and obstruction, but after two years of investigating, Robert Mueller found no evidence of that.

So, they pivoted to something new.

Later, it was the intelligence community — specifically former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI Director James Comey, and agent Peter Strzok – who was secretly plotting against the president for no valid reason other than that they disliked him.

To recap: McCabe was accused of leaking sensitive information to the media to advance personal interests and was fired by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And then he was hired by CNN.

Then, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) introduced a bill to eliminate the Electoral College.

""Americans expect and deserve the winner of the popular vote to win office,"" he said.

The Squad echoed those sentiments by calling the Electoral College a ""scam,"" so they could stir up more support to remove the president from office.

On Sept. 30, the New York Times published an op-ed calling Trump's claims about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma Holdings in Ukraine ""lies.""

It can be said with utter certainty that if any of Trump's children were benefiting from an overseas oil company because of their father's position as president of the United States, it would be pursued aggressively by a media who has overwhelmingly partnered with a political party.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/president-trump-raised-the-ukraine-issue-because-the-media-failed-to,2019-10-07
"Roth: Deliberately lessening America's energy is self-destruction, period.","Air conditioning is one of the most American things I can think of, other than perhaps ice cubes, which accomplish a related function. While people throughout Europe and other developed and emerging countries sweat and suffer through sweltering hot — and sometimes mildly hot — days and drink warm water and carbonated beverages, Americans have the freedom to choose not to do so.



Which is why it is all the more outrageous that some Americans are being asked to ration their air conditioning and other energy use — the energy that keeps Americans cool, productive, and happy, while also serving an important function in preventing illness and death from excessive heat.

The progressive central planning obsession with energy is fraught with fantasy outweighing reality. Now Americans are being asked, and in some cases forced, to sacrifice their individual health and well-being for this fantasy.

Across the country, natural gas and coal power sources have been shut down, lessening the supply of energy, which becomes very apparent during times of heavy energy demand, such as very hot days. Wind and solar power are both intermittent (that is, not generating power when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining), and we have not scaled batteries or other storage in a way that makes these viable substitutes. And that doesn’t even account for their inherent downsides, either.

In California, the California Independent System Operator, which is the manager of the state’s electric power grid, has issued a voluntary call for energy conservation during the hours of 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. — you know, the hours when people are home from work and school and want to relax and enjoy time with the family. Suggestions to conserve energy include not running the air conditioning and major appliances.

This is because the state does not have enough energy production. Nor does the country. And there isn’t enough energy production because of an irresponsible movement away from traditional energy sources without a viable alternative to meet demand. Period.

It’s not as though California has had to enact forced blackouts in prior years to deal with demand and couldn’t have seen this coming (sarcasm intended).



But it’s not just California. Even in Texas, calls for rationing are happening. This summer, Tesla asked customers not to charge their electric vehicles during peak energy demand hours (between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.) amids concerns over an energy emergency.

Well, that seems to bode well for the coordinated push for more electric vehicles (again, sarcasm intended). It’s almost as though a whole lot of people want to deny how most electricity in the U.S. is powered.

Across the pond, Europeans are faring worse and are likely facing a winter filled with heavy rationing of energy — or worse. In Germany, it was reported by Insider that landlords have already begun rationing hot water. This may become another instance where lives are at stake, especially if heat gets rationed.

This is self-destruction, plain and simple, and we should not be following suit.

The United States fought and won a few wars so that we don't have to listen to the whims and directives of those residing across the pond. Whether it is other European countries’ bad economic ideas or the rantings of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, we should be rejecting their lunacy and remembering why America has been the most powerful and broadly admired country in the world. Yet, over time, we have been turning into Europe. More socialism, more progressive nonsense, and a bigger government and ruling class with more central planning have been to our detriment.

While we listen to and ally with the European lunacy, the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) are continuing to follow their own path, becoming more powerful and potentially allying, to our future detriment. Our own foolhardy decisions are handing them more and more opportunities.

It’s time to return to American principles, American ingenuity, and American energy. The people who want to embrace the socialist trappings of Europe have plenty of choices across the pond in which to do so. Leave America alone and let America prosper.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-america-energy-europe,2022-08-22
Roth: Blame the government for our woes,"Every major problem we are facing today is not because of war, but because of the arrogance, ignorance, and incompetence of government central planners and their cronies.

The elites pushing their agendas and their cronies’ pet projects, whether through short-sightedness or nefarious intentions, have delivered an obvious negative outcome for America.

Our economic woes started long before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. And while Putin deserves the blame for war, our government central planners get the full credit for our economic and national security vulnerabilities.

The highest inflation in the last 40 years was recorded before eastern Europe even entered the conversation. This came on the back of central planning decisions, while those central planners feigned ignorance as to the outcome. The Federal Reserve printing trillions of dollars and the trillions more of government “relief spending,” increased further with Biden’s “American Rescue Plan,” were enough to drive substantial inflation. Add to that the decisions that turned off large swaths of the economy over the past couple of years and structurally kept workers out of the labor force, which also disrupted the supply chains and labor markets to increase the inflationary pressures.

Then, include the Biden administration’s suspending oil and gas leases, withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and the crony corporate kowtowing to the elite push for ESG reducing oil- and gas-related investment; these actions all impacted rising gas prices before Putin’s madness came into play.

Once Russia invaded Ukraine, these existing vulnerabilities became bigger weaknesses, something that should have been obvious to the average American, let alone those in government “leadership” positions.

Not expanding the United States' capacity as a producer of oil and gas resources was both a farce and an obvious national security issue. It didn’t decrease the demand for those resources (although the pandemic reactions did temporarily); what it did was shift some percent of the production from the U.S., which has the technology, capabilities, and incentives to produce more cleanly, to nations run by terrorists, tyrants, human rights abusers, and other generally bad people. These regimes and countries share the same planet, yet do not produce as cleanly as the U.S. could.

That’s quite a “green” strategy — both from an economic “green” and an environmental “green” standpoint.

These decisions have reverberations globally, creating vulnerabilities for our allies in Europe, who also reduced their own nuclear and oil and gas energy production, exposing them to geopolitical strife.

So, while we could have been fortifying U.S. production so that one or more foreign bad actors wouldn’t be able to leverage that against us, our government and corporate cronies couldn’t see (or didn’t care) what was flashing in front of them like a giant neon sign and ultimately did nothing on that front.

These actions will only worsen the already fragile U.S. economic situation caused by their other policy decisions.

The average American ends up paying the price, both figuratively and quite literally.

It’s not just oil and gas. The past two years exposed the weakness of depending on China for key inputs and products. The Russian invasion is highlighting other dependencies, ranging from nickel (which is a key component in the batteries used to make electric vehicles, among many other things), aluminum, wheat, fertilizers, and many other products that are key to a smooth functioning economy and everyday living, and some that could even lead to bigger crises, like food shortages in parts of the world.

Instead of strengthening America, both for economic security and national security, the central planning government leaders have been actively making us more vulnerable, taking policy direction from people who range from activist-sponsored teenagers to global entities that would be thrilled with the destruction of the American economy and way of life.

There will always be some bad actor around the corner, and we must be prepared. It’s far past the time to reverse these bad government policy actions and focus on a stronger America and better strategic decision-making.

If we don’t hold government accountable and enact change, then we will only have ourselves to blame.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-blame-the-government-for-our-woes,2022-03-09
Roth: Can the Federal Reserve fix inflation?,"Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation was already being measured at the highest levels in four decades, an outgrowth of overzealous and incompetent monetary and fiscal policy, as well as other nonsensical government policy decisions. The Russian invasion has exacerbated an already bad situation, with the CPI (Consumer Price Index) measure of inflation (one that arguably understates considerably the level of cost increases borne by families) coming in at 8.5% for March.

The Federal Reserve — the same group that didn’t see inflation coming, told us it was transitory, didn’t anticipate the disruptions in the labor market and supply chain, and was enacting accommodative policy by buying securities up until last month — now believes that it can save the economy with monetary policy tools.

As foolish as it is to think that those who created the problems and then didn’t see the outcomes on the horizon will suddenly be economic saviors, it is more foolish to think that their tools could possibly fix what is broken.

Tools that the Federal Reserve uses to enact its monetary policy include changing the target Fed funds rate and buying or selling securities to expand or contract its balance sheet. Lowering the target Fed funds rate and buying securities are expansionary policies meant to lower interest rates, increasing demand for credit and ultimately “juicing” the economy. Increasing the target Fed funds rate and selling securities are contractionary policies meant to slow down the economy.

With inflation continuing to rise, the Federal Reserve has begun to tighten its policy, enacting its first rate hike and signaling it will be contracting its balance sheet, with many current and former Fed members telegraphing the need to do more.

Sure, an increasing interest rate environment can quell some demand-related components of the economy, but how does it fix the supply imbalances that were made worse by reckless policy? The last set of data showed that there are around 1.8 jobs available for every job seeker, keeping wage pressure high. How does monetary policy fix that at all, let alone without tanking the economy? Perhaps it creates such a high cost of living and dents 401ks and pensions in a manner that forces people back into the workforce? Or, it puts even more small businesses out of business, taking away some available jobs? None of those sound like palatable outcomes.

On the housing front, increasing mortgage rates will make housing even more unaffordable than it already was for first-time homebuyers. But with housing undersupplied in the realm of 4 million to 5-plus million homes, and with corporate buyers flush with capital buying housing with all-cash offers, will that really cool off housing enough without creating a slew of other issues on the housing front?

And the underinvestment in energy and health care infrastructure that will continue to show a supply-side imbalance well into this decade isn’t going to be solved long-term with monetary policy.

How does this abrupt policy not tank the economy or the market? In a recent opinion piece in Bloomberg, former FOMC vice chair and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Bill Dudley said, “It’s hard to know how much the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to do to get inflation under control. But one thing is certain: To be effective, it’ll have to inflict more losses on stock and bond investors than it has so far.” His sentiment, along with comments made by current Fed members, doesn’t generate a lot of confidence in the Fed or warm and fuzzy feelings about the market and the economy.

It's unlikely that the Fed, which created this problem, is now going to solve it elegantly. Be prepared to weather the storm, whether that be stagflation (a stagnating economy with high inflation), a recession, or stagflation that goes into the recession.

The Fed and the government have caused this predicament that we are all paying for. We need to stop allowing these damaging policies to continue, because if and when we recover, they won’t have learned a thing.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-can-the-federal-reserve-fix-inflation,2022-04-12
"Roth: DEBUNKED and EXPLAINED: No, greedy oil companies are not to blame for gas prices","U.S. gas prices hit an average of $5 per gallon for the first time last week, according to AAA. Americans are having to spend more of their hard-earned money on energy. But who is really to blame?



It is probably helpful to start with a breakdown of the components of the price of gas.

The cost of crude oil is the biggest cost component of a gallon of gas and can skew the cost. In January, via the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the cost of crude was just over half the cost of gasoline, at 52%. In February it was 61%, and as of March 2022, it was 59% of the total cost of a gallon of “regular” gasoline (diesel varies slightly). Given its overall weighting to cost, changes to crude oil prices have an outsized impact on final gas prices.

The remaining major cost areas include refining, marketing and distribution, and taxes. As of March 2022, refining was about 18% of the total costs, distribution and marketing about 12%, and taxes (federal, state, and local) about 12%, depending on your location.

It is worth noting that gas stations make very little, and they don’t reap windfalls when prices go up. Most gas stations are independently operated, even those that bear a brand associated with a major oil company. It is estimated that a retailer’s markup on a gallon of gas is around 15 cents, and the profit after expenses averages around 2 cents per gallon. Because of this low take, most gas stations supplement their business with selling a variety of other things, from cigarettes to beverages.

The cost of crude

The cost of crude oil is set by factors of supply and demand. Supply/demand imbalances can lead to major swings in the price of oil, as we have seen recently. Of course, there is also a major oil cartel that decides how much to produce at given times, which factors heavily into supply.



On the demand side, the world has seen massive shifts because of decisions made around the world related to the pandemic and the changes in behaviors that brought about. As people were locked down, demand plummeted, and as people emerged from lockdowns, demand increased. When China fully emerges from another series of lockdowns, as the number-one importer of oil in the world, it will add demand to the worldwide market.

In 2021, the U.S. used almost 20 million barrels per day; worldwide, around 100 million barrels per day were used. You can see why President Biden’s PR stunts of releasing a small amount of inventory from the U.S. strategic reserves wasn’t going to have a meaningful, lasting impact on pricing.

On the supply side, in addition to the whims of OPEC+ regarding production, a variety of domestic and international factors impact oil production. The push for green energy has thwarted the progress that the U.S. was making in energy independence and increasing supply. The Biden administration canceling oil and gas leases, shutting down pipeline progress, and having substantial red tape for drilling and production all factor into the market calculations on what supply will be like today and going forward.

Additionally, the demonization of this critical industry, including the push of ESG initiatives to direct capital away from traditional energy projects, has led to substantial under-investment in the sector, which also materially impacts the supply side of the equation. It is estimated that as much as a trillion dollars in investment has been postponed or canceled over the past few years, with a large part of that related to the ESG and green energy pushes.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, looking at the U.S. field production of crude oil, while the U.S. was producing almost 13 million barrels per day of crude oil before the pandemic, we are now only at 11.655 million barrels per day (as of March 2022).

Europe has largely done the same and is paying the price, quite literally, for it. The Russian invasion of Ukraine took already increasing prices and added a new supply constraint on them, to some extent. The EU is still buying, and with the higher prices Putin is on track to make more money on oil and gas exports this year than last year!

Of course, if the U.S. and Europe had been leaning into more traditional sources of energy (along with expanding their green initiatives instead of trying to substitute the latter ahead of time), the supply would be closer to parity with demand than it is today, even with the invasion.

There is also a monetary policy component to this. If the Federal Reserve had been managing interest rates appropriately and not printing trillions of dollars, we wouldn’t be seeing inflation in everything, including oil and gas, at the same levels as they are at today.

Refining

People tend to forget about some of the other costs of gasoline. Refining is the process that turns the crude oil into not only gasoline but a variety of other products and components for products. These costs depend on the time of year and geography, based on laws that require different blends for different times of year and the associated climates. Input costs of items that may also be refined with the gasoline can also impact this cost (think ethanol). The supply-constrained labor market also makes wages more expensive throughout the organizations that do the refining.

Distribution and marketing

Oil needs to get from its location to the refinery. Once the oil is processed into gasoline, it doesn’t magically appear at the gas stations, either. All of the distribution related to eventually getting gas to you is intricate and expensive. Given that energy is required to transport the oil and gas, increasing energy costs end up being a double whammy for you at the pump. Again, the labor market is also making wages in distribution more expensive. The American Petroleum Institute (“API”) says on the marketing side, “Marketing costs are incurred to support the sale of gasoline by the refineries, distributors and wholesalers and the retailer.”

Taxes

API estimates that on average, 57 cents per gallon of gasoline goes to taxes. The federal tax is constant at 18.4 cents per gallon. State and local taxes vary widely. The high is California at 68 cents, and the low is Alaska at 15 cents, with the state average around 39 cents.

At least this is better than in Europe. Accounting firm UHY says that “on average taxes comprise 59% of the cost of the price of petrol and 52% of the cost of the price of diesel.” This high taxation is meant in part to discourage the use of such fuels.

Are the oil companies and greed to blame?

Oil companies work to supply you with gasoline, as well as other petroleum byproducts, regardless of the broader economic situation.

As noted, the biggest component price in gasoline is set by the market, with a thumb on the scale from OPEC+. With several U.S. companies delivering gas products, if one company wanted to charge even more for its products, other companies could take market share by setting a better price. Obviously, the constraint of supply factors in here as well.

During the sharp reduction in demand during the pandemic, major oil companies took huge losses. The five biggest companies (aka “Big Oil”) lost a combined $76 billion. But if you needed gas, they were still there for you. Furthermore, nobody offered to pay more to help them out.

Now that demand has increased far ahead of supply, the market has driven crude prices up, which has given them more revenue and, as that works, more profit.

In a June 10 tweet, Fox Business host Charles Payne said, “In 2020 Exxon lost $22.4 billion; federal government made $25.8 billion on gas taxes,” and pointed out the federal government is likely making much more today.

While people like to look for a scapegoat, price gouging isn’t what we are seeing today.

While it is easy to focus on gas prices because you see them every day, the supply/demand imbalance in the availability vs. need for traditional energy sources shows up elsewhere. It flows (no pun intended) through the entire economy, from the cost of moving goods and components for services to their destinations to a myriad of byproducts, including those impacting the availability and cost of food.

Some may say that price controls are the answer. They are never the answer. They lead to hoarding and less supply and never have the intended outcome.

You may hear that we should nationalize the oil companies. One only needs to look to Venezuela, which used to be the fourth wealthiest country in the world before nationalizing its oil. Now its citizens have a median net worth of zero.

The reality is we need energy. We needs lots of it. We need more of it. All kinds of energy. While new, “greener” sources of energy are being developed and scaled, we should, side by side, be investing in more traditional sources of energy as well, including nuclear energy.

President Biden could change all of our fortunes today and for the future by changing his energy policy. Signal to the markets that more investment will be going to traditional energy, alongside green initiatives. Clear the red tape and reinstitute drilling, leasing, and pipelines.

While we can’t turn on a tap overnight, those kinds of policies would start to show relief at the pump today, but even more importantly, secure our future, financially and in national security.

Roth: SOTU 2022 preview: The state of the union is a mess; here’s how Biden is likely to spin it,"The state of the union is a mess. Inflation is running at a 40-year high, with the prices of everything from energy to food to housing making the cost of American living much higher. Broken supply chains aren’t helping inflation or the ability to get goods and services, and we have substantial dislocation in the labor market. And if that wasn’t enough, many jurisdictions are just starting to dial back onerous COVID-related policies that have trampled on individual rights, with a backdrop of a treacherous geopolitical landscape.

But none of that will stop the president from trying to put a rosy spin on what is going on in America and selling his “accomplishments,” no matter how removed from reality they may be, during Tuesday night’s State of the Union address to Congress and the American people.

Here’s what you are likely in for:

Severe economic gaslighting

As noted above, the economy is in disarray. The administration knows that and will do everything possible to ensure President Biden touts half-truths and statistical spin as reality. Biden will likely talk about the supposed record job creation under his administration. This is a wild claim, given that there have been no new jobs created since the pre-pandemic February 2020 levels; there has been merely the reclaiming of some, though not all, of the jobs lost directly as a result of the government at various levels closing businesses and then re-opening them.

Biden will also likely address low unemployment, due again in part to the low starting point in February 2020 and the large number of individuals who have permanently left the workforce since then, in large part due to government policies.

While he won’t talk about his administration’s role in stoking inflation, from the very unnecessary $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” to canceling oil and gas leases and the Keystone XL pipeline, Biden may trot out wage increases as a highlight, of course failing to mention that these inflationary increases have also not kept pace with inflation overall and that every dollar today buys you substantially less than it did before he took office.

As many Americans haven’t filed their taxes yet and may still not realize that the child tax credit payment they received was in large part an advance, not a gift, he will also likely shout out that policy, again not talking about its role in inflation.

The wild card is the stock market. Knowing that it was a favorite measure of President Trump, Biden may mention that the broader stock market, although currently off its highs, is up since he has taken office, with the S&P 500 hitting 68 record highs during his first year in office and in aggregate, up around 12% since his Inauguration Day. While that’s largely the result of Fed intervention in the market instead of policy and facing challenges from both inflation and a potentially slowing economy, Biden may still try to grab credit here.

Green energy cheerleading

Just a couple of short years ago, the U.S. was energy independent and the leading producer of petroleum and natural gas in the world. Among Biden’s first actions in office was suspending oil and gas leases and withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.

This has created economic instability and national security implications for the U.S. and its allies, particularly given that the European Union reportedly gets 40% of its gas imports from Russia, a number that is expected to increase. It also is counter to “green” initiatives, as it shifts energy production from the U.S., which has the technology and desire to produce more cleanly, to countries that don’t.

However, Biden will likely spin the Russian invasion of the Ukraine as some sort of “proof” on why we need more green energy and why his decisions show green leadership, despite the underlying realities.

He will also likely try to talk about how tough he has been on Russia with sanctions that widely have been criticized as weak.

Taking credit for vaccines and virus cycles

Both President Biden and Vice President Harris during the 2020 election cycle expressed doubts about any vaccine brought to market under Trump. At the State of the Union, we will likely hear Biden shift to taking credit for the vaccines brought about under Operation Warp Speed.

Despite admissions by many politicians and experts that COVID is likely to be endemic and the Biden administration did very little, if anything, to help the situation, as well as more COVID deaths recorded under Biden than prior to him taking office, the president will most likely take credit for safely navigating the country through the pandemic.

For extra pandering, Biden may have some front-line workers in attendance for their heroics during the pandemic, despite the fact that his administration fired any of these heroes who weren’t vaccinated.

Those are likely to be some of the key “highlights” of the president’s speech. It will likely be written to tug on emotions, as there’s only so much he can do to spin the facts and truth.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-sotu-2022-preview-the-state-of-the-union-is-a-mess-heres-how-biden-is-likely-to-spin-it,2022-02-28
Roth: We are in a reality emergency,"We are having a climate emergency. I am sure it’s true because important people have said so. These are the same people who have been wrong about everything of late: solving crime, COVID, printing money, and energy transitions, to name a few. They have pushed a half-century’s worth of climate predictions — all of which I have managed to live through — from acid rain to Manhattan being underwater by 2015. They also travel around on private jets and yachts when they are not living in their massive waterfront properties, because they are the safest places to live in an emergency, obviously.



Yes, I am sure there’s an emergency, but it’s an emergency of indulging people entirely uncoupled with reality.

The ""boy who cried wolf"" routine isn’t cute, it’s destructive. People who are in charge of major decisions have bullied their ways into having their fantasy narratives accepted and acted upon. Large cities and even non-urban locales are experiencing outbreaks of crime because the fantasy crowd said it was mean to enforce laws. They wanted to defund the police and go easy on criminals, which, entirely unpredictably, has empowered the criminals. Stores are being robbed, people are getting attacked and car jacked, and overall, violence is increasing. Even Starbucks is closing stores in formerly desirable locales like Santa Monica, California, and Union Station in Washington D.C., for Pete’s sake!

We were told that printing trillions of dollars and injecting trillions of dollars more of stimulus money into a supply-constrained economy — one that was supply-constrained because those who shut it down didn’t realize there would be consequences — wasn’t going to produce any inflation. Then, we were told inflation was going to be transitory. Then, it was the consumer’s fault and greedy businesses’ fault, all before blaming Vladimir Putin even when inflation hit a 40-year high the month prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now, individuals and small businesses alike have to contend with labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and massive inflation that are all threatening their financial security.

We were told that we have to transition to “green” energy and start to execute a full-scale plan when there was no “green” replacement available at scale or at a viable cost. They said this without a plan and without any consideration of the most clean energy source widely available: nuclear energy. This has led to not only sky-high energy costs in the U.S. but to our president begging countries like Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. This is the “green” equivalent of believing that an unpartitioned smoking section works. And, given that global demand for energy will only increase, this is also not a transition to “green” energy, it’s a transition of our economic and national security into the hands of bad actors around the globe.

You can be a good steward of the planet and its resources and still be in touch with reality.

Now, because they have put everything else in disarray and have nothing to fall back on for their power and money grab, the climate emergency has come out of the playbook. I know preppers — people who are actually concerned about outcomes — and they act accordingly. Riding on a private jet, vacationing in your oceanside mega-mansion, or taking a yacht cruise with friends is not the action of anyone who is concerned about anything other than their own money and power.

The lunatics are running the asylum. This needs to stop. They need to be held accountable for everything that they have gotten wrong. Those areas that they have destroyed and impaired need to be fixed and restored. And it needs to be clear that they don’t get to dictate and bully us anymore. We cannot afford, financially and for the sake of our safety and quality of life, to indulge one more minute of their fantasies.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-we-are-in-a-reality-emergency,2022-07-21
Roth: What the Federal Reserve rate hikes mean for you,"The Federal Reserve has been very active with its monetary policy and resulting market intervention over the last decade and a half, and especially since March 2020 with its extraordinary measures taken in conjunction with the COVID pandemic. The Fed's actions, which included purchasing trillions of dollars in assets and keeping the target interest rate for overnight bank-to-bank lending (called the “fed funds rate”) near 0%, have meant that borrowers paid lower interest costs and savers haven’t been able to earn much of an interest return on their money. Moreover, these actions have been a significant factor in the increases in asset prices and spiking inflation.

The Fed's next scheduled meeting, which takes place Tuesday to Wednesday, is widely expected by investors to result in the Fed increasing the fed funds rate by 25 basis points as a first step toward helping to control inflation (100 basis points equals one percentage point, so 25 basis points is equal to a quarter of a percent). The Fed may also give guidance, or at least some clues, on whether authorities plan to undertake other actions that may impact interest rates, including future rate hikes and shrinking the balance sheet from some of those asset purchases.

How does this impact you?

The fed funds rate directly and indirectly impacts other interest rates in the market. If you have debt that has an adjustable interest rate, that means it changes (as opposed to fixed-rate debt, which is locked in at a particular interest rate), and when interest rates go up, so does the amount banks and other lenders will charge you for interest on that debt. For any adjustable interest rate debt, from credit card rates to mortgages that have an adjustable component, you will see those interest costs increase. You will also find that borrowing will start to become more expensive as well, in terms of the rate that you are being charged to take out a loan or take on other debt.

If you haven’t already taken advantage of low rates, you may want to consider locking in a fixed rate before they rise further.

On the savings front, unfortunately, because there is already so much money sloshing around the financial system, banks are not in substantial need of deposits to lend, and so they won’t likely be raising the rates they offer you on your savings accounts very much. With the latest CPI data showing the highest inflation in 40 years at 7.9% year over year, you definitely won’t be making up for the loss in your purchasing power with any interest income you may make by parking it in the bank.

If you have a business, note that your borrowing costs are likely to rise. And if you invest in individual stocks, take into account the strength of the company’s balance sheet, as companies' borrowing will also become more expensive and companies with high debt levels may become riskier investments.

Whether or not the Fed actions at this and subsequent meetings tame inflation — and if they do, how long it takes to do so — remains to be seen. With the challenges in the supply chain and the labor market, coupled with the ongoing issues related to energy, food, and precious metals exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation will likely get worse before it gets better (and, unless we see deflation, those cost increases will be permanent), so be prepared for that scenario as well.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-what-the-federal-reserve-rate-hikes-mean-for-you,2022-03-15
Progressivism is cancer,"Welcome to the great convergence. The stars are aligning to tell a great tale, just as they always have throughout the eons. And this time, the message seems to be every bit as clear as Orion's belt or the Big Dipper:

Progressivism is cancer.

Three political stars in particular form the backbone of current story. To be sure, this is a story that could change almost completely in the coming weeks and months depending on any number of factors. After all, when it comes to President Trump and the Democrats, it is the idiocy, immorality, and malfeasance of the other that each depends upon most to change their own fortunes.

But when it comes to the present moment, Trump is the one dominating the trophy case courtesy of the progressive cult based on the latest Democratic primary polling data, the impeachment hearings and the particular case of Mayor Pete.

● A recent Marquette University poll has Trump beating Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg in the state of Wisconsin. In the case of Trump versus Biden in particular, that marks a 12-point swing from only August, when Biden was besting Trump by nine points. Furthermore, a national Emerson poll shows Trump's approval rating rising five points to 48 percent in the last month as well as presidential electoral victories against all of the above except a within-the-margin-of-error loss to Sanders.

What happened? Well, the old polls where almost every carbon-based life form beat Trump had a lot to do with an understandable level of Trump exhaustion syndrome due to his grating antics and persona, along with a limited understanding of the field of Dems who would oppose him. But after multiple debates and state-by-state barnstorming, now we all know who we are dealing with. And it's as if we were transported back to 2016, when Better Than Hillary won the hearts of many.

The Democratic candidates are terrible. Again. So Trump wins.

● And guess what? The Democrats in Congress are terrible, too! After more than a week of House impeachment hearings, the viewership for this week's Democratic presidential debate was among the lowest so far in the 2020 electoral cycle. That clearly means that a lot of people, including a lot of voters who lean left, have declared ""Fake News"" to be the most fitting label for impeachment and its feckless propagandists.

There simply is no there there, other than the existence of countless deep state hacks who want Trump gone because he has somehow violated their elitist safe space, after none of them could be bothered to raise a finger when Biden and his son turned Ukraine into their own money-laundering shell company.

● Lastly, there is the Frankenstein monster that is Mayor Pete. A monster that the Democrats have been breathing life into for decades, via various sexual revolutions that have culminated most recently in a Chicago-area school board voting for mentally ill male students (or creeps pretending to be) to infiltrate girl's locker rooms.

Can somebody remind me why #MeToo was ever a thing if high school girls can be so easily preyed upon by the mentally ill and the morally deviant to thunderous applause? But I digress. The crucial point to be made here is that a podunk mayor from a less-than-idyllic city, who was destroyed in the only statewide race he ever ran in, has now claimed frontrunner presidential status in both Iowa and New Hampshire for no other reason than he is gay.

Yet that is clearly an issue with black voters, who have been Democratic loyalists par excellence but frown upon Buttigieg in South Carolina to the tune of giving him 0 percent of their support so far. Yikes.

The rainbows are coming home to roost in the Democratic Party, and I for one am gleefully popping some popcorn to watch the show. How the same people, who have systematically taken the black vote for granted for years while failing to deliver on countless promises concerning racial/urban improvements, will now with a straight face try to shove Will and Grace down their throats in the name of civil rights is a mind scrambler.

So what's it all mean? The D will once again stand for defeated if this keeps up.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/steve-deace-progressivism-is-cancer,2019-11-23
The impeachment process has begun — and the country deserves it,"Allow me to be perhaps the first person in conservative media to come out in favor of impeachment.

Of course, my reasoning is way different from that of the Democrats, but I vote yes nevertheless. Because this is probably the only way to guarantee the vast majority of these taxpayer-subsidized hacks, regardless of party, will be doing any work up there on Capitol Hill all day.

Let's face it, the main reason we're going to see this vapid political theater through to the bitter end is because the political class is bored, and so are the media. The political class has schemed to cynically take all the meaningful domestic policy debates off the table until after the next election. And there are only so many times you can be Politico's anonymous source in between waiting for federal judges to die and be replaced. I feel you, dog.

Then there's we in the media who are so desperate for material we're now click-baiting each other over Swedish children being exploited as Soviet agitprop. That's right, not American children but Swedish children. Where have you gone, David Hogg? A nation turns its lonely clicks back to you.

Indeed, we have so exhausted, abused, and ignored every other morsel of our Constitution except impeachment, why not go ahead and throw another shrimp on the barbie? When in the midst of a cultural implosion, leave no founding principle behind I always say. Get busy dying, or get busy dying.

Sure, it seems a tad ironic that the folks who think the Constitution is a dead letter are here to save it from the cretin in the White House. After all, when putting such relics in the hands of those who don't know what a gender is, what could possibly go wrong? Other than pretty much everything, of course.

That doesn't mean Trump is pure as the driven snow, because he never is. But if the choice is handing the country over to those claiming we're all going to die in 10 years because of what the temperature might be 10,000 years from now, or Trump's lame attempts to live out his Frank Underwood fantasies, I defer to the keen judgment of the great prophet Norm Peterson from Cheers: ""Trump...can't live with him, pass the beer nuts.""

So impeachment it is, then. Not because we care, but because we don't. Teapot Dome, Watergate, a president committing perjury under oath — now those were a better class of corruption. Scandals worthy of their times. Back when men had hair on their chests, as opposed to now, when the non-binary being does.

Instead, we're going down the only way we know how — passive-aggressive. With a president potentially attempting to kind of, sort of threaten but not really a foreign country to give him the dirt on his political adversaries. Which if true could be the dumbest thing Trump has done yet. Why didn't he just use the FBI, like everyone else does?

Many of those crying for impeachment should themselves be impeached, if not incarcerated. Only in a time as stupid as ours would the debate be about threatening to take back the American people's money from the Ukraine, as opposed to giving Ukraine even more of it.

But if you gotta go, go with a smile. At the very least, this promises to be damned funny. With Nancy Pelosi attempting to speak through her face-lifts, Joe Biden attempting to speak at all, and Trump taking a timeout from making indecent proposals to North Korea to punk Mitt Romney every step of the way.

This may not be the impeachment we need, but it will certainly be the impeachment we deserve.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/the-impeachment-process-has-begun-and-the-country-deserves-it,2019-09-25
"The president's supporters are clear: ‘In Trump, we trust.’","One recurring theme at the ""Keep America Great"" rally in Dallas last Thursday was the erosion of trust in America's systems, particularly the media, among the president's supporters.

As I walked through a sea of red ""Make America Great Again"" hats and blue polyester Trump 2020 flags with white block letters interviewing supporters from all over the state, one thing was clear: Their unwavering support for the president.

President Donald Trump had had a tough two weeks before the rally. The U.S. House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry, and the Kurds, America's allies in the fight against ISIS, were attacked by Turkey after the president pulled U.S. troops from northern Syria.

Then, in what was poor optics, the administration announced that the G-7 economic summit would take place at his Doral resort in Miami. He reversed the decision but not before he was pummeled in the media by all sides, including Republicans on Capitol Hill.

It was a bold announcement considering the criticism his administration directed at Hunter Biden, who profited in Ukraine from his father's position as vice president. Hunter reportedly received a salary of up to $80,000 per month while serving on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

But none of that seemed to faze the president's supporters — which isn't a surprise to anyone.

In a Quinnipiac University Poll published Oct. 14, voters were split on impeachment with 46 percent saying he should be impeached and 48 percent saying he shouldn't.

Unsurprisingly, the president's approval ratings remained at 41 percent among registered voters despite a particularly terrible week in the press for a president who faces heavy scrutiny regularly.

Trump's approval ratings have remained between 41 percent and 45 percent for 500 consecutive days, no matter what he does.

And many of his supporters in Dallas reflected that as they waited in long lines to see him at the 20,000-seat American Airlines Center in the heart of downtown Dallas. The event felt more like a concert than a rally.

One question I posed to every attendee I interviewed at the rally was where do they get their news and why.

I know you think every answer was probably Fox News, but it wasn't. They weren't all too happy with America's No. 1 cable news network.

Many of the president's supporters in Dallas told me they're turning to multiple news sources to piece together what they feel they aren't getting from the mainstream media.

""We want to be informed, we don't want to be influenced,"" an older African American gentleman told me outside the rally. He was there with his wife and was wearing a white T-shirt that said, ""The Forgotten Man.""

Negativity from the 2016 general election eroded trust in sources of information greatly. Confidence in the media rock bottomed in 2016 at 32 percent, according to Gallup — the lowest in the poll's history. That number among Republicans was even worse at 14 percent.

Three years later, only 41 percent of Americans say they trust the media, Gallup reported in September, which is down 4 points from last year.

And while 34 percent of Americans get their news online, 44 percent still prefer television news over all other mediums such as newspapers, radio, websites, apps, and social media. Only 7 percent of Americans are reading print news these days, which is down 4 points from 2016.

Press coverage for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trump was overwhelmingly negative during the 2016 presidential election. The media coverage was so awful that it was chastised in a Harvard study that appeared in Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.

""Negative news has partisan consequences,"" Harvard professor and author of the report Thomas Patterson said.

Although negative news coverage isn't a new phenomenon by any means, Patterson said, ""A healthy dose of negativity is unquestionably a good thing,"" but ""an incessant stream of criticism has a corrosive effect.""

And that's what the negative coverage has been: incessant.

That's why when news of something serious comes out about the president's conduct, people are reluctant to believe it.

""Until the early 1960s, news coverage of national politics divided rather evenly between Congress and the president,"" the report said.

But for Trump, that division is lopsided: ""Trump's coverage during his first 100 days was not merely negative in overall terms. It was unfavorable on every dimension. There was not a single major topic where Trump's coverage was more positive than negative.""

The study focused on leading news organizations such as CBS, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.

The only outlet that portrayed Trump somewhat positively was, unsurprisingly, Fox News by featuring coverage that was 34 percent less negative.

That explains why many of the president's supporters appreciate his candor — and his tweets — and come out for his rallies en masse.

Some 18,500 were confirmed in attendance at the American Airlines Center last week and 5,000 remained outside the arena where they watched the president on a giant Jumbotron in Victory Park.

Trump makes his supporters feel as though they're receiving a version of the truth the press doesn't present because of a lack of fair-minded journalists.

Instead of the press learning from their mistakes, they've doubled down on their negative coverage and have now elected themselves as the impeachment press in their latest blitzkrieg.

Can you remember the last positive news story you read about the president or a politician?

Everything is a crisis to the media, and it's becoming tiresome for Americans to read the headlines daily.

It's easy to become apathetic when leading news outlets cry wolf daily.

Patterson said, ""Trump's coverage during his first 100 days set a new standard for negativity. Of news reports with a clear tone, negative reports outpaced positive ones by 80 percent to 20 percent.""

The president's supporters have long felt the negative coverage was inherent, and the study and leaked memos from news execs seemed to substantiate this.

But if that still doesn't convince the president's harshest critics that he's treated unfairly, CNN and the New York Times news executives are on record detailing how they would negatively cover the president using Russia and obstruction of justice as their vehicle.

When that didn't work, they decided to focus on the president's alleged racism.

Yet critics continue to wonder why the president's supporters are enthusiastically devoted to him.

It's not because they're racists who want to maintain the status quo, it's the opposite. Trump shattered the status quo.

Tornadoes form within thunderstorms, they don't just appear out of thin air.

It's undeniable that a figure like Trump was only possible by a perfect storm in modern American politics.

And to reduce his supporters to hillbilly racists is just as intellectually lazy as many accuse his supporters of being.

James Otis — who was famous during America's Revolutionary period for his motto ""Taxation without Representation is tyranny"" — warned: ""When the pot boils, the scum will rise.""

He said this as he witnessed the upending of an entire social class during the American Revolution.

In 2016, that pot boiled, and that scum is rising.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/the-presidents-supporters-are-clear-in-trump-we-trust,2019-10-24
How Trump’s gains in impeachment polls explain extremism on the left,"If polls are any indication, the first week of public impeachment hearings was a dud for Democrats.

Survey results indicate that even after testimony from a roster of ""star witnesses"" and overwhelmingly negative media coverage of the administration, Americans are less convinced now that President Trump should be impeached than they were before they launched their probe into his dealings with Ukraine during depositions in mid-October.

As Democrats head into an election year, they are clearly flummoxed by their inability to move public opinion — and this frustration helps explain an increase in calls for censorship among some on the left, including radically re-defining the First Amendment. A review of impeachment polling data elucidates how we arrived here and where we may be heading.

The FiveThirtyEight average of polls shows that during the month spanning from Oct. 15 to Nov. 15, net support for impeachment narrowed by four points. Several studies illustrate this:

Following the first wave of public impeachment hearings, a plurality of Americans (45 to 40 percent) told YouGov's researchers that the president should be impeached. This is a four-point improvement for Trump compared to their mid-October poll that showed a nine-point (47 to 38 percent) preference for impeachment.

Another November poll from YouGov found a three-point (45 to 42 percent) preference for impeachment and removal—better for Republicans than the net 11-point support for removal by the Senate the pollsters found in their mid-October study.

A Reuters survey released this weekend showed Trump faring slightly better (albeit, within the margin of error) than he did last month. Polls from Morning Consult showed similar findings during comparable periods.



What drove the shift? Three things according to YouGov: Republicans are rallying around Trump; voters are skeptical of Democrats' handling of the investigation; and independents seem unpersuaded by Democratic arguments.

In October, GOP voters opposed impeachment by a 62-point (77 to 15 percent) margin that has since grown by 10 points. Additionally, despite Democrats' focus group-tested ""bribery"" charges, a plurality of Americans believe the president's actions do not amount to impeachable offenses. Forty-three percent said Trump's activities were either appropriate (17 percent) or inappropriate but do not warrant removal from office (26 percent), compared to 39 percent who said they do.

Perhaps the most striking statistic is that nearly half of independents who watched or heard about the public hearings told researchers that House Democrats were ""playing politics,"" while 36 percent said Democrats questioned witnesses in good faith.

In fairness, the Democrats' PR goal with the hearings is not to ingratiate themselves with voters, but to generate headlines that will blunt Trump's momentum heading into 2020. To that end, they've had success.

A recent analysis found that 96 percent of the nightly news coverage of Trump on the three broadcast networks has been negative since the Ukraine scandal broke. Conversely, they dedicated a measly four minutes to positive economic news, a sliver of the 398 minutes of reporting on the controversy.

Paradoxically, as Democrats shaped the scope and tone of the prevailing media narrative, public opinion has trended in Trump's favor. In fact, the president's approval rating currently mirrors Barack Obama's at this same point in his presidency, despite enjoying a scintilla of his predecessor's glowing press coverage.

Another problem for Democrats is that a large number of Americans distrust the media while a growing share of voters receive their news from sources they are not as adroit at influencing. Progressives enjoy a home-field advantage in newsrooms, but they lag behind Republicans on websites like Facebook where the most popular articles are regularly from conservatives.

Democrats face a dilemma: they have a political need to curb Trump's appeal (which they often achieve with his help), but their efforts yield diminishing returns the more voters see of them and their allies. Their leftward flank is aware of this predicament, but ideological rigidity blinds many of them to sensible solutions.

Progressives are philosophically predisposed to view politics through the prism of power struggles. When you combine this tendency with progressivism's absence of limiting principles, vast swaths of the media refusing to check the left's worst impulses, and Democrats' frustrations with Trump's political resilience, the result is unabashed extremism. This is evidenced by calls for censorious policies by Democratic officials and pundits; the nationalization of industries run by political rivals; and breaking up social media enterprises. These are not merely public policy objectives; they are means to acquiring greater political control.

Conservatives should brace themselves and offer a better pathway forward. Things will likely get worse before they get better.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/trumps-gains-in-impeachment-polls-explain-extremism-on-the-left,2019-11-21
Roth: Senator Warren is pounding companies over inflation. She should be censuring herself.,"Politicians like to pretend they are “for the little guy.” Democrats, especially progressive Democrats, doubly so. Which is why it should come as no surprise that Senator Elizabeth Warren is once again trying to find a way to blame companies for inflation. This time it comes in the form of a bill asking companies to explain why they are increasing prices.

This is the worst kind of dishonest deflection. If she wants to censure and hold accountable anyone for inflation, it should be herself, along with her colleagues and the agency they give a mandate to, the Federal Reserve.

The rampant inflation we are experiencing is largely due to policy decisions, period. It results from monetary and fiscal policy that “printed” trillions of dollars out of thin air and put it into an economy that was substantially supply-constrained. Moreover, the economy itself was supply-constrained due in large part to the policy decisions made over the past two-plus years by government at all levels.

Elizabeth Warren in 2020, alongside the majority of her colleagues, voted for trillions of dollars in COVID “relief” spending. She didn’t push to rein in the Federal Reserve and its printing of trillions and suppression of interest rates after the stock market hit all-time highs in June 2020; in fact, the Fed ran with that policy until just a couple of months ago.

Again, in 2021, with the Biden administration now at the helm, Warren and a majority of her colleagues voted for what stoked an already kindling fire — the “American Rescue Plan.” Despite the economy being primed for reopening across the country and vaccines rolling out, and despite the pleas from many people who understood the impact of doing so, she and her colleagues supported Biden in throwing another $1.9 trillion in to the already heating-up, supply-constrained economy.

This has caused rampant inflation, which hit a 40-year high before Putin got near invading Ukraine. That, of course, exacerbated gas prices and other energy costs, which wouldn’t have been the issue if Warren and her Democratic colleagues hadn’t been railing against fossil fuels for years.

But instead of having a shred of honesty, Warren wants to ensure this “crisis doesn’t go to waste” in trying to pin this on corporations. She blames them for inflation, saying they are being greedy, as if only in the past year or so, they decided to pursue greed as a strategy.

In fact, many companies are having a hard time keeping up with inflation themselves — even the biggest companies that have been consistently favored by government policy. This week, Walmart and Target stocks have been pummeled in the market, losing around $65 billion in market capitalization over two days, because of the impact on their business from inflation. As Yahoo Finance reported, “Walmart and Target both saw serious margin pressure as inflation in the supply chain bore down on financial statements. The discounters were caught flat-footed in not raising prices fast enough to offset inflation's ugly tentacles.”

Warren and other members of the political class always want to pass the buck, but the buck should stop with them. They have added trillions upon trillions of dollars to our national debt. They have made policy that has destroyed the value of your savings. They have put up barriers to wealth creation. There is no other entity that has destroyed the living standard for the average American more than the U.S. government.

Warren and her colleagues need to stop blaming corporations and take a hard look in the mirror. And the rest of us need to start demanding some real accountability.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/warren-companies-inflation-government,2022-05-19
WTF MSM!? Adam Sandler’s SNL skit reminds us how political comedy used to be,"Rip-roaringly funny … On Saturday, comedian-actor Adam Sandler – who often shows up on lists of Hollywood conservatives – returned to ""Saturday Night Live"" to host the program for the first time. During the ""Weekend Update"" segment, Sandler reprised his Opera Man character and reminded us all what political comedy used to be like, when comedians made fun equally of Republicans and Democrats.

The entire segment is classic Sandler, but it was the political comedy part that stood out. The Gen X Sandler started by making fun of how the Democratic field is coming down to more Baby Boomer men, yet again. Then he switched to Joe Biden's penchant for groping and hilariously tied it to President Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels. This wasn't what-aboutism; it was just comedy. Neither Trump nor Biden was spared. Watch the rest for yourself.

Weekend Update: Opera Man Returns - SNL www.youtube.com

This whole segment goes back to a time in late night when hosts were sure to be equal-opportunity jokesters. Nobody knew Johnny Carson's politics or Jay Leno's. Dana Carvey became friends with the Bush family after his sometimes biting impersonations of George H.W. Bush.



Today's comedians and entertainers, paralyzed by political correctness, could learn a lot from the four minutes Sandler performed Saturday.

Laying the groundwork for 2020 … CNN's Chris Cillizza took time on Monday to ratchet up some groundless hysteria over the idea that Trump would refuse to concede the 2020 election. Cillizza asks, ""What happens if Donald Trump refuses to admit he lost in 2020?"" Cillizza must mean like Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, and Al Gore, to name a few, right? This is straight-up #ResistancePorn.



Cillizza's argument is that Trump is laying hints all over the place by attacking the media's handling of the bogus Russian collusion narrative, election fraud, and other actions. This, Cillizza argues, is preparation for Trump to refuse to leave office.

What this really is: Cillizza is laying down a marker early, so that if there is election fraud, or something else that steals the election from Trump, he can point back and say he warned us all. Cillizza uses Nancy Pelosi's reported ruminations about Trump not accepting an election outcome to make the case that he would actually do it in 2020.

Cillizza is once again merely carrying the #Resistance's water.

Kamala Harris can't stop expressing 'joy' to Joy Ried,"Vice President Kamala Harris is becoming notorious for her embarrassing tendency to repeat certain words or phrases when she speaks.

Who could forget the time she weirdly repeated the phrase “the significance of the passage of time” four times in less than 30 seconds?

And then there was the strange ""word salad"" speech in which she kept repeating the phrase ""work together"" over and over in a single rambling sentence.

Most recently, the vice president got stuck in yet another speech loop, this time seemingly inspired by the person she was speaking to, or at least that person's name: Joy.



During an interview with MSNBC host Joy Reid, the vice president repeated the word ""joy"" four times in about 30 seconds while responding to a question about the Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation hearings.

""I will tell you, Joy, I experienced great joy when I watched this brilliant, phenomenal black woman, jurist, be so smart and just cut through the political gamesmanship they were attempting to incite,"" Harris said of Jackson. ""And she just was composed and, as far as I'm concerned, was taking a whole lot of people to school. And I watched with incredible joy because it was brilliance being displayed for the entire country to see, and I cannot wait to see, that will only be matched by the joy that I experience when I see her take the oath to be the next justice on the United States Supreme Court.""

Videos of Harris' comments circulated on social media have prompted an interesting array of responses.

Speaking of ""Veep Thoughts,"" BlazeTV's Stu Burguiere has been keeping track of the vice president's most mind-blowing words of wisdom in his ""Veep Thoughts by Kamala Harris"" series. Here are a few fun favorites in case you missed them:

'He's the whistleblower': Judicial Watch president tells Eric Bolling the REAL reason for Democrats' Russia-collusion obsession,"In this episode of ""America with Eric Bolling,"" Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton explains what he calls the real reason behind the Democrats' never-ending Russia collusion obscession.

It was never about Russia or Ukraine, Fitton asserted. President Donald Trump was targeted to protect then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, and their cohorts in the State and Justice Departments from prosecution for corruption that took place during the Obama administration.

""This is why there's an impeachment,"" Fitton explained. ""Because the president dared to ask questions about [Joe Biden's and Hillary Clinton's] corruption. And he [Trump] gets impeached for asking questions. He's the whistleblower.""

Chaos, disorder, turmoil, volatility, and lawlessness have cast nearly every corner of our nation into darkness. In past decades, it was the media who shined a light on corruption and evil, but these days the darkness never felt more enveloping. Today's media claim ""Democracy Dies in Darkness,"" yet they've blanketed our country under a veil of lies, misinformation, and propaganda.

It doesn't matter if you're Republican or Democrat, black or white, rich or poor, we all know we're being kept in the dark. But in the blackest of darkness, even the smallest flicker of light can become a lighthouse to those who are seeking the truth.

Wednesday, Glenn Beck was back at the chalkboard to uncover what our politicians on the left have been doing in Ukraine and to reveal how the media is intentionally misleading, and in some cases blatantly lying, to help them cover it up. This is Part 2 of a 3-part series to expose the truth about Ukraine and the impeachment inquiry, with all the evidence to back it up.

WATCH: 'Glenn Beck Presents: Ukraine: The Final Piece',"The media and the Left drove the now-failed Trump impeachment narrative from the very beginning. When it came to the July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, they wanted us to see only one thing. Now, it's time to look at the bigger picture.

In his fourth and final special on the corruption in Ukraine, Glenn Beck connects the dots between the phone call that led to the impeachment of President Trump and why an investigation into Hunter Biden is so important. Ultimately, this was never about Donald Trump. It wasn't even about the Bidens. This is about a violation of constitutional power by former President Barack Obama that will horrify even his most ardent supporters.

Glenn pulls back the curtain on the theft of billions of dollars in international funds to Ukraine by following the clues in the phone call. Those clues could lead to mountains of corruption — and Hunter Biden might be the linchpin to uncovering the entire thing.

Russian sanctions great reset,"Why is the west slamming Russia with sanctions on everything, while also refusing to increase our own oil production? This week on the Glenn Beck Podcast, Glenn sat down with former MTV video jockey and co-host of the “No Agenda” podcast Adam Curry — the man who introduced Joe Rogan to the ESG movement and its role in the Great Reset.

Adam and Glenn took a hard look into the terrifying realities playing out around the world, including in Ukraine, and agreed that something’s very ""off"" about the global response to Russia’s invasion. But Adam had a shocking theory as to why.

The billionaire elites behind the World Economic Forum's Great Reset agenda — including chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink, newly-appointed chair of Pentagon Defense Innovation Board Michael Bloomberg, and Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) chair Mark Carney — make no secret of their plans to transform the global financial system. Adam told Glenn he believes part of that plan is to destroy the value of the ""petrodollar,"" the system that designates the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. And they don't intend to let the crisis in Ukraine ""go to waste.""

""Anyone who has a brain will say, if we're taking away petroleum and oil and we're replacing it with 'renewables,' doesn't that screw up the petrodollar?"" Adam said.

""So, now we have a Putin-Russia ... kinetic attack ... and we're hitting back with what? Financial weapons. Why? Why are we using financial weapons? I believe this is it, Glenn: never let a crisis go to waste. This is the tipping point we need to price energy so high ... that the idea is to shut down global production because of the [high] cost of energy,"" he explained.

""But don't worry, [the government] will take care of you, just like with COVID,"" Adam added sarcastically. ""[They]'re going to send you money. This time, though, not a check. This time, it's your Federal Reserve digital dollar, and then we're in deep trouble and I don't think that's stoppable. I think that is unstoppable at that point — but I'm a doomer-optimist, so I have I have ideas and solutions.""

Russiagate was 'a dirty political trick': Ex-AG Barr says Durham uncovered 'seditious' acts against Trump,"Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann was acquitted on Tuesday of lying to the FBI in 2016, a significant setback in what was the first case from special counsel John Durham's investigation to go before a jury.

Durham was appointed special counsel in 2020 by then-Attorney General Barr to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Barr joined the ""The Glenn Beck Podcast"" to explain why he believes Hillary Clinton’s Russiagate scandal was “seditious,” and why he thinks the U.S. legal system really is ""rigged against Republicans.""

Barr told Glenn he was ""very happy edging into retirement"" in 2018, but felt duty-bound to answer then-President Donald Trump's call to help stop what he saw as an impending ""constitutional crisis.""

""I thought we were heading into a constitutional crisis,"" Barr explained. ""Whatever you think of Trump, the fact is that the whole Russiagate thing was a grave injustice. It was a–, it appears to be a dirty political trick that was used first to hobble him and then potentially to drive him from office.""



""It was a gross injustice,"" he added. ""And it hurt the United States in many ways, including what we're seeing in Ukraine these days. You know, it distorted our foreign policy and so forth. But I felt that [Trump] was not getting his due as president. He was entitled, having won the election, to implement his administration and they ... had him on the ropes.""









In reference to the ongoing Durham investigation, Glenn said it often feels like ""the whole system is absolutely rigged against"" Republicans.

""I do think there is a degree to which the system had a double standard, and still has a double standard, and is rigged against Republicans,"" Barr stated.



""There are parts of the Department of Justice that I think have a double standard, and they will pursue Republicans,"" he continued. ""For an example, while I was Attorney General, no case that was embarrassing to the Democrats was leaked, okay. However, cases that hurt Republicans were leaked.""

Marty has devoted his career to safeguarding financial freedom from the tyranny of the government and elites — a major focus of his newsletter “Marty’s Bent” and podcasts, including “Tales from the Crypt.” He’s critical of the globalist vision for our financial future, which he sees as the result of a “progressive” movement to get rid of God.

On the podcast, Marty warned that the FTX scandal could make a convenient excuse for centralizing Bitcoin and ushering in more state control, mass surveillance, ESG, and social credit scores. In fact, he said, the Federal Reserve’s push for a digital dollar has already begun.

WATCH: CIVIL WAR: The Way America Could End in 2020,"We're being set up for a civil war. The Left is grooming us for an Eastern European-style revolution this election, and they're not even trying to hide it anymore. The playbook for MainStreet USA is the exact same that has been used in places like Ukraine, initiated by the same people in order to completely upend the American system.

On his Wednesday night special this week, Glenn Beck takes us through a tale of three chalkboards that will connect the dots: the Obama administration in Ukraine, the State Department's relationship with George Soros, Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots, the Great Reset, public school indoctrination, mail-in voting.

It all points to something dangerous happening in November if we don't act now.

Biden Cover Up Hunter Documents,"The Biden classified documents story is not just a story of hypocrisy by the media and the DOJ. It’s about time and TIMING. Why did the Biden classified documents story get leaked to the press THE SAME WEEK the New York Times wrote a story on Hunter Biden ADMITTING that his business deals with Ukraine and China were shady — but that Joe Biden was apparently in the clear? And why are we hearing about Biden’s classified documents, allegedly first discovered days before the midterm election, only NOW? When you put the entire story up on a timeline, it reveals something deeper, bigger, and more nefarious. It tells you a story the mainstream media and the White House DON’T want you to know and opens up new questions of corruption, cover-up, and potential election interference. BlazeTV host Stu Burguiere fills in for Glenn and is joined by JustTheNews.com founder and award-winning journalist John Solomon. They discuss John’s latest report on Biden family business deals that paid off for the Chinese in big ways. Plus, in a bizarre twist, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department has kept the FBI away from the classified documents evidence and has trusted Biden’s lawyers to “self-report” anything amiss. Solomon explains why the two-tiered approach to President Trump and Biden is important: “This means Biden’s lawyers could be witnesses in a criminal case.”

"BLM’s SCAM Exposed: Money, Mansions & Marxism","Glenn continues to monitor the war in Ukraine and its ramifications for America, but there is another war that has raged across Democrat-run U.S. cities for almost two years – a crime wave largely brought on by over-corrective policies intended to appease BLM activists.

We were told there is nothing more important than ending racism in America, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has been at the forefront of that movement, raking in donations to change “racist” America. Glenn continues his investigation into BLM Inc., and it turns out everything isn’t exactly on the up and up.

One of the first major examples we saw of the Great Reset and ESG in action came during the summer of 2020, when corporations gave tens of millions of dollars to BLM. At the time, it was hard to understand why companies were dumping millions into an organization that was openly against capitalism and the traditional family. And why did the money continue to pour in, even after violent demonstrations raged in over 200 U.S. cities? What was the money actually for? And what happened to it? Glenn exposes the BLM scam and its intimate connections with the power structure of the Democratic Party.

'Nobody pays for a damn thing!' Glenn Beck has had ENOUGH of the left's unchecked corruption,"Glenn Beck has had enough of exposing scandal after scandal, just to have everyone look the other way: Benghazi, Hillary Clinton's emails, Joe and Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine and China … the list goes on, but no consequences are paid. Now, the media have called the election for Joe Biden and insist no one can question it. But for many of the more than 71 million people who voted for President Trump, our search for the truth isn't over yet.

On his Wednesday night special this week, Glenn called out the left's long list of alleged corruption that has gone unchecked and stressed that Donald Trump's legal team must be allowed to go through the process of investigating the multiple allegations of election fraud to ensure our voting systems are fair.

""I don't know about you, but I'm tired. I am worn out. I am fed up!"" Glenn said during his opening monologue. ""I've had enough. I am tired of exposing corruption, doing our homework, even going overseas and having documents translated to make sure they're exactly right, [and] presenting the evidence ... except, once we expose it, nothing happens. Nobody goes to jail. Nobody pays for a damn thing any more!""

Farmland WARS: The global TAKEOVER of America’s land,"On tonight's show, Glenn paints a picture of a world war that is raging right now between globalist and nationalist authoritarians. All sides want absolute control, and they will get it by locking down farmland, food, energy, and the money supply. This is what the Great Reset is all about, and it has shifted into an entirely new gear.

In some parts of the world, war involves bombs and bullets. Glenn reveals why Ukraine is so crucial to the globalist agenda and why it’s so important to nationalists like Russia, China, and Iran. But the war is being fought more covertly in other parts of the world, including our own backyard.

American farmland is vanishing. Energy is being transitioned into forms the globalists can completely lock down. And our finances are being shifted toward a system that can be shut off or taken away at the whims of the federal government. The endgame is full control and power, and we are the only ones standing in the way.

Glenn Beck BLM California,"With the war in Ukraine and inflation at home, why would Glenn Beck talk about Black Lives Matter Inc. Wednesday Night?

Well, Glenn believes that things are beginning to come clear about why corporations would dump millions into an organization like Black Lives Matter that is openly against capitalism.

As Glenn looked deeper into where BLM's unaccounted donations went, things might not be on the up and up.

Now, even the states of Washington and California have had enough of BLM's financial funny business. But, will this finally be enough to tank this corrupt leftist powerhouse?

Almost two years ago, Glenn Beck first looked into BLM's fundraising. All donations to BLM in 2020 — during all the post-George Floyd hysteria — were donated through ActBlue. ActBlue was the go-to payment portal for four major Democratic party organizations.

According to Glenn, ActBlue takes 3.95-percent of each donation as a processing fee. However, last year, ActBlue reported to the IRS that for 2020 it earned over 3.1 million dollars in processing fees from BLM donations.

Glenn observed that, according to the Washington Examiner, if 3.1 million dollars represents the 3.95-percent that ActBlue kept in processing fees, that means that in addition to the 60 million dollars, more than 78 million dollars donated to BLM came in small-donor donations in 2020.

But in 2021, Glenn said, ActBlue reported earning 517 thousand dollars in fees from BLM. That would mean another 13 million dollars in donations. So, where is that money?

Glenn explained that after collecting its fee, ActBlue sent the rest of the donations to Thousand Currents, BLM's fiscal sponsor. Thousand Currents also charged BLM a 15% handling fee.

""Wow,"" Glenn said, ""so that was 20% of everything raised, gone."" The non-profit industry-standard rate is between five and ""if you want to be grotesque"" 10%. After taking its significant cut, Thousand Currents sent the money on to BLM? But, under fiscal sponsorship, rules Thousand Currents was required to report how its funds would be spent.

Glenn learned that on July 20, Thousand Currents decided to get out of the fiscal sponsorship business, leaving BLM to seek a new fiscal sponsor. Guess who BLM chose? Who else — the George Soros funded Tides Foundation, of course.

In late January, California's Department of Justice warned BLM they had 60 days to comply with financial reporting requirements, or it would hold BLM's leaders personally liable.

""You know it's bad when California and Washington are on your case,"" Glenn said.

Glenn Beck: Marie Yovanovitch committed 'perjury' when she LIED under oath about 'do not prosecute list',"During Friday's Democrat-led impeachment inquiry hearing, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified under oath that she did not give former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko a ""do not prosecute list"" in 2017. Yovanovitch also doubled-down on left-wing disinformation saying that Lutsenko ""acknowledged that the list never existed"" in April.

""I want to reiterate first that the allegation that I disseminated a ""Do Not Prosecute"" list was a fabrication,"" Yovanovitch told the House Intelligence Committee. ""Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who made that allegation, has acknowledged that the list never existed. I did not tell Mr. Lutsenko or other Ukrainian officials who they should or should not prosecute.""

""That is such a lie,"" Glenn Beck said on Friday's show. ""She should be held for perjury.""

During a three-part BlazeTV exposé on the Democrats' corruption in Ukraine, Glenn debunked what he called ""the most misleading fabrication I've ever seen by the mainstream media.""

Earlier this year, award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon reported Lutsenko's claim that then-Ambassador Yovanovitch gave him a list of ""people whom we should not prosecute"" during a meeting in 2016. Shortly after Solomon's article was released, several news sources, including the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, reported that Lutsenko retracted his statement.

But Glenn's research revealed that the mainstream media got their erroneous information from a Ukrainian news site called Unian, which misleadingly headlined a story ""Ukraine Prosecutor General Lutsenko admits U.S. ambassador didn't give him a do not prosecute list,"" based on a misinterpretation of what Lutsenko told another Ukrainian publication, TheBabel.

When Lutsenko said Yovanovitch ""gave"" him a list, he did not mean she actually handed him anything in writing, but verbally conveyed the names of people he shouldn't prosecute.

""They never mentioned the fact that it was verbally dictated and he wrote the list down himself — are you kidding me?"" Glenn exclaimed. ""This is how the media is fact-checking and debunking. They are playing with our republic and Ukraine's republic. They are planting dynamite all around everything that we hold dear. How do they sleep at night? Everyone that reads their stories actually thinks that there was a retraction of one of the most damning parts of this entire case.""

Glenn Beck State of the Union,"Glenn brings the ACTUAL state of the union, because what America got last night was the Disney version. Joe Biden played the role of Elsa, hoping all of us would just “let it go” after a full year of probably the worst start to a presidency Glenn has ever seen. And no, your ears weren’t deceiving you, as President Biden had the audacity to finally admit our kids need to be in school. You weren't hallucinating, as he finally mentioned the border. He made a very brief pit stop at the economy before pivoting to his new apparent slogan: Building a Better America.

Why does BABA sound like baby talk? Glenn takes a deeper dive into some of the World Economic Forum lingo, because Biden’s comments on the Fed, Build Back Better (or BABA), and Ukraine are all linked together. The financial attack on Russia, though a necessary deterrent, could possibly be the framework for something MUCH bigger, and Glenn reveals it all.

He’s also joined by a power panel of BlazeTV hosts Stu Burguiere, Steve Deace, Pat Gray, and Dave Rubin.

Ukraine Crisis Digital Dollar,"Glenn Beck warned that Great Reset elites were looking for the next “serious crisis,” and … enter Ukraine.

The global corporate community has UNITED with world governments to defeat Putin and Russia’s invasion. The West’s answer was to turn on an economic weapon of mass destruction. But not just against the Russian government. Russian civilians have been forced to feel the pain too. It’s the very same economic enforcement built under the Great Reset with ESG.

Glenn warns this economic WMD model could also be used against Americans found “treasonous” under Biden’s administration. With a new Axis power hostile to the U.S. and its dollar, the president has responded with another path to full control and submission through a DIGITAL dollar being built RIGHT NOW. Glenn reveals what this programmable dollar will look like and what it all means for you. ESG could be enforced with the press of a button. Privacy would be a thing of the past. And local banks probably won’t survive. The crackdown is coming.

Glenn Beck: How to prep for global food shortage crisis,"The things Glenn has warned about are coming true. Elites at the “World Government Summit” asked if we were ready for a ""new world order,"" and Biden recently told CEOs, “There’s going to be a new world order… and we’ve got to lead it.”

Fact-checkers seized on the story to make sure we all understood the president was just describing “international changes from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, not confirming a world domination conspiracy theory.” But Glenn Beck argues it can be both.

We need to know what to look for as things begin to spiral out of control AND how to prepare. Inflation continues to spike at record numbers, not only here at home, but in other economic powers like Germany. A recession is all but guaranteed to happen, and we’ve always found a way through it. But we’ve never been faced with what we’re now seeing. The labor market and supply chain are still rocked by the pandemic, while war rages in an area that supplies a vast amount of fossil fuels, precious metals, and food.

A recession can easily become a DEPRESSION. But the Biden administration is trying to propagandize us into accepting lower living standards. Officials want us to rely on them rather than on ourselves, but self-sufficiency is the way out of this. Our grandparents dealt with this during the Great Depression, and we must now learn from their example. Glenn shows Americans what every household must do before it is too late. Nobody will be laughing at preppers any more.

'Color Revolution': The Obama Admin's plan UPEND America—and it's all happening NOW,"The former ambassador to Russia under the Obama Administration, Michael McFaul, came up with ""7 Pillars of Color Revolution,"" a list of seven steps needed to incite the type of revolution used to upend Eastern European countries like Ukraine and Georgia in the past two decades. On his TV special this week, Glenn Beck broke down the seven steps and showed how they're happening right now in America.

Here are McFaul's seven steps:

1. Semi-autocratic regime (not fully autocratic) – provides opportunity to call incumbent leader ""fascist""

2. Appearance of unpopular president or incumbent leader

3. United and organized opposition – Antifa, BLM

4. Effective system to convince the public (well before the election) of voter fraud

5. Compliant media to push voter fraud narrative

6. Political opposition organization able to mobilize ""thousands to millions in the streets""

7. Division among military and police





Glenn explained each ""pillar,"" offering examples and evidence of how the Obama administration laid out the plan for an Eastern European style revolution in order to completely upend the American system.

Last month, McFaul made a obvious attempt to downplay his ""color revolutions"" plan with the following tweet:

Two weeks later, he appeared to celebrate step seven of his plan in this now-deleted tweet:









As Glenn explains in this clip, the Obama administration's ""7 Pillars of Color Revolution"" are all playing out – just weeks before President Donald Trump takes on Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the November election.

WATCH: Rudy Giuliani says he has PROOF Joe Biden was business partners with Chinese Communists,"Tonight at 9 p.m. ET, 8 p.m. CT, Glenn Beck goes straight to the source of the biggest story in the country with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who takes us directly into Hunter Biden's alleged laptop.

Despite Big Tech's attempts to squash this story, there should be a mad scramble in the media to get to the bottom of major corruption allegations, but they're willfully ignoring it. However, this is not just a story about Hunter Biden.

This is all about Joe Biden. It's a story Glenn has been investigating for over a year that traces back to Ukraine and China. It goes directly to the root of corruption within our political system: How politicians use their family members to enrich the entire clan and sell out their country.

While the media looks the other way, Glenn asks Giuliani to show us the evidence. Giuliani details the chain of possession of the laptop and reveals news that he only had possession of the laptop days before the New York Post story broke. He says, ""I reported this the day after I saw it.""

He also drops a major bombshell on the show and says Big Tech doesn't want you to see evidence that ""establishes with texts, documents, contracts"" that ""Joe Biden was a 10% partner with a Chinese communist … and there are witnesses that will come forward and testify to it.""

Russia economic new world order,"Glenn Beck believes something has been off with the world’s reaction to the Ukraine invasion since the beginning.

Have you noticed how all the private corporations of the world have come together at an unprecedented level? They are now moving in tandem with world governments in the largest public-private partnership the world has ever seen. Now, McDonald's shut down all its restaurants in Russia. Why? Glenn says it doesn’t make sense unless you understand the Great Reset. And Russian oil just may be the last nail in the coffin to usher in the economic new world order.

On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Glenn connects it all at the chalkboard and asks: How much are you willing to sacrifice to help Ukraine? Because those sacrifices are coming. Over half of Americans are already living paycheck to paycheck, but CNN says Americans are okay with paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine.

Glenn retells the “Titanic” movie, but with Russians, oil prices, and an economic weapon of mass destruction. In this version of the story, the iceberg is still there and President Biden is steering us straight toward it.

"Sam Harris confirms, justifies 'Left-wing conspiracy' against Trump","Sam Harris, a neuroscientist, philosopher, New York Times bestselling author, and host of the reputedly non-partisan and intellectually honest ""Making Sense"" podcast, just destroyed his own credibility, if not his entire career, in less than two minutes by finally admitting what he really thinks about free speech and censorship.

On the YouTube show and podcast ""TRIGGERnometry,"" with hosts Konstantin Kisin and Francis Foster, Harris addressed censorship of the New York Post's now-infamous Hunter Biden laptop story ahead of the November 2020 election.

“Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in his basement, I would not have cared,” Harris stated. ""Whatever the scope of Joe Biden's corruption is ... — getting kickbacks from Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine ... or China — it is infinitesimal compared to the corruption we know Donald Trump is involved in.""

Harris goes on to admit that suppressing the information found on Hunter Biden's laptop until after the was ""absolutely"" a ""Left-wing conspiracy to deny the presidency to Donald Trump,"" but argued that ""it was warranted.""

""I'm sorry ... but you've just said something I really struggle with there,"" Kisin interjected. ""You're saying you are content with a Left-wing conspiracy to prevent somebody being democratically reelected as president?""

""It was a conspiracy out in the open, but it doesn't matter what part's conspiracy, what part's out in the open,"" Harris responded. He went on to justify the election-influencing ""Left-wing conspiracy"" by suggesting that President Donald Trump was the equivalent of ""an asteroid hurtling toward Earth.""





On a recent episode of Glenn TV, Glenn Beck discussed the most recent findings in the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. Don't get distracted by the seemingly endless stream of scandalous photos and videos, Glenn warns, it's what's coming out about Hunter's overseas business dealings that should be all over the media, because Joe Biden is involved too.

Glenn Beck dismantles media lies on Ukraine corruption: 'The most misleading fabrication I've ever seen by the mainstream media',"During a BlazeTV special on Wednesday, Glenn Beck exposed how the mainstream media are blatantly lying to help cover up what left-wing politicians have been doing in Ukraine, which has directly led to the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

""It's probably the most misleading fabrication I've ever seen by the mainstream media,"" Glenn said during his special titled ""Democracy DOES Die in Darkness,"" the second of a three-part series. [Watch Part 1 here.]

Glenn explained that the media have been repeating an intentionally misleading narrative that negates one of the most crucial claims alleging Democratic corruption in Ukraine.

Earlier this year, award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon reported that the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko said that then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gave him a list of ""people whom we should not prosecute"" during their first meeting in 2016.

Shortly after Solomon's report was released, so-called trustworthy news sources like the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal made the claim that Lutsenko retracted his statement and that there wasn't a ""do not prosecute list.""

""They lied their ass off to the American people,"" Glenn asserted. ""The media started blatantly making stuff up, writing their own fabricated story to hide what really happened. They initiated one of the most misleading lies I think I've ever seen from the media.""

Glenn revealed that the media got their erroneous information from a Ukrainian news site called Unian, which misleadingly reported that Lutsenko ""admitted that U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch did not give him a do not prosecute list,"" based on the fact that Lutsenko told another Ukrainian publication, TheBabel, that by ""gave"" he did not mean Yovanovitch actually handed him a list, but verbally conveyed the names of people he shouldn't prosecute.

Ukraine quid pro quo: Was Trump acting in the national interest? Was Biden?,"Democrats and the mainstream media are doing their best to convince Americans that President Donald Trump betrayed the nation by asking the Ukraine president to dig up dirt on his 2020 political opponent, Joe Biden.

At the same time, they insist that then-Vice President Joe Biden was only acting in the nation's best interest when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if Ukraine leaders didn't derail an investigation into widespread corruption involving Biden's son, Hunter, in 2016.

During a special program on BlazeTV Wednesday, Glenn Beck had a few key questions that he said the White House, and anyone else who cares about the truth, should be asking as the impeachment inquiry against President Trump goes forward.

Was it in the national interest to find out if Russia tried to influence the 2016 election?

Was it in the national interest to find out if Trump colluded with Russia to hurt the DNC candidate?

Did the fact that the DNC might have benefited from the Russia investigation mean we shouldn't have pursued this national interest?

Would the fact that Trump might benefit from a Ukraine investigation mean we shouldn't pursue this national interest?

Which is more in line with America's national interests?:

A.) Withholding additional funds until the recipient country:

Tracks down $7 billion in U.S. aid that went ""missing"" Investigates governmental corruption and foreign agents influencing U.S. elections Finds out if politicians are colluding with foreign governments to steal from the American treasury

Or

B.) Withholding U.S. aid unless the recipient country stops investigations.

""The answers to these [questions] are very clear,"" Glenn said. ""Unless you just can't stand it, unless you have a reason, a visceral, emotional feeling of 'I just want this guy [Trump] out!' Then this logic goes out.""

WATCH: Biden's Cabinet Secrets: Marching Toward the Great Reset,"Joe Biden's administration is getting ready for something historic, but we're all being distracted. And now that Biden has hired at least 14 former or current executives from Big Tech — experts at colluding to censor unflattering news about Biden — Americans must be laser-focused on what's coming.

On Jan. 20, the most corrupt president in American history will be inaugurated, and it looks like some of his Cabinet choices were picked specifically so everything just – poof – goes away. The administration nominees appear to be all about preserving corruption, crony capitalism, and executing a Great Reset. Those same people also have one more thing in common: Ukraine.

Tonight at 9 p.m. ET (or 8 p.m. CT), Glenn exposes their radical agenda in their own words and gives U.S. senators the questions they must ask before confirming corrupt nominees to some of the highest offices in the country.

Mark Levin MSNBC Journalist Compares Republicans War Ukraine,"When it comes to hating America, the kings of the left-wing media reside at MSNBC. Need proof? Mark brings the goods as Ali Velshi spews his Marxist propaganda while smearing America and Israel.



You have probably noticed that the people who hate America tend to hate Israel. People on the hard left, whether in the media, the Democratic Party, or academia, hate Israel. They won't call it anti-Semitism, but that's what it is. The standards that they apply to Israel, the attacks on Israel, they don't apply to any other free democratic country on the face of theEarth: France, Britain, Spain, or Germany.

On this episode of LevinTV, Mark reviewed a clip from MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi. In this clip, Velshi said he would soon leave Ukraine with a ""heavy heart,"" primarily because of the suffering he witnessed there.

Velshi claimed he was deeply inspired by the Ukrainians he encountered and that they ""showed the world what an existential fight for democracy looks like."" At the beginning of the war, Velshi decided to concentrate on the many aspects of the war in Ukraine and brought viewers less coverage of other ""important U.S. stories.""

Now, brace yourself for what Velshi says next. According to Velshi, his MSNBC colleagues ""did an incredible job staying on top of those important stories"" and ""holding power to account.""

Velshi listed the other ""important stories"": ""The continued attacks on voting rights; abortion rights; gay rights; trans rights, and the ongoing brazen attempts to subvert American democracy"" and said those stories are ""not unrelated to the basic rights under attack in [Ukraine's] fledgling democracy.""

""It's utterly unrelated, you damn fool!"" Mark exclaimed. ""The Ukrainians are being slaughtered. There's genocide taking place, and atrocities of the worst kind.""

Mark explained that Ukraine, in reality, more reflects and resembles Republican/conservative views on culture, morality, and governance than the radical left point of view.

Then, Velshi likened the Israeli government to countries like Afghanistan, Syria, China, Myanmar, and India.

""Unbelievable,"" Mark said. ""To throw Israel in with Syria, Afghanistan, and Myanmar? Are you kidding me? [Israel] is an open society. They have a free press, a judicial system, and an opposition party.""

""This guy dares to include Israel in his list of tyrannical totalitarian countries, and he attacks Republicans, conservatives, and Israelis while standing there, in Ukraine,"" Mark said. ""Shameful and shameless. What goes on on this network, MSNBC, is disgusting.""

Mark Levin strategy against Putin,"Mark Levin described Putin's ruthless invasion of Ukraine as having revealed his evil ambitions. As the west mobilizes against his atrocities, Putin turns to threatens the use of nuclear weapons against all who come to Ukraine's aid.

Now, Mark and others are asking if ""it would be so bad to take Putin out."" So, why is the Biden administration willing to settle for the slow death of Ukraine? Mark tackles these questions and goes on to explain different ways Ukraine can be helped without sending troops to the battlefield.

Mark Levin: Congress not supporting NATO allies,"Under Joe Biden's inept foreign policy, the world has become a powder keg of conflict, with Ukraine and Taiwan serving as the latest fuses.

According to reports, ""Nearly 64,000 troops stationed in Europe could be deployed to the continent's eastern flank if President Biden makes such a call to counter growing Russian aggression at the border with Ukraine...40 warships, 175 aircraft and 90 tanks situated throughout Europe could also be readied for conflict.""

""I remember when we had 1,500-2,000 tanks in Europe. I am quite concerned that we don't have that many [up to 2,000] tanks in Europe, quite frankly, "" Levin said.

""Here's what they [the Biden administration] are concerned about,"" Mark began. ""Ukraine is a huge deal. But Ukraine borders on four NATO allies. The concern is that once Russia gets ahead of steam, will they stop?""

Levin's primary concern is not going to war with Russia over Ukraine, as Biden has already said the U.S. is not be sending troops into Ukraine to fight the Russians. ""Biden seeks to strengthen NATO allies, hoping to keep the fighting from bleeding over,"" Levin explained.

Levin emphasized that a much more significant concern is communist China going after Taiwan and other areas where China can gain control. If China is not bad enough, Iran is months away from having nuclear capabilities.

Congress could band together to support our NATO allies, but Mark reminds us that Congress is too busy trying to chase former President Donald Trump and pass massive inflation bills to be concerned with standing unified with our allies who are currently staring in the face of war.

Russia's Ukraine Mark Levin,"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine provides a timely opportunity for a critical thinking exercise.

Suppose you are the leader of Russia, China, Iran, etc. Consider Biden's tragic exit from Afghanistan in August 2021, and the strained relationship that disaster created with our NATO allies. Wouldn't you see the present as a golden window of opportunity to carry out your war-filled dreams? After all, what America has in President Joe Biden is a commander in chief who Mark Levin, host of ""LevinTV"" noted, is incapable of defending The United States of America.

In this clip, Mark addressed a video from NBC Today that covered the developing situation of Russia and Ukraine. If you follow politics, you are well aware that what we see on the surface usually does not reflect reality. Mark highlighted the general principle, pointing out the implications of what a Russian invasion of Ukraine means.

""The fear is, the Russians will cut through Ukraine and then start gobbling up little pieces of other countries,"" Mark assessed, meaning the fear is that Russia will gain control of new territory. Mark added that the United States is not in the best position. Watch the clip for a clear breakdown of what is unfolding between Russia, Ukraine, and potentially NATO.

Mark Levin Unloads on Biden Administration Radical Policies,"Problems we're facing in America are one man's fault: Joseph R. Biden Jr. His policies are destroying the United States of America, and it's not because Russia invaded Ukraine. It's because the democrats have invaded the Oval Office.

The laws of economics are being abused as Biden wants to add another $6 trillion to our $31 trillion in debt.



BlazeTV host Mark Levin of “LevinTV” erupted over the Biden administration's destructive policies that continue to chip away at our once-great nation. Ladies and gentlemen, take note of the tone of Mark's voice in this clip. His passion, anger, and ability to take his knowledge of history and apply it to what is crumbling down. All around us is powerful and poignant.

""Radical Democrats are destroying our economic system. They're destroying your pensions and whatever salary and bonuses you are receiving. They're driving up medical costs, creating food shortages, and next thing you know, we will have brownouts, blackouts, and gas shortages,"" Mark said.

Ask yourself this question: Are we better off now than we were four years ago?

Mark Levin on Biden's 'not weak at all' Russia sanctions,"In this clip, LevinTV host Mark Levin dissecs Joe Biden's 'not weak at all' response to Putin's war in Ukraine.

Mark explains that U.S. President Joe Biden's weakness in Afghanistan and his failure to raise military funds to cover the cost of inflation, among other things, led to the economic sanctions currently being implemented against Russia.

""His decisions have weakened this country,"" Mark says. Western governments say sanctions will create financial pressure on Russia, and will send a ""strong signal."" But sanctions are also said to have little effect on Russia's economy.

'The second impeachment of an innocent man': Mark Levin sounds off on 'unconstitutional' Trump impeachment,"From the nearly two-year, $32-million Trump-Russia probe to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment sham to the current impeachment charade, the ""rabid, Trump-hating Democrats"" have been using taxpayer's dollars to cripple the Trump presidency with subpoenas, document requests, witness hearings, criminal investigations, and private allegations, since day one — and time after time, they've come up with nothing, BlazeTV's Mark Levin said on ""LevinTV"" Tuesday.

Levin noted that Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who claimed during the first impeachment hearings to have seen ""overwhelming evidence"" of the then-president's alleged impeachable conduct, is now acting as witness, juror, and judge in the current Senate impeachment trial, due to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' decision not to preside over the first trial of a former president in U.S. history.



""This man is going to sit as the presiding officer, in lieu of the chief justice of the United States, overseeing the second impeachment of an innocent man,"" Levin said of Leahy. ""The second unconstitutional impeachment of an innocent man.""

why-ukraine-gave-up-nukes,"As Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-fledged military invasion of Ukraine, BlazeTV host Mark Levin recalled how the United States, along with the U.K. and Russia, guaranteed Ukraine ""national security"" if it gave up its sizable nuclear arsenal, the third largest on earth in 1994. But in 2014, Putin gambled that then-President Barack Obama was all talk and no action and invaded eastern Ukraine. Obama was obliged to confirm his suspicions and did nothing.

In this clip, Mark unpacks Russia's terrifying track-record of subjugating Ukrainians and explains why he thinks Putin won't stop until he has forcibly taken over Ukraine.

CROWDER has several problems with Liberal MAGA murderer's release on bail,"A North Dakota man charged with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that killed a Republican teen says he doesn't want his life or job jeopardized.

Shannon Brandt, 41, reported himself to police after chasing and mowing down 18-year-old Cayler Ellingson and was released on $50,000 bail. Brandt told police that he has ""a job, a life, a house, and things that I don't exactly want to see go by the wayside....family that are very important to me.""

Steven Crowder had several problems with Brandt's release. ""That shouldn't happen,"" Crowder said. ""When you dehumanize people, it is okay to treat them inhumanely.""

Brandt did not understand why he had to post bail for his crime. This infuriates Crowder because he believes this is a manifestation of an entitled mentality.

Crowder said he wants to see Brandt jobless, homeless, and penniless and stressed his belief that Brandt is an ""entitled little pr*ck,""

About Brandt's Charges

In North Dakota, criminal vehicular homicide is defined as ""causing the death of another person while driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol in violation of North Dakota's DUI laws. A person with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08% or more or impaired by drugs or alcohol to the degree that renders the person incapable of safely driving is considered ""under the influence.""

Brandt's Call to Police

According to reports, “Brandt stated that the pedestrian called some people and Brandt was afraid they were coming to get him,” the document continues. “Brandt admitted to State Radio that he hit the pedestrian and that the pedestrian was part of a Republican extremist group.”

Is Biden MORE polarizing than Trump?,"Who is more divisive: Donald Trump or Joe Biden? Well, that depends on your definition of ""divisive."" Steven Crowder believes that Trump and Biden have been part of the division of Americans but ""in two very different ways.""

In this clip, Crowder said Trump was divisive because ""he pointed what we all knew for a long time but too many people were afraid to talk about, including Republicans: That the media is dishonest and the Left were liars."" Donald Trump is divisive because he pointed that out, Crowder said.

""Biden is divisive because now he is a part of the lie,"" he added.

Crowder compiled a list of policies and compared them for a clear picture of who looks more divisive on paper: Click here for more.

Trump vs. Biden's most ""divisive"" policies: Joe Biden (SOURCES: Time, CNN, AmericanMilitaryNews, RealClearPolitics, NBC) Biden sent tax dollars to fund abortion overseas when he revoked the Mexico City policy.

His tough-on-China stance and tariffs brought jobs back. Forced Mexico to stop migrants coming to the border by levying a tariff.

Who was tougher on Russia? Trump (SOURCES: ABC, New York Times, Brookings, TheHill) Armed Ukraine. Shuttered all consulates in Russia. Sanctioned Russia over human rights abuses, cyberattacks, 2018 election interference, and the occupation of the Crimea.

Biden (SOURCES: NYPost, USAToday, StateDept, Politico, BBC)

How Biden's Russia Sanctions FAILED As a Deterrent,"President Joe Biden is notorious for making incoherent statements that leave us scratching our heads.

Thursday, President Biden addressed NATO about the current situation in Ukraine and the way the United States is handling Russian President Vladimir Putin. During his speech, Biden said something that, if true, flies in the face of every narrative peddled by the mainstream media and the White House before yesterday.



According to Biden, and in stark contrast with comments from both White House Press secretary Jen Psaki and Vice President Kamala Harris, sanctions on Russia were never meant to deter Putin from attacking Ukraine. Instead, the U.S. president said that ""sanctions are meant to bring pain.""

'It's like 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse' with a conservative spin': Alex Stein made a major announcement,"BlazeTV will air ""Prime Time with Alex Stein"" in the Spring of 2023 with host Alex Stein (@alexstein99). During Tuesday's coverage of the midterm elections, Glenn Beck checked in with Alex while he was live from a GOP watch party with the Dallas County Young Republicans.

""What is the show going to be, Alex?"" asked Glenn. Alex descried the show as ""a very experimental show ... like a 'Pee-Wee's Playhouse' with a conservative spin."" Alex joked that all of the proceeds would go to Vladimir Zelenskyy and the fight they are currently having in Ukraine.

Unvaccinated child denied lifesaving care,"Doctors at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina, have refused a teenage girl from Ukraine a kidney transplant because she's not vaccinated against COVID-19, say her adoptive parents.

Lee and Chrissy Hicks, the adoptive parents of 14-year-old Yulia, joined BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey on ""Relatable"" this week to explain how doctors have refused to move forward with the kidney transplant their daughter desperately needs.

""Chrissy and Lee are Christians. They're an Army family. They adopted Yulia and her brother from Ukraine early last year and love her as their own flesh and blood. And they are begging for help for their daughter,"" Allie began. ""Yulia ... has a genetic kidney disorder. She needs surgery, and the hospital is saying she cannot get this surgery without getting the COVID vaccine.""

""The hospital actually played semantics with us,"" Lee explained. ""When we probed them on the requirement to have the vaccine shot, they said it's not a requirement. It's actually a recommendation. But if you don't follow their 'recommendation,' then [Yulia] won't get the kidney transplant. So that makes it a requirement.""



The Hickses — who have eight biological children and three adopted children — knew that Yulia suffered from a rare kidney disorder that would eventually require a transplant when they adopted her in 2021.



""We took [Yulia] to Duke immediately because we didn't know how long it had been since she had been seen,"" Chrissy said. ""She needed to go on dialysis basically immediately. Her kidneys, I think, were at 13% function or something when we got her.""

Chrissy explained that Yulia started dialysis at home in August 2021 and that most of her care is done at home. She also noted that Yulia has had the coronavirus, which she was ""completely, 100% over"" in less than 24 hours, but that when she and her husband asked to have their daughter's natural antibody level tested, they were ""shut down.""

The couple explained that doctors at the hospital dismissed their questions and concerns about the COVID vaccine.

""[Doctors] were almost draconian about the whole thing ... basically, what they said [was] 'if you're not going to follow our recommendation, then you're not gonna get a kidney,'"" Lee said.

""This child ... her and her brother have been through so much lately, in the last few years. I mean, a family adopted them in 2018, and that didn't work out. After about a year, they sent the boy back to Ukraine to just go away. And then they sent [Yulia] to Arizona to another family to kind of go away. And then, that family kept her for about four months and sent her back, after they got her brother back, after about a month,"" he continued.

""So then we got a phone call ... from someone who knew we were close to Raleigh, and they said, 'Hey, can you go pick these two up because they're going to be arriving in about three hours and no one's going to come to get them except for the police.' So, sure, I said absolutely, we'll go get them. And so we did,"" Lee explained. ""We were just going to keep them for the weekend to try to figure out what was going to happen. We rearranged our lives a little bit to kind of help rectify the situation that [the children] were in. Then we, of course, adopted them without hesitation, really, because we just said, 'Hey, this is what God wants us to do.' And now we're at this point of getting a kidney because she needs it, and these doctors are saying no because you won't get this vaccine, which has been known to hurt children.""

A GiveSendGo fundraiser has been set up to help Yulia's family with expenses associated with out-of-state medical care and transplant surgery.

A SOBERING on-air admission about the state of Western Democracies,"""How should Christians respond when God uses adversarial foreign leaders to punish nations who have turned from him? As Russia invades Ukraine, which supposedly has a large Christian population, but is one of the most corrupt nations globally, how do Christians in America respond?""

BlazeTV host Steve Deace answered the question of how Christians might respond using a personal story to drive his point home.

""No, differently than we would in any other situation - What glorifies God? What is true?"" Steve said. ""I get the emotional tug…I have not admitted this on the air, but I will admit something to all of you. I have a borderline level of unbiblical disdain for our government and Western democracies for the most part after the last 24 months and counting.""



Steve cited a significant factor for his disdain as the trend of making everything binary. In Steve's view, practically the only thing that the West doesn't want to be binary in Western culture today is one of the only things that God says is binary - male and female. ""Are you a saint or a sinner? Are you saved from your sins, or are you dead in them? God says these have to be binary,"" Steve said.

Yet those are all the things Western culture says are no longer binary. The practical things or Pagan philosophically are the things we're to think of as binary.



Steve concluded that he despises Western democracies in their current form because of the globalist agenda, which has more profound implications for America's future. So, how does this relate to Russia and Ukraine? Steve explained that globalist groups like the World Economic Forum play a predominant role in western democracies, and this creates craven nature's binary temptation to root for Putin. In other words, does sharing a common enemy with our enemy make us friends?

""Here is the problem with that,"" Steve said. ""I'm not supposed to be a prisoner of my Craven nature anymore. I'm supposed to have a discernment level that transcends our Earthly binary fallacies. So, back to my original answer to your question, brother, it's not easy, but it's simple. We should handle a situation like this like we would anything else. What glorifies God, and what is true?""



In Steve's view, the temptation for Christians is going to be when we recognize the game plan: ""Zelensky is the new Fauci, Putin's the new virus, right? When we realize the new implementation of the same demonic Paradigm, that brings us back quickly.""



From a strategic standpoint, Steve explained, those in the dissident crowd in the west are anti-globalist, anti-World Economic Forum...would it be better if Vladimir Putin whooped the World Economic Forum in Ukraine? Yeah, probably. But would it be good or would it be better? Good and better, Steve cautioned, are not always the same.

10 Most Significant Stories of 2022,"On the final episode of 2022, ""The Steve Deace Show"" covered the ten most significant stories of 2022.

Listen to the full episode here.

10. Canadian Trucker Convoy Truckers from across Canada protested vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions with a ""Freedom Convoy"" that began in British Columbia and made its way to the nation's capital with tens of thousands of supporters.

9. Selling Out The House of Representatives on Friday passed the ""Assault Weapons Ban of 2022,"" a bill that would ban various semi-automatic guns, though the measure would grandfather in firearms that people already own. ""It shall be unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon,"" the text of the bill states. ""Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession, sale, or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of enactment of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022."" Republican Reps. Chris Jacobs of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania joined most Democrats in voting for the bill, but Democratic Reps. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against the bill. Read more.

8. Ukraine The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in first-world weaponry to Ukraine since its invasion by Russia. House Republicans, poised to take control of Congress in January, are now pressuring the Biden administration for greater accountability and transparency about these weapons transfers as well about other aid packages sent to the embattled Slavic nation. The push for greater oversight comes after it was revealed that there have only been two in-person weapons inspections conducted by U.S. monitors since February.Read more.



7. Inflation Tiffany Wilding, an economist who works for investment management giant PIMCO, explained on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the report is deceiving because certain measurements skew the data. ""There is a little bit of noise that you have to take into account because inventories and trade numbers can obviously be very volatile. If you dig into the details of the quarter three GDP numbers, what you find is when you exclude those more volatile categories, growth was pretty subpar,"" she said. ""For the year as a whole — excluding those categories, we call that 'final domestic demand' — growth is sub-1%,"" she explained, noting that 2021 saw ""robust"" growth of 5%. Read more.

6. Groomers U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a Democrat who lists the gender pronouns ""She/Her"" in her Twitter biography, is publicly praising Drag Queen Story Hour, a program that features cross-dressers reading books to children. ""Across the country, books are being banned, which are depriving our nation’s youth. But thanks to @NYPL and programs like Draq Queen story hour, NYC’s next generation are getting a well rounded education about LGBTQ+ issues and gender identity,"" Maloney tweeted on Monday. Read more.

5. Ron DeSantis Florida law requires that elected officials tender an irrevocable resignation if they seek another office the term of which would overlap with the term of their current office. ""No person may qualify as a candidate for more than one public office, whether federal, state, district, county, or municipal, if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other,"" the law explains. ""No officer may qualify as a candidate for another state, district, county, or municipal public office if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other without resigning from the office he or she presently holds."" Read more.

4. Elon Musk Buys Twitter Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk reportedly fired four top executives from the leadership of Twitter on Thursday after completing a deal to buy the company. Musk reportedly fired Twitter chief executive officer Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, top legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett, according to a report from the New York Times that cited confidential sources. The report said at least one executive was escorted out of the offices after he was fired. Earlier on Thursday, Musk outlined why he was buying the popular platform. Read more.

3. Depopulation One may have thought that Bill Nye’s new Netflix show had reached its lowest point with a crude and anti-science song about genitals and gender theory, but beyond the nonsense, the former children’s show star is also floating the theory that bringing children into this world ought to come with government-imposed penalties because of climate change. On the season finale of “Bill Nye Saves the World,” entitled “Earth’s People Problem,” the former children's show star turned panderer to millennial nostalgia and hype theory discusses overpopulation, asking a panel whether or not “we should have policies that penalize people for having extra kids in the developed world?"" Read more.

2. The Red Wave That Wasn't Imagine how amazing things could have been had we woken up last Wednesday morning with Republicans winning 54 seats in the Senate and 250 seats in the House. We’d be off to the promised land, right? Wrong! Actually, from a policy perspective, we’d be in the same place we are today, sans the much-needed introspection that is taking place deep in the souls of conservative politicos — an introspection we’ve needed for decades. It’s not about Trump per se, and not even so much about McConnell and McCarthy. It’s that we are the true RINOs — Republicans in name only — in a party that has never shared our values for most of its history. Read More.

1. Roe Overturned The Supreme Court of the United States officially overturned Roe v. Wade, and the debate over abortion rights has been given back to the states. On this historic day, BlazeTV hosts celebrate the Supreme Court's incredible decision and take a look at some of the insane reactions as the left comes completely undone.Read more.

"With Lawmakers like this, what could go wrong — besides everything?","Ukrainian President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Congress this morning, partly in English, and seemingly tried, once again, to drag America into a third world war.

""We need you right now. Remember Pearl Harbor? The terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you? I'm addressing President Biden. You are the leader. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the world leader means being the leader of peace,"" Zelenskyy said.

On Wednesday's episode of ""Steve Deace Show,"" the popular segment called ""What Happened While We Were Away"" highlights recent moments that many would consider embarrassing. But our brave elected officials powered through their incoherent statements and lies with their chins held high, leaving the rest of us to wonder, what could go wrong — besides everything?

Last week, Nancy Pelosi held a press conference where she made the following statement:

""Putin is trying to bait the trap, and that could be the beginning of World War III. Putin is totally irresponsible in using weapons that are not allowed under the Geneva convention. Putin, who threatens use of chemical weapons, nuclear and the rest ... myself, when I see those tanks ... I'd like to take out those tanks ... but I am not a military strategist.""

You are probably asking yourself, ""what did I just read? Have I consumed alcohol and wasn't aware of it?"" You aren't alone.

Kamala Harris seriously repeats the word seriously,"Vice President Kamala Harris wants you to know that we seriously have to take serious stuff super seriously, and, sadly, we're being perfectly serious — the vice president of the United States has made yet another seriously embarrassing speech.

Our nation's second in command has become known for her embarrassing habit of impersonating a broken record. Like when she got stuck repeating the word ""joy"" over and over during a painfully awkward interview with MSNBC's Joy Reid. Or the time she weirdly repeated the phrase “the significance of the passage of time” four times in less than 30 seconds. And who could forget the strange ""word salad"" speech in which she repeated the phrase ""work together"" six times in a single rambling sentence?

During a statement Wednesday on the tragic July Fourth mass shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, Harris appeared to be trying to convince us all that she's taking ""this stuff"" very seriously.

“We have to take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are, because you have been forced to take this seriously,” Harris stated.

The vice president was immediately and quite “seriously” lambasted on Twitter:

BlazeTV's Stu Burguere, host of ""Stu Does America,"" will be adding this latest nugget of wisdom from Vice President Harris to his ever-expanding collection of ""Veep Thoughts by Kamala Harris."" Here are a few classics:

Poll shows nearly 80% think Trump could have won in 2020 if voters knew the TRUTH about Hunter Biden laptop,"Nearly 80% of those surveyed said they believe President Donald Trump would likely have been re-elected in 2020 if voters had known the truth about Hunter Biden’s now-infamous laptop, according to a recent national poll.

As you may recall, the New York Post broke the story in October 2020 that a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden had been left at a repair shop in Delaware, and it revealed that the Biden family had been up to all kinds of very lucrative naughtiness in Ukraine, China, and other places. But the story was censored on social media and ""debunked"" by the mainstream as “Russian disinformation.""

Since then (and well after the election), the Washington Post, the New York Times, and others have confirmed that the laptop and its contents are authentic, and Americans believe the cover-up had a major impact on the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, according to a poll conducted by Technometrica Institute of Policy and Politics (TIPP).

“A significant majority — 78 percent — believe that access to the correct information could have been critical to their decision at the polls,"" TIPP reports.







The survey of 1,335 adults also found that 74% of respondents believe the FBI and CIA intentionally misled voters when they claimed the laptop was Russian disinformation, and 81% want an ""independent special counsel"" to further investigate Hunter Biden’s laptop.





And for good reason, as even Mark Zuckerberg admitted on the Joe Rogan podcast this week.

On ""Stu Does America,"" BlazeTV host Stu Burguiere called out the blatant double standards in the way the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department handled the Hunter Biden laptop revelations or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified records, compared to the way they treated former President Donald Trump's handling of records that were allegedly relocated to Mar-a-Lago as he departed the White House.

Glenn Beck: Adam Schiff is a LIAR — and we have the proof,"On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck didn't hold back when discussing the latest in a long list of lies issued by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) during the Democrats' ongoing endeavor to remove President Donald Trump from office.

""I'm going to just come out and say, Adam Schiff is a liar. And he intentionally lied. And we have the proof. The media being his little lapdog, but I'll explain what's really going on, and call the man a liar to his face,"" Glenn asserted. ""No, I'm not suggesting he's a liar. No, I'm telling you, he's a liar. ... Adam Schiff is a lying dirtbag.""

A recent report in Politico claimed Schiff ""mischaracterized"" the content of a document sent to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) as evidence against President Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. Read more on this here.

""Let me translate [for Politico],"" Glenn said. ""House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff lied about a text message exchange between two players in the Ukrainian saga. And we know it, because of the documents that were obtained by Politico.""

A few of the other lies on Schiff's list include his repeated false claims that there was ""significant evidence of collusion"" between the Trump campaign and Russia leading up to the 2016 presidential election, his phony version of President Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine, and his retracted claim that neither he nor his committee ever had contact with the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower. And the list just keeps getting longer.

Democrats say Alexander Vindman's testimony on Trump-Ukraine call is 'extremely disturbing',"Democrats described Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's testimony during a closed-door deposition for the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, as ""extremely disturbing,"" reported NBC News.



Vindman, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, said in his opening remarks that he ""was concerned"" after listening in on the July phone call between President Trump and Ukraine's president, which is at the center of the Democrat's impeachment probe.

On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck noted that the transcripts of the Trump-Ukraine phone call were released to the public last month, and that even Vindman admits that there is no new information in his testimony.

""What you're going to see on TV all day long are quotes from this Ukrainian expert. His name is Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is speaking with Congress today in the impeachment inquiry, and he's going to speak out against Donald Trump. Now, the reason why this is a big deal is because he was actually on the phone call. He heard it himself. When you hear that, you'll think, 'Okay, maybe there's more to the phone call',"" Glenn said. ""No ... we all know what happened on the phone call because we've all read the transcripts. So, nothing new here to see.""

Biden family scandal EXPOSED,"Award-winning journalist John Solomon, who has been discredited and smeared over his reporting on Hunter Biden and Ukraine, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Wednesday after a thorough investigation found nothing false in his reporting.

Solomon, who is now the CEO and editor-in-chief of Just the News, recently underwent an intensive review by The Hill for articles he published concerning Hunter Biden's sketchy business deals overseas. But the news publication didn't find a single factual error in any of his reporting,

""The truth of the matter is an avalanche of facts were held behind the dam of censorship,"" Solomon told Glenn. ""But, you know what? The dam is breaking and the facts are flowing and overrunning the dam now. And soon, the American people are going to know the truth in spite of the news media, and that's a good thing for all of us.""

Glenn listed just a few of Solomon's most ""earth-shattering"" articles, all of which were discredited and labeled as misinformation but have now been confirmed.

""Somebody has to pay a price,"" Glenn said. ""Because those people are still in this administration, many of them, and doing possibly [more of] this or worse, because nobody has paid a price.""

""You couldn't have said it better,"" Solomon agreed. ""All of those stories and the counterattacks against me and Peter Schweizer ... all of that incoming fire was to keep us from the truth of what we really wanted to get, which was that Hunter Biden was running an influence peddling scheme, enriching his family, and cashing in on his father's name.""

Solomon went on to detail his latest findings, explaining how Hunter Biden and his business partners played both sides during the 2014 Russia-Ukraine war in order to enrich themselves while his father was vice president. He also gave evidence that Joe Biden was ""far more involved"" in Hunter's schemes than the media will admit.

""Joe Biden can't escape that story line if and when the indictment comes down,"" Solomon said.

Biden admin wants to use Veteran resources for border,"The House approved a new aid package for Ukraine of nearly $40 billion, which will increase the total U.S. funding for Ukraine's war efforts to a whopping $58 BILLION since March, if the package passes in the Senate. Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified before Congress that the Biden administration is considering diverting resources away from an already-struggling VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) to deal with the border crisis.

""I am not making this up -- this will [make] your head explode,"" Glenn Beck said in the radio program Thursday. ""They are going to divert costs; the Biden administration is taking money from the VA. Now already, our veterans get seconds, and we are [considering] diverting VA funding, and doctors, and nurses, away from our vets and to the migrants at the border, so we can take money that we don't have, $58 billion, and send it to Ukraine. What the hell is wrong with us?""

""Now, some Republican lawmakers are attempting to fight this,"" he added. ""But, most people haven't even heard of this. This is how the atrocities at the border go unchecked. Biden sweeps it all under a rug. The mainstream media covers it up. And, meanwhile, people suffer and die. And in this case, it's not only the people on the border, but it is also our veterans in VA hospitals.""

Glenn went on to detail the unreported deadly consequences of Biden’s border policies which have led to enough fentanyl to kill millions of Americans pouring across the border and terrorists having found easy paths into our country.

"Biden blames high prices on COVID, Putin, no ... gas companies","The Biden administration has been accusing oil producers of refusing to expand operations to help offset skyrocketing gas prices. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden even wrote a letter to seven major U.S. oil refiners, essentially saying that the administration is prepared to use emergency orders to force companies into compliance if their ""greed"" just doesn't stop.

""Your companies need to work with my Administration to bring forward concrete, near-term solutions that address the crisis,” Biden wrote. The letter went on to accuse refineries of capitalizing on the war between Russia and Ukraine, gleaning record-high profits while Americans suffer record-high pain at the pump.

But no matter how he tries to convince you otherwise, President Joe Biden isn't trying to bring down gas prices. In fact, he's doing just the opposite, Glenn Beck said on the radio program Thursday.

""Why aren't the oil companies putting more oil out? Well, they're a couple of reasons. And none of those have to do with Joe Biden. None of them, even though it was Joe Biden that said, when he was running [for president] that he was going to put oil out of business.""

Glenn first played a clip of then-candidate Biden saying, ""No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period.""

The next clip had White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifting the blame for high gas prices from Russia's war with Ukraine to U.S. oil refineries.

""We want you to act. It's time to act,"" Jean-Pierre said, addressing U.S. oil companies. ""We have done our part, with the strategic oil reserve. We are calling on them to do the right thing, to be patriots here. And to not use the war as an excuse or as a reason to not put -- to not put out a production, to not do the capacity that is needed there.""

A third clip showed Biden’s climate envoy John Kerry saying in no uncertain terms that the U.S. “absolutely"" does not need to drill for more oil and gas, during a talk with the USC Center for Public Diplomacy

The Biden administration has made it clear that insanely high gas prices are all part of the plan to eliminate fossil fuels. But the problem doesn't stop there. The ESG war against oil industries is being waged across the world.

Glenn read an op-ed from Vivek Ramaswamy that explains how BlackRock is manipulating corporations like Exxon to decrease oil production, while Americans continue to suffer majorly at the pump.

Glenn Beck reacts to Biden’s 'kleptocracy' gaffe,"President Joe Biden has suffered yet another embarrassing gaffe during a Thursday speech asking the U.S. Congress for an additional $33 billion Ukraine aid package. But this latest example of cognitive failure has caused more concern than amusement among his critics.

While attempting to explain plans to seize Russian assets, the President twice referred to ""accommodating Russian oligarchs"" by taking their ""ill-begotten gains"" before repeatedly trying and failing to read the word “kleptocrats” off the teleprompter.

""In addition to this supplemental funding, I’m also sending to Congress a comprehensive package of — that will enhance our underlying effort to accommodate the Russian oligarchs and make sure we take their — take their — thier — ill-begotten gains. Ha, we’re going to accommodate them. We’re going to seize their yachts, their luxury homes, and other ill-begotten gains of Putin’s kleptoc-k-k- (inaudible) — yeah — kleptocracy and klep- — the guys who are the kleptocracies. But these are bad guys.""





On the radio program Friday, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere explain the perfect code to interpret Biden's gaffes: The ""triangle of emotions"" that helps decide if a Biden misstep was funny, sad, or (as in this case) ""absolutely terrifying.""

"IMPEACH Biden, Harris, AND Pelosi? Rep. Lauren Boebert demands full accountability for Afghanistan disaster","Which is more impeachable — former President Trump's phone call to Ukraine or President Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal, which destroyed relations with our allies, gave the Taliban tons of U.S. military equipment, and resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members?

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to explain why she's calling for President Biden to be impeached — but she's not stopping there.

"WATCH: Rudy Giuliani exposes money laundering schemes in Ukraine; records lead to Burisma, Bidens","Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, sat down with Glenn Beck at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit on Friday to reveal the multibillion dollar money laundering schemes he says he uncovered during his recent trip to Ukraine to investigate corruption.

Giuliani said the corruption in Ukraine most likely started in 2012 during the Obama administration and involved at least two major schemes, one for $7.5 billion and another for $5 billion.

He backed his claims with bank and court records that show a million-dollar money trail leading from Ukraine to a fake company in Latvia, then to Cyprus, and finally to the board members of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas firm whose board included Hunter Biden and business partner Devon Archer.

""I'm in a lot of trouble,"" Giuliani told Glenn. ""I've uncovered an eight-year-long money laundering system, that started probably in 2012, with $7.5 billion laundered by [Vitkor] Yanukovych, the [Ukraine] president at the time — pro-Russian president at the time. He laundered through American institutions, interestingly, controlled by Democrats.""

CBS fires staffer who blew whistle on ABC's Epstein cover-up: report,"CBS News has reportedly fired a former ABC staffer believed to be the person who leaked the ""hot mic"" footage of ABC News anchor Amy Robach admitting the network refused to run her story about the now-deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for over three years.

Earlier this week, Project Veritas released a video that showed Robach complaining that ABC spiked her Epstein story because it included damning information about certain influential people such as Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.

Reports soon followed that ABC had identified the alleged leaker as a former employee who currently worked at CBS News, and that the employee in question had immediately been fired by CBS, according to reports.

On Thursday's radio program, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere compared the way ABC and CBS treated the staffer who blew the whistle on the spiked Epstein story, to how the same networks are insisting that the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower's identity must be protected at all costs.

""ABC may be schizophrenic,"" Glenn said. ""They were talking about how whistleblowers must be protected. You have to protect the whistleblower ... he could lose his job ... and anybody who names a whistleblower, they're bad people. Well, yesterday, we found out through a whistleblower that ABC was not releasing all the information they had on Epstein for some 'journalistic' reason.

Well, what did they do? They found out who that whistleblower was ... and so CBS fired him.""

This ONE move by China proves Democrats don't REALLY care about climate change,"Whether he admits it or not, President Joe Biden's climate change policies will have a devastating effect on the world this winter. Even though the Biden administration boasts about the (misleadingly named) Inflation Reduction Act being the ""most important climate legislation ever passed,"" the endgame doesn't really seem to be about the Earth's climate. If it were, the administration would be up in arms over China's new plan to ""greatly"" increase coal production — which will completely wipe out any gains from Biden's climate plan many times over. So, why are we risking global war over ""climate change"" again?

On the radio program, Glenn Beck and producer Stu Burguiere discuss how America just took one step closer to war and why that war — thanks to the far left — would be based on nonsense and a ""warped philosophy.""

""I want to put into perspective what you are facing,"" Glenn began. ""There is too much debt in the world, and we are inflating that debt away — central banks are —and it will inflate everything that you have away. You are also looking at a time right now when we could be at war at any time. We just put the 101st Airborne Division into Europe to back Nato up, and the Pentagon said yesterday they are ready to go. They could go into Ukraine at any time. That's terrifying.""

""This has been done because of the fight over pipelines,"" Glenn explained. ""The West has decided we're going to cut off all oil and gas ... and they're claiming that this is for climate. But it's not for climate.""

""We can pass the biggest climate bill ever, and it gets completely wiped out by one announcement by President Xi [Jinping] that nobody tells you about and we have absolutely no control over,"" Stu noted. ""You are changing your life for that nonsense. It's all wiped out immediately, and this happens every few years. They announce these increases, we don't even look at them, and it wipes out everything that we're doing — all the trillions of dollars, all the money that we're spending.""

""So, let me ask you, are you willing to send your son or daughter over to fight for something this flawed? Because ... in the winter, that's what they're going to say, 'it's because the people are starving. They're cold.' Well, you know what's making them starving and cold? Our policy on climate change,"" Glenn said.

"'Shut the hell up': Glenn Beck rips CNN, Don Lemon for trashing Trump supporters as ignorant 'boomer rubes'","On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck tore into CNN host Don Lemon and his panelists who mocked supporters of President Donald Trump as ignorant, out-of-touch, country bumpkins in a segment that aired during live coverage of the Senate impeachment trial on Saturday.

During the segment, GOP strategist Rick Wilson told Lemon, ""Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it.""

""[Trump] knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world,"" he continued. ""And so that's partly him playing to the base and playing to their audience, you know, the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump. That wants to think that 'Donald Trump's the smart one and y'all, y'all elitists are dumb!'"" he added in a mock southern accent.

""'You elitists with your geography, and your maps, and your spelling!'"" chimed in CNN contributor and New York Times columnist Wajahat Ali, while Lemon guffawed and snorted.

""'And your math and your readin',"" Wilson added as the trio continued to indulge in smug merriment.

""Let me just say this to the, yes, the elitists,"" Glenn said of Lemon and his cohorts at CNN. ""What is an elitist? Somebody who thinks they're better than everyone else. And what was that? A demonstration that you think that half of the country that voted for this president, half of the country, is nothing but ignorant. Just dummies that can't even read. That is the pure definition of an elitist. Someone who thinks they're better than everyone else.""



Glenn went on to note that this is exactly the kind of thoughtless divisiveness the left has been accusing him of for years.

""I am so sick and tired of anybody, anybody in the press coming to me and saying, 'Do you know what you did to divide this country?' Yes. Yes, I admit it. But it's nothing like what you did now. It's nothing like what you've been doing for the last three years,"" he said.

""Shut the hell up,"" Glenn added. ""Do you know what you're doing to divide this country? Don't ever, ever say that to me again.""

DEEP STATE? Evidence emerges showing DEMOCRATS have been pushing Ukraine to meddle with US elections since at least 2016 — and still are,"Democratic politicians and mainstream media are doing their best to convince Americans that the recently declassified whistle-blower report ""removed all doubt"" that President Donald Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden in an effort to ""solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.""

In other words, they are accusing President Trump of colluding with a foreign leader to interfere with an election. Sound familiar?

On Thursday's radio program, Glenn Beck argued that President Trump was actually looking for evidence of collusion between Democrats and Ukrainian officials during the Obama administration who sought to dig up dirt on then-candidate Trump and prompt the Russia investigation before the 2016 election.

Reports have emerged that show officials within the Democratic National Committee met with Ukraine's political leadership during the 2016 election ""for the express purpose"" of helping ""Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.""

In an article for ""The Hill,"" award-winning investigative reporter John Solomon wrote, ""Democrats repeatedly have exerted pressure on Ukraine, a key U.S. ally for buffering Russia, to meddle in U.S. politics and elections"" since at least as early as 2016. In January of that year, ""the Obama administration invited Ukraine's top prosecutors to Washington, under the pretext of 'training,' then pressed them to drop an investigation into corruption at Burisma Holdings, the company that employed Joe Biden's son, Hunter.""

This, of course, is the very investigation at the center of the Trump-Ukraine whistle-blower report. President Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that the investigation had been unfairly ""shut down,"" and asked Zelensky if he could ""look into it."" Read the transcript of the call here.

Solomon's report also notes Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy's carefully worded message to the President Zelensky during a bipartisan meeting in Kiev earlier this month, in which Murphy made it clear that U.S. aid to Ukraine could be jeopardized if Ukraine leadership complies with President Trump's requests regarding the Burisma Holdings investigation.

""[T]he government at the highest levels [were] in collusion with our U.S. ambassador, appointed by Obama ... they were all working together,"" Glenn said. ""The DNC had come over and said, 'Hey, we need some dirt on Donald Trump,' and the Ukrainian government, working through oligarchs, went to Russia and helped gather information. Then, when the 2016 Russian investigation was happening, they were firing and bribing everybody to shut up. And the ambassador was stopping people from coming to the United States to say, 'Hey, this is what's really going on.' That's what Trump is asking for ... and the Russian hacked servers, because, what's on those servers?""

""This is what the people hired [Trump] to do,"" Glenn added. ""To go in a shut this deep state down — shut this swamp down.""

'Demand destruction' is coming FAST — and it could wipe out WAY more than gas,"You can't just cut off Russian oil without replacing it, preferably with American oil, because it's not just gas that's affected.

Even if you're willing to pay higher prices for gas (as so many virtue-signaling elites say they are,) what about all the other things that barrel of oil is used to make? The price of everything will go up. Get ready to start hearing a lot about ""demand destruction."" Demand destruction occurs when a commodity is priced so high that consumers are forced to find alternative ways to use less of it.

In this clip, Glenn Beck explains this economic tactic and shows how it may be occurring today with oil in America so that the far left can usher in its clean energy dreams.

""We're in demand destruction right now with oil and … I think this is being orchestrated,"" Glenn said. ""I think this is another thing that just didn't feel right. I think our demand destruction of oil was orchestrated.""

""I want to explain ... why I say it's really bad to get off Russian oil without opening up our own oil fields,"" he continued. ""I like that morally we're trying to help Ukraine and we do it by canceling, cutting off their blood supply over in Russia, but we're also cutting it off here and the rest of the world.""

Glenn explained that only about half of each barrel of oil is turned into gasoline. The other half is turned into everyday items such as solvents, ink, floor wax, ballpoint pins, football cleats, insecticides, boats, sweaters, upholstery, bicycle tires, sports car bodies, nail polish, fishing lures, perfumes, golf bags, tires, dresses, cassettes, dishwasher parts, toolboxes, shoe polish, transport transparent tape, petroleum jelly, caulking, motorcycle helmets, CD players, faucet parts, clothes lines, curtains, food preservatives, baseballs, basketballs, soap, vitamin capsules, antihistamines, purses, shoes, dashboards, cortisone, deodorant, shoelace aglets, putty, dyes, pantyhose, refrigerants, linings, rubber, rubbing alcohol, life jackets, percolators, skis, TV cabinets, shag rugs, electrician's tape, paint, epoxy, car battery cases, tool racks, mops, slacks, insect repellent, oil filters, hair coloring, fertilizers, yarn, umbrellas, diesel fuel, motor oil, bearing grease, roofing, toilet seats, fishing rods, lipstick, denture adhesives, linoleum, ice cube trays, synthetic rubber, speakers, plastic wood, electric blankets, glycerin, dice, fishing boats, rubber cement, tennis rackets, nylon rope, candles, trash bags, house paint, water pipes, hand lotion, roller skates, surfboards, shampoo, wheels, paint rollers, shower curtains, safety glasses, aspirin luggage, guitar strings, antifreeze, football helmets, awnings, eyeglasses, clothes, toothbrushes, ice chests, footballs, combs, CDs, DVDs, paint brushes, detergents, tents, balloons, vaporizers, heart valves, crayons, parachutes, telephones, enamel, pillows, dishes, cameras, anesthetics, artificial turf, artificial limbs, bandages, hair curlers, folding doors, model cars, dentures, cold cream, movie film, soft contact lenses, drinking cups, ammonia, shaving cream, car enamel, fan belts, refrigerators, golf balls, and toothpaste, to name a few.

""There's going to be demand destruction,"" Glenn warned. ""So, if you thought that there was [already] a problem with supply and demand, you ain't seen nothing yet,"" he added.

""Sowhen you see the price of everything going up, just remember, the people who are leading you to this are the ones that say we have to get rid of fossil fuels. Less than half of each barrel goes to gasoline. The rest of that barrel goes to make everything else we have grown accustomed to. Everything else. So, when your friends tell you that the price [of gas] is worth it — really?

""You cannot disconnect the price of oil, and the price of gasoline, from the price of food or plastic or anything else that you are used to buying. Demand destruction is coming, and it is coming fast.""

DNC CORRUPTION: What's on the hacked Democratic computer server in Ukraine?,"When the White House released transcripts of the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, we learned that President Trump was seeking information about a missing DNC computer server believed to be in Ukraine, which allegedly contains incriminating information about the Democrats' involvement in election meddling.

This is the same server that fired-FBI Director James Comey and the Justice Department have been looking for as part of the Russia investigation. If it was so important then, why shouldn't President Trump be looking for it now? And what's on that server?

On this week's radio program, Glenn Beck noted that corruption within the government is wrong regardless of who's committing it — and we need to call it out to save our republic.

""This is massive corruption,"" Glenn said. ""It doesn't matter who they are if they are guilty, because this corruption is so deep. Exactly everything that the Democrats said that Donald Trump did in Russia, they did and are still doing in Ukraine, and we don't have a republic if this remains,"" he added.

""One of the things in the phone call that the Left made a big deal about, is [President Trump] was asking for help, not about Hunter Biden, but ... the first thing he said [to President Zelensky] is 'You still may be surrounded by really bad guys. There is corruption all around you. We think some of those bad guys are still in your circle of advisers.' And the [Ukraine] President said, 'I know who you are talking about ... and, no, sir, they are not in my circle,'"" Glenn explained.

""Then [President Trump] said, 'We are looking for a server.' Now, what server are they looking for? They're looking for the DNC server,"" Glenn continued. ""Why do they have a DNC server in Ukraine? Well, wouldn't we like to know?""

""So, Donald Trump asked for the server. How dare him? Yeah, except that's the same server that James Comey was looking for, that the FBI, the Justice Department, was looking for and couldn't find,"" Glenn said. ""Remember when they said that server was really, really important for the Russia investigation? That's the same server that Donald Trump is looking for. So, if it was so important that the FBI and James Comey needed it, why is it so bad [that President Trump is looking for it]? Because it's going to prove Donald Trump was guilty right? Why is everybody upset he is asking for this server? Why is it so bad that he says, 'Hey, talk to our attorney general about this server, can you find it?' Donald Trump, why would he want the server that was going to prove what he did in Russia? Because the people in Ukraine have been trying to get things to the United States, but they were blocked by the DNC. They were blocked by operatives in intelligence, in justice, and in the embassy.""

""I don't know about you, but I would sure like to see what is on that DNC server. And if it implicates Donald Trump, then it implicates Donald Trump. If it implicates the DNC, then it implicates the DNC,"" Glenn concluded.

"PROOF: Audio, email evidence shows DNC colluded with Ukraine to take down Trump in 2016","The Democrats have been trying for years now to find evidence that President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 election. As it turns out, the DNC has been doing the exact same thing in Ukraine, all the while misleading Americans with empty allegations and smokescreens.

On Friday's radio program, Glenn Beck, Pat Gray, and Stu Burguiere discuss the documents, finances, hacked emails, and audio recordings that show the Ukraine scandal goes far beyond Joe and Hunter Biden, and their involvement with Ukraine oil company Burisma. To see the documents and other source materials for yourself, click here, or go to GlennBeck.com.



Glenn read a leaked email from Alex Chalupa, a lawyer hired by Democrats to ""investigate"" then-candidate Trump in Ukraine, addressed to Louise Miranda at the DNC.

Hey, a lot coming down the pipe. I spoke to a delegation of 68 investigative journalists from Ukraine last night at the Library of Congress, the Open World Society forum. They put me on the program to speak specifically about Paul Manafort. I invited Michael Isikoff, who I've been working with for the past few weeks, and connected him to the Ukrainians. More offline tomorrow, since there was a big Trump component you and Lauren need to be aware of that will hit in the next few weeks. Something I'm working on that you should be aware of.

""What was crazy, was the Isikoff article that came out was stuff from the dossier from Fusion GPS,"" Glenn pointed out. ""This is why Tony Podesta shut down the Podesta Group, like on the day that Paul Manafort was arrested. Okay? As soon as they arrested him, the biggest lobbying firm, the Clinton lobbying firm, millions of dollars, [Podesta] walks into the office in one day, and says, 'close the doors.' Not like, 'Hey, at the end of the week, or at the end of the month, we're going to wrap things up,' [he said ] 'Close the doors.' And he shut his firm down. Well, why? Because he's working with the same group of people, that Manafort [was.]""

""So, you're expecting me to believe that Manafort got money under the table, but the Podesta Group didn't?"" Glenn asked. ""No way. No way.""

""They [the Podesta Group] only existed from 1988 to 2017. It's just a coincidence they happened to stop the thing right there,"" Stu joked. ""It was a fly-by-night operation, one of the biggest lobbying firms in Washington for 30 years.""

Glenn went on to play an audio recording of Artem Sytnyk, Director of the National Anti-corruption Bureau of Ukraine who was tried and convicted in Ukraine for interfering in the U.S. presidential election in 2016, speaking with friends, ""Kolya"" and ""Ivan.""

Glenn shared a translation of the Ukrainian tape:

Kolya: Did they, those Russians, help Trump? Your people?

Sytnyk: I think they did. Yeah. I helped him, too. Not him, but Hillary. I helped her.

Kolya: Yeah. Right. Then her position tottered, right?

Sytnyk: Well, this is how they write about it, right.

Ivan: Hillary's humanitarian aid ... [indiscernible.]

Kolya: Well, I'm about ... the commentaries. At the time, we were not [indiscernible.]

Sytnyk: Trump ... his purely inner problem ... issue ... they dominate over the external matters. While Hillary, she is -- how shall I put it? She belongs to the cohort of politicians who comprise the hegemony in the US. Both in the US and the entire world, right? For us, it's ... sort of ... better. For Americans ... what Trump is doing is better for them.

Kolya: Well, we have lots of those American experts here now ... [indiscernible.]

Sytnyk: Well, there, you see why Hillary lost the elections? I was in charge of the investigation of their ""black accounting"" records. We made the Manafort's data available to general public.

Kolya: So what?

Sytnyk: He was imprisoned. Manafort then was the head of the Supreme Headquarter of Trump, right? Then he was dismissed, too, including due to the ""black accounting."" After that, he was sentenced to 80 years of imprisonment term. How about Trump? Did he not give a s***. They have their system working there and it works smoothly.

Kolya: Everybody worked smoothly there.

Sytnyk: And when they carried out the elections, a week before the elections, the FBI reopened the investigation in respect of Hillary. So her rating dropped for 7 percent and that's why Trump managed to win the elections at a pinch.

I'm still unable to understand why he's fighting with the FBI. They try to catch him on the hand. If it were not the FBI, he would not have won the elections. They torpedoed Hillary's ratings for 7 percent.

""So here he is. He is admitting to tampering with our elections. Admitted working with the Hillary Clinton campaign,"" Glenn said. ""He is actually convicted in the highest court in the land in Ukraine. This is all front page news, in Ukraine, while we are saying, 'Was there anyone tampering with the election?'""

Here's the REAL reason the US media won't tell you about these MASSIVE protests in Europe,"Protests over soaring energy, food, and fuel prices have broken out across Europe, but the corporate media can't seem to care less. These people are protesting the same things Americans are upset with: unaffordable living costs, inflation, energy shortages, what banks are doing to our money, and what political leaders are doing (or not doing) to help.

Europe is ahead of the United States in this economic crisis, but the same things are happening here. While Europeans face a winter during which many may not be able to afford heat, the Biden administration is focused on things like trans surgeries, emptying our strategic petroleum reserve, and throwing money at Ukraine.

On the radio program Tuesday, Glenn Beck explained why U.S. policies have made America, the world's most reliable lifeboat, unable to responsibly assist the nations that will soon need it most.

""The world is preparing for famine. The world is preparing for huge inflation. The world is preparing for shortages of energy, of food, of medical care. The world is on the verge of World War III,"" Glenn said.

""America, when did you lose your ability to think critically?"" he continued. ""The entire world is doing this, and we're just having a party. We're just arguing about transgender issues, having strip shows for our kids, and spending money like it's going out of style ... while not taking care of our business at home.""

Russia Ukraine food shortages,"Record price hikes could soon see another huge spike — this time on wheat-based grocery items in particular — as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coincides with the crop season for one of the world's most essential food sources.

Fifteen percent of all global calories come from wheat and rice, and one-third of the world’s wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. The crop season for wheat is right now, but very little farming currently is occurring as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on for a second month.

On the radio program, Glenn Beck broke down the importance of this statistic — plus many more — and explained why these numbers could even point to a possible famine by the end of the year.

""When you're looking at food, understand that 15 percent of all global calories come from wheat and rice … and one-third of all of our wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine,"" Glenn explained. ""The next stat you need to understand is ... the supply chain for food is 90 days. We have 90 days worth of food in the supply chain and ... if it stops, let's say for some reason stop all farming, we would have 90 days left of food worldwide. Okay? Now, 25 percent of all global production is food. We're about to lose 12 percent of that production. That means, we're losing half of our food supply,"" he added.

""Now, the bigger problems [are] fertilizer and energy. The energy price to run the tractors, to run the trucks, to run everything else. And the price of phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. Those are the three major things we use to make fertilizer ... this is causing so much stress on the farmers that farmers all around the world are not planting their fields. They are reducing the acreage, because without fertilizer, you're not growing much. So why plant all those fields?"" Glenn continued.

""So far, the price of corn has doubled. Soybeans [and] wheat are skyrocketing. The strategic food reserves, in some parts of the world, are now opening,"" he warned. ""We'd better have perfect weather all over the world, because if things continue the way they are and don't turn around quickly, hundreds of millions of people will experience famine by the end of the year.""

Glenn went on to detail what you can do now to prepare. Watch the video below to hear Glenn break it down. Can't watch? Download the podcast here.

"Glenn's predictions for 2022: The economy, Russia, China, and … the return of Hillary Clinton?","Will 2022 be any better than the last two years? With the way things appear to be going, we may be in for a lot of changes as leaders across the globe push for the Great Reset, says Glenn Beck on the radio program this week.

As Biden continues to tout economic ""recovery"" ahead of the midterms, Russia continues to eyeball Ukraine, and Hillary Clinton resurfaces yet again, Glenn gives his predictions for the coming year.

Glenn Beck WARNS: The falling stock market is NOTHING compared to what's coming,"The stock markets have taken a nosedive in the biggest downtrend since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. But that's nothing compared to what's coming thanks to our government's embrace of modern monetary theory, warned BlazeTV's Glenn Beck on the radio program.

""It really is important that you understand what's happening to us,"" Glenn stated. ""Modern monetary theory is truly the [fuel] ... for the great reset. It is the idea that we can print as much money and spend as much money as we want,"" he explained.

""Then the next step is to release the Federal Reserve digital currency and make payments by other currencies [including cryptocurrencies] illegal,"" he continued. ""And you're seeing it happen now in real time. Why would they do this? Because you cannot print this kind of money without having absolute control over how it is spent.""

Glenn broke down the steps powerful political organizations — like the Federal Reserve — will take to end currency competition and enact a Federal digital dollar, which will allow for the government to have complete control over how we spend our money.

""This is what's coming. This is coming quickly, and events will make it move faster. For instance, why is Joe Biden basically giving Ukraine to Russia? He's giving it to them. He he knows Russia's not afraid of him. Putin knows that [Biden] is not going to do anything ... neither is NATO. They're not going to do anything,"" Glenn said.

""It's because war resets everything. War is the best great resetter. Changes boundaries. It changes borders. It changes laws. It changes societies. It changes currencies. It changes everything. And in the end you just want the war to stop. And so you you accept whatever it is the terms are that you're going to have to live under now. We're in very, very dangerous times. The only way to survive this is to know why they are dangerous times.""

Ukraine probe: Why Joe Biden won't answer questions about his son Hunter and Burisma gas company,"On the Glenn Beck Radio Program Monday, Glenn and Stu discussed former Vice President Joe Biden's seemingly incompetent campaign staff who still haven't answered any of the much-asked questions regarding his or his son's involvement in Ukraine.

Case in point, why would the Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, hire Hunter Biden in the first place? Hunter had zero experience in the gas industry, was struggling with serious substance abuse, and was in and out of rehab the entire time he was employed by the Ukrainian company. And they paid their troubled new-hire a reported $50,000 a month — though it may have been more than $200,000 a month.

""You are Burisma. You are a Chinese corporation associated with the national government. You're a bank,"" Stu said. ""You're tightly tied to the government and you're just going to hire Hunter Biden? With no experience, with no obvious reason why he would be hired, and he will be paid, not $50,000 a month ... but much, much more than that. It seems like it was more than $200,000 a month to do these duties.

""All that aside, the guy is just plainly a mess. OK? And a lot of us are a mess. I'm not saying this to beat the guy up. We all have our issues. But Hunter has a specific set of issues that would not indicate he should be hired for a high-level position anywhere, even at Cinnabon.""

Stu walks through the timeline of Hunter Biden's battles with addition — and it's quite extensive.

'Not one cent': Hunter Biden tells ABC News he received NO money from China — but his bank records tell a different story,"On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck, Stu Burguiere, and chief researcher Jason Buttrill talked about Hunter Biden's interview on ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday, during which the former vice president's son denied any wrongdoing in his business dealings with either Ukraine or China.



During the interview, ABC News' Amy Robach brought up President Donald Trump's accusation that Hunter Biden ""got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason.""

""The president has repeatedly said that you received $1.5 billion dollars from China, despite no experience and for no apparent reason,"" said Robach, while rolling her eyes dismissively. ""Obviously, fact-checkers have said that that is not true. Have you received any money from that business dealing?""

""No,"" Hunter asserted. ""Not one cent ... no one ever paid me $1.5 billion.""

In this clip, Glenn noted Hunter's intentionally misleading semantics, pointing out that Hunter's company, which he co-owned with Devon Archer and Christopher Heinz, former Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson, would actually have received the funds.



Jason questioned how ABC News or Robach could conduct a credible interview without so much as mentioning financial records from Morgan Stanley that show numerous transfers of funds from anonymous LLCs in Ukraine, China, and elsewhere going directly into Hunter Biden's account.

""Journalists looked through Morgan Stanley records and they found that anonymous LLCs were coming from China and Ukraine, going directly into Hunter Biden's account. His account, directly into it!"" Jason said.

""We have the Morgan Stanley file,"" Glenn added. ""We know offshore China was paying [Hunter] and putting it directly into his Morgan Stanley account.""

SUSPICIOUS? Senate report shows Hunter Biden received '$3.5 million wire transfer' from Russian billionaire,"Chief researcher Jason Buttrill joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Thursday to discuss an ""explosive"" new report released Wednesday by Senate Republicans on Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Among other serious allegations, the 87-page report claims that ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow,"" and the richest woman in Russia.

""The transactions discussed [in the report] are designed to illustrate the depth and extent of some questionable financial transactions. Moreover, the financial transactions illustrate serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family,"" the report stated.

Jason suggested the Senate's findings provide additional evidence to back allegations of a money-laundering scheme, which Glenn detailed in a four-part series about Biden's shady connections to Ukraine. Learn more on this here.

""Laundered money is very hard to track to its finality,"" Jason explained. ""I'm sure the Biden camp is really hoping that it just looks suspicious, but [investigators] don't ever find the eventual end point. But, if they do – and it's possible they already have – this is going to be explosive, very explosive.""

Is there enough evidence to impeach AND REMOVE Joe Biden?,"From Hillary Clinton's email scandal to Biden family corruption to Russiagate and the Mar-a-Lago raid, it's very clear that many institutions in Washington, D.C., have a separate set of rules for former President Donald Trump — including the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation. And when you take a look at history, it's also clear that there's nothing more destructive to a free civilization than having a judicial system that favors one political side or is used to go after the other, as Peter Schweizer, author of ""Red-Handed"" and expert on Biden family corruption, explained.

Schweizer joined Glenn Beck on the radio program to give his thoughts on what the FBI's raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home was really about (hint: getting caught ""jerry-rigging"" the Russiagate investigation was deeply embarrassing for both the DOJ and FBI) and whether President Joe Biden will ever be held accountable for his part in alleged ""major crimes and major security threats"" to our country.

Asked if there is enough evidence to impeach Joe Biden if Republicans gain control of Congress later this year (and if they actually have the spine to challenge the president), Schweizer told Glenn there is enough evidence for impeachment, but removing Biden from office may be another story.



""The evidence is clearly there,"" Schweizer said. ""My view is this has always been, not a story about the hookers, about the cocaine, about the drug abuse, and it's not even been a story just about Ukraine and Russia. For me, it's always been about espionage and about the fact that Chinese intelligence has their claws into [the Biden] family. All you have to do is look at, very simply, the four businessmen that Hunter Biden received tens of millions of dollars from in China. They're all directly linked to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence, and that ain't a coincidence [...].

""The problem that you have with elected officials, like Mitt Romney, is they really do view a high elected office as a club ... but you can't gloss over major crimes and major security threats,"" he added.

Schweizer later went on to add, ""When it comes to Ukraine, in my mind, it's really possible to believe two things at the same time. Number one, Vladimir Putin is an aggressor that has moved into neighboring Ukraine and created this humanitarian crisis. And number two, the Ukrainian government is corrupt, and we are going to pour billions of dollars in there that's going to end up in overseas accounts. We know Zelinskyy's already done this ... the international consortium of investigative journalists, they got access to overseas bank accounts that show government officials have been ... siphoning off billions of dollars of U.S. aid. So, what you're saying is already happening, and it's a tragedy.""

Dems change Trump charge from 'quid pro quo' to 'bribery' after conducting 'impeachment focus groups',"Democrats have changed the accusation against President Donald Trump in the House impeachment inquiry from ""quid pro quo"" to ""bribery"" after conducting several focus groups to determine which term sounds more ""compelling"" to voters.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee conducted several focus groups ""in key House battlegrounds,"" asking participants whether ""quid pro quo,"" ""extortion"" or ""bribery"" was a ""more compelling description of Trump's conduct,"" according to The Washington Post.

On Monday's radio program, Glenn Beck likened the Democrats' increasingly arbitrary impeachment attempts to ""throwing spaghetti up onto the wall to see what sticks.""

""They're just doing everything they can. They're throwing spaghetti up into the wall to see what sticks,"" Glenn said. ""They don't have anything. They try 'quid pro quo.' Doesn't work. Bribery? Doesn't work. 'He's a Russian agent'? Doesn't work. When is America going to wake up to this?""

"Bill O'Reilly calls impeachment hearings a 'fiasco,' says Americans aren't buying into this 'bunch of garbage'","Bill O'Reilly joined Glenn Beck on Thursday's radio program to discuss the House impeachment hearings, which he said can be summed up in one word: ""fiasco.""

""It was a fiasco, and the reason is that, still, after all of the verbiage, all of the bloviating, I still don't know what the crime is,"" O'Reilly said.



Glenn played a video clip of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) questioning acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, who testified on Wednesday to a litany of alleged crimes against President Donald Trump — none of which Taylor witnessed himself.

""This is incredible,"" Glenn said of Taylor's testimony. ""He said in his testimony, 'No, I didn't think any quid pro quo was going on, after I had three meetings over three months. But then I talked to this guy [one of Taylor's staffers who reportedly overheard an an alleged conversation between Ambassador Gordon Sondland and President Trump] and I was convinced.' That's crazy!""



""So that's why I started this with one word: fiasco. And it is a fiasco,"" O'Reilly added. "" And I believe that most Americans now will tune it away. Number one, it's incredibly boring ... And I believe most Americans, even if they wouldn't tell the pollsters, say this is bull. You know, we know Nixon obstructed justice. We know Clinton lied and perjured himself under oath. But this is a bunch of garbage.""

"Intel community: 'First-hand information REQUIRED' for whistleblowers — until second-hand complaint on President Trump, that is","The Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) has quietly removed its requirement that whistleblowers report only ""first-hand information,"" according to a report in The Federalist.

Coincidentally, the whistleblower who recently filed a complaint against President Donald Trump admitted that he or she was ""not a direct witness"" to the alleged wrongdoings, a stipulation that would have disqualified the complaint under previous versions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) disclosure process.

A screenshot provided by The Federalist's Sean Davis shows the former version of the whistleblower complaint form, or ""Disclosure of Urgent Concern"" form, with the following listed under a bold, underlined heading that read, ""FIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.""

In order to find an urgent concern ""credible,"" the [Intelligence Community Inspector General] must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICPWA based on an employee's second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when an employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing.

However, a new version of the form only requires would-be whistleblowers to check a box saying, ""I heard about it from others.""

""We don't know when, but the intelligence community in the last few months secretly eliminated the requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings. This was the intelligence community that changed their form, and this wasn't uploaded until ... just days before the anti-Trump complaint was declassified and released to the public,"" Glenn Beck explained on Monday's radio program.



""The document was revised in August of this year, by the intelligence community. Then it was only told to the public just a couple of days before this whistleblower report came out. Now, what was the claim from the media that Donald Trump was trying to hold this whistleblower report back and all of these things were always reported to Congress? Wasn't that the case, that these always went to Congress, that no whistleblower in the history of whistleblowers has ever been held back from Congress?""

Glenn noted the absurdity of starting an impeachment hearing based on ""a guy who heard other people talk"" about the president's phone calls, and whose assertions about what was said during these phone calls have so-far been proven wrong.

""Our intelligence community requires people who are not dealing in rumors,"" he said. ""There is no reason to talk to this person There is no reason to listen to this person.""

Joe Hunter Biden indictment,"We are possibly on the verge of World War III, and look who's leading America. Joe Biden has been compromised, and now Biden family corruption in places like China, Ukraine, and Russia may be disrupting the president’s foreign policy decision making in a big way.

Investigative reporter and author Peter Schweizer is one of the few who will actually talk about the evidence we now have that President Biden has been compromised and has committed high crimes — money trails found on Hunter Biden's laptop that lead to Russia, China, and Ukraine.

Peter joined the ""Glenn Beck Program"" to explain why he believes the White House is bracing for an indictment of Hunter Biden. But could that actually lead to impeachment proceedings against Joe?

Peter notes that in the bombshell New York Times article, ""Team Biden basically acknowledges"" that Hunter Biden may very well be indicted on tax evasion charges, at very least. Other possible crimes the Biden's could be facing include money laundering, failing to file as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice, and political corruption.

""[The NYT article] reveals that Hunter paid a million dollars in back taxes. Of course, he did that 18 months after the grand jury started looking into this, but to me that is a massive admission that they are trying to get ahead of this story,"" Peter explains. ""They realize that it's a big problem. And I think that it's going to create an enormous problem within the Biden family because the question becomes: does Hunter Biden take the fall for his dad? Or if he is indicted, does he actually fight this? [Because] by fighting it, it brings in all the material from the prosecutors about how some of the money ended up with his dad and the favors that his dad performed. So, I think they're in serious panic mode in team Biden.""

Peter goes on to break down the details of the alleged ""high crimes"" that could finally be exposed, but admits that there are ""several hurdles"" still standing in the way. He also explains why he actually has hope the far-left mainstream media will ultimately report this story the way it deserves.

WATCH: Glenn Beck dismantles John Bolton's book 'bombshell',"The New York Times reported Sunday that former national security adviser John Bolton's new book, scheduled for release mid-March, claims President Donald Trump asked him to withhold nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine until it cooperated with investigations into the Bidens.

As a result, the House Democrats and certain Republicans (like Mitt Romney) are pushing to have Bolton testify as a witness during the Senate's impeachment trial.

On the radio program Tuesday, Glenn Beck discussed Bolton's dubious decision to publish a tell-all book — titled ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir"" — amid President Trump's impeachment trial.

""If John Bolton had something to say ... if he had something that he felt was impeachable, he should have stepped to a microphone that would have been provided for anybody and said, 'Look, I need to testify, because I know something that no one else knows,'"" Glenn said.

""He should demand to be heard — and not for a price. Our country is at stake. Our civilization. Our belief in our system, in Congress, in the White House, in the president, in the entire thing is at stake,"" he added.

""John Bolton, and everyone else, if you have information and you have something to say, don't take a book deal,"" Glenn continued. ""Don't do it. These are the times that try men's souls. We don't need the sunshine patriots. We need the winter soldiers. The ones who, in the deepest, darkest day of winter, they still remember why they're doing it, and they're doing it for America. They do it because they love their country. Your country is at stake. Step to a microphone and say it.""

'My reporting has been inconvenient to the Democrats': John Solomon weighs legal action amid left-wing smear attempts,"John Solomon, an award-winning investigative reporter who has become a central figure in the impeachment proceedings, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Wednesday to talk about why he has become the target of a vicious smear campaign by left-wing media as well as members of the House Intelligence Committee.

Read more on this here.

During the interview, Glenn noted that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) obtained Solomon's personal phone records, along with those of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, and released them to the public on Tuesday in a 300-page impeachment probe report.

""The Democratic report is out,"" Glenn said to Solomon. ""Your name is all over it. It includes your name on a list of AT&T records.

Does Schiff have the legal grounds to do this? How did he obtain it? Can he legally unmask an American citizen, the name, in an official report like this?""

""Well first off, I don't have AT&T as my phone service. Those most likely aren't my records. They're likely someone else's records, where my phone calls show up,"" Solomon said. ""My suspicion, without having been able to get confirmation yet, is that my phone records simply show up in some of their call logs that we know are subpoenaed.

""Any time the government uses that power, it has a chilling effect on you as a reporter. Who wants to call me the next time if they think their records can be subpoenaed or shown on a subpoena?"" he continued. ""But at the end of the day, what does it show? It shows I'm a reporter that was engaged in reporting.""

""All of this effort by Adam Schiff, the Democrats, and their allies in the media, are designed to distract from the fact that the factual trail in my stories is true and unassailable,"" Solomon added later in the interview. ""They engage in character assassination, assassination by affiliation, or assassination by phone records. But no context.

""I guarantee you, if you ran Rudy Giuliani's phone records, you would find lots of other reporters. I'm not the only one.

Why did they single me out? Because my reporting has been inconvenient to the Democrats and The Washington Post and the New York Times for three years. I helped unravel the Russia collusion bogus narrative. Now, I put another narrative out there that's important, factual, and worth debate,"" he said. "" And they don't like that either.""

Glenn asked Solomon if he might consider ""going after the media or Schiff with some sort of a lawsuit?""

""My lawyers and I are taking a look at some of the more outrageously false claims that are in some of these news articles.

And we'll make a decision soon on whether to take some action. If I do so, it's not to make money. It will be to correct the factual record so that the American public can make a better judgment about what's going on. But, you know, it's sad. It's sad to watch a profession ignore the facts and engage in ad hominem attacks, when they have so many of the facts wrong.""

Media SMEAR journalist John Solomon after research on DNC and Ukraine corruption,"On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck defended journalist John Solomon, the award-winning investigative reporter who has become the target of a brutal smear campaign by the mainstream media after uncovering evidence of DNC corruption in Ukraine.

Over the past several years, Solomon has released a series of well-researched reports that show how former Vice President Joe Biden used unethical practices to help his son, Hunter, profit as a board member of Burisma Holdings, a Ukranian natural gas firm. Biden later bragged that he strong-armed Ukrainian leaders into scrapping an investigation into corruption at, you guessed it, Burisma Holdings. Read more on this here.

But Solomon's findings didn't end with the Bidens. His investigations have uncovered corruption during the Obama administration, involving key Democratic players like Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who allegedly used Ukraine to launch the Russia collusion probe in an effort to take down President Donald Trump.

Now, the media is smearing Solomon as a right-wing nut job and conspiracy theorist, begging the question: why is the press so desperate to discredit a journalist who played such a key role in uncovering collusion between U.S. leadership and a foreign government?

For his part, Solomon maintains that he stands by his stories ""100 percent,"" adding that they are all ""completely accurate and transparent"" with ""embedded the documents and videos we collected in each story for all to see.""

""I want to talk to you a little bit about a journalist. A guy who has worked for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, ... [and] the Associated Press. He is an award-winning investigative journalist,"" Glenn said of Solomon. ""He is an equal opportunity reporter. He is not someone who is looking for his truth. He's looking for the truth. But since he has started working on Ukraine, and telling the truth, and doing the only real heavy lifting on Ukraine, he is being destroyed now in the press.""



""John Solomon is a good reporter. He is a fair reporter. He is a guy who has taken on both sides. He is a guy who has taken on investigative reporting against -- against the odds in more than just politics,"" added Glenn. ""He's a guy who has done great work and won many awards from the people who are now tearing him down, only for political purposes. I'm not sure what the truth is, but I am sure of this: You're not getting it.""

WATCH: John Solomon files lawsuit seeking records to expose Ukraine corruption and impeachment fraud,"On the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Friday, award-winning investigative reporter John Solomon, a central figure in the impeachment proceedings, explained his newly filed lawsuit, which seeks the records of contact between Ukraine prosecutors and the U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev during the 2016 election.

The records would provide valuable information on what really happened in Ukraine, including what then-Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter were doing with Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, Solomon explained.

The documents, which the State Department has withheld thus far despite repeated requests for release by Solomon, would likely shed light on the alleged corruption that President Donald Trump requested to be investigated during his phone call with the president of Ukraine last year.

With the help of Southeastern Legal Foundation, Solomon's lawsuit seeks to compel the State Department to release the critical records. Once released, the records are expected to reveal, once and for all, exactly why President Trump wanted to investigate the dealings in Ukraine, and finally expose the side of the story that Democrats are trying to hide in their push for impeachment.

""It's been a one-sided story so far, just like the beginning of the Russia collusion story, right? Everybody was certain on Jan. 9 of 2017 that the Christopher Steele dossier was gospel. And our president was an agent of Russia. Three years later, we learned that all of that turned out to be bunk, "" Solomon said.

""The most important thing about politics, and about investigations, is that there are two sides to a story. There are two pieces of evidence. And right now, we've only seen one side of it,"" he continued. ""I think we'll learn a lot about what the intelligence community, what the economic and Treasury Department community was telling the president. And I bet the story was way more complicated than the narrative that [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff [D-Calif.] has woven so far.""

FINALLY: Feds target Ukrainian money-laundering oligarch linked to MISSING $1.8 billion in US aid,"In February 2020, Glenn Beck and his research team uncovered an alleged multi-billion dollar money laundering scheme that lead to a missing $1.8 billion in U.S. aid sent to Ukraine during the Obama administration, all of which pointed to Igor Kolomoisky, the corrupt Ukrainian billionaire at the center of it all.

If you missed Glenn's February special, ""Ukraine: The Final Piece,"" you can find it here.

This week, the FBI raided the offices of U.S. companies owned by Kolomoisky in Cleveland and Miami. Additionally, the Department of Justice accused the Ukrainian oligarch of stealing billions of dollars from PrivatBank and then laundering the money through a network of companies all over the world. Kolomoisky and partner, Hennadiy Boholyubov, owned PrivatBank until December 2016, when Ukraine nationalized the bank because billions of dollars had gone missing.

Kolomoisky has ties to the Ukrainian gas firm Burisma, former Burisma board member Hunter Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose phone call with President Donald Trump was central to the Democrats' now-failed impeachment attempt.

On the radio program Friday, Glenn spoke with chief researcher Jason Buttrill about these latest developments.



""Yeah, $1.8 billion of [taxpayer] money that just vanished has now been found, or at least part of it, in Miami and Cleveland,"" Glenn said.

""I can't believe it's taken this long,"" Jason responded. ""You said in February that [Kolomoisky] was the key to finding out where the money went. And we're talking about $1.8 billion dollars — $1.8 billion! That could finance a small war.""

""That money went to PrivatBank — that's Kolomoisky's bank,"" he continued. ""It was later nationalized after they found out all this money was mysteriously going missing. But it went through a bank in Cypress then, poof, it was laundered all over the world. [...] We also showed, in one of the previous shows, that there were wire transfers going from Burisma, which Kolomoisky is the managing principal of, to Hunter Biden.""

Glenn and Jason also talked about recent reports from the Department of Homeland Security alleging ties between American revolutionaries, such as Antifa, and Marxist terrorists in Syria, which BlazeTV exposed back in June. Find out more here.

BOMBSHELL: Here's what newly released audiotapes expose about Biden-Ukraine quid pro quo,"On the radio program Thursday, Glenn Beck sat down with chief researcher Jason Buttrill to go over two bombshell developments that have recently come to light regarding former Vice President Joe Biden's role in the 2016 dismissal of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.

""Wow! Two huge stories dropped within about 24 hours of each other,"" Jason began. He went on to explain that a court ruling in Ukraine has just prompted an ""actual criminal investigation against Joe Biden in Ukraine.""

This stunning development coincided with the release of leaked phone conversations, which took place in late 2015 and early 2016, allegedly among then-Vice President Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Ukraine's former President Petro Poroshenko.

One of the audiotapes seems to confirm allegations of a quid pro quo between Biden and Poroshenko, with the later admitting that he asked Shokin to resign despite having no evidence of him ""doing anything wrong"" in exchange for a $1 billion loan guarantee.

""Poroshenko said, 'despite the fact that we didn't have any corruption charges on [Shokin], and we don't have any information about him doing something wrong, I asked him to resign,'"" Jason explained. ""But none of the Western media is pointing this out.""

Glenn Beck: One TERRIFYING thing is clear no matter who caused the Nord Stream pipeline leaks,"Evidence strongly suggests that the Nord Stream pipeline leaks were the result of sabotage, and U.S. and European officials have been working to discover who could be behind the explosions that damaged the natural gas pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.

Was it Russia? Ukraine? Germany? But no matter who carried this out, it has put the entire world in grave danger, because if this is indeed an attack, it means that non-military key infrastructure outside Ukraine is now on the ""target menu,"" warned Glenn Beck on the radio program.

""It is so important for you to understand, this is now a non-military key infrastructure that has been destroyed,"" Glenn explained. ""If Russia thinks we did it, they've already said, 'Nukes are now on the table.' That gives us a green light to use nukes,"" he added.

""This is non-military key infrastructure outside of the borders of Ukraine. To date, as far as we know, combat targets were either in Ukraine, or were military targets hit inside of Russia by Ukrainian Air Force or special forces. But the target menu now includes key civilian infrastructure: electricity, water utilities, energy production. That makes Russia more dangerous than ever. And that would be true no matter who carried out the attack,"" Glenn stated.

Now, the Russians are saying the Unted States did it, and the U.S. is saying it was Russia. But no matter who carried out the attack, ""We are facing a Cuban Missile Crisis,"" said Glenn.

""This could end up being the biggest story of our lifetime and ... if it isn't played calmly by every side, this could be World War III,"" he continued. ""Russia has already said that this gives them the right to use nuclear weapons as soon as they find out for sure who did it. That would be catastrophic, absolutely catastrophic.""

"BREAKING: House passes articles of impeachment to Senate, Pelosi names Schiff to lead trial prosecutors","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi [D-Calif.] announced Wednesday that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) will lead the seven-member prosecution team during the Senate's impeachment trial for President Donald Trump. The team will also include House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who like Schiff has been intricately involved with the impeachment process from the beginning. The Senate impeachment trial is scheduled to formally begin on Thursday.

Pelosi's announcement came just hours before the House voted to send two articles of impeachment against the president to the Senate, which have been held back by the speaker for the past four weeks.

On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck and chief researcher Jason Buttrill discussed the House's case for impeachment as they attempt to convince the Republican-majority Senate that the president abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate corruption potentially involving political rival Joe Biden, and obstructing Congress' subsequent probe.

Meanwhile, the president's team has continued to build the case proving there was extensive corruption in Ukraine. And now, Russian hackers have successfully hacked into Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas firm that employed Biden's son, Hunter, which is at the center of President Trump's impeachment allegations. What they found may be the final smoking gun needed to prove what's really been going on in Ukraine.

"Peter Schweizer: Trump’s request to investigate Biden, Ukraine was legitimate — and we have the evidence to prove it","Best-selling author and Government Accountability Institute President, Peter Schweizer, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Thursday to discuss whether or not U.S. Senators should call additional witnesses to testify or proceed to a final vote in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

In his new book, ""Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite,"" Schweizer profiles several of the 2020 Democratic contenders, including former Vice President Joe Biden.

Asked by Glenn who should be called as a witness for the defense of President Trump, Schweizer was quick to name the former vice president his son, Hunter, and Hunter's business partner, Devin Archer.

""I think if you're interested in corruption, you need to call Hunter Biden. You need to call his business partner, Devin Archer. And I think you need to call Joe Biden,"" Schweizer said. ""Because the nexus of the question here is, was Donald Trump's request of the Ukrainian leader, Zelensky, legitimate? And I think it was. Democrats want to pooh-pooh it. They want to pretend nothing happened. But if the request is real and genuine -- and I think the evidence indicates that it is -- he was actually doing his responsibility, which was looking after billions of dollars in taxpayer money that disappeared. And disappeared by people who were paying the son of the vice president of the United States.""

Schweizer told Glenn that he has documented evidence of Joe and Hunter Biden's corruption in Ukraine, including a 400-page J.P. Morgan financial document that raises several questions.

""We have [Hunter Biden's] bank statement here. We have it. We got it from a court trial involving Hunter Biden's business partner, Devin Archer, who was charged with fraud in New York. We had a researcher attend that court case, talk to the prosecutors, and got access to a 400-page J.P. Morgan financial document, which shows Hunter Biden taking large amounts of cash out of this account,"" said Schweizer.

""Flowing into that account, you not only have $83,333 a month, which works out to a million dollars a year, you also have money from Kazakh oligarchs. You have money from Swiss bank accounts, there's $1.2 million from an anonymous Swiss bank account. Where is that money coming from? Who is paying you [Hunter]? Why are they paying you?"" he asked.

""I think if you walk the American people through that, it becomes very, very obvious what's going on,"" Schweizer added.

Putin could ESCALATE war by May 9,"Russia has been talking a lot about the very “real"" risk of nuclear war lately, and Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened a ""lightning fast"" response to any foreign intervention in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Biden administration and the press continue to make ostentatiously public pledges to help Ukrainian forces.

Now, with Putin reportedly going under the knife for cancer surgery while his military suffers crushing loses in Ukraine, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) has introduced a resolution to use military force if Russia turns to weapons of mass destruction as its situation grows more and more desperate. It almost seems like some politicians want this war to escalate.

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere discuss the rising tensions between Russia and the West over the past week and explain why they believe Putin could have his own plans to escalate war efforts — with tactical nukes — as soon as May 9th.

Does Joe Biden need to eat a Snickers or is he just OLD?,"According to Joe Biden, Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices worldwide. The president claims that 70 percent of the increase in inflation was the consequence of Putin's price hike because of the impact on oil prices.

However, the notable thing about Biden's speech is less about the words he said and more about how he said them.

Glenn and Stu address Biden's agitated state on Friday's radio program with a question. ""Has anybody noticed how much of an old 'get off my lawn' man Biden is these days?"" Glenn is not the only person to notice that Biden might need to eat a Snickers bar.

Multiple instances involve Biden making an aggressive or accusatory statement about a member of Congress or a member of the press, then lashing out in angry denial.

Stu explains that everyday interactions get frustrating when you start to lose your marbles.

Glenn considers that it might be time for Biden to get a metal detector and fill his days with walks on the beach.

"Locked down Shanghai residents leap to their deaths, and Biden remains silent","The world — along with the Biden administration — SHOULD be outraged about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the destruction caused by President Putin. But there's another ongoing crisis that deserves just as much furor from around the world — yet President Biden remains silent.



On Thursday's program, Glenn details what's currently happening in Shanghai, China, where millions of residents have been forced into their homes — without food — due to strict COVID lockdown measures. People are suffering, but pets are also being thrown in trash cans and clubbed to death. Dogs and cats, in trash bags, set out on the curb like garbage.

The CCP's use of force to keep people in their homes and left to starve is even more disturbing. Lockdowns were meant to last four days, but have lasted two weeks and counting. Shanghai residents are suffering immeasurably, and many of them have already succumbed to the Chinese government's brutality over the last week.

""This is like watching what happened at our World Trade Center on 9/11, except this isn't a fire,"" Glenn said. ""These people are just trying to escape from the government, the lockdown, and hunger.""

We must demand our President speak out against this tragedy because if he doesn't, it further proves his administration has been bought and sold by the Chinese Communist Party.

Report: Newly released memos reveal Ukrainian gas firm pressured Obama admin to end corruption investigation linked to Bidens,"Newly released memos reveal that Burisma Holdings — the Ukrainian natural gas firm that employed Hunter Biden as a board member — contacted the Obama State Department on multiple occasions during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, seeking to put an end to an investigation into the gas firm's alleged corruption.

On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck discussed a new bombshell report by award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon in which recently declassified memos show Burisma representatives pressuring Obama administration officials to end the investigation and specifically naming Hunter Biden as a reason the State Department should get involved.

The final correspondence, from February 2016, took place just one month before then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless the country fired the prosecutor leading the Burisma investigation.

The memos also reveal that then-Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson, Christopher Heinz, who was partners with Hunter Biden and another Burisma board member, Devon Archer, at a firm known as Rosemont Seneca, severed ties with his former colleagues due to their participation in the Burisma dealings.

Liberal professor warns Big Tech will go 'all out' to shift votes in 2020: 'Biggest threat there is to the free and fair election',"Dr. Robert Epstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology or AIBRT, joined the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program"" on Monday, to expose the serious threat tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter pose to ""free and fair"" elections by dramatically shifting voting preferences through search-result manipulation, censorship, and content suppression.

Epstein, a lifelong liberal who has been researching the impact of online censorship for more than six years, said, ""I love humanity, my country, and democracy more than I love any particular party or candidate. And democracy, as originally conceived, cannot survive Big Tech as currently empowered,"" during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in June.

In this clip, Glenn mentioned a recent BlazeTV video titled, ""Ukraine: The Democrats' Russia,"" which has quickly become the most viewed video in the platform's history, but has been suspiciously limited in its reach on other platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.

""What they do,"" Epstein told Glenn, ""is they can either down-rank you — and they admit this by the way — they can either 'down-rank' you so people don't see you because you're not high on any list. You're popping up very, very low [in search results.] Or actually 'shadowban,' which means you send out a tweet to your 2 million followers, but your 2 million followers aren't getting the tweet, period, or just a small portion of them are getting it. But we now have a way of actually documenting this, recording it, quantifying it. So we're going to have rock solid evidence in 2020.""



Epstein detailed AIBRT's plan to prove Big Tech manipulation through a monitoring system that can detect and track these otherwise ""invisible"" practices.

Find out more at MyGoogleResearch.com.

""We are going to document it, prove it, and we're going to release our findings to the media, and to a Federal Election Commission, and to various authorities. We'll be tracking all kinds of things with a very large panel of field agents in all 50 states, including shadowbanning,"" he said.

""We'll be watching YouTube, [and the] many, many different ways — in fact five different ways — in which Facebook suppresses material. [...] We'll be monitoring Google. Google is the biggest threat there is to the free and fair election,"" Epstein added. ""I can tell you that I'm positive that these companies, if there's no monitoring system in place, these companies are going to go all out. And together, I calculate that they can shift 15 million votes next year, with no one knowing that they've done it. And without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.""

"Rudy Giuliani: I have the 'smoking gun' to prove money-laundering linked to Burisma, Bidens","President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani told Fox News' Jesse Watters that he's found the ""smoking gun'' in an investigation that has uncovered a multimillion-dollar money-laundering scheme in the Ukraine that involves far more than just Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck and chief researcher Jason Buttrill discussed Giuliani's interview on ""Watters' World"" and broke down the details in a document from the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Latvia to the Ukrainian Financial Intelligence Unit that shows a multinational money-laundering transaction that was disguised as a loan.

Glenn played a clip from the Fox News interview:

""I have, what I used to call, while I was U.S. attorney, a smoking gun,"" Giuliani said to Watters. ""This is a money-laundering transaction. It occurred just at the time that [Viktor] Shokin [Ukraine's prosecutor general in 2016] was fired. And it's about $14.6 million. This is a notice from the Latvian government to the Ukrainian government that Hunter Biden is under investigation for corruption, a 'corruption affair,'"" he explained.

""I'll simplify it: $14.8 million goes from Ukraine to a company in Latvia disguised as a loan. Then it goes from Latvia to another company, disguised as another loan in Cypress. And then it goes to the U.S.,"" he continued.

Giuliani later went on to add, ""I want to prove what happened, because I believe if we prove what happened, [President Donald Trump] will be totally vindicated.""

Glenn read a copy of the document, which was also discussed in detail during last week's special presentation: ""Ukraine: The Final Piece (The Billion-Dollar Question)"".

""This is from the prosecutor's office from the Republic of Latvia, Office for Prevention of Laundering of Proceeds Derived from Criminal Activity. This was sent to the Ukrainian FIU, that's the Financial Intelligence Unit. And the subject is Burisma Holdings Limited,"" Glenn said. ""It says [they are] currently investigating suspicious activity of Burisma Holdings Limited. According to publicly available information, Burisma Holdings Limited and its director, Hunter Biden, are involved in a corruption affair.

""The following transactions made to Burisma Holdings Limited account as PrivatBank are known to the Latvian FIU. From July of 2012, until July of 2015 ... the first one is almost $15 million from Wire Logic Technology. Then from July 2015 until December 2015, a total of $1,964,375 US dollars were received from Digitex Organization as payments for other loan agreements. The funds were partially transferred from Burisma Holding Limited account, to Devon Archer, Hunter Biden, Alan Apter, and Alexander Kwasniewski.""

"Rudy Giuliani: Manafort's 'black ledger' was a 'fraud,' part of an US-Soros collaboration in Ukraine","President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Glenn Beck during an exclusive interview on Wednesday that the infamous ""black ledger"" used to convict former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort — who is currently serving 7½ years in federal prison for financial crimes in Ukraine — was a ""fraud"" and part of an Obama-era-instated effort to discredit Donald Trump, which involved the DNC, Ukraine, and George ""Spooky Dude"" Soros.

""I am entirely convinced that this whole episode is just one chapter in at least a three or four chapter plan ... to prevent [Trump] from being president, and should he become president, the insurance policy to remove him,"" Giuliani said of the House impeachment inquiry. ""And this Ukrainian stage also had a pre-election stage, because the black ledger against Manafort turned out to be a fraud.""

Giuliani explained that a Ukrainian nonprofit known as the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC), which was co-funded by the Obama administration and far-left billionaire financier George Soros, was ironically under investigation for alleged corruption, namely a ""misplaced"" $4.4 million in U.S. funds designated to ""fight corruption inside the former Soviet republic,"" during the 2016 presidential election in America.

Ukrainian prosecutors, however, faced intense resistance from the U.S. Embassy in Kiev and then-embassy Charge d' Affaires George Kent, the latter of whom testified during the first open hearing of the impeachment inquiry last week. Along with former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. officials pressed the Ukrainian government to drop the AntAC investigation.

Then-FBI supervisor in charge of international fraud cases, Karen Greenaway, was at the time one of the lead agents in the Manafort investigation. Both Greenaway and Ambassador Yovanovitch were featured speakers at an AntAC conference in 2016, along with Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's new prosecutor general who was assigned to replace the lead prosecutor fired under pressure from the United States and then-Vice President Joe Biden. Greenaway has since joined AntAC's supervisory board.

""The FBI had a case that was two years old, went back to 2014. The FBI had dismissed the case. This rogue FBI agent Greenaway, who is now working for Soros, wanted to reopen it. In order to reopen it, they needed newly discovered evidence. And when this meeting took place in January of 2016 at the AntAC, what the Obama people were asking the Ukrainians to do was to go get information on Manafort so they could reopen the investigation. And, lo and behold, this black ledger shows up on the doorstep of a parliamentarian, who then brings it to the prosecutor, but also does not forget to bring it to The New York Times first.""

Putin ally Aleksandyr Dugin's daughter killed in car bombing,"We still don’t know who was behind the car bombing that killed the daughter of Aleksandr Dugin, a prominent Russian ultranationalist and alleged ally of President Vladimir Putin, on a highway outside of Moscow on Saturday. But whether it was a foreign strike or an inside job, it could have a devastating effect on the world.

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck warned this could be an ""Archduke Ferdinand"" moment and talked about why he believes ""we need to be very careful, very prayerful, and prepared.""

""I believe this war with Russia, this proxy war, is going to end up being Biden's biggest failure and largest criminal scandal in American history,"" Glenn began, going on to suggest it could also lead to ""the end of the western way of life if everything goes wrong, God forbid.""

It appears that Dugin, who is often called ""Putin's brain,"" was the intended target of the attack, but a last-minute decision to switch cars put Dugin's daughter, Daria Dugina, in the doomed vehicle at the time of the explosion. Now, Russia is blaming both America and Ukraine, while Dugin is calling for revenge and for Russia to ramp up attacks on Ukraine.

""[Ukraine President] Zelenskyy has warned of a nastier phase of war as Russia says the bombing was a contract killing from Ukraine,"" Glenn explained. ""If Putin escalates this war ... I believe [the United States] will respond. I urge you to pray for the president and those in power around him,"" he added.

""A war at this time ... is the ultimate way to change the world,"" Glenn said. ""Imagine if we had a devastating war. That's how worlds change. That's how everything changes.""

He continued, ""I hope this isn't it, and I don't think it is, but we don't know. I have been saying for a very long time that the next war will be fought in such a way that it will sneak up on you and we'll have an 'Archduke Ferdinand moment.' Nobody knew who Archduke Ferdinand was and we went into World War I over it. Nobody in the world really knows who Aleksandr Dugin is. I hope he's not the guy and this isn't the reason, but you need to know who he is because ... he is wildly dangerous.""

""I tend to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Pray for your country, and pray for guidance and peace,"" Glenn said.

'This is an inquisition': Schiff denies GOP witness requests on eve of 'fair' public impeachment hearings,"The House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is slated to go public on Wednesday, and three Democrat-approved witnesses -- all of whom have already testified behind closed doors -- will be taking the stand. Meanwhile, Republicans are still waiting to find out if any of their nine requested witnesses will be allowed to testify.

Beginning at 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) will hear testimony from William Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs.

On Friday at 9 a.m. ET, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, is scheduled to testify.

All three testified in closed-door interviews last month in support of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the impeachment inquiry.

""We intend to conduct these hearings with the seriousness and professionalism the public deserves. The process will be fair to the president, the committee members, and the witnesses. Above all, these hearings are intended to bring the facts to light for the American people,"" Schiff told House members in a letter Tuesday, but has yet to approve any of the nine witnesses Republicans requested on Saturday.

House Democrats voted last month on an impeachment resolution that requires the GOP to get permission from Democrats to call witnesses or subpoena documents, and Schiff has already suggested that he will not sanction testimony from either the whistleblower or Hunter Biden, both on the GOP list.

On the radio program Tuesday, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere agreed the impeachment inquiry process has been anything but ""fair to the president.""

""This is not a fair trial. This is an inquisition,"" Glenn asserted. ""The Democrats and Schiff control all of it. So they will only call who they want to call. [...] Democrats have the veto power over the Republican's wish list, which means Hunter Biden, the whistleblower, Chalupa, none of them are going to be part of this.""

The GOP's list of witness requests also includes Devon Archer, the longtime business partner of Hunter Biden; U.S Ambassador Kurt Volker; Nellie Ohr, a former contractor for opposition research firm Fusion GPS that commissioned the infamous ""Steele dossier""; former National Security Council official Tim Morrison; and former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, David Hale. As of this writing Tuesday evening, there is still no word on whether these witnesses will be allowed to appear.

'It's been hysterical to see the media screaming': Ted Cruz says MSM 'panicking' over Democrats' failing impeachment,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to discuss the two articles of impeachment House Democrats announced Tuesday, accusing President Donald Trump of ""abuse of power"" and ""obstruction of Congress.""

Cruz described the articles of impeachment as ""an admission of failure on the part of the Democrats"" that has ""0 percent chance of succeeding in the Senate.""

Cruz addressed an interview he did on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" over the weekend, saying host Chuck Todd mocked his claim that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election out of fear. The ""propagandists"" in the mainstream media, who no longer even ""pretend to be fair and objective,"" are panicking because the impeachment case is ""collapsing,"" he said.

""The reason they're laughing, the reason they're mocking and attacking any claim about Ukraine, is that they're terrified,"" Cruz continued. ""I've done 'Meet the Press' a lot of times. Chuck Todd knows how to be a real journalist. He's capable of asking questions that are real questions, and I've never seen Chuck Todd panic as much as he did on Sunday. And all the media is panicking because they see the Democrats' case collapsing, and they're running like rats from a ship.""

Cruz went on to say that the Democrats' impeachment case is collapsing because they have failed to present any facts or evidence to indicate that the president committed an impeachable offense — and the partisan media know it.

""They are desperately trying to preserve the narrative. I have to say, it's been hysterical to see the media screaming,"" he added. ""The fact that they get so hysterical is revealing. It shows how scared they are. They don't have any evidence. And what they're going to do next week, which is vote to impeach, they decided they wanted to do in November of 2016. So, it's unrelated to any facts. It's not related to evidence.""

Cruz later confirmed that the Senate will hold an impeachment trial to expose the corruption in Ukraine. Read more on this here.

"Ted Cruz on impeachment trial: Dems just threw Joe Biden under the bus, and blasted holes in their own argument","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Friday to discuss the latest developments in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.

According to Cruz, Thursday was a ""very consequential day"" in the otherwise tedious and redundant impeachment proceedings.

""Yesterday, the House managers effectively threw Joe Biden under the bus,"" Cruz said. ""They doubled down on what they started doing on the first day of arguments, which was making their entire case ... based on the proposition that there was zero evidence to justify investigating Burisma [the Ukrainian natural gas company that paid then-Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, $50,000 a month to sit on the board].""

Cruz went on to explain that every time the Democrats, namely House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), rehash the ""zero-evidence"" argument, they open the door for Republicans to present the overwhelming evidence that contradicts those claims.

""That proposition, that there's zero evidence to investigate Burisma, is utterly and completely absurd. So, I'm looking forward to Saturday when the president's lawyers will begin presenting his case. Because what the Democrats have done, is they have opened the door to this. And I hope the president's lawyers will stand up and systematically lay out the case,"" Cruz said.

""They've been arguing that Hunter Biden is completely irrelevant to this case. Well, the House managers have now, through their arguments, made Hunter Biden not only relevant — he was always relevant — but critical now,"" he continued. ""They built the entire case, like a house of cards, on the proposition that there was no reasonable basis to investigate Burisma. And that's just absurd.""

The two also discussed Cruz's new podcast, ""Verdict with Ted Cruz,"" which he records with Daily Wire host Michael Knowles each night following the Senate trial.

""Last night's podcast went through systematically ... all of the overwhelming evidence of corruption from Burisma that any president, not only had the authority to investigate, but the responsibility to investigate,"" Cruz said. ""And that, ultimately, is why President Trump is going to be acquitted at the end of this process.""

'The evidence is clear': New details show collusion did occur — with Obama White House,"Executive Vice President at The Hill, John Solomon, joined Glenn Beck on Tuesday's radio program to discuss recently uncovered evidence of collusion and foreign meddling in the 2016 presidential election — by the Obama administration.

John spoke with several top Ukrainian officials who acknowledged that they released a ""black ledger"" file during the 2016 election in an effort to sway the election in Hillary Clinton's favor.

""They admitted that the goal was to help Hillary Clinton,"" John said. ""The evidence is clear. There is a court ruling in Ukraine, which says the Ukrainian government wrongly released this document in an effort to sway the 2016 election. And then there was a tape recording released by that court ... in which a top member of what you would call the FBI of Ukraine ... he was captured in the tape recording, bragging that he was trying to help Hillary Clinton.""

But that was just the tip of the iceberg. After learning of the black-ledger leak, John continued to look into the connections between Obama-era White House officials, Ukraine and the origins of the Russia-Trump collusion narrative. He discovered ""a series of events where you have a foreign government now admitting on the record that they tried to intervene in the 2016 election — but it wasn't Russia. It was Ukraine.""

Top Ukraine adviser Andriy Yermak refutes key impeachment testimony,"A top Ukrainian official has disputed key claims made by Democratic witnesses testifying in the impeachment case against President Donald Trump, according to a recent report in Time magazine.

Andriy Yermak, the top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland did not inform him of a quid pro quo offer when the two spoke in Warsaw last fall -- a claim Sondland made during his testimony that has become central to the Democrats' impeachment argument against the president.

Instead, Yermak said the two men briefly met by the escalator after a meeting between President Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence, and they both agreed the meeting between the two world leaders went very well.

""Gordon [Sondland] and I were never alone together,"" Yermak told Time in an interview last week. ""We bumped into each other in the hallway next to the escalator as I was walking out ... and I remember – everything is fine with my memory – we talked about how well the meeting went. That's all we talked about.""

On Wednesday's radio program, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere discussed the Time interview and what Yermak's version of events mean for the Democrats' impeachment proceedings against President Trump.

IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE? Glenn Beck reads transcript of Trump-Ukraine phone call,"An unnamed whistleblower alleged that President Donald Trump threatened to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if their president didn't get his government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's actions regarding his son Hunter Biden's dealings with a Ukranian natural gas firm called Burisma Holdings. Democrats immediately demanded the release of transcripts of what was said during a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Though President Trump agreed to release ""the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine"" in a tweet on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that Democrats would begin an official impeachment inquiry against the president.

On Wednesday's radio show, Glenn Beck was mid-interview with comedian Nick DePaulo when he received copy of the newly released transcript of President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.



Glenn interrupted the interview to share the transcript's content to listeners. Here's what he read:

President Trump: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States. You did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It's fantastic. Congratulations.

President Zelensky: You are absolutely right Mr. President. We did win big. We worked hard for this. We worked a lot and I would like to confess to you that I had opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections. And, yes, it is true these were unique elections. We were in a unique situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I'm able to tell you this: the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so we can talk on the phone more often. [Laughter.]

President Trump: That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.

President Zelensky: Well, yes, to tell you truth. We are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swap here in our country. We brought in many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us in that.

President Trump: Well, it's very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spent a lot of effort and a lot of time, much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost done nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel, she talks about Ukraine but she doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way. I think it's something you want to look at, but the United States has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn't say it's reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good, but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.

President Zelensky: Yes, you are absolutely right. Not only 100 percent, but actually 1000 percent and I can tell you the following: I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and told them they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should for Ukraine. It turns out that even though, logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner, but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union. And am grateful for you because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than European Union, especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps, specifically we are almost ready to buy more javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

President Trump: I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine. They say Crowdstrike -- I guess you have one of your wealthy people -- the server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you are surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you, or your people, and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, the whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it, if that's possible.

President Zelensky: Yes, it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me, as a president, it's important, and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from the United States and he will be replaced by very competent and experienced ambassador who will work hard to make sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like to hope to see him having your trust and confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you one of my assistants spoke to Mr. Giuliani recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to the Ukraine. I just want to assure you, once again, that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you, Mr. President, have friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership. I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation, I guarantee as the president of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly. That I can assure you.

President Trump: Good, because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him, that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, she was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news. So, I just want to let you know that. The other thing, there's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So, whatever you can do with the Attorney General, that would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it -- it sounds horrible to me.

President Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100 percent my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the Parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the investigation of this case is actually the issue of making sure they restore honesty, so we can take care of that and we will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask if you have any additional information that you could provide us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure we administer justice in our country with regard to the ambassador of the United States from Ukraine, as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100 percent. Her attitude towards me was far from the best, as she admired the previous president and she was on his side. She would not accept me as the new president well enough.

President Trump: I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

No impeachable offense: Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz says Dems have nothing criminal to allege or 'they would have done it already',"On the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Monday, Harvard Law professor and lawyer on President Donald Trump's impeachment defense team Alan Dershowitz explains the history of impeachment and its process, why the framers did not include abuse of power as criteria for a Constitutional impeachment, why the Democrats are framing their case the way they are, and what to look for in the upcoming Senate trial.

Dershowitz argued that ""abuse of power"" -- one of two articles of impeachment against Trump approved by House Democrats last month -- is not an impeachable act.

""There are two articles of impeachment. The second is 'obstruction of Congress.' That's just a false accusation,"" said Dershowitz. ""But they also charge him, in the Ukraine matter, with abuse of power. But abuse of power was discussed by the framers (of the U.S. Constitution) ... the framers refused to include abuse of power because it was too broad, too open-ended.

""In the words of James Madison, the father of our Constitution, it would lead presidents to serve at the will of Congress. And that's exactly what the framers didn't want, which is why they were very specific and said a president can be impeached only for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,"" he added.

""What's alleged against President Trump is not criminal,"" added Dershowitz. ""If they had criminal issues to allege, you can be sure they would have done it. If they could establish bribery or treason, they would have done it already. But they didn't do it. They instead used this concept of abuse of power, which is so broad and general ... any president could be charged with it.""

What is the REAL Mar-a-Lago raid endgame?,"If you're celebrating this FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago, you have no idea how much this changes things. We don't do this in America. At least, we didn't. But the left cannot have Donald Trump be president again. His ""America First"" platform goes against everything they've been working for. So, what's their endgame here? On the radio program, Glenn Beck said there's really only one endgame that makes sense — and it should scare us all.

""If you are not for the destruction of America, you better pay attention quickly. This is a massive move,"" Glenn said of the Mar-a-Lago raid.

""Who has credibility on this? ... The right will believe Donald Trump, but nobody on the left, so you're not going to change any minds there. Do you think the right will believe the New York Times? MSNBC? NBC? CBS? Do you think we're going to believe the New York Times — the people who have been carrying water for the Biden crimes? The Clinton crimes? And ... I'm talking about her server and having her own State Department people go into a skiff, which is the top secret room, completely sealed off, going in and getting documents, cutting off 'top secret,' and then emailing them to her on her private server. And nothing? And now you're going to try to convince me [that] this has nothing to do with January 6?"" he added.

""Remember the [allegations about] bank servers, [Trump] was pinging a bank? Untrue. Carter Page is a Russian spy? Untrue. Donald Trump is a Russian spy? ... Untrue. Collusion with Russia? Untrue. Ukraine, the perfect phone call? Not true. Not true. Wasn't a perfect phone call. Was not impeachable. The pee tape dossier? None of that was true. Here's why they can't have [Trump] as president of the United States. They can't have him as president of the United States because we are headed towards a completely new, all redesigned, non-capitalist, nonconstitutional Great Reset,"" Glenn argued. ""They cannot have him be president because he is America first.""

Glenn warned Americans that our federal government is accumulating massive power, case in point the 87,000 new IRS agents. ""Coupled with the [IRS agents] they already have ... that's almost the size of our National Guard. Do you feel comfortable with that? Democrats? You don't think there's a possibility ... that someone ... might come in at some point and weaponize the IRS?""

He also warned that the FBI's raid on Donald Trump’s home has implications that stretch far beyond simple dislike for the former president. So what are they hoping to accomplish?

""What is the endgame? You make him into a martyr by throwing him into jail or killing him ... so you make him stronger. That doesn't make sense, why would they want that?"" Glenn asked. ""So, what is their endgame? The only one that makes sense to me, is to stop him at any cost, then lunatics will take to the streets, and then [the Democrats] will have evidence that the [right is] more dangerous than anyone could possibly imagine. Please, pray for your country.""

BOMBSHELL: Newly discovered document points to missing $1.8 billion in Ukraine,"On the radio program Thursday, Glenn Beck sat down with chief researcher Jason Buttrill to go over a few of the findings he and the research team uncovered while looking into the phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to the Democrats' now-failed impeachment charade.



Glenn explained that there were ""things in the phone call that just didn't make sense to us"" that prompted them to dive deeper into the research process and to find out, once and for all, what happened to the $1.8 billion in aid that went missing in Ukraine's largest bank, PrivatBank.

Jason revealed a bombshell discovery: an urgent letter from the Latvian government to the Ukrainians, which has changed the entire narrative about who and what was involved in the corruption going on in Ukraine.

""This document ... is the jumping-off point,"" said Jason. ""It shows you the path to follow the money.""

Glenn explained how the money trails all tie back to a corrupt and brutal oligarch named Igor Kolomoisky.

""This guy [Kolomoisky] is actually viewed in Ukraine ... as a brutal, brutal oligarch. Nobody messes with him. Okay? Chainsaws to the neck. Nobody messes with him,"" Glenn said. ""But we also found out, there are a lot of people that view him as an extreme patriot. Now it gets interesting. Now it really starts to get interesting. Why is he a patriot? Because he's a guy that buys arms, and funds armies. He's a guy, when it comes to Russia, he's a guy that happened to, as all of our money disappears, to go on a spending spree.""

Ukraine whistleblower: George Soros behind DNC pressure to fire prosecutor at center of impeachment inquiry,"On the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Thursday, Glenn and chief researcher Jason Buttrill recapped part of an in-depth interview with a new Ukraine whistleblower, Andrii Telizhenko.



Telizhenko was an adviser to former Ukrainian chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was ousted during an investigation into Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, sat on the board. The Obama administration claims that the Ukrainian prosecutor was fired over alleged corruption. Biden even bragged, with cameras rolling, that he threatened to withhold a billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine ""if the prosecutor is not fired.""

According to Telizhenko, however, Shokin was fired because a George Soros funded non-governmental organization (NGO) wanted him gone.

"Glenn Beck: Chuck Schumer, Democrats admit NO Trump-Ukraine 'quid pro quo'","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he was ""appalled"" by Republican calls to release the name of the whistleblower at the center of the House impeachment inquiry.

""[T]he calls to make the whistleblower's identity are despicable,"" added Schumer during a Senate floor speech on Tuesday. ""The whole purpose of the whistleblower law was to protect people when they had the courage to come forward. This whistleblower was obviously coming forward because he was so concerned about where President Trump was leading America.""

On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere questioned why Democrats refuse to release information about the whistleblower if they actually want his story to be heard.



""I want this guy to testify. You know who doesn't? The Democrats,"" Glenn said. ""They were like, 'You're going to put him in danger. You're going to have blood on your hands.' Really? Because every Republican wants his name out. They want him to testify ... not so people can get him — that would be your side [Democrats] that would not want him to testify. You don't want him known because you don't want his record known,"" he added.

""Republicans need to be very clear: Protect this guy at all costs. If you watched the 'Untouchables,' this guy is the accountant,"" he continued. ""This guy is the accountant and the FBI would like, in that movie, would like for the accountant to testify. Al Capone doesn't.""

Glenn noted that Democrats are accusing President Trump of ""quid pro quo,"" which is exactly what former Vice President Joe Biden admitted to doing when he bragged to the world, with cameras rolling, that he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid if the Ukraine investigation into Burisma gas firm and Hunter Biden wasn't stopped.



But when Democrats, like Chuck Schumer, claim the whistleblower was actually ""concerned about where President Trump was leading America,"" they're admitting that the accusations against President Trump are not that he committed ""quid pro quo,"" but that they don't like him looking into what really happened in Ukraine.

""That's not quid pro quo,"" Glenn said of the Ukraine whistleblower's allegations. ""He was concerned with where this president was leading America. That's what the whistleblower testimony says. That's what the two ambassadors' testimony says. It's not quid pro quo. Their testimony was that he [Trump] was changing policy in Ukraine, and it was going to be very dangerous.""

Glenn went on to explain how Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, were using foreign intelligence and foreign operatives in Ukraine for their own purposes.

UPDATE: Congress suddenly cancels testimony of former Ukrainian Prosecutor General in Burisma hearings,"On Thursday's program, Glenn was joined by Andrii Telizhenko, former adviser to the prosecutor general of Ukraine, to give the latest on what he believes Alexandra Chalupa and the whistleblower were working on with Joe Biden.

Andrii Telizhenko was on a train headed to D.C. to testify when he received news he would not be called as a witness. Glenn dug in to find out why.

Glenn Beck russia ukraine,"Something regarding Russia's invasion into Ukraine — and the way the west responded to it — hasn't made sense to Glenn Beck since the chaos all began.

While Russia is increasing its nuclear preparedness and while western oil markets are struggling amid sanctions, the Biden administration closed yet another avenue for oil here in the United States. Western countries have also blocked certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network, but that comes with a potentially devastating catch for the U.S. too.

Glenn has been carefully combing through the details of the struggle between Russia and Ukraine: Which countries have backed Russian President Putin, new ways the world is standing against Russia, and what Ukrainian politicians predict may be coming next. But some of the so-called ""facts"" just ""don't make sense,"" he observed. For example, why didn’t Putin immediately destroy internet access in Ukraine to confuse both citizens and its military? And why did world leaders wait several days before enacting SWIFT sanctions?

In this clip, Glenn starts to piece the puzzle together: It's the first time the western world has formed such a powerful ""coalition"" — including multiple public-private partnerships between banks, big corporations, and world governments — in response to foreign disputes. But the way world leaders banded together demonstrates what may be coming for us all: The Great Reset. And now, proponents of the World Economic Forum's masterplan have a crisis on their hands they likely will not let go to waste.

"REPORT: Ukraine whistleblower worked with Biden, Brennan, DNC to initiate Trump-Russia inquiry — and his identity is no secret","On the radio program Thursday, Glenn Beck took a look at a new report from RealClearInvestigations that claims to have uncovered the identity of the whistleblower at the root of the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

The whistleblower is being interviewed privately, and Democrats aren't letting Republicans ask questions about him. They claim to fear for his safety, but are likely more concerned about hiding the informant's ties to the Obama White House and the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Not only did the registered Democrat and CIA official work with former CIA Director John Brennan and former Vice President Joe Biden during the Obama administration, but he was also Biden's right-hand-man while the former vice president was manipulating the firing of Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma and Hunter Biden. He also worked very closely with a Democratic National Committee ""operative"" named Alexandra Chalupa, who we now know was working with Ukraine officials to dig up dirt on Donald Trump in 2016. It's all starting to make sense now.

Glenn Beck details how the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower bypass​ed nearly ALL of Intel community's legal channels,"On Tuesday's show, Glenn Beck used his chalkboard to explain the Intelligence Community's official process for whistleblower complaints and shows how the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower bypassed 4.5 out of 5 of the Intelligence Community's legal channels

Glenn broke down the whistleblower process, in accordance with the ""Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA)"", into five steps:

1.) The whistleblower must first report to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community.



2.) The Inspector General (IG) has 14 days to determine if the complaint is ""credible and of urgent concern.""

In the Intelligence Community, an ""urgent concern"" is defined as: ""A serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of the law or Executive order, or deficiency relating to the funding, administration, or operation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the Director of National Intelligence involving classified information, but does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters.""

At the time President Trump's whistleblower filed the complaint, August 12, 2019, to be deemed ""credible"" the complainant ""must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG [Inspector General of the Intelligence Community] cannot transmit information via the ICWPA [Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act] based on an employee's second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when a fellow employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing.""

3.) If the IG determines that the complaint is credible and of urgent concern, they must forward it to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).



4.) The DNI has 7 days to submit the report to Congress.

5.) If the information is deemed not credible and urgent, or no action is taken, the whistleblower can go directly to Congress, BUT he/she must tell the Inspector General and work with the Director of National Intelligence to ensure classified information is in no way compromised.

Glenn went on to compare the official process to the way President Donald Trump's whistleblower reported directly to Congress, circumventing both the Inspector General and the Director of National Intelligence.

""But here's how it worked with [Trump's] whistleblower, for some reason,"" Glenn explained. ""He goes right directly to Congress. He skips steps one through four. [He] goes directly to five, but ... he doesn't do any of the IG or the DNI. This is a guy who is worried about our national security, he's supposedly an intelligence officer, and he does this? [...] He skipped right to five, and only did half of five.""

Why would Hunter Biden release a memoir NOW?,"During his campaign, President Joe Biden survived scandal after scandal involving his son Hunter — the Ukraine/Burisma scandal, the laptop scandal, the one involving a stripper from Arkansas and a long-lost child. And yet, after it all appeared to have been swept under the rug, Hunter has now released a memoir — ""Beautiful Things.""

Filling in for Glenn Beck on the radio program this week, Pat Gray and Stu Burguiere discussed Hunter's ""horrible"" response when asked on ""CBS This Morning"" if the laptop seized by the FBI in 2019 belonged to him and reviewed a few segments from his new book, which they agreed raises the question: Is Hunter trying to sabotage his father's career?

John Solomon: Ex-ambassador Yovanovitch blocked Ukraine investigation before being ousted by Trump,"On Friday's radio program, award-winning investigative journalist John Solomon joined Glenn Beck to detail how Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, obstructed investigations into potential corruption and interference by Democratic and Ukrainian officials in the 2016 U.S. election.

The Trump administration recalled Yovanovitch from her post in May. The whistleblower complaint at the center of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump alleged that Yovanovitch was recalled because of claims made by former Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko.

A White House memo of the July 25 phone call referenced in the whistleblower complaint, documents President Trump speaking to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky about Yovanovitch. ""The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just want to let you know that,"" he said.

During a House deposition on Friday, Yovanovitch told congressional investigators, ""there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018.""

In this clip, Solomon breaks down the timeline. Starting last year, several Ukraine officials working under Prosecutor General Lutsenko raised alarms concerning Yovanovitch's conduct, saying not only was she meddling in Ukraine domestic affairs, trying to control who the government there could and couldn't prosecute, but that former Vice President Joe Biden was also up to something fishy concerning his son, Hunter, and Ukrainian gas company Burisma. But when they tried to bring it to the attention of American politicians, Yovanovitch blocked their visa applications from ever going further than her desk.



""There were three waves of concern expressed by Ukrainian authorities including the prosecutors and other officials. In May of 2018, then-House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, Republican from Texas and one of the most powerful chairmen in all of Congress at the time, he made a trip over to the Ukraine. He came back and wrote a letter to the brand-new Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and he said, 'I have heard some deeply troubling reports from both Ukrainians and Americans, that our ambassador is bad-mouthing President Trump, and I think you should recall her.' That was the first time that Ukrainians on the ground raised concerns that they saw the ambassador engaged in inappropriate behavior, interfering investigations, that sort of stuff,"" Solomon explained.

""A few months passed and nothing happened. So the Ukrainian prosecutors under Lutsenko ... hired an American lawyer. This is in the October-November time frame of 2018,"" he continued. ""They hired a former U.S. attorney here in the United States and they gave him a packet of information of things that they felt were wrong. One, that the ambassador was interfering in the Ukrainian internal affairs, like telling who he could prosecute and not prosecute. Two, that Joe Biden had fired a prosecutor, who was investigating his son's company, Burisma. And, three, there is some significant evidence and there is about to be a court ruling in Ukraine ... that Ukraine inappropriately interfered in the U.S. election in 2016.""

Solomon pointed out that the Ukrainian prosecutors ""tried on their own to get visas to come to the United States,"" but that the U.S. Embassy would not process the request. ""They were just sitting there unprocessed. They wouldn't reject them, they wouldn't approve him. So they were in limbo,"" he said.

""The third wave is when, eventually, Lutsenko ... reaches out to me and agrees to do an interview,"" Solomon added. ""He says, on the record, what had happened, confirming what Pete Sessions said, confirming what the prosecutors had done in the fall, and legitimately raising concerns.... When we have a diplomat on our soil in Ukraine, their job is not to tell us what to do in our internal affairs, it's to deal with American policy. It's not to tell us who we can and can't prosecute on our own soil. So three waves over a year ... and all before Rudy Giuliani got on the ground in Ukraine.""

Could FTX CEO and Democrat megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried get 'Epsteined'?,"On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV hosts Sara Gonzales and Alex Stein, along with actor and director Matthew Marsden, talked about the ongoing saga of Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and founder of FTX cryptocurrency who is accused of stealing billions of dollars from the customers of his now-collapsed company.

Bankman-Fried faces up to life in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission and commit campaign finance violation. He allegedly used billions of dollars from FTX customers for his own personal use, to repay loans owed by Alameda Research, and to donate millions of dollars to political campaigns.

He was also the Democrats' second-biggest campaign donor, second only to George Soros. Are we about to see another Jeffrey Epstein situation?

Hillary Clinton compares pro-lifers to war crime rapists,"On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV hosts Sara Gonzales, Chad Prather, and Alex Stein, along with BlazeTV contributor John Doyle, discussed Hillary Clinton's recent interview with PBS' Christiane Amanpour, in which the twice-failed presidential candidate compared pro-lifers to war criminals and rapists in Iran, Afghanista,n or Ukraine.

Asked for her thoughts on ""what's happening to women around the world,"" Clinton said she believes women have ""have come a long way"" but that progress is ""under attack"" both literally and politically.

""There is a lot of pushback, and much of the progress that has been, I think, taken for granted by too many people is under attack. Literally under attack in places like Iran or Afghanistan or Ukraine — where rape is a tactic of war — or under attacks by political and cultural forces in a country like our own when it comes to women’s health care and bodily autonomy,"" Clinton asserted.

""Arkansas itself, I believe, rapidly moved to make a woman’s right to choose illegal in your state, or your former home state,"" Amanpour responded. ""Talk to me about the confluence of both these events, this pushback on American women’s rights at the same time as you’re trying to figure a way forward.”

""You're absolutely right,"" Clinton responded. ""[When] women have a chance to vote on these draconian abortion restrictions, they do not accept them. They overturn them. They certainly want to limit the reach of the government into the most intimate, private parts of our life.""

She went on to add, ""So, we’ll see what happens in states like Arkansas and so many others when we face real-world problems, as we have seen already, where women with miscarriages go in for medical care and are turned away. When maybe, God forbid, a woman dies because that health care is denied her.""

Zelenskyy and wife take a break from war to pose for Vogue,"Between courageously defending their nation in the face of Russia’s brutal invasion and the non-stop rigors of cashing in on all those billions of U.S. aid dollars, it's a wonder that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife Olena Zelenska were able to find the time for a little photo shoot with Vogue magazine.

The magazine shared a few photos from the upcoming October 2022 issue on social media Wednesday.

On ""The News & Why It Matters"" Wednesday, BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales, BlazeTV host Elijah Schaffer of ""Slightly Offens*ve,"" and head writer and researcher for Glenn Beck Jason Buttrill discussed the ""portrait of bravery"" and asked, ""How many billions of dollars did the U.S. send Ukraine again?""

Ron DeSantis says Biden is to blame for record-high gas prices,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) ripped into President Joe Biden over record-high gas prices, which the administration first blamed on supply disruptions from the COVID pandemic, then Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and, most recently, oil refineries in the United States.

Not only does the president not have any ""proactive solutions"" for skyrocketing gas prices, but his policies are the ""cause of a lot of it,"" DeSantis said on ""Fox & Friends.""

""Joe Biden came into office and declared war on American energy. We were energy independent for the first time in my life. When he came into office, he had sweeping executive orders to try to kneecap American energy production,"" DeSantis began.

""This is a global market, it's not just the U.S., but [Biden] has made it way worse here in this country,"" he continued. ""They will not reverse course. This is just a religion for them to be attacking energy production in the United States, and people are paying at the pump like never before. It's hammering blue-collar people, working people because ... it impacts everything in the economy.""

""There's also the fact that they printed trillions of dollars that we didn't have,"" DeSantis added. ""Those two factors have created a really a hellish scenario and now we're on the precipice of — if we're not already in — a formal recession. Maybe that won't happen, but I think everyone's looking at it and saying, 'under Biden, with his policies, he's going to plunge this country into a recession.""

On a recent episode of ""The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin predicted that DeSantis' ""political sanity and rationality"" would be a ""gold mine"" for conservatives in the upcoming midterm elections.

""Republicans [could] really turn this thing around, and that's why I'm feeling good about the world right now,"" Dave said. ""Opportunity is right in front of us, but we have to grab it.""

Jordan Peterson makes CHILLING prediction for what Putin will do next,"On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a clip of Canadian author and clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson telling Piers Morgan how he thinks the Russia-Ukraine war will end and what he would do if he were Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""How does this war end, do you think?"" Morgan asked Peterson on Sky News Australia's ""Uncensored.""

""We're going to find out this winter,"" Peterson replied. ""I know what I would do in [Putin's] shoes. I'd wait till the first cold snap and shut off the taps.""



""Right. Because he's got control over the energy,"" Morgan agreed.

""Of course, he's going to do that,"" Peterson added. ""He's already warned the West with his insistence that maintenance problems were necessary and the pipelines had to be shut down.""

Morgan then asked Peterson for his thoughts on whether Putin would use nuclear weapons ""even if it starts World War III.""

Psaki desperately defends Biden inflation,"On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin reacted to White House press secretary Jen Psaki's desperate attempt to convince Americans that a year ago nobody could possibly have predicted today's soaring inflation.

""We know, if we look at the recent inflation data, a per-, a large-, depending on which data you look at, two-thirds to even 70 percent of inflation data is a result of energy prices,"" Psaki stammered. ""A- a- large part of that is the result — and, and, and Chairman Powell has spoken to this and Secretary, um, Secretary Yellen has also spoken to this — as a result of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and the impact on the gloyal-, global energy markets. Those are all steps and impacts that I don't think anyone could have predicted a year ago.""

""Nonsense. Everyone could have predicted it,"" Dave commented.

""It's also a lie that this is all because of Putin ... we know that this isn't because of Putin, right. First off, prices were going up — we've covered this many times — gas prices were already up over a dollar before the the invasion of Ukraine. ... And do you think if you endlessly print money ... that the amount that you had first might start dropping? Well, that's what they've been doing. They endlessly print money,"" he added.

Bryce Mitchell slams Biden,"Because apparently it's important to know what every athlete, actor, and talking-head thinks about foreign policy, UFC fighter Bryce Mitchell was asked to weigh in on the "" whole Russia-Ukraine situation."" However, the Arkansas native's answer ended up being well worth a listen.

“My first thought is, I'm not going nowhere to fight none of these wars for these politicians,” Mitchell said. “I'm staying at home and when the war comes to Arkansas, I will dig my boots in the ground and I will die for everything I love and I will not retreat,"" he continued.

""If this country is invaded and everybody's saying well, ‘we got to evacuate. we got to leave,’ I will not. I will dig my boots in Arkansas soil and I will fight for the people that I love, for the land that I love and the way of life that I love. But I'm not going overseas to fight.”

Mitchell then turned his attention to President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and their dubious dealings in Ukraine.

“I don't know what's going on to be honest, brother, I really don't. There's so much stuff and I don't think nobody knows what's going on fully. There's been so much political corruption in that area. You got Biden and his son making a sh*t ton of money off of and using our tax dollars to bribe their people. That's treasonous in my opinion,” he stated.

“He shouldn't be giving our tax dollars to that country anyway. We got veterans out here sleeping on the street and you're going to give our frickin' tax dollars to these Ukrainians. Brother, I don't know what's going on over there, but I'm not going over there and fighting. And God bless anybody that’s over there fighting,"" he added.

Mitchell also made headlines recently for his pledge to give half of his fight purse, $45,000, to charity following his win over Edson Barboza on Saturday.

""I’m about to show you I’m not just good at hurting people. I can help people. Half of my fight purse, $45,000, is going to Arkansas children with medical conditions who have no hope. We will be their hope! In the name of God these children will be healed,” he announced.

On “The Rubin Report” Monday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared the viral clip of Mitchell's epic Biden takedown, pointing out how the MMA fighter made more sense than our corrupt corporate media.

Elon Musk drops BRUTAL response to Ukraine ambassador who told him to 'F*** off' — then flips his own script,"Earlier this month, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk caused a whole lot of bipartisan outrage by daring to propose a plan to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine. In response to Musk's Twitter poll about possible conditions for negotiating peace, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, told the Tesla CEO to ""f*** off.""

Predictably, Musk was accused of siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin despite having frequently spoken out in support of Ukraine and providing the nation with thousands of free Starlink satellite units and free satellite service after Russia attacked Ukraine's communications system early in the war.



On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a clip of CBS “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert attacking Musk with the baseless accusation that he's suddenly a stooge for Putin.

Stephen Colbert Attacks Elon Musk with a Vicious Accusation | DM CLIPS | Rubin Report www.youtube.com

In response to an article in the ""Financial Times"" that criticized the provided communications systems and claimed they were, in part, ""purchased by the U.S. government or crowdfunded by donors,"" Musk revealed that SpaceX has already spent $80 million to help Ukraine and that the costs will ""exceed $100 million by the end of the year.""



But it looks like Musk's charitable contributions may be coming to an end. According to a CNN report, a SpaceX director sent a letter to the Pentagon last month saying the company can't continue to fund the Starlink service without some funding from the Pentagon.

A correspondent for ""The Kiev Post"" noted that Starlink's move came after Melnyk's poorly judged jab at his country's benefactor.

“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk replied.

In the end, though, Musk seemed to have a change of heart. ""The hell with it ... even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free,"" he tweeted.

'Bidengate' VIDEO: Joe Biden brags to the Council on Foreign Relations about withholding $1 billion in aid from Ukraine,"On Monday's episode of ""White House Brief,"" Jon discussed a 2018 video in which former Vice President Joe Biden bragged about threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid from Ukraine unless Ukraine fired the lead prosecutor investigating Burisma, the company tied to Biden's son, Hunter Biden.

""Joe Biden's son, Hunter, was a consultant and a board member for a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma,"" Jon said. ""Burisma is riddled with corruption charges and came under investigation by a prosecutor for corruption ... after they start the investigation for corruption, Joe Biden gets on the phone with the president of Ukraine and says fire that prosecutor or else. Biden admits that he does this on tape.""

While speaking on a panel with the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden bragged about withholding aid to Ukraine.

""I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and Yanukovych that they would take action against the state prosecutor and they didn't. So they were walking out of the press conference, and I said we were not going to give them the $1 billion. They said you have no authority. You are not the president. The president said ... I said call him,"" Biden said. ""I'm telling you, you are not getting $1 billion. I said you're not getting $1 billion and I am going to be leaving here in six hours and if the prosecutor is not fired you are not getting the money. Well, son of a b**** ... he got fired.""

""If that is not a quid pro quo, then I do not know what is,"" Jon said.

According to the Democrats, the Ukraine scandal involved Trump telling Ukraine that he would withhold money if he did not get dirt on Joe Biden. Jon asserted that it turns out that everything the Democrats claimed Trump said is what Biden said to the former president of Ukraine.

""Joe Biden said to this guy, 'Hey, if you don't stop investigating this company my son is on the board of, I'm not going to give you $1 billion in aid,"" Jon asserted.

Joe Biden denied having prior knowledge of his son's business that was under investigation in Ukraine.

Later, Jon discussed NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio making it a crime to use the term ""illegal alien"" with the intent to demean, undermine, or harass a person. If found guilty, the crime may be punishable by a $250,000 fine.

""Mayor Bill de Blasio, I say shame on you,"" Jon said. ""Shame on you. And let me make you this guarantee, I will never stop calling them what they are, and that is the illegal aliens who should not be here. They are illegal aliens, and they should be deported far far away and then we should finish the damn wall so they can never come back. I will never comply with your Orwellian demands, and you will never prevent me from speaking the truth.""

Trump Snaps at fake news Media: 'Be Quiet! Be Quiet!',"On Friday, President Trump spoke to the media before his departure on Marine One. In this clip, Trump addressed questions related to the public hearings and testimony on the impeachment inquiry scheduled this week.

""I just told them, 'I've got to come over and see the fake news.' Let's go. What do you have, John?"" Trump said.

You can read the full transcript here.

According to WhiteHouse.gov, Trump began:

""THE PRESIDENT: I just told them, 'I've got to come over and see the fake news.' Let's go. What do you have, John?....

THE PRESIDENT: We are looking for corruption. We're giving hundreds of millions of dollars, and we're looking for corruption. And all you have to do is take a look at Biden, and you'll see tremendous corruption because what he did is quid pro quo times 10.

Q. Did you ask your DOJ?

THE PRESIDENT: And let me just tell you —

Q. Did you ask —

THE PRESIDENT: Be quiet.

Q. — your DOJ?

THE PRESIDENT: Quiet.

Q. Did you ask your DOJ?

THE PRESIDENT: Quiet.

Q. It's a simple question. Did you ask —

THE PRESIDENT: Quiet.

Q. — your DOJ?

THE PRESIDENT: Are you ready?

Q. Yes, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: I never spoke to him about anything. It's up to Bill Barr. Bill Barr can do whatever he wants to do. But I saw the same tape on television. And the tape shows that Joe Biden is a crook. He's 100 percent crooked. And the fake news, which is you and you — you don't want to do anything about it.

Q. We reported it.

THE PRESIDENT: His son walked out with millions of dollars from Ukraine, millions of dollars from China. He doesn't know anything. He walked away with a stash. It's a corrupt deal. It's a corrupt enterprise. And if the press did it right, it's a hell of a story.""

Pat Gray's dramatic 'mafia-style' reading of the whistleblower complaint transcript,"On Friday's episode of ""Pat Gray Unleashed,"" Pat discussed the transcript from the whistleblower report presented on Thursday by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

In this clip, Pat explained how Schiff's exaggerated retelling of the whistleblower complaint transcript sounded like a mafia movie radio bit.

Here is what Schiff told the committee:

We've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though. I am going to say this only seven times, so you had better listen well. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent. Understand? Lots of it. On this and on that. I am going to put you in touch with people and not just any people. I am going to put you in touch with the attorney general of the united states, my attorney general Bill Barr. He has got the whole weight of the American law enforcement behind him. And I am going to put you in touch with Rudy. You are going to love him; trust me. You know what I am asking, and so I am only going to say this a few more times and in a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again. I will call you when you have done what I have asked.

Ohio Rep. Mike Turner (R) spoke out at the hearing to inform the committee that Schiff's version of the transcript was inaccurate.

""As he was speaking, I heard had someone text me to say is he just making this up? Sometimes fiction is better than the actual words in the text. Luckily, the American public is smart, and they have the transcript, they have read the conversation, and they know when someone is making something up,"" Turner said.

Here's what Trump said:

President Trump: Congratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States. You did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody wasn't given much of a chance, and you ended up winning comfortably. It's fantastic. Congratulations.

President Zelensky: You are absolutely right, Mr. President. We did win big. We worked hard for this. We worked a lot, and I would like to confess to you that I had the opportunity to learn from you. We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections. And, yes, these were indeed unique elections. We were in an individual situation that we were able to achieve an unparalleled success. I'm able to tell you this: the first time you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I should run more often so we can talk on the phone more often. [Laughter.]

President Trump: That's a very good idea. I think your country is very happy about that.

President Zelensky: Well, yes, to tell you truth. We are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swap here in our country. We brought in many new people. Not the old politicians, not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new format and a new type of government. You are a great teacher for us in that. Read the full transcript here.

Throughout the clip, Pat portrayed a stellar re-enactment of Schiff reading the transcript set to theme song for the movie, ""The Godfather.""

Schiff has since admitted that his recap of the transcript was meant to be a parody.

Three samples of ice cream tested positive for COVID-19 in China,"Pat Gray discussed a report released on Friday about COVID-19-contaminated ice cream produced in China by Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company.

""It's likely this has come from a person, and without knowing the details, I think this is probably a one-off,"" Dr. Stephen Griffin, a virologist based at the University of Leeds, told Sky News.

The article stated that anti-epidemic authorities in north China's Tianjin Municipality are tracing people who may have been in contact with batches of ice cream.

Initial investigations determined the company ""produced the batch of ice cream using raw materials, including milk powder imported from New Zealand and whey powder imported from Ukraine."" However, poor hygiene at the factory cold storage temperatures, rather than an issue with the production plant was noted.

In the article, Dr. Griffin claimed ""we probably don't need to panic that every bit of ice cream is suddenly going to be contaminated with coronavirus.""

""My gosh, so I guess you can get it from ice cream,"" Pat said.

"'This is like Alex Jones territory': Reporter DEMANDS evidence of stunning State Dept. claims, leaves spokesman stammering","Associated Press reporter Matt Lee was not about to let State Department spokesman Ned Price get away without providing evidence to back claims that Russia plans to film and broadcast fake videos to justify invading Ukraine.

At a media briefing Thursday, Price told reporters that the Biden administration suspects Russia is planning to produce and broadcast ""a video with graphic scenes of false explosions - depicting corpses, crisis actors pretending to be mourners, and images of destroyed locations or military equipment - entirely fabricated by Russian intelligence"" to justify a further invasion of Ukraine.

""Well, it's an action that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that,"" Lee said to Price. ""And I'm going to get to the next question here, which is, what is the evidence that — I mean, this is like, crisis actors? Really? This is like Alex Jones territory you're getting into now. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?""

Price and Lee then engage in a fruitless, albeit entertaining, back-and-forth in which Lee repeatedly asks for evidence to support these allegations, and Price repeatedly claims that the allegations themselves are all the evidence he needs.

Biden makes it CLEAR that 'a billion a trillion 750 million dollars billion dollars' could help fight climate change or something,"During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday, President Joe Biden defended his administration's economic record, saying he doesn’t think there's a recession coming, but if there is, it would be ""very slight,"" before moving on to boast about all his ""legislative victories,"" such as the memorable ""American Rescue Plan,"" the ""Inflation Act"" (we assume Biden meant the Inflation Reduction Act, but ""Inflation Act"" is probably more accurate), and the most recent $368 billion in additional spending to ""deal with the energy problem and the whole notion of global warming.""

Asked if the American people should prepare for a recession, Biden answered, ""No, look, they've been saying this now, how, every six months they say this. Every six months, they look down at the next six months and say what's gonna happen. It hadn't happened yet.

""It hadn't — but — there — that had — there is no, there's no guarantee that there's gonna be — I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a slight recession. That is, we'll move down slightly,"" he added.

Biden then pivoted to his administration's wonderful accomplishments. ""Think about what's happened. We've done more, we're in a better position than any other major country in the world, economically and politically. We still have real problems, but look, look, look, look, look what we got done,"" he said before mentioning the ""American Rescue Plan,"" his first stimulus package, and ""the legislation to deal with infla — the Inflation Act.""

Next, Biden launched into a rambling narrative about the economic ""impact on families"" who are ""concerned about energy prices"" and how his dad used to say middle-class families should have ""breathing room"" after all the bills are paid because they are ""in fact, struggling"" and so, of course, he threw another $368 billion at ""the whole notion of global warming"" to deal with the energy problem.

In case that didn't quite make sense, Biden clarified by adding, ""It's gonna bring a billion, a trillion, 750 million dollars, billion dollars off the sidelines in investment. Look what's happened. Look at the investment going on in America right now.""

At that, Tapper somehow managed to keep a straight face and simply answered, ""Yeah. So you think Democrats have something to run on.""

""Oh, I think we do, I know we do,"" Biden responded.





Unfortunately for Biden and Tapper, a few folks on Twitter still had questions:

"Biden: Expect 'real' food shortages due to sanctions — oh, and sanctions never work","During a press conference in Brussels on Thursday, President Joe Biden admitted that food shortages are ""going to be real"" because that is ""the price of the sanctions"" that have been imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

""With regard to food shortages … it's gonna be real,"" Biden said. ""The price of the sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia. It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well. Including European countries and our country as well.""



Of course, we all know the incoming food shortages have absolutely nothing to with any of the Biden administration's policies.

















Minutes later, Biden was asked why the U.S. and other NATO nations are continuing to impose sanctions when ""deterrents didn't work.""

""Let's get something straight,"" snapped a visibly peeved Biden. ""I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter [Putin.] Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter.""

So, what is the point of sanctions if ""sanctions never deter""?

Also, President Biden and several administration officials representing him, have most definitely said that the sanctions are indeed intended to deter.

"WATCH: Devin Nunes SHREDS Dems, Schiff in fiery opening statement at impeachment hearing","In his opening statement at the first public impeachment hearing on Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) accused Democrats of conducting ""a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign"" against President Donald Trump, and called out House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for denying key Republican witness requests.

""In a July open hearing of this committee following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent. That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media, and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election. After the spectacular implosion of their Russia hoax on July 24, in which they spent years denouncing any Republican who ever shook hands with a Russian, on July 25 they turned on a dime and now claim the real malfeasance is Republicans' dealings with Ukraine,"" Nunes said.

""In the blink of an eye, we're asked to simply forget about Democrats on this committee falsely claiming they had 'more than circumstantial evidence' of collusion between President Trump and the Russians. We should forget about them reading fabrications of Trump-Russia collusion from the Steele dossier into the congressional record. We should also forget about them trying to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Russian pranksters who pretended to be Ukrainian officials. We should forget about them leaking a false story to CNN, while he was still testifying to our committee, claiming Donald Trump Jr. had colluded with Wikileaks, and forget about countless other deceptions, large and small, that make them the last people on earth with the credibility to hurl more preposterous accusations at their political opponents. And yet now we're supposed to take these people at face value when they trot out a new batch of allegations. But anyone familiar with the Democrats' scorched-Earth war against President Trump would not be surprised to see all the typical signs that this is a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign,"" he continued.

""Despite this hypocrisy, the Democrats are advancing their impeachment sham. But we should not hold any hearings at all until we get answers to three crucial questions the Democrats are determined to avoid asking ...These questions will remain outstanding because Republicans were denied the right to call witnesses who know these answers,"" added Nunes.

joy behar face plant,"Joy Behar apparently missed her chair and fell rather dramatically during the opening of Thursday's episode of ""The View.""

In video footage from the live show, the 79-year-old co-host was seen falling forward, then on her side, before fellow co-hosts rushed over to help her back up.

""Come on just stop, just stand,"" laughed Whoopi Goldberg.



""Twenty-five years that has never happened to me,"" Behar said, adding, “Who do I sue?”

While Behar is reported to be just fine after her fall, the mishap garnered mixed reactions on social media.

















Behar is no stranger to making headlines, for better or worse. Just last week, she was shredded for complaining that Russia's invasion of Ukraine might interfere with her plans to vacation in Italy.

Joy Behar scared Russia Ukraine Italy,"“The View” co-host Joy Behar is so heartbroken and scared for the Ukrainians as Russia invades their country, potentially killing and displacing millions of Ukrainian citizens.

“Estimates are 50,000 Ukrainians will be dead or wounded and this is going to start a refugee crisis in Europe,” co-host Sonny Hostin said. ""We’re talking about 5 million people that are going to be displaced. It’s heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen.""

""Yeah,"" Behar agreed. ""“I’m scared of what’s gonna happen in Western Europe, too. You know, you just, you plan a trip, you wanna go there. I’ve wanted to go to Italy for four years and I haven’t been able to make it because of the pandemic, and now this, you know? It's like, who's gonna, what’s gonna happen there?”

Yes, she REALLY said that. It's hard to believe, we know, so here's the video:





Keep in mind that this is the same sanctimonious snob who on Wednesday likened the ""traitorous behavior"" of former President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists after Trump claimed the Ukraine invasion ""never would have happened"" if he was in office.

“A lot of people in the GOP right now are buying this lie, that [Trump] would have solved the problem. He would have said, ‘Here. Here is Ukraine, take it. And I’m gonna build a casino there any minute now,'” Behar said. “The traitorous behavior that’s going on right now on the right is just, it’s unbelievable to me ... for having grown up in a country that fought this fascism, we are now becoming the people that we fought!”

Behar the hypocrite was also spotted in a crowded public setting without a mask on after announcing on ""The View"" that she'll keep wearing a mask in crowded places “indefinitely” — regardless of what health officials say.

""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,"" she continued.



Reid then played a short video montage of 3 reporters, 2 from European networks, describing Ukraine as a “European” nation and the Ukrainian people as ""European.""

""Let’s face it. The world is paying attention because this is happening in Europe. If this was happening anywhere else, would we be seeing the same outpour of support and compassion? We don’t need to ask ourselves if our response would be the same if Russia unleashed their horror on a country that wasn’t white and largely Christian.”

looters shamed shrink-wrap,"Ukrainian citizens have allegedly taken to publicly shaming those who decide to take advantage of the war-caused chaos to do a bit of looting.

According to Ukraine's Korrespondent, one ""enterprising citizen"" who decided to take advantage of an understaffed store chose to “buy something there without money.""

""The looter was unlucky – he was seen by local residents. They called the police to the place,” continued the report (if Google translate can be trusted.) ""The arriving patrol found the marauder without pants and taped to a pole.""

Following that report on Sunday, images of more unlucky looters began cropping up on social media.

Check out this poor chump (apparently, the sign shrink-wrapped to his shoulder reads ""marauder, :

This marauder had it even worse:

This guy doesn't look too happy:

Megyn Kelly Biden impression,"Stand-up comedian and actor Kyle Dunnigan joined Megyn Kelly on “The Megyn Kelly Show” and had the former Fox News host in stitches with his uncanny impersonation of President Joe Biden.

Struggling to keep a straight face, Kelly proceeded as if actually interviewing the president and asked about the Russia-Ukraine war.

""Vladimir Pukin is ... not Pukin. The guy, the guy without the shirt, man. He's a bad dude. He's a liar, man, not to be trusted. So I don't believe a word that guy says. He's like, he's like Corn Pop,"" articulated the faux-president before falling asleep mid-sentence.

""Hey! Hey! Did you, did you sh*t my pants or did I? What's going on here?"" he asked upon waking. ""Kegyn Melly, the classiest gal ... in the news.""

Now nearly falling out of her chair laughing, Kelly pressed on, asking about Hunter Biden's dubious dealings with Burisma in Ukraine.

“My boy, Huntie, he lost his job over there in the Kraines. He had a great nice cushy job there working for $80,000 a week. This guy, man, he blew it all. Blew it all for self-centered reasons ... Plutin, man. Pluto blew it for my boy. C’mon, you know the thing. The guy,” faux-Biden said.

Putin pretaped declaration of war on Ukraine,"According to reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""live"" broadcast declaring war against Ukraine was pre-taped on Monday, sparking concerns that the large-scale invasion was already planned but ""postponed for reasons unknown.""

Putin announced a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine and issued a chilling warning for President Joe Biden and NATO not to intervene during what appeared to be a live broadcast on state TV Thursday. But according to several reports, the announcement was actually filmed three days earlier.

""Putin's speech about the declaration of war was recorded on the evening of February 21, on Monday. You can verify this by downloading the video from the Kremlin website and checking its properties,"" read a translated tweet from Russia's Novaya Gazeta.





Additionally, Russian-based Conflict Intelligence Team noted on Twitter that ""Putin's clothes [during Thursday's broadcast] match his clothes at the meeting of the Russian Security Council on February 21 ….""





""This suggests that a large-scale invasion of Ukraine was planned for February 22, but was postponed for reasons unknown to us,"" CIT added.",https://www.theblaze.com/video/putin-reportedly-taped-declaration-of-war-against-ukraine-days-before-live-broadcast,2022-02-24
Putin's war in Ukraine prompts international ban on Russian cats​,"Now that Russian cats are banned from international competitions, does the world feel safer? Doubtful.

The International Cat Federation issued a statement announcing its shock and horror ""that the army of the Russian Federation invaded the Republic of Ukraine and started a war.""

Prompted by the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine, FIFe took action. It will not permit ""cats bred in Russia to be imported and registered in any FIFe pedigree book outside Russia, regardless of which organization issued its pedigree."" Also, cats with Russian exhibitors will not be allowed to register for shows organized outside of Russia.

The Board will revisit the restriction on May 31, 2022.

Mark Levin Trendiing on Twitter,"Mark Levin was trending on Twitter Monday morning for comments about President Joe Biden's weak handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I mean, Biden is the so-called commander in chief. He is a disgrace and disaster,"" Levin said. Adding that Biden ""actually has the Russians negotiating with the Iranians on a nuclear deal with us.""



On Sunday's episode of ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" on Fox, Mark expressed that ""[Biden] puts more sanctions on the American oil industry and no sanctions on the Russian oil industry as I speak. What kind of a fool does that when we can use oil to debilitate the Russian economy, the Putin economy, and war machine, rather than debilitate you, Mr. and Mrs. America?

""We do have a damn fool in the White House, there's no question about that, and we should be muscling up our military for any possibilities. We're not. Despite spending trillions and trillions of massive debt, we are not muscling up the United States military. Russia, China, Iran, the axis of evil, the real axis of evil that now exists.""

Twitter exploded with mixed reviews of Levin's take on Biden's weak leadership. Some commenters agreed with Mark, while others threw obnoxious tantrums. Check out the comments on these tweets.





anyone see Mark Levin's show yesterday? he spells it out exactly whats happening and why.....



simply put, Biden and his administration and the WEAKNESS they display daily is a magnet to corrupt world leaders like no other. their weakness is an aphrodisiac to the corrupt.

Childress Ammo Ukraine,"Legendary NASCAR driver and owner Richard Childress said on Fox & Friends Wednesday that he plans to donate one million rounds of ammunition to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.

""I was listening the other day and heard President Zelenskyy say he didn't want out, he wanted ammunition,"" Childress told host Brian Kilmeade.

Childress was referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's response to the U.S. government's offer to evacuate him to safety.

""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" Zelenskyy said, according to reports.

Childress added, ""I called my good friend Fred Wagenhals (the Chairman of AMMO, Inc.) ... and I said, 'Fred, we gotta help these people. They need ammunition.' And he stepped right up, he said, ‘We’ll do it,’ and now we’re turning our production to this as our number one priority.""



Childress, a member of Ammo, Inc.’s board of directors, briefly explained how the organization is attempting to deliver the ammunition to Ukraine.

""We're working with some government agencies, but to get it there quickly, we're going to work through a private company that will be working to get it in there,"" he said. ""The number one ammo they're needing right now over there is the 7.62s, and that's what we're going to be producing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/video/richard-childress-ammo-ukraine,2022-03-03
Russian mobile crematoriums,"Russia reportedly has ""mobile crematoriums."" Yes, crematoriums on wheels that follow along behind troops as they continue to advance into Ukraine, which could be used to hide evidence of the number of casualties, according to a Fox News report.

The British Ministry of Defense released chilling footage that revealed the inner-workings of Russia's horrifying motorized incinerators designed to ""get rid of dead soldiers"" and ""avoid sending body bags back home.""

“If I was a soldier, and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield in a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or a father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up loss was a mobile crematorium, I’d be deeply, deeply worried,” said U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in the video shared by the Telegraph on Wednesday.

sting-performs-russians-song,"Sting took to Instagram Saturday to revive his 1985 song ""Russians"" amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in what the Grammy winning artist called ""a plea for our common humanity.""

""I’ve only rarely sung this song in the many years since it was written, because I never thought it would be relevant again,"" the video was captioned. ""But, in the light of one man’s bloody and woefully misguided decision to invade a peaceful, unthreatening neighbor, the song is, once again, a plea for our common humanity. For the brave Ukrainians fighting against this brutal tyranny and also the many Russians who are protesting this outrage despite the threat of arrest and imprisonment - We, all of us, love our children. Stop the war.""



First released on ""The Dream of the Blue Turtles,"" Sting's first solo album after parting ways with The Police, the song “Russians,” is about the Cold War. In it Sting sings, ""There is no monopoly on common sense, on either side of the political fence. We share the same biology, regardless of ideology. Believe me when I say to you, I hope the Russians love their children, too.""

Biden underestimate Putin,"At a virtual event on Tuesday, President Joe Biden had several of his embarrassingly confused moments, like the time he couldn't quite remember if his secretary of energy is Governor Granholm or Senator Granholm or Secretary Granholm or former governor, well, you know, the thing.

Or when he asked permission to continue speaking.

Or when he asked permission to stop speaking.

But one of the most reassuring moments had to be when a reporter asked the president if he thinks he ""may have underestimated"" Russian President Vladimir Putin. At this point, Biden stared blankly for a few beats before grinning weirdly and then ... picking at his teeth. To be fair, it sounded as though Biden was told by his puppeteers that question time was at an end. But someone really should have let him know the cameras were still rolling.

Unlike the president, the folks on Twitter are never at a loss for words:









But give a guy a break. After all, he was probably all tuckered out after the inspiring speech he gave earlier on Tuesday announcing new sanctions against Russia. Here's an impressive clip from that speech:

Ted Cruz Ketanji Brown Jackson,"During Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) grilled Jackson about her views on critical race theory.

Jackson first denied ever having studied critical race theory and claimed it “doesn’t come up in the work that I do as a judge.”

""I've never studied critical race theory, and I've never used it. It doesn't come up in the work that I do as a judge,"" Jackson stated.

""With respect, I find that a curious statement,"" Cruz responded. He then read a quote from her saying that critical race theory is, in fact, part of her work as judge during a speech at the University of Chicago in 2015.

""[S]entencing is just plain interesting ... because it melds together myriad types of of law — criminal law ... constitutional law, [and] critical race theory ..."" read Jackson's quote, according to Cruz.

""You described, in a speech to a law school, what you were doing as critical race theory,"" Cruz said. ""So, I guess I would ask, what did you mean by that?""

Jackson said she was not talking about ""sentencing"" in her quote, but ""sentencing policy,"" and repeated that ""none of that relates to what I do as a judge.""





Cruz then moved on to discussing Ibram X. Kendi’s children’s book, “Antiracist Baby.” Jackson is on the Board of Trustees at Georgetown Day School — a private school in Washington, D.C. — that Cruz claims assigns Kendi's book to students as young as four years old.

Pointing out that in “Antiracist Baby” Kendi says children should confess when being racist, Cruz asked Jackson, “Do you agree with this book that’s being taught with kids that babies are racist?""

After a long pause, Jackson answered, “I do not believe that any child should be made to feel as though they are racist, or as though they are not valued, or that they are less than, that they are victims, that they are oppressors. I don’t believe in any of that.”

Quite a few folks on Twitter took exception to Cruz's line of questioning:









Others took issue with Jackson's answers:

Trump goes off on 'maniac' Adam Schiff at NATO Summit: 'Adam Schiff is a deranged human being',"During a NATO Summit in London on Tuesday, President Donald Trump assailed Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), calling him a ""deranged human being"" and a ""maniac"" in response to a question about the House impeachment inquiry.

President Trump, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was taking questions from reporters when he was asked, ""What do you want to learn from the Adam Schiff testimony?""

""I learn nothing from Adam Schiff. I think he's a maniac. I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he's a very sick man and he lies. Adam Schiff made up my conversation with the President of Ukraine. One of the reasons people keep talking about it is that's what they saw,"" he continued, in reference to Schiff's hyperbolic ""reading"" of the controversial phone call with the president of Ukraine in July.

""This guy is sick. He made up the conversation. He lied,"" Trump continued. ""If he didn't do that in the halls of Congress, he'd be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he's given immunity. This is a sick person. He's a liar. By the way, Nancy Pelosi knew he was lying and she went on the show, Stephanopoulos and said he told the truth. She was lying, too. These people are deranged.""
