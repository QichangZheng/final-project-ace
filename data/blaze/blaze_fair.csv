Couch: Did the iconic 1992 basketball 'Dream Team' end our Olympic dreams?,"One of the most popular songs from the rap group Wu-Tang Clan explains what's happening to the Olympics in particular and sports in general.

""C.R.E.A.M."" It's an acronym for ""cash rules everything around me."" In the world of sports, the acronym means ""cash ruins everything around me.""

Money ruined the Olympics. It's in the process of ruining college sports, too. It's already weakened our professional games, prioritizing the individual ahead of the team.

The Olympics used to be played by ""amateurs"" pursuing glory for their country for no pay. It was about nobility, fair play, and avoiding the vagaries of big money. Amateurism was never perfect. But amateurism worked, especially as a marketing ploy. We loved the Olympic Games. We loved the pageantry, the nationalism, the sacrifice for your country's honor, the role the Games' played in combating racial bigotry and promoting diversity and unity.

And all of that was fine and good in theory until the U.S. basketball team flopped in the 1988 Seoul Games, taking the bronze medal for its worst performance ever.



So the U.S. created the Dream Team four years later of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird. The Dream Team won every game in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics by at least 32 points, sending a message about American dominance in an American sport: There is just one superpower in basketball.



They did so well that we still feel it today at the Tokyo Olympics in so many ways. You see it in Simone Biles, Naomi Osaka, Novak Djokovic, and maybe the U.S. men's basketball team, too. The Dream Team showed the world what basketball can be, which started the sport's international boom. We're seeing one minor side effect, though:

The Dream Team killed the Olympics.

That might be a bit of an overstatement. There was timing involved, too. And greed. Lots of greed. The International Olympic Committee started to back off its ideal of purity when TV dollars started to add up. And the TV dollars would grow in multiples if famous professional athletes could be pre-packaged and sold in advance of the Games.

So professionals were finally allowed in the Olympics in 1988. At that point, the Olympics had dipped its toe in the waters of professionalism. The Dream Team was a toe, a leg, a body, and an entire neighborhood.

It worked so well, and made the Olympics so big. With the Dream Team as the model, the professionalism and TV dollars have grown in multiples. And the result?

The Tokyo Olympics have been defined by overhyped professionals, who aren't competing for nobility so much as just another day at the office. There is no joy. There is no Olympic spirit. Many of these athletes don't look like they even want to be there.

It was just what the backers of amateurism had always feared.

These athletes aren't here to represent a global cultural get-together, but instead to represent their corporate sponsors. In Osaka's case, that was $50 million worth of endorsements. Biles was a huge part of the superhype machine, too. So was Djokovic.

And in Tokyo, they all melted down.

Osaka lost early. Djokovic didn't medal, had a tantrum and abandoned his mixed doubles partner before the bronze medal match. Biles barely competed.

None of them smiled once.

It was all glum and grim, gloom and doom and mental breakdowns. And they have defined the Tokyo Olympics so far, easily the most boring Olympics in history.

That's the model college sports is chasing, basically following the Olympic ideal down the drain.

Amateurism was always the foundation of college sports. That's dead now, after the NCAA and major conferences and school presidents saw the TV money and couldn't help themselves but to sink a bite into the apple.

Much like Olympic professionals, college athletes are going to rack up huge endorsements. Alabama quarterback Bryce Young is closing in on a million dollars in endorsements, according to coach Nick Saban. Last week, Texas high schooler Quinn Ewers decided to bypass his final year of high school to play football for Ohio State so he can take advantage of endorsement opportunities.

The education ideal doesn't factor in any more than the Olympic ideal.

The Dream Team did their job too well. They were just so good and made so much money that they broke the Olympic ideal and changed it to a cash grab.

We get so few glimpses of what used to make the Olympics great. On Tuesday, women's wrestler Tamyra Mensah-Stock won gold, wrapped herself in the American flag, said she was crying tears of joy and that she loves representing America.

It took women's wrestling to show it, though. It's such an obscure and underhyped sport. That's the best place to still find the spirit, where the athletes aren't already making millions.

But you wonder how many of the American professional athletes are wrapping themselves in the flag in honor and how many are in Tokyo as a business opportunity because their endorsers want them there.



The Olympics only works if the athletes think that being there is the ultimate goal and winning gold is reaching the mountaintop. Otherwise, the Games are just any other sporting event.



What am I calling for? An end to professionalism in college and the Olympics? No. Not at all. The money is there and there's no reason the athletes can't get some of it.

This is only an observation that the Olympics as we know them are dead. Money stole all the joy. The same thing might happen to college football, too.

At the end of the movie ""Miracle,'' the story of the 1980 gold-medal-winning, U.S. hockey team, the coach, Herb Brooks, is reflecting on the team and what it stood for. That team was magical because it was a collection of college players and amateurs who sacrificed their individualism and beat the juggernaut Russians.

Years later, actor Kurt Russell depicted Brooks lamenting the United States using professional athletes at the Games.

""Dream Teams?"" he said rhetorically. ""I always found that term ironic because now that we have dream teams, we seldom get to dream.''",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/couch-did-the-iconic-1992-basketball-dream-team-end-our-olympic-dreams,2021-08-05
Couch: Former Baylor football coach Art Briles mistakenly believes NCAA’s lack of power exonerates him,"""Completely exonerated."" That's the term the attorney of former Baylor football coach Art Briles used this week. The NCAA made a ruling after a six-year investigation into Briles and Baylor football over its sexual assault scandal, the one that led to Briles, Baylor's president, and its athletic director all being run out. And what was the ruling from college sports governing body? That it doesn't have the authority to govern or rule any more.

It seemed like more of an indictment of the NCAA than a release of Briles.

The NCAA said that Briles was so inhuman — my word — that he looked the other way when he received reports of women alleging that they'd been sexually assaulted by his players. It said there was a lack of institutional control in helping assault victims but that the lack of control existed not only in the football program but also the entire university. Baylor officials agreed with all of that.

And yet the NCAA said there was no actual, specific NCAA rule broken in all of that. So, the NCAA couldn't pin anything on Briles or Baylor.

""My client Art Briles has been completely exonerated and cleared of all NCAA violations alleged against him,"" attorney Scott Tompsett said. ""As the NCAA Committee on Infractions explained, the conduct at issue was pervasive and widespread throughout the Baylor campus, and it was condoned or ignored by the highest levels of Baylor's leadership. The NCAA's decision clears the way for Mr. Briles to return to coaching college football.""



It's an interesting thing to celebrate, that women were left unprotected campus-wide and that their safety wasn't just ignored by Briles, but also by the entire university. Hooray!

It's an argument that Briles and Baylor football couldn't have done anything heinous because other people on campus were doing heinous things. All parents have heard this argument from their 5-year olds: ""My friends are doing it …""

We are in an interesting moment in the American justice system. In this case, college sports is the model. The justice system might be lost.

The social media mob demands swift and timely justice, something resolved in minutes, or 40 seconds on TikTok. Meanwhile, the old style of long, slow, drawn-out justice doesn't work any more. So the NCAA is outdated, ineffectual, and without purpose. Meanwhile, the mainstream media is another institution we no longer trust.

Add it all up, and there are no legitimate watchdogs any more.

Even my good friend Jason Whitlock leans toward siding with Briles. He disagreed with me yesterday on his show, ""Fearless with Jason Whitlock,"" and said it's not fair to lay the problems of an entire university culture on the football team just because it's in the spotlight. He argued that Baylor, trying to pacify the Twitter mob, used Briles as a scapegoat. Put the blame on Briles, give the mob what it wants, and douse the fire. He also said there were questionable aspects of Baylor's own investigation.

There is one reason why it's hard to argue with Jason on that: It's because he's right.

That does not exonerate Briles, not in our new justice system. People aren't desperate to defend Briles out of any sense that he's clean. It's more of a distaste for his accusers, who are part of our institutions. It's a counter-culture attack, not a defense of Briles.

The truth is the NCAA could easily have charged Briles with lack of institutional control and ruled that he could not coach again. Nine years ago, the NCAA ruled hard on the Penn State rape scandal regarding former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. The NCAA fined Penn State $60 million and banned it from the postseason for four years. And NCAA president Mark Emmert said that we'd never again put football above education and keeping young people safe.

Then his authority was questioned, his penalties weakened. And the NCAA lost its ability to enforce rules. Emmert, rather than fixing the rules to protect people over the past nine years, has no power or purpose any more. Neither does the NCAA.

Meanwhile, the court system is dragging along on the Baylor case. One former player is in prison. One was convicted and is on probation. Fifteen women have cases pending, all these years later. Baylor hired a law firm to conduct its own investigation and then told that firm to issue its report to the school orally.

No written record. Since then, the alleged victims have been fighting in the courts to get the notes and details of Baylor's investigation. A federal judge ruled that Baylor has to give it all up. Baylor keeps fighting it.

Briles supporters think the report will show that he should be cleared.

Are we really down to saying that a coach has to only stay one inch above the line of the law? A coach should mean more. The Twitter mob, the courts, and the NCAA aren't ever going to get to a reasonable finish line.



It's a battle for loopholes, not truth. Briles needed to go. He built a program from nothing to a national power. The success led to a shiny new stadium, and Baylor's conscience melted under the lights.

The AD and president Ken Starr are gone, too. Briles was the head of a program that everyone acknowledges was out of control and unsafe for young people.

Someone had to take the fall, even if he is ""completely exonerated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/couch-former-baylor-football-coach-art-briles-mistakenly-believes-ncaas-lack-of-power-exonerates-him,2021-08-13
Whitlock: Reaction to Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition reveals men value ‘freedumb’ and women value safety,"In America, there is no free without the dumb. Freedumb – not freedom – defines America.



Our level of free is directly correlated to our tolerance of dumb. The elimination of non-harmful dumb activity restricts freedumb and de-incentivizes the risk-taking that made this country great.

Our founding fathers innately understood this. That’s why the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protected freedumb of speech alongside the free exercise of religion, freedumb of the press, freedumb of assembly, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.

Had mothers founded America, freedumb wouldn’t be our highest priority. The First Amendment would likely focus on safety – the right to speak safely, assemble safely, and worship safely. We would be the land of safe spaces, not the land of the free.

Women value safety more than men do.

That is at the root of the hyperbolic reaction to Elon Musk buying Twitter. Musk believes in good old-fashioned American freedumb. He’s stated he’s only interested in censoring speech that violates American laws, tweeting:

“I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.”

Musk is willing to allow Twitter to wallow in dumdness, stupidity, and high-risk speech. He recognizes stupidity’s essential relationship to freedumb. Words aren’t sticks and stones. Words have no ability to harm unless we grant them that privilege.

Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s top lawyer and the person described by Politico as the app’s “moral authority,” has steered the platform toward existing as a safe space for women, the LGBTQIA+ community, and people of color who support the Democratic Party. Gadde sets the tone and is the ultimate decision-maker when it comes to harassment and “dangerous” speech on the platform.

In 2015, she wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post that made clear her vision to ensure the safety of groups she deemed worthy of a special level of protection.

“I’m often inspired by the vigorous debates on controversial issues that occur on Twitter,” Gadde wrote, “but I’ve also been seriously troubled by the plight of some of our users who are trying to silence healthy discourse in the name of free expression. At times, this takes the form of hateful speech in tweets directed at women or minority groups; at others it takes the form of threats aimed to intimidate those who take a stand on issues.”

Twitter’s moral authority envisions the platform as an inclusive safe space.

She’s not alone. All aspects of American culture are focused on eliminating risks and being inclusive. We’ve been brainwashed into believing that the founding fathers were misguided and set up a system that overvalues freedom and undervalues safety and inclusivity. America needs to reflect the sensibilities of women.

You know what would make the NFL better? Women playing, coaching, and managing the game. At our current pace of feminization, the NFL will outlaw tackling and blocking by 2040 so that Lizzo’s daughter can play nose tackle.

We will lie to ourselves that football never needed contact to be exciting. We were stupid for being entertained watching men risk their physical well-being to play a game. Football needs safety and inclusivity. So does America!

We foolishly think that in order for America to be fair, all things must be for everybody.

I don’t believe that. Our founders didn’t believe that.

The people – men or women – bothered by Twitter’s rough discourse should exit the platform. Healthy public discourse is a contact sport. Rude, disrespectful, and uncomfortable things will get said. Human beings lack discipline. We cross lines and make mistakes. It’s the price of freedumb.

Not everyone is built for public discourse. We shouldn’t soften public discourse to make room for everybody. The voting booth is the safe space for public discourse. America appropriately changed its laws to allow all of its citizens access to vote safely without fear of intimidation or violence.

Twitter isn’t a voting booth. It can’t be made safe without severely damaging free speech. I’d rather protect free speech than protect the fragile feelings of women (or men) on Twitter.

American freedumb is irreversibly tied to free speech. Feelings? They’re random, emotional, and illogical. They equally provoke love and hate. A properly functioning society or social media app can’t cater to feelings. Indulging feelings leads to chaos.

Elon Musk is a threat to the matriarchy and the continued feminization of American culture. The world’s richest man boldly planted a flag that he stands with the founding fathers and America’s founding principles. Proponents of the matriarchy will frame Musk as sexist, racist, and homophobic. Cowardly men will slander him, too.

Are you a coward? Are you afraid to admit that, in general, men and women have different sensibilities? Afraid to acknowledge that it’s a mistake to feminize every platform and industry to make room for women? Too controlled by racial idolatry to recognize that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the other flawed founding fathers conceived documents that created a system that works better than any other nation’s system of governance?



If so, you’re not man enough for this world. Delete your Twitter account and join Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, Joy Reid, and Rachel Maddow’s group text string.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/elon-musk-twitter-freedumb,2022-04-27
Greg Couch: Southeastern Conference’s acquisition of Texas and Oklahoma means the South plans to overthrow the NCAA,"What you're seeing now in college sports is a coup, plain and simple. It's the overthrow of an NCAA regime that turned corrupt, stale, and ineffectual, a governing body that refused to adjust with the times.



The Southeastern Conference, smelling weakness, has attacked quickly. Five weeks ago, the Supreme Court knocked down the NCAA's founding principle and economic engine, amateurism in college sports.

By stealing the University of Texas and Oklahoma University from the Big 12 Conference late last week, the SEC, and savvy Commissioner Greg Sankey, are executing a hostile takeover of the NCAA and making a bold statement:

""We're in charge now. We are the NCAA. The South has risen.""

While other media outlets focus on what place Texas will finish in SEC football, it's important not to miss the big picture: This is the greatest power play in American sports since Al Davis, Lamar Hunt, and the American Football League forced the National Football League to merge 55 years ago.



In terms of TV impact and cultural relevance, the new SEC might take a backseat only to the NFL.

The SEC's acquisition of Texas and Oklahoma will hasten college sports' Great Reset. The Big Ten, Pac-12, and ACC will be left scrambling to prevent this coup from becoming the Great Re-SEC.

As for the Big 12? Well, it's done as a power player in college athletics unless it can find some way to stop this. Its desperate attempt to get UT and OU to reconsider their defections is likely going to be as successful as Kanye's public weeping over Kim Kardashian. Khloe has a rearview mirror, not Kim.

There's little for the Longhorns and Sooners to reconsider. They upgraded in a time of global upheaval. Change is on the way, and the SEC is going to be the biggest winner.

What can the NCAA do to stop this? The NCAA is finished, other than as a party host in a cocktail dress, throwing the NCAA Tournament basketball gala every year ... as long as the SEC allows it to.

SCOTUS justices ignited this uprising, ruling unanimously that the NCAA can't limit college athletes' compensation to tuition, room, board and scholarships. Athletes can also get ""education-related'' benefits, such as a computer or an internship.

The NCAA is ""not above the law,'' Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote. ""Nowhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.""

That will go down as the critical step in professionalizing college sports. Next up, athletes will be paid a salary.

Even more money will flood into college sports, directly to the athletes from outside influences. At first, that would seem to cut right into the heart and bank account of college football's elite. Instead, as always, the rich simply knew how to get richer.

As Michael Douglas' infamous character Gordon Gekko said in the movie ""Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps:""

""The government's worse than a wife. They got all the power and they got half the money. Now they're working on getting the other half.''

The SEC wants the other half. How does getting Texas and Oklahoma constitute Gekko's greed?

It is the gobbling up of two name-brand colleges from another major conference. The SEC is hoarding the nation's blueblood programs, leaving only Ohio State and Michigan in the Big Ten, University of Southern California in the Pac-12, and independent Notre Dame outside its control. (You could argue the ACC's Clemson and Florida State are major brands.)

In the new professional model, athletes can get endorsements. Alabama coach Nick Saban said that his 2020 backup quarterback, Bryce Young, has already landed close to $1 million in name-image-and-likeness deals. Athletes everywhere will be mining for the same gold Young struck in Tuscaloosa. Until the Supreme Court stepped in, endorsement money had to go to the colleges.

So in this new world of above-the-table professionalism, the big new money will go to the big-name athletes from the big programs. That means all the money will be funneling toward the SEC.

More money. More power. And the SEC is going to create a super conference much like the NBA super teams. Everyone else will fight for scraps.

What can the other major conferences do to protect themselves? They need to think and move, and expand, fast.

They are going to have to scavenge from each other. That likely means the Big Ten hanging on to Ohio State and Michigan and trying to fortify by going after USC and any other schools in major TV markets. Colorado for the Denver market? Arizona for the Phoenix market? Would Notre Dame consider joining?

You wonder, though, what else the SEC might be planning. Florida State and Clemson would be a natural geographic fit.

Meanwhile, the SEC has maneuvered its way into perfect position to make up all the rules as it goes.



You think the College Football Playoff expansion will be spread across conferences equally? The SEC will let you know what it decides. Maybe the SEC thinks there should be no limits on the number of football players on a roster? It has the money for that.

Just think, amateurism in college sports was supposedly about not being polluted by greed and big money. That was always such a sham, as college sports built into a business worth billions. The SEC shows what a shark can do.

Sankey recognized the crippling impact of the SCOTUS ruling and seized this unique moment, orchestrating a coup d'etat of college athletics. He saw the weakness in the NCAA, which no longer has a purpose or a mission, and executed the hostile takeover in a matter of weeks.

All the power, all the money. The regime change is all but done.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/greg-couch-southeastern-conferences-acquisition-of-texas-and-oklahoma-means-the-south-plans-to-overthrow-the-ncaa,2021-07-26
"Delano Squires: LeBron James, Serena Williams, activists athletes should publicly defend women athletes against transgender invasion","Professional sports have been completely taken over by politics. What started with athletes protesting during the national anthem and demanding team support for political causes has culminated in the leagues themselves using courts, fields, and jerseys to promote ""racial equity"" and major corporations weighing in on proposed state legislation.

Conspicuously absent from the list of causes worthy of increased awareness are the girls and women who have publicly opposed the inclusion of biological males in women's sports. State laws that attempt to restrict girls' sports to biological females have been characterized in corporate media outlets from USA Today to ESPN as attacks against transgender athletes. The Biden administration withdrew from a federal lawsuit in Connecticut that tried to limit participation in girls' sports to female athletes. The passage of the Equality Act by the House of Representatives early this year further demonstrates that the girls fighting for athletic fairness have as little support among elected officials as they do in corporate media or pop culture.

I find it fascinating that no professional leagues, high-profile players, or social justice activists have spoken up to say anything about how these changes will impact girls and women who have trained from a young age to compete at the highest levels. The WNBA has carved out a reputation for being very active in protesting racial justice causes, but it has been completely silent on an issue that could have a direct impact on the league. The same can be said for Jemele Hill, Serena Wiliams, LeBron James, and Megan Rapinoe. Each one has argued for using their platforms to speak for the voiceless and advocate for the marginalized.



This issue shows the limits of activism in sports. Players and sports journalists know that engaging in social justice causes, whether on or off the court, can improve their public profile as long as the issue is in line with the cultural zeitgeist. What's more difficult, and much less culturally rewarding, is to come out against a policy that many see as the latest frontier of justice for an oppressed group.

This type of selective activism is a sign of cowardice.

The most elite female athletes know that their male counterparts are bigger, stronger, and faster and that no amount of hormone therapy can totally eradicate those physical advantages. They are afraid of saying anything that would offend the transgender community or bring them criticism on social media. They sit by as girls suffer the public indignity of standing on the podium and smiling as a biological male walks away with medals and prize money that is meant for female athletes.

The left's radical views on sex and gender are the types of changes that destabilize societies. While they focus on race — which is literally skin deep — they completely ignore the long-term physical, emotional, and societal impacts of rejecting the body'snatural design and telos. People who think their bodies and minds are in conflict with one another need care and compassion, specifically because I believe that God created males and females equal in dignity and worth but different in composition and function. People who don't share my Christian convictions should at least trust science enough to know that while much of the public debate about gender identity focuses on what people feel and believe, athletics are largely an exercise in what the body can do. Thinking you were born in the wrong body doesn't change the physical advantages that body provides. Unfortunately, too few people are willing to acknowledge that fact. Activist athletes want to be seen as revolutionaries ushering in a new age of social equality. They're not. The only thing radical about them is their conformity to whatever opinions the cultural gatekeepers deem acceptable.

"NCAA amateurism is dead, but college sports could collapse","The NCAA's decades-long refusal to reform its amateurism model will likely lead to a massive decline in the popularity of college football and basketball.

State politicians forced the NCAA to adopt the Name Image and Likeness (NIL) athlete marketing structure that went into effect early this week. College athletes are now free to sell their name, image, and likeness to businesses big and small.

Rapper Master P's son, Hercy Miller, an incoming freshman basketball player at Tennessee State University, reportedly cut a $2 million brand ambassador deal with a tech company.

NIL is going to cause an unprecedented level of chaos within college athletics. The impossible-to-control influx of cash into college locker rooms will spark acrimony among the players and completely disrupt and negatively redefine player-coach relationships.

As a proponent of ending NCAA shamateurism, I've long argued that the NCAA needed to work with its television partners, the NFL, and NBA to find a way to compensate its football and basketball players whose value to the games exceed room, board, and books.

Power 5 football and men's basketball drive the revenue in college sports. Years ago, the NCAA should've constructed a pay model that financially rewarded its top 750 football players and top 250 college basketball players each year. It would've required the organization to get creative with its relationships with the NFL and NBA.

The professional leagues benefit greatly from the college feeder system, which markets the young players and sends them to the professional ranks with a brand and following. This is especially true in football. Every year, players such as Lamar Jackson, Kyler Murray, Baker Mayfield, Reggie Bush, Peyton Manning, etc., enter the NFL as ratings-driving stars. College basketball used to do the same thing for players such as Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar before the advent of one-and-done culture.

Around 2007 and 2008, when I worked at AOL Sports, I wrote extensively about potential pay models for elite college football and basketball players. My model financially incentivized players to stay in school, attend classes, be good citizens, and cooperate with coaches. The elite players, the genuine pro prospects, would earn significant sums of money while in college and would receive a significant cash bonus for graduating college.



Guys like me, an average Division 1 college football player, would be paid with a traditional scholarship. It's a fair exchange. The football scholarship I received from Ball State launched me on a rewarding 30-year career as a journalist. I left school with zero debt, a huge advantage over my peers. The lack of debt allowed me to take a part-time, entry-level position at the Bloomington Herald-Times in 1990.

The NIL madness is going to jeopardize the future of mid-major programs. NIL will grossly favor the rich universities with an abundance of super-wealthy boosters.

This didn't have to happen.

Anyone with a brain could see the amateur model was collapsing. Too much TV money had poured into college football and basketball for the old model to remain in place.

Coaches now earn millions of dollars per year. Football teams now play as many as 15 games in a season when they used to play 10 or 11. Education opportunities have been compromised by the additional travel. The model has been broken for a long time.

For at least two decades, the NCAA has been in desperate need of visionary foresight from its leaders. It has never materialized. It's easy to blame Mark Emmert, who was named president of the NCAA in 2010. It's not Emmert's fault. He is the ineffectual leader his bosses (college presidents) want. The leaders of academia are quite comfortable exploiting the dumb jocks they allow on their campuses, and these same academics are just as comfortable letting a hired mercenary (Emmert) defend their corrupt system.

They'll never be held accountable.

Over the next couple of years, as the chaos ensues and the college system collapses, the coaches, players, and Emmert will be scapegoated, portrayed as greedy and unethical.



No one will think to blame the architects of the system, the people who could've empowered real change. We'll hear a laundry list of excuses, starting with how Title IX made change impossible.

It's all bull. We can send a man to the moon, but we can't figure out a college system that rewards the handful of athletes who impact the bottom line? Stop it.

The overhaul of big-time college athletics could've been done in a way that improved football and basketball at the collegiate and professional levels. Instead, like everything else in the last five years, the system is going to be burned to the ground because of bad leadership.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/ncaa-amateurism-college-sports-whitlock,2021-07-03
"Nike and LeBron serve China, not America, says Jason Whitlock","Late last week, Nike CEO John Donahoe inadvertently explained the difference between NBA legends Michael Jordan and LeBron James.

In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Donahoe described the shoe brand's commitment to China.

""Nike is a brand that is of China and for China,"" said Donahoe, who joined Nike in January 2020. According to Yahoo News, Donahoe spent his first weeks as CEO ""scoping out Nike's operations in China.""

The Bible and common sense have spoken authoritatively on the Portland, Oregon-founded and based company's dilemma.

""No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other."" —Matthew 6:24

Nike cannot serve America and China. It has chosen its master, and it is not us.

China is a communist-run, authoritarian, racist country. America is (or has been) a democratic republic pursuing freedom and fairness. You can't be of China and for China and serve America.

For the past decade, American sports fans, sports writers, and sports broadcasters have debated the on- and off-court differences between 1990s NBA superstar and Nike pitchman Michael Jordan and 2010s NBA superstar and Nike pitchman LeBron James.



The off-court difference could not be more clear. Jordan spoke for Nike when the company was a brand of America and for America. James speaks for the company that now serves China.

Keep in mind, Nike is Jordan's and James' primary employer. The $40-billion-a-year shoe company pays Jordan and James far more than the $8-billion-a-year NBA. The reality is the NBA is the marketing department of Nike. The NBA's main purpose is to sell sneakers in general and Nike's in particular. No other major sports league is as dependent on and under the control of a single sponsor as the NBA is to Nike.

Former NBA commissioner David Stern is credited with hatching the league's plan to take the game international. The truth is Nike founder Phil Knight devised the plan. After conquering the U.S. market, Knight wanted to colonize and overtake China.



""We've always taken a long-term view,"" Donahoe told Wall Street analysts on Thursday. ""We've been in China for over 40 years. Phil (Knight) invested significant time and energy in China in the early days and today we're the largest sports brand there.""

Knight instructed Stern to prioritize international growth. That's why the NBA has had zero interest in preserving and protecting college basketball. America's college stars do not resonate in China. Unlike the NFL, which benefits from the ready-made stars that enter the league from college, the NBA hasn't authentically supported rules that would keep its future players on college campuses for three or four years.

But let me get back to Jordan and James.

Michael avoided politics because the American market was still important to Nike during his heyday. LeBron is an anti-American, far-left political activist because that messaging serves China, Nike's master.

Of course, you've been led to believe James is outspoken on police shootings because he's a voice for voiceless poor and working-class black people. James is Nelson Mandela in gym shorts, according to Nike and corporate media.

James is a businessman doing business with Nike. So are Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe, and all the other multi-millionaire woke warriors.

Let me tell you which poor and working-class black people have no voice: The parents of young men slaughtered daily by random gang violence. Who speaks for them?

Ben Crump? Al Sharpton? Black Lives Matter? Don Lemon? Van Jones? Joy Reid? Anderson Cooper? Antifa? Kamala Harris? Barack Obama? Colin Kaepernick? Charlamagne tha God? John Legend? Cardi B? Maxine Waters? Nancy Pelosi? Shaun King? Jemele Hill? Max Kellerman?

Who? Anyone you see regularly on a national platform?

The police kill on average approximately 250 black people (and 450 white people) per year. According to Statista, in 2019, approximately 14,000 Americans were murdered and 7,500 of the victims were black.

The 250 black people killed by police have about 250 national spokesmen appearing on television weekly. Who do the 7,500 murder victims have?

I'll wait here as you Google an answer. Let me give you a hint. LeBron James' name ain't gonna pop up.

China doesn't allow it. China is a racist country that has no use for black people who can't sing, dance, or dunk a basketball at the very highest level. This is an open secret. American-based global corporations know how China treats black and brown people.



This is personal for me. A former Ball State football player (my alma mater) spent more than two years in Chinese prisons on bogus assault charges. Look up the story of Wendell Brown. While you're at it, look up the story of Jeff Harper, the former Iowa Wesleyan basketball player who spent five months in a Chinese prison because he came to the defense of a Chinese woman being assaulted on the streets by a Chinese man.

Nike, the NBA, LeBron James, and countless other American businesses and businessmen are trying to serve two masters – America and China. Guess which master they hate.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/nike-lebron-china-america-bible-whitlock,2021-06-27
Fearless: Jason Whitlock’s letter to black America explaining the real purpose of made-for-TV racial conflict,"Dear Black People:

We are being lied to and set up. The mainstream media, Democratic politicians, social justice activists, and perhaps even your church pastor have led you to believe America is in the midst of a racial conflict similar to the Civil War and the civil rights movement.

They have pitted us against the Proud Boys, the KKK, rural militia groups, and Trump supporters in a made-for-TV race war. Just five years after Barack Obama completed two terms as president of the United States, we're supposed to believe America has been overrun by violent white supremacists determined to reinstate segregation, Jim Crow laws, and maybe even slavery.

Evidence of this massive wave of 1920s-style bigotry amounts to three things: 1) Republicans want all voters to show a government-issued ID; 2) On January 6, unarmed Trump supporters crashed the Capitol and took pictures inside Nancy Pelosi's office; 3) Across the nation, police kill on average 250 black men and 450 white men per year.

Oh, I almost forgot. There's a fourth piece of evidence. Colin Kaepernick failed to land a job as a starting quarterback after pissing off a large segment of football fans by taking a knee during the national anthem.

Those are the main smoking guns proving that white supremacy is the most dangerous domestic threat America faces. George Floyd, a habitual criminal and drug addict, is the Crispus Attucks of this raging race war. He is our rallying cry and hero.

It's a setup. We're being used as decoys and distractions in a war that has nothing to do with race.

The real war is about global power and the future of America's system of government. This country's elite, global citizens, and corporations prefer communism over capitalism and democracy. They prefer China's system over our system.



America has been the world's leader in racial progress and fairness. The mainstream media are not allowed to explain this to you. Advertisers, aka major corporations, will no longer support media outlets that back our current democratic and capitalistic systems of governance.

You say, what about Fox News? Turn it on. It's filled with a bunch of MyPillow and wounded soldier commercials. America's big, global corporations, the ones looking to improve their market share in China, are not financially supporting Fox News. The most popular voices at Fox News dislike China.

The faux race war the mainstream media have promoted is a tool being used to convince you and non-black Americans that our system of government has been a giant failure. They want you to believe that a great reset is necessary to achieve fairness.

The reset is communism, which starts with the gateway drug of socialism and ends in full-blown Marxism. China is run by the Communist Chinese Party. Communism has no respect for individual freedom or religion of any kind. Communism has no tolerance for political dissent.

Your religion and free speech will not survive the reset. Communism is racial oppression's best friend. When a nation is stripped of religious faith and free speech, few people have the courage to defend the rights of minorities. The elites cozying up to China do not care about you. They are aware of how despicably China treats black people. They are aware of how China squashes dissent.

Do your own research on communism and what it stamps out and how it oppresses. Don't take my word.

You might be wondering why Oprah Winfrey or LeBron James or some other super popular black celebrity isn't telling you what I am. They're global elites. The reset won't hurt them or their loved ones. Communism favors wealthy elites far more than capitalism and democracy do. Oprah, LeBron, and the other uber-wealthy black tokens will thrive under socialism and communism.

You won't. Unless you're a 6'6"" basketball star or some other black entertainer capable of entertaining the people in power. That's a tiny percentage of black people.

Why won't your favorite white cable newsman or newswoman tell you what I'm telling you? Rachel Maddow, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Joe Scarborough, aren't they our allies? No. They're not. They're political lobbyists working on behalf of the corporations and politicians pushing the reset.

OK. What about me? You might think I'm a political partisan working on behalf of conservative Republicans. That is certainly how I've been painted by left-leaning media outlets and social media platforms. And I'm now partnered with Blaze Media, a platform that leans right.

Judge my career. I have been at this for more than 30 years. I have been equally despised by the left and the right. I have publicly feuded with Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann. I've been a guest on their old Fox News and MSNBC shows. I've worked and/or written for ESPN, Fox Sports, the Huffington Post, Playboy Magazine, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal. I spent years bashing Sarah Palin.

I don't play for any political team. I've never voted. I go wherever I believe I can speak, follow, and write the truth. The truth I believe the most is that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior.

I believe Jesus is under attack. That's why I'm at Blaze Media. You can't defend Jesus at corporate media outlets. Advertisers won't allow it. You can discuss the religion of racism every day at ESPN, CNN, MSNBC, and even Fox Sports. But it's taboo to discuss the cure for racism — Jesus — on those platforms.

I'm not saying any of this because there's a big paycheck for black men espousing my views. The money for black broadcasters and journalists is connected to preaching the race-bait religion.

Let me be clear. I'm not broke by any stretch. I've earned and saved a substantial sum of money. But I've bypassed far more money than I've earned with the choice I've made to follow the truth wherever it leads and my refusal to support the racial groupthink dictated by global elites.

My faith won't allow me to jump on board with the lunacy, racism, and sacrilege of Black Lives Matter, a movement founded by three lesbian self-admitted trained Marxists. BLM is an atheist movement in support of LGBTQ issues and the reshaping of America into a communist country. BLM is part of the deception.

Black people tell me all the time: ""I don't support the BLM organization, but I support the slogan and sentiment.""

Let me translate that. You despise the devil's tree but love the fruit it produces. That's some Don Lemon-Lori Lightfoot-Van Jones-Colin Kaepernick level of hypocrisy. You know, all the Malcolm X-wannabe, anti-white radicals in relationships with white partners. They hate the white tree but can't live without the white fruit.

We have to stop letting everyone use us. We're being played. We're all being played, black and white working-class people. It's all a giant setup. Look at what they did to Trump supporters. They were manipulated into storming the Capitol, and then the corporate media portrayed it as a bloody, violent KKK rally intended to overthrow democracy. The so-called ""insurrection"" is an excuse for the government to seize more power and crush dissent.

We, black people, have been convinced the crushing of working-class white people is good for us.

It's not. Working-class white people, Christian white people, are our true allies, not the elites. We can't see that because of the made-for-TV hyper-focus on racial conflict.

The defunding and demoralizing of police are tactics deployed to increase violence in major cities. Local media outlets are focusing on this rise in crime, national media outlets have followed suit, and social media platforms are generating viral videos exposing the crime wave.

Guess who are the stars of this content. Black perpetrators.

It's all a massive setup. The stirring of racial animus between Obama worshippers and Trump worshippers is orchestrated by billionaire elites, executed by trained Marxists, promoted by millionaire influencers in the media, sports, and entertainment worlds, and co-signed by religious leaders pursuing popularity.

Black America, print this letter and share it with family, friends, co-workers, and, most importantly, your pastor.



My critics will tell you: ""Oh, Jason Whitlock is a sellout. He hates black people.""

That's laughable. It's part of the deception. I despise the people deceiving us, manipulating us to participate in a racial clash that will be used to destroy the religious and individual freedoms that liberated us.

There's a reason black and brown people across the globe fight to get into this country and excel when they do. They love the American tree and the fruit it produces.

Thanks for reading,

Jason Whitlock",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/ready-fearless-jason-whitlocks-letter-to-black-america-explaining-the-real-purpose-of-made-for-tv-racial-conflict,2021-06-25
Jason Whitlock says social media determined Richard Sherman coverage by ESPN,"ESPN is so afraid of the Twitter mob that the Worldwide Leader in Sports won't put a byline on its stories covering the arrest of NFL star Richard Sherman.

This is significant. It underscores the power of Twitter to manipulate basic journalism and force a two-tiered, racial standard of journalism equity.

ESPN.com has published four stories related to Sherman's domestic-disturbance, drunk-driving arrest. All of the stories are bylined ""ESPN News Services."" Here are links, links, links, and links to the stories.

Fear — not a search for truth or desire to inform the public — is driving ESPN's coverage of Richard Sherman. ESPN does not want to subject one of its black or white reporters to the racist bile popular with ""Black Twitter."" So, the network's stories about Sherman post without a byline and are written in a manner sympathetic to Sherman.

ESPN has yet to report that the uncle of Sherman's wife called 911 and stated that Sherman threatened his wife with violence. Yes, it's just an allegation. However, it's no different from Sherman's wife calling 911 and reporting that Sherman threatened suicide, drank two bottles of whiskey, and told his wife he would fight with police if they tried to arrest him.

Furthermore, since the 1994 OJ Simpson-Nicole Simpson tragedy, we've been educated on identifying the early signs of men who cannot control their violent tempers with spouses. I'm not analogizing Sherman to OJ. I'm saying there's a reason the King County Sheriff's office sought an order in February that barred Sherman from possessing a fireman. Sherman is a threat to himself and others.

ESPN is fearful of painting an accurate picture of Sherman. I'm sure some of its restraint is well-intentioned and based in fairness.

But would fear and fairness drive ESPN's coverage of a white athlete in trouble with law enforcement?

Let's take a look at ESPN's coverage of Chad Wheeler.



Police arrested Wheeler, a former backup offensive lineman for the Seahawks, on Saturday, January 23rd for domestic violence. Wheeler appeared in just five games in 2020. It took the news media several days to take notice of his arrest.

The hometown Seattle Times published a story on Monday, January 25th. Here's a link to that story. Approximately 24 hours later, ESPN weighed in on Wheeler's arrest. Here's a link to ESPN's story.

Notice the byline on the ESPN story, Brady Henderson. He covers the Seahawks for ESPN. Henderson is a fine sports writer. In no way am I attempting to cast Henderson in a negative light. He's a victim of Twitter's negative impact on journalism.

Henderson has tweeted about Sherman's arrest. He's even tweeted a link to the ESPN story about Sherman's court proceedings. Henderson and ESPN justifiably recognize the racially radioactive nature of the Sherman story. ESPN is shielding Henderson from the Twitter storm, and shielding itself by sharing a narrative favorable to Sherman.

There's no risk for a reporter attaching his name to a story examining Wheeler's alleged criminal activity.

Wheeler's criminal case became a bit of a social media cause celebre. Wheeler is white. His alleged victim is black and female. Shortly after his arrest was reported, a Twitter mob formed and began pushing the narrative that ESPN television downplayed and/or ignored the Wheeler case because of white supremacy, white privilege, systemic racism, fear of the Proud Boys, Charlottesville, Trump supporters, and Rachel Nichols' private conversations.

The fact that no one outside of Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll and a handful of Seattle players had ever heard of Chad Wheeler had little impact on ESPN's sparse coverage.

""No, ESPN was racist. The network covered Super Bowl champ, three-time Pro Bowler, two-time all-pro Ray Rice's 2014 domestic violence case because he was black,"" shouted the angry social media mob.

This column is not intended to take cheap shots at ESPN. Its purpose is to further expose just how corrosive Twitter is to fair, honest journalism. Twitter and Facebook are the primary drivers of two forms of separate-and-unequal corporate journalism — one standard for whites, one standard for blacks.



The social media apps are driving a wedge between black and white Americans. Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg are not journalists. They have installed themselves as the editor-in-chiefs of the news media. They're more toxic and destructive than Roger Ailes, Jeff Zucker, and Phil Griffin.

Politicians love Dorsey and Zuckerberg because of their naïveté, journalistic incompetence, malleability, and willingness to make it financially rain in protection of power.

We're living in the era of mob journalism. Black Twitter's control of the mob won't last forever, or even much longer. Soon, the mob will come for the very people who foolishly delighted in its existence.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/richard-sherman-social-media-espn-coverage-whitlock,2021-07-17
"Sha-Maria Law: ESPN sacrificed Rachel Nichols to honor George Floyd, the Alphabet Mafia, and America’s cultural insurrectionists","ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro is engaged in a prolonged war with the Taliban, commonly referred to in sports media circles as the ""BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.""

Wednesday, under the tenets of Sha-Maria Law, the Alphabet Mafia beheaded NBA broadcaster Rachel Nichols for private disobedience of identity politics guidelines. ESPN removed Nichols from its NBA coverage and canceled her show, ""The Jump."" With a year left on her contract, according to reports, Nichols will no longer appear on the Worldwide Leader in Sports.

A year ago, Nichols, a white Jewish woman, gossiped with a male member of her tribe about ESPN management handing black colleague Maria Taylor a job that had been contractually promised to Nichols. Unbeknownst to Nichols, her comments were accidently recorded by a camera in her Orlando hotel room and subsequently shared with leadership of a Taliban cell headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut.

Because Nichols made these inconsequential comments during the summer of 2020, the first holy holiday celebrating the death of career criminal St. George Floyd, the Alphabet Mafia placed a bounty on Nichols' career at ESPN. Working with Taylor, the Alphabet Mafia newspaper of record, the New York Times, smeared Nichols as a bigot, forcing Pitaro to execute Nichols.

Some critics are comparing Pitaro to U.S. President Joe Biden, saying Pitaro's submission to the sports media Taliban is analogous to Biden's catastrophic Afghanistan exit. The New York Post's influential media critic Andrew Marchand published a column Wednesday night blaming Pitaro for fumbling the Nichols-Taylor dispute.



""In the history of sports media mismanagement, the way ESPN handled Rachel Nichols' situation may not be the worst, but it can make a case,"" Marchand wrote. ""The fiasco was the result of embarrassing, indecisive management from ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro on down. More than a year ago, ESPN did not do anything of substance about Nichols' comments when they first found out about them. Nothing. Nada.""

It's a fair take. However, I disagree. I am far more sympathetic to Pitaro's plight.

Full disclosure, ESPN rehired me in 2013 to found a website dedicated to covering the intersection of sports, race, and culture. Unfortunately, my black skin did not compensate for my woke shortcomings, my faith-based conservative values, and my toxic masculinity. I was a frequent target of Deadspin's attack. ESPN fired me in 2015. Six years ago, I was Rachel Nichols, a sacrifice to the Alphabet Mafia.

Pitaro inherited the Alphabet War from his predecessor, former ESPN president John Skipper. From 2012 through 2017, Skipper surrendered complete control of the network to the terror group Deadspin and its infamous warlord Nick Denton, the Osama bin Laden of the Alphabet Mafia. In mid-2017, I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal explaining the successful insurrection Deadspin pulled off in the Disney capital of Kabul, Connecticut. Deadspin's insurrection was quite similar to the events on January 6 at the Capitol. ESPN security opened doors and welcomed insurrectionists onto its campus. Many ESPN employees worked in a clandestine manner with Deadspin Proud Boys Tommy Craggs, Tim Marchman, A.J. Daulerio, and single token Alphabet nationalist Greg Howard.

Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, used Deadspin to bully ESPN into adopting the identity politics agenda. For years, Deadspin attacked ESPN executives relentlessly, exposing embarrassing details about the sexual malfeasance of the network's executives and personalities. Fear of being a target of a Deadspin ""investigative"" story terrified ESPN leadership, especially Skipper. In 2018, Skipper was forced to resign when it became public that someone was using his cocaine addiction in an alleged extortion plot.

Skipper and ESPN's longtime head of human resources and Alphabet Mafia soldier Paul Richardson negotiated a secret peace agreement with Deadspin. The network agreed to prioritize identity above talent and merit in its on- and off-air decision-making.

In front of the camera, sexual identity, skin color, and gender drove ESPN to form the worst Monday Night Football booth in the history of the iconic show, pairing legendary NFL coach Jon Gruden with solid baseball play-by-play man Sean McDonough and talented sideline reporter Lisa Salters. During the broadcast of FOOTBALL games, Gruden and McDonough routinely expressed horror at the level of violence displayed.

Behind the camera, sexual identity, skin color, and gender led the network to elevate female executives to supervising positions over studio shows, which led to no-impact, mostly attractive female broadcasters landing high-priced hosting jobs on nearly every studio show. Skipper gave huge contracts to Michelle Beadle, Cari Champion, Jemele Hill, Katie Nolan, Samantha Ponder, etc.

If you want to understand why Maria Taylor balked at a raise from $1 million to $5 million and left for NBC, you have to understand the culture Skipper, Richardson, and Deadspin created at ESPN. Taylor was radicalized by Taliban culture early in her career. She is quite talented. But ESPN raised her to feel entitled. Her black skin qualified her for reparations.

Nichols is talented, too. She's also accomplished as a journalist. She worked as a legit journalist at the Washington Post for eight years. Not Jeff Bezos' Washington Post. Nichols worked for the Graham family's Washington Post. Nichols fought her way to the top of sports media with hard work and cunning politics. She earned it. Yes, Nichols played woke to survive and thrive within corporate media. But she did not deserve this embarrassing public execution. She did not deserve the New York Times hit piece insinuating racism, nor the savage and irresponsible tweets about her personal life.

She whined to a friend that identity politics stole an opportunity she earned. Who wouldn't do that? Who hasn't done that?

Nichols and Pitaro are victims of a strategy Skipper and Richardson implemented a decade ago. Pitaro replaced Skipper in 2018 and immediately declared war on the sports media Taliban. Pitaro demanded that ESPN sportscasters talk about sports rather than Twitter-approved political talking points. He bought out Michelle Beadle's $5 million-a-year contract when she could no longer hide her utter disdain for football, the primary ratings driver for all of sports television. Pitaro bought out Jemele Hill when she chose sophomoric political commentary over sophomoric sports commentary. Pitaro declined to participate in the sports media fantasy that a cute Boston bartender, Katie Nolan, was the future of sports television.

Pitaro and ESPN executive vice president Norby Williamson were having great success smoking insurrectionists out of their Bristol caves. Everything changed in the summer of 2020. That's when a Minneapolis police officer assisted fentanyl activist St. George Floyd in the destruction of his life. In terms of cultural change, Derek Chauvin's knee was more powerful than Colin Kaepernick's.

It resurrected the Taliban, aka the Alphabet Mafia.



Insurrectionists in sports media and across American culture glorified St. George Floyd so they could use him to seize power and exact revenge on the infidels who stray from or don't adhere to the politics of identity.

What we've seen play out at ESPN over the past decade mirrors the rest of American society. Those of you applauding the death of Rachel Nichols, including those of you with black skin, will be the next victim of Sha-Maria Law.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/sha-maria-law-espn-sacrificed-rachel-nichols-to-honor-george-floyd-the-alphabet-mafia-and-americas-cultural-insurrectionists,2021-08-26
Squires: 2022 America owes 2015 Rachel Dolezal an apology,"Janelle Monáe, the Grammy-nominated singer and actress, recently disclosed that she identifies as “non-binary” on Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk web series. This announcement comes four years after Monáe claimed to be “pansexual,” meaning she is attracted to both sexes and the ever-growing list of gender identities.

We live in a country where a person can claim to be neither a man nor a woman and still expect to be taken seriously by every social, cultural, and political institution in the nation. That is a sign of civilizational decline, not social progress. It is also a reminder of how poorly we treated the woman who tried to pull America back from the brink of narcissistic identity destruction.

America owes Rachel Dolezal an apology.

Dolezal, also known as Nkechi Amare Diallo, is the white woman who pretended to be black as she obtained a degree from Howard University, taught Africana studies at Eastern Washington University, and led a local chapter of a venerated civil rights organization. She unknowingly tried to strike a crippling blow against racism, but her efforts were rejected.

In times past, a black person with light enough skin might have chosen to pass for white because they realized that racism put constraints on where black people could work, eat, and live. In America today, white women like Dolezal and Jessica Krug, a former professor at George Washington University, attempt to pass for black because doing so gives them access to social status and cultural capital they deeply desire. The reality that no white woman would have attempted to pass for black in 1815 or 1922 is a sign of how far the country has come on race.

Rachel Dolezal became the butt of jokes and was roundly mocked in the broader culture after she was exposed for lying about her ethnic heritage. The controversy prompted her to step down as president of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the NAACP on June 15, 2015. Exactly one month later, ESPN awarded Caitlyn Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYS. Jenner’s award came after he was featured on the cover of Vanity Fair with the headline “Call me Caitlyn” in June and did an interview with Diane Sawyer in April in which he announced “I’m a woman.”

In the span of one month, we decided the thoughts of slave owners about race were more important than what Genesis and genetics say about the reality of biological sex.

That is the ultimate form of white supremacy.

The year 2015 was the point in American history when Rachel Dolezal should have sparked needed conversations about whether we should cling to arbitrary racial categories that were used to enforce a color caste system. Her claims of blackness should still have been rejected, but at least her presence could have prompted questions such as, “What did Toni Morrison mean when she called Bill Clinton the 'first black president'?""

We could have also asked why Kamala Harris gets to identify as Indian when it suits her, yet we’d laugh at Barack Obama if he claimed to be white and ridicule Sage Steele when she – accurately – calls herself bi-racial.

Those are exactly the types of issues that needed to be raised, especially since Caitlyn Jenner’s new identity was being hailed as a sign of progress by the ruling class. Public intellectuals, social commentators, and comedians should have asked why people sneer when they hear the term “transracial” but nod in affirmation when they hear “transgender.”

Melissa Harris Perry, a professor and former MSNBC host who interviewed Dolezal, should have asked why many of the people who claim blackness is not a feeling or a costume also affirm any man who claims he “feels” like a woman and demands to be treated like one after he changes his appearance.

Instead, Dolezal was mocked for challenging our allegiance to arbitrary racial categories and Jenner was celebrated for rejecting his biological sex.

Both the left and right are fond of saying that “race is a social construct,” but attempts to change how we see it are met with the type of fierce opposition one would expect when challenging a biological reality.

At various points in history, Americans with discernable African ancestry have been called negro, black, colored, creole, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, high yellow, bi-racial, and mixed. Such a variety of terms suggests a category that is not “fixed” in any scientific sense, but certain people are only “race-fluid” when it suits them. This is why Joe Biden could declare that anyone who didn’t vote for him over Donald Trump in 2020 “ain’t black.”

It is also why both Nikole Hannah-Jones and Jemele Hill defended his thinking. They treat blackness like a cultural border wall, keeping race-fakers like Dolezal from coming in and pushing people like Justice Clarence Thomas out for the crime of political nonconformity.

We would be a very different nation if we practiced equity in our application of ridicule toward a white woman pretending to be black and a man pretending to be a woman. Putting someone like Rachel Dolezal under the microscope should have prompted us to look in the mirror and reconsider the long-term impact of making Caitlyn Jenner a civil rights icon.

Instead, we dismissed the woman confused about race and celebrated the man confused about gender. Now the culture applauds when people like Janelle Monáe claim to reject the entire concept of gender altogether. We should have cast off slavish adherence to plantation race logic and held firm to the truth of sex differences between men and women.



Submitting the eternal truth of God’s word regarding His creation to the temporal opinions of created beings also captures the nature of America’s spiritual decline. We are stuck in a pit of deception and sinking deeper every day. Our only hope is a spiritual revival characterized by humility, repentance, prayer, and understanding that the God who designed the world gets to define the world.

It’s too late for Dolezal to help us now. Her box braids and bronze skin can’t save us. That doesn’t mean we can’t tell her we’re sorry.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-2022-america-owes-2015-rachel-dolezal-an-apology,2022-04-28
Squires: The gun control debate proves hypocrisy is a bipartisan feature of our political system,"Thousands of Americans gathered in Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives rally this past weekend to call for additional gun control laws in the wake of the high-profile mass shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde, and Tulsa. Other rallies took place across the country as gun violence survivors, activists, politicians, and celebrities intensified their demands for Congress to “do something” about guns.



The difficulty of passing gun control legislation reflects a broader reality in American political life: The U.S. Constitution itself has become a political Rorschach test that both parties cling to or discard depending on how it fits their goals and serves their constituents. One photo from the D.C. event explains this phenomenon on the political left.

It read “Outlaw Guns, Not Abortion.”

This sentiment captures the worldview differences that fuel our political divisions. When it comes to a procedure that has a 100% death rate, Democrats do not want any legal restrictions and claim to be protecting a constitutional right that isn’t mentioned anywhere in our founding documents.

When it comes to firearm ownership, which actually is in the U.S. Constitution, they favor enough restrictions to render the right inaccessible. Democrats also seem immune to the “they’ll just get them illegally” argument that has become a familiar retort in our national abortion debates. When it comes to made-up constitutional rights, waiting periods, age restrictions, and parental notification all get cast aside.

This explains why Democrats have been promoting the “Protecting Our Kids Act,” which recently passed in the House, without any hint of irony. It also highlights the reason the March for Our Lives receives so much more media coverage than the March for Life rally that has taken place every January since 1973 to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision.

As is often the case when it comes to politics, hypocrisy is a bipartisan feature of the system.

The Second Amendment is the golden child to constitutional conservatives. The Fourth Amendment is the red-headed stepchild. This is why red-flag laws are rejected as a strategy to combat mass shootings but stop-and-frisk is accepted as a solution to street crime. Conservatives used the standard of “reasonable suspicion” mentioned in the Terry v. Ohio Supreme Court case to defend violating the civil liberties of American citizens in the name of public safety.

Some conservatives and libertarians, including Maj Toure and Dana Loesch, have consistently rejected threats to both constitutional rights. They have been the exception.

The editors at National Review defended stop-and-frisk in New York City in 2013, and most conservative commentators spent more time in 2016 talking about athletes kneeling during the national anthem than reports of unconstitutional police practices in Baltimore.

One of the cardinal rules of gun safety is never to point your weapon at something you don’t want to destroy. Public policy can function in a similar fashion. In both instances the person wielding power has to ensure that their sights are set on the correct target.

Being young, black, and male in a low-income neighborhood is not a crime. Neither is being middle-aged, white, and a legal gun owner in the suburbs. Asking both groups to accept significant impositions on their civil liberties because a small subset of people who look like them break the law is a dangerous proposition. The erosion of constitutional rights for the masses for the sake of targeting a small minority is the slipperiest of slopes in a constitutional republic.

Mass shootings in schools, churches, and grocery stores are often carried out by people who have purchased their firearms legally. The majority of homicides in large cities (e.g., Philadelphia and St. Louis) are committed with guns that are not legally owned and registered to the shooters. Suicides by gun actually constitute the largest number of gun deaths but generate the least amount of media coverage. Accidental shootings that occur when firearms are not stored and handled properly typically get local media attention because they often involve children.

The problem with our gun debates is that political talking points on both sides are used in ways that fail to account for important nuances.

Raising the age to purchase an AR-15 from 18 to 21 could keep those weapons out of the hands of disaffected, troubled teenagers and prevent a future mass shooting. Those would obviously be good outcomes, but outlawing AR-15s would also put millions of gun owners in a very tenuous legal position and prevent law-abiding citizens from accessing a popular means of self-defense.

One Florida woman used an AR-15 to defend her family after burglars broke into her home and pistol-whipped her husband. She shot one of the men, who died in a ditch near her home.

She was eight months pregnant.

This is not an anomaly. Firearms are used for defensive purposes thousands of times per year. This is an important part of the gun control debate that needs to be highlighted, even as we can acknowledge the pain of families and fellow citizens who have lost loved ones to self-inflicted or deliberate acts of violence.

American politics are at an inflection point. Identity politics is on its deathbed. Conservatives have the opportunity to craft a strong, sustainable multi-ethnic base founded on common values and the protection of constitutional rights. The left will counter and say it is doing the same thing, but its political constituency is built on the assumption that the main goal of politics is the procurement and provision of resources.

Those two political philosophies are not the same.

Protecting rights is not a zero-sum exercise. The politician who fights for Second Amendment rights is helping the black man in Philadelphia as much as he is the white man in Peoria.

Promising and providing resources is very different, because favoring one group often implies holding something back from another. Racial discrimination in the GI Bill’s implementation after World War II is one commonly cited example. The effects, both on specific groups and national cohesion, are no different today.



The Second Amendment is an anti-tyranny measure, whether that oppressive rule is expressed through direct government force or the abdication of appropriate state power. That doesn’t mean guns are idols to be worshiped, but it does mean both sides should recognize that feelings of helplessness and hopelessness can quickly lead to calls for more state power. This is true whether it’s the left talking about random acts of violence using guns or the right complaining about the concerted effort to confuse and sexualize young children in K-12 schools. When families are falling apart and church pews are gathering dust, the government inevitably takes on the role of both father and priest. That is a future we should all want to avoid.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-gun-control-hypocrisy-parties,2022-06-14
"Squires: Fighting God's creation is the left's new religion, but their words will never make 'pregnant men' a reality","A number of social commentators have claimed that partisan political affiliation has replaced religion as the most important identity for many Americans. The politicians and pundits on the left who frame “Christian nationalism” as a conservative evangelical attempt to institute theocracy don’t seem to notice how their political agenda is rooted in a different set of religious instincts.

Democrats fight so hard to control the dictionary because they believe they can shape reality with their words. They believe their primary fight is with conservatives, but their desire to create the world of their choosing ex nihilo has put them in direct opposition to God.

In their world, homeless people are “unhoused persons,” ex-offenders are “returning citizens” and “justice-involved individuals,” women are “people with the capacity for pregnancy,” abortion is “reproductive justice,” a medical treatment that prevents neither infection nor transmission of a disease is a “vaccine,” and the mutilation of adolescents is “gender-affirming care.”

I understand the desire not to define people by their problems, but there is a much bigger issue at play here. This is not about rhetorical compassion. Like the “name it and claim it” prosperity preachers on television, liberal politicians, academics, and activists believe they can “decree and declare” the things they desire into existence.

The beliefs that “trans women are women” and “men can get pregnant” are treated as sacred knowledge – understandable only to the enlightened – to liberals today. Anyone who questions these claims is seen as a heretic. Some people like Macy Gray respond to their public shaming with expressions of contrition and pledges to continue educating themselves. Others, like J.K. Rowling, are treated like diseased lepers who are unfit to mingle with the true believers who unquestionably affirm these new truths.

The same people who are unsure of the exact number of genders also believe that they can create legislation to control the physical world. The Bible says that the wind and the waves obeyed Jesus. Nancy Pelosi believes the words in a climate change bill will have the same effect. She seems to believe that if the Son of God can control the weather, surely the speaker of the House can as well. This is government via god complex.

This rejection of nature has serious real-world effects. Serena Williams recently expressed the difficulty she is having with accepting that her tennis career is ending. Her essay in Vogue magazine includes much of what you would expect from an athlete facing the prospect of leaving a sport that has defined her for over 25 years. It also included one section that sounded like an opposition to biological reality.

“Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family,” she wrote. “I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.”



The gender exclusivity of childbirth is seen as unfair by women like Serena Williams because second-wave feminists sold women a lie. They told women to pursue any area of social or economic life that was dominated by men and reject a superpower – the ability to bring life into the world – that belongs solely to them. The inevitable result of rejecting the world as it was designed is a lifetime of frustration and bitterness.

Politicians, ideologues, and activists on the left think they can shape reality – and solve problems – through the manipulation of language. That may work on people who lack knowledge or courage, but with respect to eternity, it is an exercise in futility. They can use emotional extortion and fear to force compliance, but none of those tactics can actually change reality. The God who created the world cannot be bullied into submission by rebels who want His throne.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-lefts-religion-against-reality,2022-08-18
Squires: Social (media) justice requires far different standards for Kyle Rittenhouse and Julius Jones,"America's justice system is broken.

Our laws are still in place, but as a nation, we have no shared understanding of what ""justice"" is or how it should be pursued. This reality impacts every aspect of society, especially when the modifier ""social"" is attached to the concept of justice whenever disparities between ethnic groups are found to flow in a particular direction.

This is yet another outcome of a rapidly secularizing country that attempts to cherry-pick Bible verses about justice while discarding the God who defines it.

Biblical justice reflects God's character. It promotes and upholds good and punishes evil. Its ultimate purpose is to bring people into the right relationship with God and with one another.

Our justice system draws on those principles. Ideally, our system of laws should be an impartial, proportional mechanism for promoting moral order. It should seek to punish criminals and motivate a change in their attitude and behavior, protect the innocent, deter criminal behavior from spreading, provide restitution for victims, and apply grace and mercy without prejudice.

Achieving justice is a process, not an outcome. That process includes weighing evidence, hearing from witnesses, and deciding guilt or innocence based on the facts of the particular case.

The members of the ruling class do not want a justice system. They want a system of cultural, political, and legal spoils (e.g., presumption of innocence, celebrity backing) that can be doled out to people they like and withheld from people they don't.

The cases of Kyle Rittenhouse and Julius Jones demonstrate that clearly.

Rittenhouse has been accused of being a white supremacist without evidence since last year, and his critics ignore the video footage that clearly shows him using his gun in self-defense. The fact that he came to Kenosha and was not in favor of burning it down in the name of racial justice makes him a natural enemy of the ruling class. That is why politicians and pundits on the left, as well as a few on the right, have tried to make this case about race and the dangers of Trumpist vigilantism. They make the case about Rittenhouse's age and the type of gun he was carrying and refuse to even acknowledge the chaos and disorder that were allowed to fester in Kenosha and many other cities in 2020.

The left has a completely different attitude toward Julius Jones, the convicted murderer whose death sentence was commuted on the day he was scheduled to be executed. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Kerry Washington and professional athletes including Baker Mayfield and Russell Westbrook successfully lobbied Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt to spare Jones' life.

His supporters claim that he didn't have a fair trial because of racial bias, inadequate legal representation, and issues with witness identification. They also allege that Jones' co-defendant confessed to carjacking and killing Paul Howell in 1999.

If Jones did not kill Howell and was not present at the scene, he should be fully exonerated. Justice demands it.

The actual evidence points to his guilt. A witness claimed Jones drove the victim's car to his home on the night of the shooting and was wearing the exact outfit — white shirt, black stocking cap, and red bandana — the victim's sister described to police. The police later found that bandana and the murder weapon in Jones' home. The bandana was tested in 2017 and was found to match Jones' DNA.

The issue here isn't opposition to the death penalty. There are people across the political spectrum who object to the practice for religious, moral, and administrative reasons. No definition of justice includes executing an innocent person for evil acts committed by others, but there is another side to that coin as well. Failing to punish the wicked for the evil they do is also an injustice. Worse yet is holding them up as heroes or excusing their behavior for the sake of political expediency.

This isn't just about Julius Jones. In recent years, Hollywood celebrities have joined with death penalty opponents to advocate for several people on death row. The most well-known case involved Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams, the co-founder of the Crips. Williams was convicted of murdering four people, but his case brought together rappers and actors who claimed he changed his life and should be spared death. Even the founder of one of the most notorious street gangs in America can become a sympathetic figure if the right people get behind him.

The left has a completely inverted view of justice that prioritizes the feelings of lawbreakers over the needs of the victims. This is why citizens from San Francisco to New York City are frustrated when they don't see serious consequences for thieves who steal from stores in broad daylight or commuters who assault passengers on the subway.

Imagine being the mother of Jacob Blake's children and seeing the man you accused of sexually assaulting and terrorizing you venerated as a near-martyr for racial justice. The same goes for the parents of the children Joseph Rosenbaum molested.

The same goes for the academics and journalists who claimed that people burning down buildings and destroying property were simply engaging in political speech, not committing crimes. These small business owners who work tirelessly to provide jobs and services to their communities were quickly dismissed by people who appear on cable news shows to declare that ""rioting is the language of the unheard.""

Like every other issue they champion, radicals wrap this inversion of justice in brown skin to make it more palatable to the public. This is why we are unlikely to see the same level of anti-death penalty activity on behalf of Dylan Roof. Aside from a handful of activists and academics, most of the celebrities who say the death penalty is barbaric wouldn't dare say anything that could be misinterpreted as supporting an actual white supremacist. They only champion the cause of convicted rapists and murderers if it furthers a political agenda.



The reason the left immediately brings up rape during every debate about abortion is because they actually believe unwanted children are more worthy of death than men who violate women sexually. This moral perversion is why they use ""reproductive justice"" as a euphemism for intentionally killing the unborn and ""criminal justice"" as their rallying cry for sparing the lives of convicted murderers. That's not a standard of justice I recognize.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-social-media-justice-requires-far-different-standards-for-kyle-rittenhouse-and-julius-jones,2021-11-19
Squires: ‘What Is a Woman?’ proves godless hedonism – not Christian nationalism – is America’s biggest threat,"""What is a Woman?,"" the documentary film from Daily Wire podcast host and political commentator Matt Walsh is not primarily about women. It’s not even mainly about transgenderism or the excesses of leftist dogma related to sex and gender.



The documentary is about the nature of truth and as such, it's ultimately about theology more than biology. Walsh is an outspoken Catholic, but he never tackles the subject from a religious perspective. That may have been a strategic choice, given how left-of-center media outlets are trying to convince Americans that the biggest threat to the future of the republic is the growing number of conservatives who advocate for policies informed by their faiths.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The biggest problem our culture faces is godless hedonism, not Christian nationalism.

Matt Walsh asked a simple question – “what is a woman?”– to college professors, medical professionals, elected officials, activists, and ordinary citizens. Very few even attempted to give a straightforward, logical answer. It is hard to give an answer when your mind has been conditioned to think in terms of “your truth” or say that a person’s self-perception is “their reality.” One college professor in the film said Walsh’s use of the word “truth” itself was “transphobic,” “condescending,” and “rude.”

This is why our entire culture has come to believe that a person can change their sex simply by claiming they identify as the opposite sex. The reason Lia Thomas is a household name is because activists and journalists focus on hormone levels and fairness for trans athletes instead of basic definitions. If women’s sports are for women and men can’t become women, then there is no reason whatsoever for a man to be competing in women’s sports.

The elevation of the self above all rational objective thinking is also why there seems to be a sudden explosion of drag queens engaging with young children. The ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" programs in local libraries have morphed into drag queens reading and performing in public schools as well as drag events for young children in adult clubs. These events are posted online as if men twerking and gyrating in front of young children is perfectly normal and acceptable, but only if those men are dressed up as women.

The modern left has no limit on the types of content and activities adults can introduce to children in the name of LGBT progress. That became crystal clear by how liberal entertainers, lawmakers, and journalists responded to a bill prohibiting schools from discussing matters of sex, sexuality, and gender identity with young children. They said “gay” for weeks in their state houses, on news broadcasts, and at awards shows because they believe the desires of adults should always take precedence over the needs of children.

The denial of objective truth is a rejection of God. There is a straight line from biological evolution to political revolution to cultural devolution.

If human beings have no creator who provides our standards of morality, then human flourishing is a function of having the right people in power to control our lives, not a matter of spiritual health. Societies don’t suffer from too much sin; their problem is not enough Caesar.

The problem with that worldview is that chaos ensues when the concept of objective truth is rejected, people believe they can create their own realities and feelings become the final arbiters of good and evil.

What we are seeing in the West is the inevitable collapse of this way of thinking. Leftist dogma regarding the value of life, the human body, biological sex, human sexuality, and the definition of family are all part of the same death spiral. According to the Bible, God wants humanity to “be fruitful and multiply” and build order into our world that allows us to fulfill that command. Reproduction requires male and female participation. Marriage provides the ideal context for the provision and protection of women and dependent children. The scriptures declare the value of human life is inherent because of our common creator.

The practitioners of progressive politics disagree. They believe abortion up until birth of is a human right and think toddlers can change their genders. The family structures they prefer promoting cannot reproduce offspring without external assistance. Their command to fellow humans is, “be fruitless and destroy.”

This is the dystopian future of butchered babies, harvested eggs, rented wombs, and sterilized adolescents. Charles Darwin would probably describe this entire agenda as “artificial selection” because there is nothing natural about a species that sees the death and destruction of its young as a sign of social progress.









We live at a time where we have more financial resources, technological advances, and access to knowledge than at any point in history. We also seem more despondent, depressed, nihilistic, disconnected, and narcissistic than ever. That’s because material wealth does not give life meaning, and education is not the same as wisdom.

A lifetime of expensive formal education from the most elite institutions is worthless if it makes a person deny objective truth. None of the Maasai tribesmen Matt Walsh encountered studied medicine, law, or philosophy at Harvard, yet they understand the difference between men and women better than the people who have.

The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 3:19, “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: 'He catches the wise in their craftiness.'”

Our inability and unwillingness to answer the question “what is a woman?” has caught us in a trap we can’t escape with more worldly wisdom. Only time will tell whether we will continue following the path of man’s wisdom or embrace the peace that accompanies God’s truth.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-what-is-a-woman-proves-godless-hedonism-not-christian-nationalism-americas-biggest-threat,2022-06-06
"Steve Kim: Baker Mayfield is Jared Goff 2.0, an average quarterback masquerading as a franchise QB","When you draft a quarterback number one, the expectation is that he will lead your franchise for the next dozen years and, if not lead you to a few Super Bowls, at least be an upper-echelon signal caller.

By those standards, the Browns have an issue. Because Baker Mayfield isn't that guy.

Not that he's JaMarcus Russell or anything. To be fair, he is serviceable. But he's far from elite.

That was shown again in the Browns' most recent loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, where they lost to their AFC North rivals 15-10, dropping to last place in the division at 4-4.

Once again, Mayfield was OK. He completed 20 of 31 passes for 225 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. But that doesn't tell the whole story. Too often his passes aren't accurate enough for his receivers to run through the ball and have the opportunities to get yards after catch. Coming out of Oklahoma, he was thought to be a precision passer. That simply hasn't manifested itself in the NFL.

It has to be mentioned that he is playing with an injured left shoulder. But there is a large enough sample size at this point to determine who he is. Right now, he's a better pitchman than a passer.

To be fair, in the fourth quarter of this loss to the Steelers, Mayfield didn't get much help, as there were drops, a key fumble by the usually reliable Jarvis Landry, and inexcusable penalties. Certain quarterbacks can overcome their teammates; Mayfield isn't one of them.

But looking at the big picture, while the blue-collar Landry has always been a productive player, the flamboyant Odell Beckham Jr. is now basically a non-factor. This week Odell had a lone catch for six yards.

Generally, Mayfield has a strong running game to lean on, but with the Browns generating only 96 yards on the ground, the offense produced just 10 points.

Go back to the 2018 draft, when Mayfield was chosen by the Browns. He was one of five quarterbacks selected in the first round alongside Sam Darnold, Josh Allen, Josh Rosen, and Lamar Jackson. From that class, Mayfield is no better than the third-best player.

The Browns have a decision to make. Do you commit to a highly lucrative second contract with Mayfield? The Rams faced this dilemma. They signed 2016 No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff to a lucrative extension, then decided to cut bait with him two years later. Goff actually led the Rams to a Super Bowl.



There is a belief that in the NFL there are two types of teams: Those who have their franchise QB and those who are looking for one.

The Browns are the latter.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/steve-kim-baker-mayfield-is-jared-goff-2-0-an-average-quarterback-masquerading-as-a-franchise-qb,2021-11-02
Steve Kim: Professional athletes are going to regret volunteering to be 'more than an athlete',"Last year, many athletes adopted LeBron James' mantra about being ""more than an athlete."" For them, playing sports was just a small part of their identity. In essence, they shouldn't be forced, like most of us working stiffs, to have their identities attached to their profession.

No. They weren't just grossly overpaid performers on the playing field. They're activists and community leaders. And that's exactly how the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People treated them on Thursday, when it asked professional athletes to eschew opportunities to work in the state of Texas.

According to ESPN, NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson wrote a two-page letter addressed to the MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, and WNBA players' associations asking athletes to avoid Texas over the state's recent laws regarding abortions, voting rights, and mask mandates.

""Over the past few months, legislators in Texas have passed archaic policies, disguised as laws, that directly violate privacy rights and a woman's freedom to choose, restrict access to free and fair elections for black and brown voters, and increase the risk of contracting coronavirus,"" the letter states.

So much for just playing ball, making a living, and negotiating happy endings. Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson now has to factor in abortion laws, mask mandates, and voter IDs into his decision-making about where to play next season.

The NAACP website states that the organization's mission is to ""ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality of all citizens.""

Certainly a noble endeavor, but it has to be asked -- what sacrifice are Derrick Johnson and the NAACP making in all this? I guess he did take the time to craft the two-page letter. That took some effort.

But this is nothing more than grandstanding and a cheap attempt to stay relevant by an organization whose influence has been fading for years.

It's very easy to request that others reduce their economic opportunities in highly lucrative careers that have relatively short life spans. All of the sacrifice — and almost none of the benefits (if there are any ) — in this instance would be for the players who are learning that being a willing pawn means that others make the moves for you on this chessboard.

Real activism should go farther than hashtagging and sitting out games. Now they are being asked not to play for certain teams in major markets.



Hey, guys, don't you just want to be an athlete and leave the grandstanding to the professional grandstanders?

But, hey, you asked for all this. Next time read past page one of LeBron's book, ""Social Justice Warrioring for Dummies.

"Whitlock: New York Mayor Eric Adams, the Dragged King, wears the LGBTQ wedding dress the left requires","The political left has been planning the wedding of black people to the LGBTQ movement since the days of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.



Bayard Rustin, a gay man, helped organize Dr. King’s march on Washington. Huey Newton, the national leader of the Black Panther Party, argued as early as 1970 for an alliance between black people and gays. In the last two decades, American academia exaggerated and elevated the profoundness of the writing of James Baldwin, a gay novelist in the 1950s.

During his second term as president, Barack Obama gave black voters permission to drop the religious pretense and come out of the closet as bi-political and supportive of same-sex marriage. At the close of Obama’s presidency, black people were officially engaged to the LGBTQ+ movement.

Post-Obama, three black lesbians, the founders of Black Lives Matter, married black people to the LGBTQ community, forming the BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.

Now, gay is the new black. We’re the mascots, the internationally recognized symbol, for the gay movement and all forms of biblical sexual immorality.

Yesterday, my ""Fearless"" colleague Delano Squires texted me an internet billboard promoting Drag Queen Story Hour as an event celebrating Juneteenth, the newly federalized national holiday celebrating the end of slavery. The poster references Juneteenth and, of course, includes a reference to Black Lives Matter.

Is there any other racial ethnic group as closely aligned to the gay and trans community as black Americans? What does Juneteenth have to do with drag queens? Nothing. The underlying message is that black people are connected to drag queens and gender dysphoria.

We’re mascots for the Alphabet Mafia.

This is the deal black political elites have cut.

New York Mayor Eric Adams symbolizes the bargain that has been made. Since last Wednesday, Adams has been tweeting up a storm about Juneteenth, LGBTQ issues, and drag queens. As of early this morning, 17 of Adams’ last 30 tweets related to Alphabet Mafia issues. The mayor of America's largest city is obsessed with race and sexuality.

Adams is the second black mayor in the history of New York. He’s a former 20-year New York police officer. He grew up going to church. He previously supported Louis Farrakhan’s vision of black male masculinity and self-responsibility.

New York has a multitude of high-profile issues, including a rise in crime. Eleven tweets about Juneteenth and six about sex and/or drag queens? His priorities are not in proper alignment. Neither are his values.

Eric Adams, like most black political elites, is a Dragged King. His allegiance to leftist ideology has dragged him away from his values.

“Drag storytellers, and the libraries and schools that support them, are advancing a love of diversity, personal expression, and literacy that is core to what our city embraces” Adams tweeted Wednesday.

Black people are locked in an unholy political marriage. We swore matrimonial vows to a movement that directly contradicts biblical values.

“To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.”

We’re financially broke, mentally and medically sick, and dying in the womb, at the hospital, and in our communities. The marriage to progressive ideology and secular values is killing us. We’ve had to abandon everything we say we believe to remain loyal to a political ideology that has not improved our condition.

The political left define who we are and what we believe. The regime now requires us to serve as the mascots for gays, trans, and drag queens. I’m not homophobic. But I’ll never support men dressed as women reading books to school children. That’s grooming. I’ll never support biological men competing in sports against biological women. It’s not fair to women or girls. I’ll never support surgeries or puberty blockers that stop young girls and boys from developing naturally. That’s abuse. I’ll never support same-sex marriage. It’s inconsistent with what’s taught in the Bible, no different from how my previous promiscuity made me an inappropriate candidate for marriage.



I’m a Christian. I’m not going to abandon what I believe and join a movement that violates my beliefs because a narrative has been spun that opposition to leftist values is anti-black.

I’m not wearing the clown suit the left has stitched for black people. It’s a wedding dress. I don’t wear dresses. Eric Adams does.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-adams-lgbtq-wedding-dress,2022-06-21
Whitlock: America’s toxic femininity pandemic provides China huge advantage in the Mold War,"We're losing the Mold War to China.

The Asian superpower and America's economic and military rival is molding its culture in masculinity. America is doing the reverse. With a gentle nudge from China, we're leaning into feminine energy.

On Thursday, China's lawmakers announced a ban on television programming with incorrect political positions, including shows featuring effeminate men. The Chinese Communist Party is pushing back against the feminization of men. Meanwhile, here in America, we're celebrating it. On Thursday, the rapper Lil Nas X partnered with People Magazine to promote the fallacy that he's having a baby. In an extravagant photo spread, Lil Nas was pictured pregnant. His new album, ""Montero,"" is slated to be ""born"" on Sept. 17.

""SURPRISE! I can't believe I'm finally announcing this,"" a caption read. ""My little bundle of joy Montero is due September 17, 2021.""

I know many of you think we should ignore Lil Nas X. He's a troll. The maker of Old Town Road is a one-hit wonder who is constantly courting controversy for relevance because his music is no good. I wish that were true.

Lil Nas is important because he has the support of our cultural puppet masters. There's a reason People Magazine supported his pregnancy photos. Lil Nas is bait for the minds of young people. He's a tool being used to feminize little boys. Old Town Road made him an icon among grade-schoolers. Now that he's an influencer, he's putting out music to influence young boys in the LGBTQ direction. Every other month, he executes an attention-grabbing stunt connected to a sexual taboo. When he's not giving the devil a lap dance, he's twerking naked in a prison shower or posed in a white satin dress with a huge baby bump.



Just a few years ago, we were (perhaps falsely) led to believe that 3% to 4% of Americans were gay. Now, when you turn on the television or open a social media app, society is presented as a narrative centered around alternative sexual identities. Transgenders make up 1% of society and 50% of our conversations about society. This is by design and manipulation.

If China is attempting to build a more masculine society, what kind of society would it love for its chief rival to adopt?

America is ruled by toxic femininity. The pleasing of emotions and feelings is our highest priority. We take so seriously the protection of feelings and emotions that thought crimes are judged more harshly than actual crimes. Jan. 6 is a great example. The rioters at the Capitol have been labeled and treated as insurrectionists even though the damage they caused at the Capitol pales in comparison to a typical Black Lives Matter and Antifa riot. The real crime of Jan. 6 rioters is wrongthink. They wrongly think Donald Trump was a good president. Support of Trump offends the sensibilities of feminized Americans.

Man can never fully please a woman. It's not in her nature to feel fulfilled. There's always more, something better. I'm sorry if that offends. It's my belief.

It's my belief that we're building a society that makes laws and rules based on feelings, fleeting, flighty, and filthy emotion. Emotions and feelings drive the behavior of weak people. Modern culture says men are weak when they don't express their emotions. The truth is men are weak when they don't control and tame their emotions. So are societies.

Human beings are capable of feeling a lot of things. Biological boys feel like girls. Biological girls feel like boys. I have sympathy for every human who suffers identity confusion. But we can't make laws focused on satisfying the feelings of confused people. Where does it stop? There are human beings who feel like dogs and cats. I'm not being flippant.

I do not doubt that Bruce Jenner felt like a woman trapped in a man's body. I don't doubt it for one second. We can't make laws based on people's feelings, though. Feelings change. A fair society presents challenges for all of us. Should airlines be forced to change the size of their seats because I feel uncomfortable in a standard coach seat?



There are consequences for our untamed feelings and desires. I feel like eating McDonald's five times a day. There's a price for that.

There's a price America will pay for its emasculation of men. China is taking steps to collect that debt. Lil Nas X is just another maxed-out credit card in the Mold War.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-americas-toxic-femininity-pandemic-provides-china-huge-advantage-in-the-mold-war,2021-09-03
"Whitlock: Bill Belichick is anti-vax-mandate, and I love it","Based on his comments Wednesday morning, it's fair to conclude Bill Belichick is no fan of the NFL's nonsensical and highly divisive COVID protocols.

The Patriots' head coach started his day meeting with the media. For about 10 minutes, reporters probed football's greatest coach for insight into the reasoning that caused the team to cut starting quarterback Cam Newton. Belichick provided no such insight. He dodged every direct question concerning Cam and pivoted to offering not-so-subtle gripes about the league's convoluted and authoritarian COVID protocols.

When asked if Cam's unvaccinated status contributed to his departure, here's how Belichick responded:

""No. Look, you guys keep talking about that. I would just point out that I don't know what the number is — you guys can look it up, you have the access to a lot of information — but the number of players, coaches, and staff members that have been infected by COVID in this training camp who have been vaccinated is a pretty high number. So I wouldn't lose sight of that.""

Later in the press conference, a reporter asked a second question regarding Cam's vaccination status and the impact of Cam missing practice because of the league's COVID protocols.



""No, we have other players on the team who are not vaccinated, as I would say probably every other team in the league,"" Belichick said. ""And we've had minimal, but throughout the league there've been a number of, quite a high number I would say, of players who have had the virus who have been vaccinated.

""So your implication that the vaccination solves every problem, I would say that has not been substantiated, based on what has transpired in training camp this year. That's all.""

Let's be clear. The reporter did not imply anything. Belichick knows this. He knows the NFL and the NFLPA have implied that the vaccine solves every problem. He knows that's not true. He knows the NFL isn't forcing the vaccine on its players out of concern for their safety. The league is doing it to appease critics of football. They're doing it to align with the Big Tech social media overlords.

The NFL knows that if it doesn't bully its players into taking the vaccine, corporate media will double and triple down on their assault on football. Roger Goodell and the league office have spent the past decade trying to make peace with their enemies through appeasement.

Who is the NFL's enemy? The political left, the people determined to tear down the patriarchy, the feminists who labeled masculinity toxic, the alleged journalists who have distorted football's concussion issue, the woke warriors who want to end football.

It's all connected. Goodell thinks fighting for football means making peace with people who hate football. It's not going to happen. Last year, the NFL bowed to the Black Lives Matter mob. The league draped itself in Marxist ideology and utopian slogans.

This year it's embracing pandemic panic. Forcing young men in relatively perfect health to inject an experimental drug is ludicrous. The NFL played an entire season a year ago with no one vaccinated. Did one NFL player die? Did any NFL player get hospitalized during the season with COVID?

These players are not all stupid sheep. They know the COVID survival rate. They know older, fat, unhealthy people are the people who should be taking extra precautions. They know the NFL has no business getting this deep into their medical decisions.

So does Bill Belichick. A reporter asked him to cite the number of unvaccinated Patriot players.

""I'm not going to get into that,"" he said. ""Those are all personal decisions. And it's not my place to talk about a person's decision or medical condition.""

What's going on in the NFL is a joke. It not only violates the players' personal rights, it violates the unifying tenets of team sports. Vaccinated and unvaccinated players are being treated differently in things as small as where they can eat in team facilities and what they can eat at the team facility. Unvaccinated players have to report to the facility much earlier than vaccinated players.

It's all stupid. It's all theater to appease the media.

Most of the vaccinated, including the coaches, took the vaccine under personal protest. You can't convince me a group of mostly 20-something men believe getting the vaccine is in their best interest.



The NFL is immersed in the same political theater as the rest of the country. Sports used to be a leader. Now our sports leagues are followers.

Whitlock: Bill Belichick misses America’s old-school toughnes more than he misses Tom Brady,"My takeaway from the historic Tom Brady-Bill Belichick clash Sunday night is rather unusual:

We've created a culture so soft, so free of uncomfortable truth, that it's nearly impossible for anyone to do their jobs at a high level. We're all on eggshells, afraid of causing a moment's discomfort, worried we might say something that can be twisted for clicks and tricks, terrified we could lose access to someone important.

Bill Belichick blew last night's football game. He needed to be called out on NBC's telecast. It didn't happen because our safe-space culture frowns on mild critique.

In the final minute of Tampa Bay's 19-17 victory over the Patriots, Belichick continued his bad streak of poor decision-making, a streak that started the day he decided he'd rather move on from Tom Brady than acquiesce to Brady's small demands.

Facing fourth and three with 59 seconds to play, Belichick sent Nick Folk onto the field to attempt a 56-yard field goal in the pouring rain. The kick would've given New England the lead by a single point. Tampa Bay still had two timeouts and Tom Brady.

Make or miss, it was a really dumb decision. There was too much time on the clock. A week ago, on Sunday Night Football, Aaron Rodgers drove the Green Bay Packers into field-goal range in 37 seconds without any timeouts. On Tampa's previous possession, Brady tossed two would-be long TD passes to receiver Antonio Brown. Brown lost the first one in the rain and the lights. He dropped the second, a perfect rainbow that descended from the heavens.

But there was more. Patriots rookie quarterback Mac Jones earned the right to throw at least one more pass. He'd completed 31 of 40 on the night. There was no indication the moment was too big for Jones.

It was for Belichick. He choked.

Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth, NBC's terrific broadcast team, never commented on the foolishness of Belichick's decision. I can't really blame them.

Our culture overreacts to criticism. Had they second-guessed Belichick's obvious error from the broadcast booth, they would become the story, not Belichick.

Michaels and Collinsworth blast Belichick!

There would be endless debate about the appropriateness of criticizing the greatest coach in NFL history, a six-time Super Bowl winner. Belichick could become even more aloof and dismissive. He could treat Michaels and Collinsworth the way he does the rest of the media … with disdain.

Better to leave the discussion of Belichick's boneheaded strategy to Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless, easy-to-ignore football ""experts.""

I'm not criticizing Michaels, Collinsworth, Smith, or Bayless. I'm criticizing the culture created by social justice warriors. They've outlawed legitimate criticism. They've cultivated safe spaces for elites. Fair criticism is defined as hate or racism. Multimillionaire football players wear helmets with slogans attached to the back that demand we ""stop hate"" and ""end racism.""

They're warm and fuzzy sentiments with no tangible finish line or path. What the sentiments create is hostility toward truth and fear of honest discussion. We've eliminated Howard Cosell from the broadcast booth and replaced him with cheerleaders.

What's the point of knowing the game at a high level if you're prevented from discussing what you know?

This is a culture problem, not a football problem, not a Collinsworth and Michaels problem. They're bowing to the culture.

Bill Belichick — like LeBron James, Gregg Popovich, Barack Obama, Beyonce, and Saint George Floyd — has ascended to heights not achieved by Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, or Michael Jordan in his playing prime. Belichick is an icon above serious questioning. He's Football Jesus. It's an honor to share the planet with Belichick.

Again, I'm criticizing the culture, not Belichick.

Questioning Belichick's decision-making does not diminish Belichick. He's proven his greatness. His status as football's greatest coach isn't up for debate.

What can and should be questioned is whether he's lost a coaching step or two. No one sits on the throne forever. He miscalculated on Brady. It's not as bad as the Boston Red Sox's Babe Ruth miscalculation, but Belichick clearly gave up on his star pupil three years too soon.

And guess what? Belichick probably pushed Brady aside out of fear of the woke mob. Belichick was trapped by his history of letting his stars (Ty Law, Richard Seymour, Lawyer Milloy) leave a year too early rather than a year too late. Had Belichick made an exception for Brady, the woke sports media would have accused the legendary coach of providing Brady with white privilege.

Sounds crazy? Does it sound crazier than statues of George Floyd? Maria Taylor insinuating Drew Brees is racist because he defended the flag and the national anthem? Arguing that men can have babies?

The American media eat crazy for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime snacks.

Our country is crazy because we've let social media apps outlaw any truth that causes the slightest discomfort. We've gone from no pain, no gain to whatever annoys destroys.



Here's the real irony: The softening of America is why Belichick is in decline. It's not the absence of Brady. You can't be Bill Belichick in a culture this soft.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-bill-belichick-misses-americas-old-school-toughnes-more-than-he-misses-tom-brady,2021-10-04
Whitlock: Bill Maher and the left’s house of Trump cards teeters at the brink of collapse,"Bill Maher is lying. To his audience. And to himself.

He's no longer a loyal Democrat. He's anti-Trump. And his enthusiasm for Trump resistance is rapidly waning.

The liberal comedian's HBO talk show, ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" has turned into a weekly ray of hope for those of us praying America snaps out of its left-wing fascism revolution.

Every Friday night, it seems, Maher finds a way to trash the woke, and every Saturday morning across social media platforms, conservatives gleefully share his most recent rebuke of the left.

The latest episode of his show convinced me that Maher has been red-pilled and that former President Donald Trump is the sole reason Maher won't admit it. Trump is the only thing holding together the Democratic Party. He fig-leafs progressive insanity.

On Friday, Maher opened his panel discussion addressing the Biden administration's catastrophic handling of our withdrawal from Afghanistan. Maher trashed Trump and then declared that the former president couldn't have made a bigger mess than the current one.



Panelist Jackie Calmes, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, vapidly responded:

""You know how you always say, 'I can't believe Trump did that.' Nothing he did would make you think he'd hit bottom, and then … Well, it could be worse.""

That should be the slogan of the Democratic Party: ""It could be worse.""

To his credit, Maher pushed back and demanded that Calmes explain how things could be worse. She had no answer. She backpedaled, claiming she wasn't trying to defend the Biden administration.

The left is a house of Trump cards. Remove Trump and the progressive movement immediately collapses beneath the weight of its bulls**t. Remove Trump and the left can't defend the authoritarian actions it's taking to overhaul America's cultural norms.

Without Trump, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey would be viewed as treasonous villains for their censorship of free speech. Trump resistance justifies infringement of the Constitution's First Amendment. Big Tech, especially smartphones, has too much influence over American society. On Friday, Maher ended his show explaining the negative impact of our cellular devices. Maher understands that smartphones and social media apps are disconnecting and dividing us.

Trump resistance is the lone catalyst and justification for corporate media framing the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6 as an ""insurrection."" The insurrection is the Big Lie. No one authentically believes you can overthrow the government with flagpoles, moose heads, and zip ties. The Taliban staged an insurrection in Afghanistan. Trump supporters staged an unruly, criminal protest that never reached the level of violence seen at a typical Antifa or Black Lives Matter protest.

Without Trump, the left would have to vigorously defend its contention that men can be ""birthing people."" It would also be forced to defend allowing biological men to compete against women in sports.

Would America's laissez-faire policy at our southern border exist without Trump? Our immigration policy makes no sense. It can't be defended. It doesn't serve the greater good of our country. It is as big a mess as Afghanistan. We're allowing illegal immigrants to flood our country simply because doing so is anti-Trump.

Critical race theory depends on Trump resistance for legitimacy. It can't survive scrutiny and analysis. On Friday, Maher and his interview guest, gay conservative writer Andrew Sullivan, mocked the New York Times 1619 Project and complained that the left has moved away from the goal of a color-blind society.

You should watch Friday's show. It was amazing. Maher flirted with multiple third rails, including suggesting that vaccines and masks shouldn't be regarded as a more important response to COVID than exercise, losing weight, and a healthy diet.

Watching Maher on Friday made me ponder what the world would be like if Trump abandoned politics. Would it hasten the collapse of the fascist left? If you removed the Trump card, would it force the fake leftists to confront the fraudulence of the rest of the progressives' hand?

I believe, at this point, the majority of leftists are fake. Black people, the house pets of liberals, are required to hate Trump and all conservatives. Gangbangers and drug dealers command more respect in the black community than black Trump supporters.

There's nearly as much pressure on white people. Who wants the baggage of being assumed racist for espousing conservative beliefs? Disavow Trump and supporting leftist policy protects you from accusations of homophobia, racism, and misogyny. Pretending to be a Democrat exempts you from being held accountable for any violations of political correctness. Late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted ""The Man Show"" and performed in blackface. He's in good standing. Meanwhile, ""Jeopardy"" just canceled its brand-new host because of things he said on a podcast no one listened to 10 years ago.

Maher recognizes this hypocrisy. And he likely knows that he would be canceled, too, if he didn't keep up the charade of being a loyal Democrat and devout Trump hater.

Trump hate is the Democratic platform. It justifies Afghanistan, the border, 20 new genders, censorship, critical racism theory, mandating experimental vaccines, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Sometimes I think Trump has proven his point. He awakened the public to the swamp, the financial alliance among global corporations, political elites, and America's adversaries.



Does he have more to offer? Or is he now an impediment, a blinding force that stops well-intentioned people from seeing the damage the other side is doing to America?

Could Trump save America by stepping aside and fully exposing the lunacy of the Left?

What I'm suggesting reminds me of the strategy that civil rights workers used to defeat segregationists. Bible-carrying men and women put on their Sunday-best clothes and let photographers and cameramen document the behavior of bigots. The images won the civil rights movement.

Compelling liberals to defend their agenda without their trusty Trump card would unmask their wickedness.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-bill-maher-and-the-lefts-house-of-trump-cards-teeters-at-the-brink-of-collapse,2021-08-23
Whitlock: Brittney Griner and Alex Jones have a lot in common,"Racism and sexism do not explain the national indifference to the sad plight of Brittney Griner, the WNBA player imprisoned in Russia.



Thursday, a Russian court sentenced Griner to nine years in prison for attempting to carry a small amount of hashish oil into the country. A crime that would provoke a slap on the wrist here in America could dramatically alter the course of the 31-year-old two-time Olympian’s life.

Griner has already spent more than 150 days jailed in a foreign country. She’s a hostage in a geopolitical dispute between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the regime backing American President Joe Biden. Griner is a pawn Putin has walked across the chess board and plans to turn into a queen capable of forcing the United States into releasing terrorist kings.

America should be writhing in empathy for Brittney Griner. Instead, we’re mostly indifferent. Why?

The answer is complicated. Race and sex play a role, but not in the way Griner’s loudest supporters argue. In an attempt to pressure the Biden administration, Griner’s WNBA coach, Vanessa Nygaard, played all of the identity cards.

“If it was LeBron, he’d be home, right? Nygaard alleged. “It’s a statement about the value of women. It’s a statement about the value of a black person. It’s a statement about the value of a gay person. All of those things. We know it, and so that’s what hurts a little more.”

The truth is the identity politics movement is the reason Griner is caught in a cold war game that used to be reserved for men only. She’s a victim of the feminist movement that states there’s no difference between Brittney Griner and John McCain, the now-deceased Vietnam War prisoner turned politician.

The feminist movement redefined the rules of engagement. We no longer protect women and children first. We marked Griner and other women as fair game. Now we will pay an inflated price for her release.

The United States has offered a convicted arms dealer for Griner and a U.S. Marine, Paul Whelan. That’s a really bad deal for America. It’s only being offered because Griner is black, gay, and a woman and the regime backing Biden is a slave to identity politics.

Russia knows this. That’s why, according to reports, the Russians are insisting that America sweeten an already bad deal. Putin wants America to involve Germany in the trade. Germany holds a convicted murderer whom Putin wants thrown into the Griner trade.

This is embarrassing. It partially explains the indifference to Griner’s plight.

The rest of the explanation resides in our own corrupt justice system. It’s difficult to muster outrage at the unfairness and harshness of the Russian courts when our own system has fully embraced a harshness and one-sided political motivation.

We’re no better than Putin and Russia.

Our courts and media have defined Trump supporters as insurrectionists and terrorists. We jailed a 69-year-old grandmother with cancer for 60 days because she attended the Jan. 6 protest. She took videos while trespassing in the Capitol. She did nothing violent.

A policeman murdered Ashli Babbitt on Jan. 6 and has been lauded as courageous. She was unarmed. She posed no threat.

On the same day Russia sentenced Griner, our Department of Justice announced the arrest of four Louisville police officers for violating the civil rights of Breonna Taylor. What happened to Taylor is a tragedy. But her boyfriend shot a police officer before the officers fired into her apartment and killed her.

You can argue that her boyfriend thought the police were intruders. OK, but let’s say it was his next-door neighbor banging on the door and the boyfriend mistakenly thought it was an intruder and shot the neighbor. The boyfriend would be charged with criminal negligence. Banging on a door does not justify shooting whoever is on the other side of the door.

The boyfriend has faced no charges. Meanwhile the police officers who responded to being shot at are facing prison time.

Our court systems are a mess. There’s no consistent logic or set of laws driving what we see from our courts. This includes our civil courts.

I don’t fully comprehend what’s happening with Alex Jones. A politically motivated judge appears to be crucifying Jones in civil court because he uncorked a loony opinion on the Sandy Hook school shooting. Thursday a jury awarded two Sandy Hook parents $4.1 million in damages for Jones’ contention that the school shooting was a hoax.

I don’t have a problem with Jones facing consequences for spreading a myth that caused people to harass the parents of Sandy Hook. My problem is with the judge seeming to assist in the prosecution of Jones. It creates the appearance that she doesn’t like Jones’ politics.



When everything is politics, we lose empathy for all political prisoners.

The indifference to Brittney Griner’s plight is matched by the indifference to Alex Jones’ plight.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-brittney-griner-alex-jones,2022-08-05
Whitlock: Brittney Griner’s Russian ‘Brokedown Palace’ less disappointing than America’s January 6 ‘Midnight Express’,"I grew up believing America’s imperfect criminal justice system was the fairest in the world. My schoolteachers taught me that as a child.



They warned that America’s primary rival, the Soviet Union/Russia, practiced a cleverly disguised system of oppression and corruption, in which citizens were powerless against government forces. They said American citizenship was a privilege, that people in other countries would do virtually anything to enjoy our rights and freedom.

Popular culture reinforced the narratives I learned in school. I’ll never forget the first time I watched the 1978 movie ""Midnight Express."" It was an adaptation of the life of Billy Hayes, an American vacationing in Turkey. Turkish police captured him at the airport in possession of two kilograms of hash. He was sentenced to four years in prison for possession. Shortly before his release, the prosecutor changed Billy’s conviction to smuggling, and he was resentenced to 30 years. Billy was beaten and raped in prison. The food was terrible.

I remember making a mental note that I did not ever want to break the law in a foreign country.

Years later, I watched the 1999 movie ""Brokedown Palace."" It was a fictional movie about two American girls vacationing in Thailand. A slick Australian man tricked them into smuggling heroin. Thai police captured them at the airport. They were sentenced to 33 years. A corrupt prosecutor later added 15 years to their sentence.

""Brokedown Palace"" reinforced my commitment never to break the law while traveling abroad.

I bring all this up to make a point about Brittney Griner, the WNBA player jailed in Russia for possessing a small amount of hashish at a Russian airport. She’s suffering in a ""Wokedown Palace."" I don’t make the reference to vilify Griner. Who knows whether she really broke the law? I certainly don’t.

Brittney Griner got arrested in the absolute wrong place at the absolute wrong time.

It baffles me that the American media are attempting to make what’s happening to Griner an example of American racism. The Los Angeles Times recently published a piece by the great Bill Plaschke that vilified America for what’s happening to Brittney Griner in Russia. The piece argues that American racism is the reason Griner isn’t at home safe, sound, and spending the millions she earned playing basketball in Russia.

Plaschke wrote: “She’s black. She’s covered in tattoos. She has dreadlocks. She’s gay. She doesn’t fit America’s image of the ideal female athlete, so America is pretty much shrugging. If this had been Brady, we’d be going to war right now.”

Plaschke quoted Griner’s WNBA coach Vanessa Nygaard making this allegation: “If it was LeBron James, he’d be home, right? It’s a statement about the value of women, it’s a statement about the value of a black person. It’s a statement about the value of a gay person – all those things. We know it and so that’s what hurts a little more.”

Russia locks up a 6-foot-8 black woman for a tiny amount of hash, and it’s America’s fault. Really? What’s the matter with us? Are we really filled with this much self-hate?

I have experience in dealing with a foreign country that wrongly incarcerated a black American citizen. In 2016, Chinese police arrested a former Ball State University linebacker, Wendell Brown, for a minor bar altercation. Wendell spent three years locked up inside a Chinese prison. For his release, China’s corrupt criminal justice system required that the alleged “victim” needed to be paid $40,000. I paid it. Wendell came home in September 2019. He’s a great young man.

Chinese culture is hostile toward black people – unless you’re tall and play basketball. LeBron James won’t tell you that. No one associated with the NBA will state this obvious fact. Money is their ruler, not truth.

Like LeBron James, Brittney Griner is a globalist. She’ll go anywhere and say anything for the paycheck. Dissatisfied with her WNBA salary, Griner traveled to Russia to earn her millions. There’s a cost to the global agenda – a loss of American rights, customs, and freedom.

Griner earns approximately $221,000 a season in the WNBA. That’s a more than fair salary for a league that loses millions of dollars each year and is basically a charity financed by the NBA. WNBA players and their supporters disagree. American sexism is why WNBA players don’t earn millions playing a game virtually no one in America will pay to watch. According to the globalists, America is always the bad guy. America is always evil.

Griner is getting a taste of Russian oppression. It tastes like 1800s America, a time Griner knows nothing about. We can only hope that when she does return to America, she’ll muster the courage to sing this country’s praises.

This week, she wrote President Joe Biden a letter begging him to secure her release. WNBA and NBA players have spent the last five years demonizing America. Griner refused to stand for the national anthem. LeBron James and the NBA swallowed the entire Black Lives Matter agenda. Sitting in a Russian jail, Griner has rediscovered her patriotism.

“On the Fourth of July, our family normally honors the service of those who fought for our freedom, including my father who is a Vietnam War veteran,” Griner wrote. “It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate this day because freedom means something completely different to me this year.”



Bottom line: I have more sympathy for Ashli Babbitt and the incarcerated January 6 protesters than I do for Brittney Griner. I say that because I’m not shocked or surprised that Russia would make an American citizen a political prisoner. It’s exactly what my schoolteachers told me Russia did.

I naively expected more from our criminal justice system.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-brittney-griner-brokedown-palace,2022-07-06
Whitlock: CNN+ another casualty of Donald Trump’s ‘Dead Dems Society’,"The left needs Donald Trump more than we do. That’s the takeaway from the rapid and shocking collapse of CNN+, the stillborn streaming service Cable News Network birthed three weeks ago and pronounced dead on Thursday.



Donald Trump is the sun that fuels the left. He is the source of their energy, the god they worship, the justification for their retention of power, the wind beneath their wings.

The left needs President Trump far more than we do.

Let me define my use of the word “we.” It represents those of us who are grateful to live in the most free, most fair, and most successful country on the planet. It represents those of us who recognize that our founding documents, the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, were biblically inspired and have been the force rooting out the unfairness of man’s nature.

My use of the word “we” in this instance isn’t intended to be politically partisan. It does not connote the political right. It signifies people in their right minds, people who are rational, objective, and believers in truth. We no longer need Donald Trump.

That is not written to denigrate and/or criticize America’s 45th president. It’s written to convey how far we’ve come and what he taught us. There was clearly a time, even if some of us failed to recognize it, that we desperately needed President Trump. We needed him to open our eyes to the depth and pervasiveness of America’s political corruption. We needed him to expose corporate media’s hostility toward the average American. We needed him to inspire us to stand up to the establishment.

Donald Trump was actor Robin Williams in the movie ""Dead Poets Society,"" the eccentric teacher shouting “carpe diem” to teenagers who couldn’t resist the force of his personality. At the film's climax, Williams’ character, teacher John Keating, was wrongfully blamed for the suicide of one his students, Neil Perry. Perry’s parents forced the school to fire Keating, devastating the flock of boys inspired by Keating’s teachings. The boys staged an impromptu classroom insurrection, shouting “O captain! My captain!” when Keating briefly returned to class to collect his belongings.

Donald Trump is the star of ""Dead Dems Society."" His final lesson focused on election integrity. It reached its climax on January 6, when the establishment assassinated Ashli Babbitt for shouting “O captain! My captain!” inside the Capitol. The establishment blames Trump for Babbitt’s death. The truth is that corrupt politicians put Babbitt in harm’s way and an inept cop acted incompetently.

My point is we have graduated from Welton Academy, the fictional prep school in ""Dead Poets Society."" Keating taught his students well. He sent arrows into the world. His students no longer needed him. They knew how to seize the day.

That’s where we are with Donald Trump. We know what to do. The left doesn’t. The left is collapsing now that it is being forced to live without orbiting around Trump, the source of its power.

“Everybody profited from the ratings and the clicks with the anti-Trump vitriol,” Fox News media expert Joe Concha told me. “And now that Trump is gone, everybody’s struggling.”

Everybody on the left. CNN+ folded. Netflix is hemorrhaging subscribers. Spotify declined to renew its deal with the Obamas. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow suddenly only wants to host her show once a week. Comedian Bill Maher now regularly cracks just as many jokes on liberals as conservatives. Jack Dorsey gave up his Twitter CEO chair, is a critic of the Twitter board, and claims CNN was staging conflict in Ferguson, Missouri, during the Michael Brown controversy.

When the left has to actually defend its agenda rather than just shout “Trump,” its insanity takes center stage.

Disney is insane. The California-based company wants to dictate political policy in Florida. The Sunshine State enacted a law prohibiting teachers from teaching sexuality and gender to kindergartners through third grade. It’s a rational law. It empowers parents, leaving them as the primary “groomers” of their kids. Disney joined the leftists fighting against the law and the empowerment of parents.

Disney and the left want public schoolteachers to groom the sexuality and gender of 5-year-olds.

The absence of Trump from the White House makes the left’s agenda the star of the reality show corporate media broadcasts. The show is an absolute train wreck. It’s satanic.

The left’s “Defund the Police” sitcom has led to a dramatic increase in crime and violence. It has now turned extreme leftists against their political allies. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is engaged in a feud with Black Lives Matter. Adams has recently criticized BLM for ignoring the deaths of black people not killed by police.

Hank Newsome, the head of BLM New York, called Adams, who is black, a “white man in blackface.”

Now that they can’t fight Trump, the left is fighting each other. The modern left isn’t about building back better. It’s about tearing down everything in sight.

The left needs Donald Trump back in the White House more than we do. His existence on the political stage lets Democrats pretend they’re a force for good. Without Trump, all the Democrats have left is climate change. Speculating about Mother Nature isn’t nearly as profitable or interesting as calling Trump the next Adolf Hitler.



""Don’t Look Up,"" the Leonardo DiCaprio-fronted climate-change movie, couldn’t bail out Netflix.

"Whitlock: Democrats’ 2022 campaign slogan: ‘Kill my baby, or kill Donald Trump’","You will never convince me that the people who don’t value the life developing inside a woman’s womb know what’s best for us outside it.



The chaos, anarchy, and lawlessness overtaking America’s major cities are rooted in the pro-abortion mindset of progressives.

I tried to unpack this idea Wednesday night on Jesse Watters’ Fox News program. Watters played a series of news clips highlighting the ""Lord of the Flies"" behavior that seems commonplace in cities long controlled by Democrat politicians. He asked me for an explanation.

It's abortion.

Leftists do not value life. You can see it in their attitude toward abortion. They believe life begins in the delivery room and that the pursuit of happiness is contingent on a woman’s alleged constitutional right to destroy an unwanted baby in the womb.

Stacey Abrams, the Georgia gubernatorial candidate and darling of the left, recently addressed a crowd of concert-goers in Atlanta. She expressed a single message: “My body, my choice.”

The slogan is the Democrats’ version of Patrick Henry’s 1775 “give me liberty, or give me death” speech that compelled Virginia to join the Revolutionary War.

“Kill my baby, or kill Donald Trump” is the rallying cry of progressives. It encapsulates their worldview, defines their motivation, and explains the nihilism ruining the country.

Before I go farther, let’s examine the other side of the argument.

Progressives argue that political conservatives do not value life outside the womb. Democrats point to Republicans’ opposition to universal health care, minimum wage hikes, and other government assistance initiatives as proof that the pro-life movement reeks of hypocrisy and fraudulence. Progressives wonder: How can you be pro-life if you’re against government programs that assist the living?

It’s a fair question. Here’s the fair answer: Anything that makes man more reliant on the government and less self-sufficient does not support life. It cripples it. It creates dependency, which underscores my contention that the people who don’t support life inside the womb know very little about supporting life outside it.

Preparation fuels life.

Caring for a human being begins before conception. Doctors advise women to stop drinking and smoking before pregnancy, to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, to avoid toxic substances, to exercise and maintain a healthy weight.

Once a woman is pregnant, doctors advise parents to read and sing to the baby, to rub the mother’s belly, to avoid stress, to eat a healthy diet, to exercise, and to stop drinking and smoking.

Before and during pregnancy, doctors advise parents to treat the baby like a human being, not a fetus, not a clump of cells, not a collection of underdeveloped bones that can be easily dismembered.

The quality of a human being’s life can be greatly influenced before conception and certainly during pregnancy.

Here’s the proper worldview and slogan for a successful society: “Our bodies, our baby, our responsibility.” The word “our” represents mama and daddy.

“My body, my choice” is a death cult that leads to dystopia. Life begins long before the delivery room. The people who reject this support policies that lead to the destruction of family. They prioritize government assistance ahead of natural marriage. They hand responsibilities meant for a married man and woman to the government. The centering of abortion as a fundamental human right undergirds the irresponsibility and moral decay sweeping American culture.

Killing babies in the womb kills the necessity of marriage.

Major cities are violent and lawless cesspools because violence and lawlessness rule in the absence of family.

Redlining, the bombing of a Tulsa business district 100 years ago, and the war on drugs did 1,000 times less damage to urban black communities than Democrats mainstreaming the idea that abortion is liberating and being a Democrat is synonymous with blackness.

It’s not a coincidence that murder plagues the neighborhoods of the voting demographic most loyal to the political party that sees abortion as a human right.

Killing babies in the womb came before drive-by shootings.

When life in the womb is defined as a disposable burden, we should not be surprised when those same people see life outside the womb as disposable.



Democrats mask their indifference to black death and dystopian communities with Black Lives Matter T-shirts, yard signs, and hashtags. They shower empathy on a handful of black criminal suspects and pay Stacey Abrams to convince black women to kill their babies.

We’re supposed to take life advice from the people advocating for our deaths?

This goes well beyond race. Democrats mask their indifference to life with concern over climate change. Their solution to every problem is a reduction in humankind. They spend more time and energy garnering sympathy for violent criminals than innocent babies.

The importance of abortion to Democrats reveals their cluelessness about life.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-democrats-2022-campaign-slogan-kill-my-baby-or-kill-donald-trump,2022-10-27
"Whitlock: Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey are a ‘poison pill’ for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google’s ‘Alphabet Mafia’","Based on the reaction to his bid to buy Twitter, Elon Musk is 100 times more dangerous to the establishment’s vision of a new world order than Donald Trump.



The response to Musk has been measured and strategic as opposed to emotional and impulsive. The establishment unleashed its gaggle of celebrity pit bulls on the former president. A pack of rabid actors, athletes, broadcasters, comedians, and print journalists gnawed at Trump’s ankles for four years, eventually crippling him and turning the 2020 election into a contest of what well-intentioned Americans would do to stop Adolf Hitler 2.0.

There’s not enough time to reimagine Musk as Hitler 3.0, especially since corporate media prematurely gave that title to Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The attack on Musk will be led by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and a team of lawyers, all hired by Twitter’s board of directors to thwart his proposed $43 billion takeover of the social media app. Stopping Musk’s existential threat to globalism will be a game of chess, not checkers.

In the technology-driven world we now live in – a matrix designed by Silicon Valley – controlling Twitter is more important than controlling the White House. That’s why Twitter’s board would rather kill itself than turn the app over to an individual who believes in freedom, free speech, and the U.S. Constitution.

The “poison pill” enacted to stop Musk could easily double as a suicide pill for the board that authorized it. By denying shareholders the right to vote on Musk’s proposal, Twitter’s board has abdicated its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Rather than act in the best interest of shareholders, the board served the interest of political and activist stakeholders.

Musk forced Twitter completely out of the closet. The app is hostile to free speech and a partisan tool reserved exclusively for Democrats. Worse, the reaction to Musk’s takeover puts an impossible-to-ignore spotlight on Silicon Valley’s control of public discourse and American culture.

The Twitter-Musk controversy brings into focus the power, importance, and influence of the five families governing the BLM-LGBTQIA+ Alphabet Mafia. The Alphabet Mafia reports to FAANG, the acronym CNBC host Jim Cramer gave to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.

Musk’s bid to buy Twitter is an attempt to de-FAANG America. Twitter is the hit man for the Alphabet Mafia. Twitter assassinates reputations with false narratives and unfair allegations of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia. It censors, silences, and diminishes opponents of the Democratic Party.

If Musk acquires Twitter, he’ll have access to the algorithms, tactics, schemes, and correspondence that led to, among other things, Twitter disappearing the Hunter Biden laptop story and the banning of this nation’s 45th president from the app.

The richest man in the world owning Twitter is far more dangerous than even Donald Trump seated in the Oval Office. Trump could only complain about “fake news” and its origins. Musk could expose one of the co-conspirators in the alleged shadow government headquartered in Silicon Valley and the Pacific Northwest.

The members of FAANG do not want one of their soldiers (Twitter) captured and interrogated by Elon Musk. That’s way too dangerous a proposition for a man like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who already faces questions about the more than $400 million he spent fortifying the 2020 election. Musk’s involvement with Twitter could disrupt the warm and fuzzy narrative painted in Time Magazine about “The Secret Bipartisan Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election.”

Someone could snitch. In order to save the establishment, Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s zealot CEO, might be willing to off himself, climb into a bathtub and slit his wrists like Frank Pentangeli in “Godfather 2.”

But Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter’s founders and a member of the board, sounds like a man looking for witness protection. Dorsey spent the weekend working on his Salvatore Bonpensiero impersonation. Sal was an infamous character on the TV show “The Sopranos.” Everyone called him “Big Pussy.” He was one of Tony Soprano’s best friends from childhood. He was a rat and a snitch.

Dorsey might be Twitter’s Big Pussy. In a response to a Twitter user complaining about Twitter’s board, Dorsey tweeted: “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company.”

When another user tweeted that “good boards don’t create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time,” Dorsey responded with “big facts.”

When a user asked if Dorsey is allowed to talk in such a transparent manner, Dorsey stated flatly, “No.”

Dorsey is off the Twitter reservation. He resigned as CEO in November. His term on the board ends sometime this year. He’s friends with Elon Musk. Dorsey has joined the Musk Twitter Great Again movement. Dorsey is an insurrectionist.

In my view, he’s really a traitor with remorse.

Three years ago, during a three-hour podcast interview with Joe Rogan, Dorsey and one of his top underlings, Vijaya Gadde, acknowledged that Twitter’s algorithms were designed to amplify the voices and impact of groups Twitter deemed marginalized.

FAANG and its Alphabet Mafia are located in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest (Amazon). Those areas believe the most marginalized people on the planet are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and the silent P (pedophiles). Their voices have been amplified in corporate media to the point that no other voices can be heard as clearly.

Twitter was the primary tool used to normalize lesbian, gay, and bisexual behavior. It is now in the process of normalizing transgenderism. Estimates are that 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender. That’s .4 percent of America’s population. We are dramatically changing American cultural norms and socially outlawing biblical, Christian worldviews to please .4 percent of the American population.

We’ve normalized gluttony in this country, but you can still speak against it and remain in solid standing on your job. That is not true for many Americans about sins of sexuality and gender. There is immense pressure to change your values or risk punishment from the Alphabet Mafia.

The Twitter Elon Musk says he wants to create values free speech above hurt feelings and culture-policing lynch mobs. Musk’s version of Twitter would adhere to the principles spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, not the principles written and rewritten in Silicon Valley.



If Musk is successful, FAANG may soon regret siccing its dogs on Donald Trump. The silencing of Trump and the sabotage of Parler awakened the masses to the corruption and true agenda of the Alphabet Mafia. They’re not promoting fairness, equality, and a higher form of democracy.

They’re making offers people can’t refuse in pursuit of authoritarian rulership and a new world order.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-elon-musk-and-jack-dorsey-are-a-poison-pill-for-facebook-amazon-apple-netflix-and-googles-alphabet-mafia,2022-04-18
"Whitlock: ESPN, Biden administration, and Alphabet Mafia have big plans for Brittney Griner","Apparently, it is ESPN’s job to transform Brittney Griner into the Kim Kardashian of the Alphabet Mafia.



The Worldwide Leader in Sports spent the weekend force-feeding fans updates on Griner’s activities since being released from a Russian penal colony. On Saturday, ESPN dutifully reported that Griner bonded with the flight crew that transported her back to U.S. soil. Sunday night, ESPN’s top investigative journalist, T.J. Quinn, breathlessly reported that Griner dunked a basketball during her first workout.

So far, Griner has bonded and dunked.

ESPN thinks nine months inside a Russian jail have made the mundane details of Brittney Griner’s freedom fascinating to the American public. ESPN is trying to establish the importance of Griner. The network has set about the business of justifying the Biden administration trading a notorious Russian arms dealer for an irresponsible, pothead hooper, whose real value derives from brown skin and lesbian sexual preference.

ESPN is operating under the fallacy that once the American public recognizes the magnitude of Griner’s stardom, President Joe Biden’s decision to trade a convicted terrorist for her release will make perfect sense.

Unlikely. What is likely is Viktor Bout assisting Russian President Vladmir Putin in his war effort against Ukraine. Meanwhile, Brittney Griner will assist the Alphabet Mafia in normalizing drag queen story hour, gender transformation surgery for kids, and prioritizing sexual and skin color identity above everything else.

It’s a very fair trade when you consider the importance of the work our government has planned for Griner.

She’s spending her first few days back on American soil at a military base, where I’m sure Department of Defense operatives are giving her the right talking points for her new life as a high-profile influencer.

From the ESPN news story about Griner’s practice dunk: “Several sources close to Griner have said that when she does leave, she will not head to her Phoenix home but to what they describe only as a private, secure location.”

Griner’s agent then told T.J. Quinn: “There’s no timeline on her return at this point. She’s reintegrating into a world that has changed for her now. From a pure security standpoint, she’s not going to be able to move in the world the way she did. It’s not a fate that she asked for, but I think she’s going to utilize her fame for good.”

Brittney Griner is famous now. She needs security. She must sequester and isolate herself from a dangerous mob of Americans who could do her harm. Nine months in a Russian jail turned Griner into Tall Kim Kardashian. Griner and her wife, Cherelle, are Alphabet Mafia royalty, the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry of the LGBTQ.

My snark may feel like animus. For that, I apologize. I do not dislike Brittney Griner.

I dislike the way Griner is being used by the Biden administration, corporate media, and the Left. She’s another dumb jock being steered in the direction of misguided social justice activism. She was unappreciative of her American freedom before Russia showed her what real oppression is. A $200,000 salary for playing a game that no one watches isn’t oppression. Getting locked up for 14 years for a tiny amount of hashish oil so you can be exchanged for a terrorist is oppression.

I wonder if Griner understands this now. I wonder if she’ll stand for the national anthem. Or will her Leftist handlers insist that she remain polarizing and divisive?

My instincts say that Nike and other globalist corporations will pay her to follow the path of Colin Kaepernick. Two white Christians rescued Kaepernick as a baby, and he repaid them by portraying them as racist in a Netflix documentary.

America saved Brittney Griner at a ridiculous and unwarranted cost. How will she repay America?

Griner, her agent, ESPN, and the WNBA better milk all 15 minutes of her fame. It won’t make it to minute 16. People will watch her sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey, Don Lemon, or Robin Roberts. Her first WNBA will be watched by a few million people.

But there’s little substance to Griner and nothing interesting. She’s not even that good at basketball. She’s extremely tall. That’s it. She’s not Wilma Chamberlain. She’s never been MVP or a great scorer. Her dunks are unspectacular. She’s covered in unflattering tattoos. She’s not profound.



Like most woke modern athletes, her talking points come straight from Twitter.

Try as they might, neither ESPN nor the Biden administration will be able to elevate Griner’s importance to a level that justifies the trade for Viktor Bout.

A year from now, Griner and the WNBA will be back to trolling patriotic Americans for relevance. It wouldn’t surprise me if in two years, Griner is back playing basketball in Russia, signing an autograph for Viktor Bout.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-biden-administration-and-alphabet-mafia-have-big-plans-for-brittney-griner,2022-12-12
Whitlock: ESPN isn’t man enough to even discuss transgender Penn swimmer Lia Thomas,"Lia Thomas is why I have so much animus toward ESPN, the self-described worldwide leader in sports.

Thomas is the biological man competing on the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team. His parents named him William. He originally competed on Penn’s men’s team. Lia is the most disruptive athlete perhaps in the history of sports.

He is Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, and Colin Kaepernick rolled into one gender transition. Thomas is crushing his new peers in the pool. He’s pissed off his female teammates. They’ve been forced to anonymously complain to Outkick and the Washington Examiner about Thomas’ illogical and immoral invasion of their sport.

Yesterday, an anonymous Penn swimmer spoke to the Washington Examiner.

“Yeah, it’s definitely really stressful,” Thomas’ teammate told the Examiner.

“It definitely weighs on my mind a lot because it’s definitely hard to overcome the feeling of feeling completely overlooked, as if the NCAA just does not care about us at all. And nobody cares about how this is affecting us at all.

“It just seems like if you say anything, everyone is just going to attack you and call you transphobic, and it’s not even true. We just want to have what we were promised by joining the swim team, which is fair competition and equal opportunities. It’s been really frustrating because we all agree, and I have yet to meet anyone or talk to anyone who thinks what is going on is OK.”

I’m unaware of Lia Thomas’ name ever being uttered on ESPN, the self-described worldwide leader in sports. I can’t find his name or story mentioned anywhere on ESPN.com.

A week ago, the Ivy League released a statement supporting Lia Thomas. In part the statement said, “The Ivy League reaffirms its unwavering commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all student-athletes while condemning transphobia and discrimination in any form.”

The richest, most powerful and influential universities in America issued a statement defending Lia Thomas. ESPN said nothing, pretended it didn’t happen.

Thomas is not the first biological boy to compete against girls, but he is the most important, polarizing, and the highest-profile. In a normal world, ESPN would be analyzing and discussing the impact of Thomas’ swimming career twice as much as the network debated Tim Tebow kneeling in prayer, Kaepernick kneeling in protest, Michael Sam kissing his boyfriend on draft day, 65-year-old Bruce Jenner transitioning to Caitlyn, and George Floyd dying from a combination of drugs and police misconduct.

Women’s sports are being transformed and,quite possibly destroyed right before our eyes. ESPN is ignoring this dramatic change. Michael Sam’s kiss was a bigger deal?

Cowardice is the only explanation.

The deafening silence throughout corporate media makes me think of the 1996 Tupac Shakur song “Heartz of Men.” I can’t lie. I used to love Tupac’s music. I used to listen to it virtually every day. “Heartz of Men” is a hyper-masculine song that warns men about the wickedness and weakness of many of their peers.

When I think about Lia Thomas, his dominance of female swimmers at Penn and in the Ivy League, and how corporate media are intentionally ignoring this story, I think about wickedness and weakness.

I’m embarrassed for men. I’m embarrassed by how far we have fallen.

Men used to take pride in protecting women. Now we take the most pride in protecting our social media brands, our paychecks, and our popularity with the in-crowd.

Social media has led us to believe that protecting career criminals is more important than protecting college women. ESPN talking heads would riot rather than remain silent over law enforcement’s treatment of George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Rayshard Brooks.

Yesterday, I released a video spoof mocking the deification of Floyd, Blake, and Brooks. The spoof points out the absurdity of the attention, concern, and love we lavish on men who spent their lives wreaking havoc on others. Professional athletes, ESPN broadcasters, politicians, celebrity entertainers, and alleged civil rights activists pretend they defend Floyd, Blake, and Brooks as a way of being a voice for the voiceless.

Every TV network and media platform in America has discussed the plight of Floyd and company. College female athletes? We’ll leave their struggles to fringe websites.

Did Floyd, Blake, and Brooks earn a louder voice than female athletes? Why are male athletes silent about the plight of their female peers?

LeBron James has a daughter. All of the activist athletes have nieces, female cousins, sisters, and friends. Stephen Jackson, Matt Barnes, Ryan Clark, Randy Moss, Colin Kaepernick, Malcolm Jenkins.

Cowards. All of them.

Moss cried on national TV because Jon Gruden said DeMaurice Smith has big lips. Moss has three daughters. They are and/or were athletes. He should have an opinion on what’s transpiring in women’s sports. So should all the other athletes – male and female – who appear on ESPN. Maybe they think what Lia Thomas is doing is great. I’d love to hear their reasoning.

We’ve listened to them second-guess and condemn police officers the past six or seven years. They know nothing about policing but talking endlessly about it.

It’s sickening what has happened to the hearts of men. They have shriveled and disappeared. Our hearts pump Kool-Aid. We spend our energy, emotion, and resources fighting to protect criminals who resist arrest and have no genuine concern for victims of crime, the safety of law enforcement, or competitive spaces reserved for women.

In 2012, I lost a family member I loved to what my family and I believe was police misconduct. His name was Anton Butler. He had a criminal record that included drugs and guns. I’m not unsympathetic to George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Rayshard Brooks. But I’m also not a fool.



I have far more sympathy, concern, and passion for law-abiding citizens who are harmed by crime or have their hard-earned opportunities undermined by biological men who feel like women.

As Tupac would say, I’m “on this side, the real side.”

On the real side, what Lia Thomas is doing is stop-the-presses newsworthy. It’s worthy of vigorous debate and analysis. It could change the course of history and undermine the rights of biological women.

ESPN isn’t man enough to enter the discussion. America isn’t man enough. We’re a nation run by cowards.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-isnt-man-enough-to-even-discuss-transgender-penn-swimmer-lia-thomas,2022-01-13
Whitlock: ESPN spends wildly on 'Cracker Rear View' album by ‘Stephen A. & the Blowfish’,"ESPN’s recent spending spree on Troy Aikman, Joe Buck, Adam Schefter, and Adrian Wojnarowski will soon be problematic.

The Worldwide Leader in Woke will be forced to explain why it dumped $250 million in contracts on four white men in a span of one month. These types of explanations are necessary when businesses embrace diversity, inclusion, and equity (D.I.E.) mandates established by the BLM-LGBTQIA+ Alphabet Mafia.

Every decision, not just hiring decisions, has a racial, gender, sexuality, and political component that must be met. If certain boxes are not checked, Jemele Hill, Elle Duncan, Maria Taylor, and their Alphabet Mafia allies running corporate human resources departments huddle to plot their revenge.

The only thing more dangerous than a scorned woman is a pack of them in partnership with biological men looking to emote feminine energy.

Aikman, Buck, Schefter, and Wojnarowski now join their black heterosexual ally Stephen A. Smith atop the Alphabet Mafia’s ESPN hit list. Jimmy Pitaro, the ESPN executive who authorized their contracts, probably thinks of these men as the network’s Fab Five. They’re certainly paid like basketball stars. Aikman earns a reported $18 million a year, Buck earns $15 million, Smith $13 million, Schefter $9 million, and Wojnarowski $7 million.

“Green with envy” does not adequately describe the waiting-to-exhale text thread circulating among Hill, Duncan, Taylor, Malika Andrews, Cari Champion, Josina Anderson, Mina Kimes, Sarah Spain, Lia Thomas, and Bomani Jones. In that fictional thread, the Fab Five are referred to as “Stephen A. and the Blowfish,” and the album is called “Cracker Rear View.”

Not all of the complaints will be unjustified. Schefter and Wojnarowski are grossly overpaid. Twitter should be paying them, not ESPN. I like and respect Schefter and his work ethic. I respect Wojnarowki’s work ethic, too. But they can both be replaced. No one turns on the TV to see Adam Schefter or Adrian Wojnarowski. We follow them on Twitter for their information. They’re handed information from NFL and NBA insiders because ESPN is still the most powerful TV platform to disseminate information about those leagues.

Schefter’s primary value is that he’s willing to live a miserable life attached to several cell phones at all times. Fox’s Jay Glazer quit that lifestyle several years ago. Few people are willing to make the lifestyle sacrifice Schefter makes. That sacrifice is worth $4 or $5 million a year.

Wojnarowski is obscenely overpaid. He is embarrassingly bad on TV. He’s virtually worthless on air. He’s solely a Twitter feed. Years ago, when he worked at Yahoo Sports, Wojnarowski wrote influential and insightful columns about the NBA. He no longer does this. He tweets. He’s either unwilling to share what he knows about NBA culture, or he only knows NBA transactions. He’s newspaper agate. He’s an agate clerk being paid like a lead newspaper columnist.

Brian Windhorst, Shams Charnia, and Chris Haynes could replace Wojnarowski tomorrow without impacting ESPN’s business model. Wojnarowki is worth $2 million.

I have no problem with the money ESPN paid to lure Aikman and Buck from Fox Sports. They’re worth it. Their arrival dramatically impacts the perception of ESPN’s NFL coverage.

Under previous ESPN president John Skipper, the network created the perception that it hated football. The “Monday Night Football” broadcast booth was turned into a shrine for the LGBTQIA+ community when Skipper paired coaching legend Jon Gruden with Sean McDonough and Lisa Salters. The replacement booths featuring Steve Levy, Jason Witten, Booger McFarland, Brian Griese, and Louis Riddick barely improved the Alphabet Squad.

Aikman and Buck know how to sell football. They appear to love the game. Their addition to ESPN will make the NFL more comfortable improving the “MNF” schedule. Given the broadcasting shake-up across ESPN, Fox, and NBC, you could argue that Monday night might replace Sunday night as the NFL’s most important destination. That alone makes Aikman and Buck worth every penny spent.

As for Stephen A. Smith? Of course, he’s overpaid. His signature show, ""First Take,"" averages 400,000 viewers. He’s paid like he’s Tucker Carlson, who averages close to 4 million viewers. In fairness, Carlson’s show is half as long as Smith’s. But Carlson is a singular host, not reliant on a co-host or a rotating cast of debate partners. Smith is a barbershop gimmick supported by props. “Debate” is the star of Smith’s gimmick, not his own talent. The same holds true for Skip Bayless.

After the success of Tony Kornheiser, Mike Wilbon, and ""Pardon the Interruption,"" sports TV networks let a charlatan (Jamie Horowitz) convince ESPN and Fox Sports that “debate” was the draw, then paid the marginally talented trolls like they were must-see TV. The flawed concept and saturation wound up diminishing the real talent and chemistry between Kornheiser and Wilbon.

In terms of audience, the “debate” shows have a very limited ceiling, but that hasn’t stopped ESPN and Fox Sports from overpaying for their trolls, race-baiters, and shouters.



Nothing has changed about television talk shows since syndicated columnist Ed Sullivan debuted ""Toast of the Town"" in 1948. It was later renamed ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" TV talk is always about the talent, likability, and point of view of the host. It was true for Sullivan, Johnny Carson, Dave Letterman, Oprah Winfrey, Arsenio Hall, Jon Stewart, Bill O’Reilly, and Rachel Maddow.

No one tuned in to see Carson debate Ed McMahon. Forced debate is a telltale sign of a lack of talent.

So is the argument that justifies jobs on the basis of diversity, inclusion, and equity. D.I.E. will be the death of ESPN.

Whitlock: Fair to discuss whether 'vaccine' mania contributed to Damar Hamlin's collapse?,"Monday night, as I watched ESPN’s coverage of Damar Hamlin’s on-field collapse, I refused to entertain the possibility that the tragedy could be related to the NFL’s experimental medical trial (“vaccine”) coercion.



Other people were far less reluctant. Opponents of the experiment immediately connected Hamlin’s cardiac arrest to his vaccination status, a status that I did not know Monday and still don’t today.

Anti-vaxxers – of which I am one – argued, mostly with anecdotal evidence, that there has been a rise in sudden death syndrome among young athletes since governments and corporations across the globe started force-feeding Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed medical trial.

I remain undecided on whether speculating about Hamlin’s vaccination status is appropriate at this time. The 24-year-old remains in a Cincinnati hospital fighting for his life.

What I do know is that many people within the pro-vaxx group seem determined to pin Hamlin’s health crisis on the sport of football. Football is the proverbial bad guy. Speaking ill of the game is celebrated in modern America, where anything as uniquely American as tackle football is despised.

What I also know is that for members of corporate media, questioning the methods and products of the pharmaceutical industry is rife with as much danger as questioning the influence of secular Jewish people in Hollywood. It’s a topic best avoided.

Big Pharma is the most influential advertiser in all of television. Sports television now depends on pharmaceutical companies the way it once depended on Miller Lite, Bud Lite, and Old Milwaukee. The dope dealer replaced the bartender as the biggest bully in TV.

Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna are the puppet masters of the pontificators on television. The vaccine manufacturers demand that their puppets blame football for whatever happened to Damar Hamlin on Monday.

Yesterday, CNN.com contracted sports writer Jeff Pearlman to spin a yarn about how Hamlin’s collapse mirrors the 1971 death of Chuck Hughes, a Detroit Lions receiver, and illustrates the inherent dangers in football.

“Is a game that results in so much pain and suffering a reasonable pursuit in an enlightened society?” Pearlman asked. “Should we talk more about the 2017 Boston University study that found Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) in 99% of brains obtained from NFL players, as well as 91% of college football player? Can we question the wisdom of grown men slamming into grown men? Can we debate whether youth tackle leagues are life-affirming, or insane?”

Chuck Hughes died because of undiagnosed blood clots. He collapsed walking back to the huddle. Had he been walking to the team bus, would CNN blame football? Hughes’ death speaks to the dangers of blood clots, the side effect researchers say the experimental medical trials cause.

And what does CTE have to do with Hamlin? Why bring up CTE? CTE is the convenient mystery disease that can only be diagnosed in a corpse. In my opinion, CTE is a distraction, another tool to demonize football and deflect from the drugs athletes ingest to compete.

On the CNN morning show, ESPN’s Bomani Jones talked with Don Lemon about Hamlin. And, of course, Jones blamed football too.



“It’s like trying to make a safe cigarette,” Jones said, comparing the game that produces millionaire athletes to the cancer-causing tobacco industry.

My reluctance to ponder the possibility that the “vaccines” the NFL promoted contributed to Hamlin’s cardiac arrest is starting to dissipate. If it’s fair to blame football, why not ponder the impact of the so-called clot shot?

I’m willing to pay the penalty for discussing the vaccine. We’ve seen from Elon Musk’s “Twitter Files” that social media platforms banned and shadow-banned people who questioned the efficacy of the shots. YouTube discourages its users from negatively discussing the shot.

Big Pharma greatly influences what we can and cannot discuss on all platforms. Its commercials finance the NFL and all the sports leagues. Roger Goodell would rather have football blamed for Hamlin’s collapse than have football viewers second-guess their fifth booster.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-fair-to-discuss-whether-vaccine-mania-contributed-to-damar-hamlin-s-collapse,2023-01-04
"Whitlock: Kanye West, Kyrie Irving, and Dave Chappelle caught in the crosshairs of America’s descent into secularism","CNN now claims, without a shred of credible proof, that Kanye West admires Adolf Hitler. Blue-check social media influencers believe basketball star Kyrie Irving committed an act of anti-Semitism when he retweeted a graphic promoting a Black Hebrew Israelite documentary.



The controversies engulfing West and Irving seem similar to the trouble comedian Dave Chappelle courted when he cracked “Space Jews” jokes a year ago in a Netflix special.

A pop culture observer might conclude that there’s discord brewing between black celebrities and their Jewish business partners in the entertainment industry. I think the problem is much deeper and speaks to the strife, chaos, and anarchy stirring America. You can see it most clearly in the swift, punitive reaction to Kanye West’s poorly worded Twitter screed threatening to badmouth his former associates.

The rapper turned fashion designer is being canceled by any and all means necessary.

Quoting an anonymous business executive, CNN alleged that the shoe designer maintained a hostile work environment, with constant references to Germany’s Nazi leader.

“He would praise Hitler by saying how incredible it was that he was able to accumulate so much power and would talk about all the great things he and the Nazi Party achieved for the German people.”

That’s quite the allegation to level at a man from an anonymous source. But rules of fairness and credibility no longer apply to Kanye West. He’s spent the last six years intentionally crossing the wrong people, the progressive secular elites and influencers seizing power through cancel culture.

Before he was an anti-Semite, corporate and social media told us Ye was mentally ill, a misogynist, sexist, an Uncle Tom, alt-right, anti-vaxx , and a possible Putin sympathizer . Worse, he liked Donald Trump.

While Kanye’s recent controversy appears to have been the last straw, his original sins were being pro-God, pro-life, pro-Trump, and completely uncontrollable. His unwillingness to be controlled meant that the secular progressive elite would need to prevent him from continuing to flourish. Ye had to be corrected, lest other millionaire or billionaire influencers get the bright idea to break from progressive orthodoxy and let the Bible influence their imprecise interpretation of God’s truth.

West has crossed every red line progressive secular elites (black, brown, white, Jewish, female, Muslim, lesbian, gay, trans, etc.) hold sacred. He did it while hoarding all the material and sexual riches Satan has to offer. He’s now being stripped of those riches. JP Morgan Chase kicked him to the curb. So did Adidas, CAA, and all the high-profile tastemakers (LeBron James) looking to benefit from his fall.

Kanye won’t renounce God. At 45, he still has the heart of the 20-something who forced Sony Music to release ""Jesus Walks."" His faith makes him uncontrollable and unpredictable. The Hollywood secular elite can’t allow him to thrive.

Imprecision and social media recklessness – misdemeanors – are Ye’s real crimes. He fired off a stupid late-night Tweet and subsequently butchered his accusations against a group of former business associates in Hollywood, creating the opportunity for his targets to file countercharges of anti-Semitism. The counterclaim is a clever tactic commonly practiced by progressive elites of every stripe. They exaggerate their level of offense, fear, and victimization to seize power or avoid accountability for their abuse of the power they’ve captured. It works nearly every time.

Black progressive secular elites have seized power in Hollywood, the music industry, and corporate media. If you criticize the satanic “art” they create in music, movies, or television, you’re smeared as racist. The same goes for the progressive secular Jewish people at the top of the movie, television, music, and media industry. If you blame the LGBTQ crowd for the slippery slope that has drag queens inside schools and a record number of children suffering gender dysphoria, you’re smeared as homophobic and transphobic. If you criticize feminists for MeToo overreach and the lowering of military standards in the name of diversity and inclusion, you’re smeared as misogynistic.

Power’s proper partners are accountability and thick skin. Secularists avoid accountability with the thinnest skin in the history of mankind. The slightest imprecision or misspoken word is cast as an existential threat.

According to the secular, Kanye saying “slavery is a choice” moves America one step closer to eliminating the 13th Amendment. “Deathcon 3” signals a potential second Holocaust.

Secularists claim they want equality with white, heterosexual Christian man. Do they really? You can speak imprecisely about white Christian men, you can accuse them of anything, and they’re required to be man enough to deal with it and take responsibility for their mistakes.

I’m not going to entertain the lie that progressive secular elites – black, Jewish, LGBTQ, or feminists – wield no power in the United States. Miss me with that “trope.” Denial of the mass power they’ve collected is just one of the many lies they use to avoid accountability. Minority groups who have previously been victimized have weaponized the victimization of their ancestors to accrue power and uproot the foundational tent poles that made America great.

What’s happening to Kanye is a show of force, a display of secular Hollywood’s nuclear power.

So I’m not surprised that CNN published a story claiming West admires Hitler. Later, in the same story, the network claimed his White Lives Matter T-shirts promoted a “hate slogan.” The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, determined that the slogan “White Lives Matter” is hate speech.

On the surface, progressive secular black people, Jewish people, LGBTQ, and feminists seem united in their hatred of white people. It’s not white people. It’s a hatred of Christianity that unites them. That hatred compels them to try to destroy anything that Christianity created, including the patriarchy, Western civilization, and the United States of America.

Anyone accused of trying to preserve America and its Christian values can be labeled a Nazi, a Hitler sympathizer, a racist, a homophobe, a transphobe, an anti-Semite.

We can all be treated like Donald Trump or Alex Jones. That’s the lesson the secular want us to learn from their treatment of Kanye West. They control your reputation, your ability to provide for your family, your free speech.

If, as President Obama once complained, you cling to your Bible and your gun, the cabal progressives who worship him will use corporate and social media to smear you.

Thursday, Deadspin published a story accusing me of anti-Semitism based on a tweet I posted that quoted Revelation 2:9. I wrote :

“When will the Bible be de-platformed and canceled? Revelation 2:9: I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. #Kanye.”

Eric Blum, the Deadspin writer, accused me of “spewing blind hate against Jewish people.”

I did no such thing. I quoted scripture. I did not attempt to interpret the scripture. I allowed people to reach their own conclusions. Kanye has claimed in several interviews that he is a Jew. You could interpret the scripture as Kanye committing blasphemy and claiming a false heritage.

But let me remove all the mystery and explain how I interpreted the scripture and what my intent was.

I think secular black and secular Jewish elites are committing blasphemy, claiming an allegiance to a religious heritage they don’t support or respect. There are many secular black people who sit inside churches every Sunday and Wednesday pretending to honor God who abandon every religious principle in pursuit of political power. Barack and Michelle Obama sit at the head of this secular throne. “Rev.” Al Sharpton serves them communion.

That group has partnered with progressive non-religious Jewish people like George Soros to execute a strategy to disrupt traditional Judeo-Christian culture in Western civilization. Secular black and secular Jewish elites then aligned with the LGBTQ-BLM Alphabet Mafia and agreed that any criticism of any of them would be framed as racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic.

So any time a religious person of any faith or color criticizes behavior, political policies, or cultural norms that directly violate their faith, that person runs the risk of being canceled. He runs the risk of being accused of promoting a revisitation of long-ago oppression. The criticism allegedly causes a pain so immense that it harms its so-called victims irrevocably.

It’s an effective game that undermines truth, honesty, and progress.

The progressive secularists have set up a system that rewards lies, dismantles truth, deceives the naive, and eliminates redemption. It’s satanic.



Kanye West is a flawed human being, no different from me or anyone reading this. He’s not the perfect messenger because there’s only one perfect messenger. That messenger died on the cross.

There’s ample evidence Kanye admires Jesus Christ. There’s no evidence the rapper admires Hitler.

Ye’s admiration of Christ caused him to conclude that Donald Trump gave America a better chance of sticking to its Judeo-Christian culture than Joe Biden. With child-friendly drag queen shows commonplace across America, men dressed as women holding high-ranking government positions, and Democrats convulsing in anger because aborting babies in the womb is now more difficult than it once was, it’s obvious that the rapper reached the right conclusion.

Only the secular can’t see it.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-kanye-west-kyrie-irving-and-dave-chappelle-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-americas-descent-into-secularism,2022-10-31
Whitlock: Michigan coach Juwan Howard feels ‘untouchable’ in racist world liberal elites constructed,"Michigan basketball coach Juwan Howard believes he’s untouchable.

And why shouldn’t he? The rules imposed by our China-influenced institutions of government, education, sport, media (corporate and social), and art grant him a bigoted form of privilege.

Howard is black, elite, and a supporter of left-wing social justice. He checks all the boxes for the elimination of standards, accountability, and adult expectations. Our current culture immunizes Howard from real consequence. He took the blackcine, the alleged experimental cure for bigotry that injects people with the mindset that black people are inferior and can’t be held to the same standards as white, Asian, and Latino people.

Howard is fully blackcinated and boosted. He can’t be touched.

We saw that yesterday in the handshake line after the Wisconsin Badgers routed Howard’s Wolverines. Incensed that Wisconsin coach Greg Gard called a timeout with 15 seconds to play, Howard yelled at and attempted to walk past Gard without the customary handshake. Gard placed his hand on Howard’s elbow and tried to explain his use of a timeout. Howard responded by grabbing Gard’s shirt in the center of his chest and then pointing a finger in Gard’s face while repeatedly shouting, “Don’t f---ing touch me!”

Players and assistant coaches separated Howard and Gard. Moments later, Howard reached across several people and struck Wisconsin assistant coach Joe Krabbenhoft. Howard’s blow ignited a fracas among players from both teams.

Howard’s on-court, postgame behavior was embarrassing and justifies a season-ending suspension.

Howard’s postgame interview was troubling and justifies his firing.

“I didn’t like the timeout being called,” Howard told reporters, “and I’ll be totally honest, I thought it was not necessary in that moment, especially being a large lead. And then to have the timeout being called with 3, 4 seconds to go I thought that was – what I felt – wasn’t fair to our guys. So that’s what happened.”

There was no timeout called with 3 or 4 seconds to play. Howard is confused. Given time to collect his thoughts, Howard had no real idea what happened at the end of the game.

With 48 seconds to play and leading by 19 points, Wisconsin emptied its bench and inserted its scrubs, including several walk-ons. Howard instructed his players to compete until the final second. The Wolverines pressed full court and caused a Badger turnover.

“It wasn’t a press,” Howard told reporters. “We were just five, pressure defense man to man. That’s what five is for us.”

So it wasn’t a press. It was pressure defense man to man. Got it. Howard was in a total fog during his postgame media session. It’s like he blacked out. He lost a game and lost his mind.

“For someone to touch me, and I think that was very uncalled for him to touch me as we were verbalizing and communicating with one another,” Howard said. “That’s what ended up happening. That’s what escalated it.”

Getting touched in a handshake line is not unusual. It’s customary. Howard escalated the situation when he hit a Wisconsin assistant coach in the face.

“Oh yeah, it was more than that,” Howard responded when a reporter pointed out the point of a handshake line is to touch. “Yeah, he touched me unnecessary. There wasn’t cause for that when we were talking. At that point I thought it was time to protect myself.”

Five to 10 seconds after being touched by Gard, Howard protected himself by attacking Joe Krabbenhoft. It makes no sense. Howard sounded like a 12-year-old playground bully at best and a violent criminal with no emotional control at worst.

What he did not sound like was a leader, an adult capable of counseling young people not to be easily provoked. You can’t strike a man because someone touched your elbow or stepped on your favorite gym shoes. Striking the Wisconsin assistant was bad. The rationalization of the act was far worse.

How can Michigan have confidence in Howard’s ability to lead? Howard has less emotional control than his players.

Indiana University fired Bobby Knight 22 years ago, ending the era of out-of-control bully coaches. Twenty-years before Knight’s dismissal, Ohio State dumped its legendary football coach, Woody Hayes, for throwing a punch at a Clemson player.

Things we tolerated and/or overlooked decades ago, we no longer do. The Don Draper, Roger Sterling, Pete Campbell, and “Mad Men” era is gone. Juwan Howard can’t be retroactively grandfathered in. Replacing “Mad Men” with “Mad and Untouchable Black People” is a mistake and equally harmful and racist.

But that’s what we’re doing. We’re codifying cultural norms that lower or eliminate all standards of behavior and achievement for black people. You can see it in the education system, the criminal justice system, and the sports world. Leftists are defining black people as incapable of meeting traditional cultural norms. We’ve been defined as a special group worthy of a capital B that distinguishes us from the masses.

The behavior of black people has been deemed irrelevant. Only the actions of white people matter. From the use of the N-word all the way to murder, we only care about the behavior of one group – white people. That’s why it’s forbidden to talk about the behavior George Floyd exhibited that contributed to his death. Discussing Colin Kaepernick’s career-destroying and illogical behavior is frowned upon. Criticizing LeBron James or Barack Obama is an unforgivable sin.

Floyd, Kaepernick, James, and Obama are untouchable.

When people believe their actions are above scrutiny and irrelevant, their behavior typically becomes more erratic. That’s what we’re witnessing with Juwan Howard.

I first met Juwan when he was a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Michigan and the most mature member of the famed Fab Five. I covered the team for the Ann Arbor News. Howard was an impressive young person. He was mature, respectful, and classy. He had a huge heart. He brought his best friend from childhood – a kid everyone called “Juice” – to Michigan. Juice was small and smart. He and Howard were inseparable. At the time, it seemed understood that Howard used his athletic gift to empower and educate his best friend from home.

I’ve always been impressed with Howard. I’m shocked to see Howard struggle with his emotions and behavior. A year ago, he had an over-the-top, on-court confrontation with Maryland coach Mark Turgeon. Turgeon says Howard threatened to kill him.

It was an ugly scene. Michigan took no disciplinary action against Howard. The team was nationally ranked and would eventually advance to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. Howard should’ve been disciplined a year ago.

But he’s untouchable and knows it.

That’s why he was so offended that Gard had the audacity to protect his bench players from Michigan’s endgame, full-court press. Gard’s walk-ons were getting overwhelmed and embarrassed. The final 48 seconds of a blowout are a walk-on’s reward for practicing every day. Upset by the loss, Howard decided to ruin the reward Gard gave his scrubs. When Gard countered with a timeout, Howard emoted and eventually erupted.

Joe Krabbenhoft is white. Had he struck Howard, Krabbenhoft would have been fired Sunday night. He would be portrayed as the second coming of Derek Chauvin.



Howard has somehow been cast as the victim. Calls for his removal as Michigan head coach are being framed as a racist overreaction. For white bigots and black supporters of black inferiority, holding Howard to the same standard as a white coach would be racist.

Like Al Capone, Howard is untouchable. He will not be punished for his bad behavior. In a year or two, Michigan will fire Howard for NCAA Tournament evasion.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-michigan-coach-juwan-howard-feels-untouchable-in-racist-world-liberal-elites-constructed,2022-02-21
Whitlock: New York Times labels Tucker Carlson racist to mask its secular agenda,"This weekend, the New York Times unloaded more than 20,000 words arguing that Tucker Carlson hosts “what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news.”



As a somewhat regular guest on Tucker Carlson Tonight the past two years, I found the description shocking and offensive.

I’m black. I’ve spent the past decade of my career – at ESPN, Fox Sports, and now at TheBlaze – building media platforms that showcase black content creators. I volunteer to appear on Carlson’s show. It’s the only cable news program I watch on a nightly basis. In the past year, Carlson’s show has hosted two black contributors from my show – Delano Squires and Royce White.

Off the air, I frequently exchange ideas and friendly banter with Carlson via texts. I’ve dined with Carlson in Florida and came away impressed with his intellect, authenticity, and passion.

The New York Times claimed it analyzed virtually every episode of TCT since its Fox News inception. America’s newspaper of record, the alleged bastion of journalistic integrity, framed Carlson as the most racist man in modern TV history without quoting a single black person and apparently without probing a single black person who contributes to his show.

If Tucker Carlson is the Grand Wizard of cable news, the New York Times story insinuates that black (and white) contributors to his show participate in nightly cross burnings and lynchings. An editor at the Times should have instructed one of the nine reporters assigned to the Carlson stories to interview Carlson’s unwitting co-conspirators, especially black ones.

Nicholas Confessore, a regular contributor to Fox News competitor MSNBC, wrote the main two stories that attempted to assassinate Carlson’s character and reputation. The Times listed eight other reporters as contributing to the three-part series. Nine reporters couldn’t find one black person with something relevant and worthy to say about a man who is supposedly racially radicalizing millions of Americans through his show.

Did they even look? Or do black lives only matter when their dead bodies can be used to argue that America is irredeemably racist and oppressive?

The New York Times series impugned my character. I’m sure other regular contributors to Carlson’s show feel the same way. Is Glenn Greenwald, one of the best and most courageous journalists on the planet, a tool of white nationalism? For years, Greenwald, a white Jew, was a darling of left-wing media platforms. In the post-Trump-presidency era, Greenwald’s steadfast commitment to reporting truth has made him persona non grata at MSNBC, CNN, and NPR. Greenwald is gay. He’s married to an Afro-Brazilian, a man of color. Greenwald appears on Carlson’s show almost once a week. Greenwald’s thoughts on the alleged bigotry of Carlson’s show would be fascinating.

So would Victor Davis Hanson’s. Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute of Stanford University and one of this country’s most brilliant minds, is a former Democrat and a former respected voice at the New York Times. Is he now just a tool of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight’s"" white supremacy?

Am I?

I’m no mystery to the New York Times. I’ve been fairly profiled twice in its pages. Once in 2010, when I noisily left the Kansas City Star after 16 years. And a second time in 2015, when ESPN appointed me to lead ""The Undefeated,"" a media platform designed to analyze sports, race, and culture. Given the projects I’ve been involved in – ESPN’s ""The Undefeated,"" Fox Sports’ ""Speak for Yourself,"" and now ""Fearless with Jason Whitlock"" – it’s awfully difficult to suggest that I’m anti-black. If so, my career choices and actions are at odds with my alleged animus toward black people.

The New York Times thinks so little of me, Delano Squires, and Royce White that it apparently didn’t cross the minds of one reporter or editor to ask us why we would contribute to the most racist show in cable news history.

I’m not thirsty to appear on Fox News or any cable news network. When I was younger, before CNN and MSNBC shied away from diversity of thought, I regularly appeared on all the major cable news networks. Now the only network that invites me is Fox News. The only show I make it a priority to appear on is Tucker’s.

The show is smart. He allows me to express my biblical worldview. I get to say “Jesus” when I want to and when it’s appropriate. I get to remind people that America and Western civilization are founded on biblical principles and that those principles are worthy of defense.

I like Carlson’s show because it is not hostile toward Christian values and it regularly features guests and segments that defend Judeo-Christian culture.

The New York Times spent 20,000 words trying to convince readers that the success of Carlson’s show is because it appeals to white bigots. I watch it because it appeals to me as a Christian and a proud American. I believe in this country. I believe in the documents that founded this country. I believe the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution are responsible for black people in America having the highest standard of living and safety of any black people on earth.

I’m concerned that politicians, global corporations, and institutions such as the New York Times want to rewrite the U.S. Constitution into a secular document that does not adequately protect individual freedom or a system of governance that allows for class mobility.

The Times posited that Carlson’s show is racist because he constantly complains about a “ruling class,” shifting gender roles, discrimination against white people, the destruction of society, and America’s laissez-faire approach to illegal immigration.

Again, I’m black. I believe there is a ruling class, a cabal of global elites, selling this country out to China. As a career-long sports journalist, I can easily see China’s impact on American culture just by following the NBA. I’m frustrated by shifting gender roles. I’m bothered that biological men are being allowed to compete in women’s sports. I don’t like discrimination. The race of the victim is irrelevant to me. The fact that a white man pushes back against the discrimination he feels is directed at him does not surprise me. The New York Times published a series of stories – the 1619 Project – aimed at portraying white men and this country as the worst plague to hit earth. Should anyone be surprised a white men are fighting back?

Given the breakdown of American family structures, it’s also not surprising that a married father of four would decry the destruction of society. Christians believe the nuclear family is at the foundation of an orderly society.

And as for illegal immigration, I don’t have a black, brown, or white friend who is for it. Mass illegal immigration does make America poorer and dirtier. Carlson stated that on his show in 2018. The New York Times opened its three-part series on Carlson offering that statement as proof of Carlson’s runaway bigotry.



Tucker Carlson Tonight is popular because there are millions of Americans who believe there are powerful corporate, media, political, entertainment, and institutional forces working to redirect this nation away from its biblical founding.

The New York Times wants anyone uncomfortable with this new direction to believe it is their racism – not common sense – that’s making them uneasy.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-new-york-times-labels-tucker-carlson-racist-to-mask-its-secular-agenda,2022-05-02
Whitlock: NFL COVID policy turning quarterback Kirk Cousins into Muhammad Ali,"You don't have to agree with Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins' decision to remain unvaccinated against COVID-19, but you should respect his courage and conviction. It reminds me of Muhammad Ali.



Cousins spent a week in the NFL's COVID penalty box, the reserve/COVID-19 list. A Vikings backup quarterback, Kellen Mond, tested positive for COVID-19. Cousins came in close contact with Mond, and because Cousins is unvaccinated he was sent home and unable to practice with the team. The 32-year-old quarterback missed four practices.

""It was disappointing to miss practice,"" Cousins said Thursday when he was finally allowed to return to practice. ""In my entire college and pro career, I have not missed four practices. So to miss four practices in one week and not have COVID was frustrating, disappointing.""

Cousins told the media he remains committed to not taking the vaccine. He said he will follow the league's burdensome protocols for unvaccinated players. This pronouncement has put him in the corporate and social media crosshairs. He will likely remain a target of the vaxx mob throughout the season. Cousins signed a two-year, $66 million contract extension last year. The big paycheck puts a big target on Cousins' back.

There was a time when small segments of the mainstream media would rally around a public figure willing to defy the establishment and risk ridicule.



Muhammad Ali comes to mind. In fact, Cousins' noncompliance is analogous to Ali's bold stance to reject induction into the military. Ali stood on religious principle and common sense.

""I am a member of the black Muslims, and we don't go to no wars unless they're declared by Allah himself,"" Ali told Robert Lipsyte of the New York Times in 1967. ""I don't have no personal quarrel with those Vietcongs.""

Coincidentally, Ali never said ""no Vietcong ever called me n****r."" That's a Hollywood and corporate media fabrication. It was a popular phrase among anti-war protesters that was later attributed to Ali to give the declaration more weight and traction.

Ali was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title and banned from the sport for three years because of his draft refusal.

It's unlikely Cousins will face that level of backlash. However, he and other, healthy, in-their-prime professional athletes have no quarrel with those coronaviruses. No coronavirus ever called an NFL quarterback to a hospital bed. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has tested positive for it twice.

Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is trying to pressure Jackson into getting the vaccine. He issued a statement two days ago about Jackson's vaxx status.

""With the rules the NFL put down, I can't imagine a team wanting to forfeit a game or lose a chance at the playoffs and none of the players getting paid because someone won't get a vaccine.""

The criticism of Jackson will be muted. It's too high risk. He's black and we know corporate and social media fear criticizing black people. That's racist! Cousins doesn't have the right complexion for that connection. His critics are free to lambaste them however they please. Cousins' dad is apparently fair game.

The anti-Trump, pro-Colin Kaepernick Twitter feed Resist Programming spent much of Thursday attacking Don Cousins, Kirk's dad who is a minister at Discovery Church in Orlando, Florida. To his more than 1 million followers, former NBA player-turned-left wing Twitter troll Rex Chapman recirculated a video of Don Cousins complaining during a sermon that it's tough to hear the voice of God because of cancel culture and critical race theory in academia.

According to Twitter, Don Cousins' religious beliefs are a bad look for Kirk Cousins. You know, the same way Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X's religious beliefs were a bad look for Muhammad Ali.

This isn't about whether you believe in Ali's anti-war stance, or his religious convictions. This is about consistency of point of view. You can't pretend to love Muhammad Ali and hate Kirk Cousins. It's inconsistent.



I can hear my critics. ""Jason, it's inconsistent for you to respect Ali and ridicule Colin Kaepernick.""

No. It's not. Ali stood on his religious convictions. Whether I agree with everything the Nation of Islam believes is irrelevant to me respecting a man or woman for upholding their religious tenets. Kaepernick, as far as I know, stands on no religious principle. He's a Marxist tool, a communist sympathizer. Black Lives Matter is an atheist movement. Kaepernick's stance was far more opportunistic than principled. Ali actually believed in his actions.

So does Kirk Cousins. His father and Christianity taught Cousins not to be controlled by irrational fear. Fear is what is driving vaccination insanity. Cousins does not fit the profile of someone who could be harmed by COVID. It makes perfect sense for him to be reluctant to inject an experimental, non-FDA-approved drug into his healthy body.

The people pressuring him to do so are not concerned with Cousins' health or the health of Cousins' family. They're concerned about themselves, including Cousins' head coach Mike Zimmer. Zimmer wants things to be easier for the Vikings and himself.

The rest of the vaxx mob just wants Cousins and everyone else to take the same risk they have in taking the experimental jab. It's a cult applying pressure to nonbelievers.

I respect Cousins' decision to stand firm in his beliefs.

Whitlock: NFL owner Daniel Snyder crumbling beneath Washington’s house of cards,"Daniel Snyder bought the wrong NFL team in the wrong city. He practices the wrong politics for the political football he purchased 23 years ago.



The midterm elections won’t save Dan Snyder. That’s my prediction.

There’s a false hope among political conservatives that a Republican landslide in the November elections will halt the persecution of American citizens who refuse to disavow the populist movement powered by Donald Trump.

The midterms will slow the persecution in some areas of the country, but nothing will change in our nation’s capital. Washington, D.C., is a leftist stronghold filled with government-dependent citizens and devout progressives. The political winds blow one direction in the District. It’s a headwind for Snyder.

The city’s newspaper of record, the Washington Post, had been tearing into Snyder long before Jeff Bezos gutted it of any semblance of objectivity and fairness. Snyder spent the first two decades of his ownership fighting the newspaper over his football team’s former nickname (Redskins). With that battle won, the Post has moved on to casting Snyder as the Harvey Weinstein of professional sports.

According to corporate media, Snyder is racist and sexist. Snyder keeps trying to make peace with enemies who have no interest in a negotiated settlement. He changed the team’s name to the Commanders, installed his wife as CEO, hired a black team president, a black general manager, and a Latino head coach and filled the organization’s senior leadership with four women.

Snyder is the poster boy of the left’s diversity, inclusion, and equity agenda.

It’s not enough. It never is.

The House of Representatives launched an investigation into Washington’s toxic work environment. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, no friend of Snyder’s, testified before the House yesterday.

Rashida Tlaib, the representative from Detroit, bashed Goodell for not removing Snyder from NFL ownership.

Snyder bought the wrong football team in the wrong city. He can’t win. He’s playing a never-ending road game. He’s surrounded by political people using him to make a point to Jerry Jones and every other pro sports owner.

You want to know why the NFL climbed into bed with the BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia? Look at what’s happening to Daniel Snyder.

That’s not written to suggest that Snyder is innocent of the allegations brought against him. Snyder is a rich and powerful man. Wealth and power corrupt. But Snyder is no more or less rich, powerful, and corrupt than Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the old man who likes rub-and-tugs.

Rich and powerful people, which includes our politicians, would rather virtue-signal about integrity than attempt to clean up and control their immoral behavior.

You follow? NFL owners, coaches, top executives, and high-profile players are all rich and powerful. They’re mostly men. They’re weak and live in a society that baits weakness. From the boardroom to the playing field, it’s a league filled with Deshaun Watsons and the 2010 version of Ben Roethlisberger.

Weak men with excess cash and free time. An idle mind is the devil’s playpen. For athletes and the people running athletic leagues, it’s wiser to buy Alphabet Mafia life insurance than run around uninsured.

Snyder had no insurance. He’s a hard-core conservative with a franchise attached to an area completely controlled by progressives. It was just a matter of time before he had a major accident and his wrongthink politics put him in the crosshairs.

When they’re done with Snyder, Jerry Jones will be next. Jones will be more difficult to take down. He’s based in Texas. He has allies throughout the state. He’s not playing an away game.

What’s going on with Snyder reminds me of one of my favorite TV shows, “House of Cards.”

The Kevin Spacey-fronted political drama was Netflix’s version of HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” Both shows depicted the evil men and women do in pursuit of political power. ""Thrones"" camouflaged its intent, weaving its narrative in fantasy with fire-breathing dragons, ice creatures, and a fictional world. ""Cards"" was more direct and relatable. Spacey’s character, Frank Underwood, was a South Carolina senator willing to do anything to acquire the presidency. In season 1, Underwood murdered his mistress, a female reporter with too much ambition and too little street smarts.

Public allegations of Spacey’s predatory sexual nature ruined the final season and legacy of “House of Cards.” Netflix wrote Frank Underwood out of the script. And now it’s sort of taboo to discuss the greatness of ""Cards."" The show isn’t treated like the “Cosby Show.” You can still watch ""Cards"" on Netflix, though.

I might rewatch it again.



Frank Underwood would be impressed with the way Democrat and Republican politicians are using Daniel Snyder to distract from true evil and corruption. Prosecutors are seeking a 30-to-55-year prison sentence for Ghislaine Maxwell, the sex trafficker who set up rich and powerful men with underage girls.

Politicians and corporate media have no interest in seeing or disclosing her client list. This is information that could show the public which of our politicians are compromised, susceptible to blackmail, and secret supporters of legalizing pedophilia. Maxwell’s client list could reveal the power source of the BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.

Meanwhile, our politicians are pressuring the NFL to remove Daniel Snyder as an owner. It’s just another meaningless virtue signal.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-nfl-dan-snyder-washington,2022-06-23
Whitlock: NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson could be the next Kobe Bryant,"We live in an era without guiding principles and values. That’s the cost of a secular culture. Warring political factions randomly enforce a code of conduct based on polls, special interests, and the acquisition of power.



Starting tomorrow, with the beginning of the NFL’s crazy season of transactions and player movement, we will learn how our current ruling class plans to assess and/or use quarterback Deshaun Watson.

On the surface, it will be a difficult ruling. Watson spent the last 10 months under a cloud of negative suspicion. Nearly two dozen women accused him of sexual assault or sexual misconduct. In the past week, a grand jury declined to indict him on criminal charges. Watson spun the grand jury’s no bill as vindication of his innocence, tweeting:

“When you stand on TRUTH, the LORD will FREE you.”

Again, we live in a godless era. Watson is a professed believer. Somehow he foolishly believes God intervened on his behalf in a dispute revolving around Watson propositioning multiple Instagram models/massage therapists to provide him a happy ending.

Lawyers set Watson free. The truth is quite muddled as it relates to allegations leveled against Watson.

The bigger problem for Watson in the court of public opinion is that a decade ago, the NFL suspended Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for six games for two messy, public sexual assault allegations, even though he was never criminally indicted.

The ruling class demanded that commissioner Roger Goodell harshly punish Big Ben, who is white. Will they demand the same for Watson, who is black?

It seems unlikely. The spirit of the age dictates that, depending on their political affiliation, we hold black men and white men to far different standards.

Watson won’t be the next Ben Roethlisberger. Watson will be the next Kobe Bryant, the former NBA star who seemingly elevated his stardom by avoiding criminal prosecution resulting from a teenage woman accusing him of rape.

Like Watson, at the age of 25, with the bulk of his career still in front of him, Bryant faced a salacious rape allegation he deemed false. Much of the mainstream media celebrated Bryant’s ability to continue to play while the criminal prosecution loomed.

When the criminal case was dropped and the civil suit resolved, the media moved on and treated Bryant as a deity. Bryant’s tragic and untimely death in a helicopter crash further expanded his religious-like following. It is now far safer in American society to mock and criticize Jesus than Kobe Bryant.

The same fate could await Watson if he’s able to lead a team to the Super Bowl.

Within minutes of the grand jury’s no bill, influential NFL reporter Adam Schefter fired off a tweet announcing the news and insinuating the no bill equated to exoneration. The rest of the media immediately began speculating on which team might win the Watson sweepstakes.

The quarterback demanded a trade last off-season and sat out the 2021 season rather than play for the Houston Texans. The Carolina Panthers and the New Orleans Saints are reportedly leading the race to land Watson via trade.

Watson’s pariah status has disappeared.

Let me be clear. I don’t have a problem with Watson re-entering the league. I’m not bothered that a half-dozen NFL teams expressed an interest in signing him. I won’t be bothered if the NFL decides not to suspend him and considers the 2021 season as time served.

I believe in second, third, fourth, and fifth chances. America is the land of opportunity. I loved Michael Vick’s second career in the NFL after he served prison time for dog fighting. I argued that former Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy was worthy of football redemption after his domestic violence incident.

I was no fan of Kobe Bryant’s playing career, his Michael Jordan impersonation, or his treatment of Shaquille O’Neal and other teammates. But I certainly believed he had every right to play basketball while the allegations against him were being resolved. And I loved how Bryant represented and carried himself in retirement.

What I don't like are racial hypocrisy and double standards. What I don’t like is a society with no guiding principles or values. What I don’t like is the fact that we pick and choose who is worthy of derision based on skin color.

I don’t like racism – regardless of the color of the perpetrator or the victim.

Former Baylor football coach Art Briles is treated as a pariah because of a bogus narrative created by powerful people in need of a scapegoat for a campus-wide sexual assault problem at Baylor. The media accepted and sold that bogus narrative. Briles is white. He never assaulted anyone or was accused of assaulting anyone. But he’s been deemed unworthy of redemption.

That’s racist.

It’s also racist that modern American society will determine its level of outrage over the murder of black people based on the race of the murderer. Black people killing black people is no big deal. It’s inevitable and harmless. It’s like abortion. It’s a good thing. It’s liberating. It’s my murder, my choice.



But when a white person kills a black person, the world must come to a halt and the actions of the victim are rendered irrelevant.

It’s racism.

When a society rejects God, it rejects principles and values that lead to fairness, order, and harmony. In this world of disorder, Deshaun Watson will be a hero and a martyr.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-nfl-quarterback-deshaun-watson-could-be-the-next-kobe-bryant,2022-03-15
Whitlock: Only racists believe Tucker Carlson was wrong for playing political football with Ketanji Brown Jackson,"I scored a highly unimpressive 880 on the SAT. I graduated from Ball State University magna cum hungover with a 2.23 grade point average. In the spring and summer of 1990, every newspaper editor who read my cover letter and resume wrote back informing me that I was unqualified for full-time work.

One of my biggest regrets in life is how unserious I was about academics as a child. I loved football and socializing. I approached my education as a mash-up of the movies “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” “Animal House,” and “All the Right Moves.” My laissez-faire approach to study meant that I had to start my career as a journalist at the very bottom. After five years of college, I was extremely fortunate to land a part-time, $5-an-hour job at a small newspaper in southern Indiana.

My academic performance did not foreshadow my rise in sports journalism.

I mention all of this because blue-check media rushed to Twitter last night to call Fox News host Tucker Carlson racist for asking about the LSAT score of black Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.

I was Tucker’s first guest after the monologue. I’m not a huge proponent of judging the competence of seasoned, adult professionals on standardized tests taken two or three decades earlier. But Carlson’s snark did not remotely bother me. It did not strike me as racist.

It struck me as standard politics.

Politics is a game of Dick Butkus tackle football. Buckle up or stay on the sideline. President Joe Biden called a play for Brown Jackson to go over the middle. Carlson is a safety assigned the responsibility of bringing down and/or dislodging the football from political operatives who dare to catch the ball in the middle of the field.

Carlson is Ronnie Lott. Brown Jackson is a promising rookie receiver Carlson welcomed to the NFL with a hard hit. It wasn’t dirty. The dirty hits don’t come until the confirmation hearings.

Ask Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas. The Democrats hit Kavanaugh with allegations dating back to high school. They unearthed a woman who claimed the teenage Kavanaugh groped her inappropriately at a teenage party. They called it sexual assault. His defenders called it high school in the 1970s and 1980s. It was a dirty hit. No one called the attack racist.

Democrats blindsided Thomas with allegations of pubic hairs, Coke cans, and harassment. A black woman, Anita Hill, uncorked the very late hit. Thomas called it a high-tech lynching.

Kavanaugh and Thomas are conservatives. Conservatives, regardless of color, are allowed to play tackle football. Corporate media does not care how hard or late you hit a conservative.

But liberals – white and black – do not believe black liberals are capable of playing tackle football in the NFL of politics. Black liberals must be shielded from the hard and dirty hits commonplace in political football.

Bill and Hillary Clinton can withstand persistent rumors that they’ve collaborated in the murders of everyone from Jeffrey Epstein to Abraham Lincoln without claiming racial victimization. The Clintons are some of the hardest hitters in political football.

The people whining about Carlson’s LSAT remark and questions about President Barack Obama’s birth certificate do not know or comprehend America’s political history.

They’ve never heard the story of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, political rivals who dueled to the death. In 1804, Hamilton was a former treasury secretary and Burr was vice president. Things got so heated between the two that they agreed to duel with pistols. Burr shot and killed Hamilton. Authorities charged Burr with murder, but eventually dropped the charges.

Politics is a blood sport. It’s not a safe space. The fight for power is 100 times more dangerous than a UFC octagon or boxing ring.

If you’re not a history buff, then I suggest you watch the HBO TV show “Game of Thrones.” The point of the show is to illustrate what men and women will do in pursuit of power. There’s nothing we won’t do. To succeed his brother, Stannis Baratheon burned his young daughter to death on a stake.



Liberals believe black people are not man or woman enough for political football. It’s infuriating and insulting. Any attack on a black liberal is flagged for racism.

Tucker Carlson barely touched Ketanji Brown Jackson. She can wipe off the dirt and continue her journey to the Supreme Court. If she can’t handle questions about the test she took to qualify for law school, she’s not qualified for the high court.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-only-racists-believe-tucker-carlson-was-wrong-for-playing-political-football-with-ketanji-brown-jackson,2022-03-03
Whitlock: Richard Sherman’s criticism of Matt Stafford shows Sherman still plans to be left-wing Charles Barkley,"Yesterday, NFL star and Stanford grad Richard Sherman made great use of his black privilege.

Sherman announced his retirement from football and launched his TV broadcasting career by climbing on the back of Super Bowl-winning quarterback Matt Stafford.

Sherman took a massive dump on the idea of the Rams’ Super Bowl victory justifying Stafford’s candidacy for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A handful of broadcasters on ESPN and the NFL Network floated the idea of Stafford wearing a gold jacket. Sherman filed a strong objection over Twitter.

“The HOF bar is incredibly low now,” Sherman tweeted. “Like a participation trophy. No all decade team. No All pro. No MVP. 1 Pro Bowl. Not even MVP of the SB. Never considered the best in any year he played. At least M(att). Ryan has an MVP.”

Sherman went back and forth with people defending Stafford. He added: “All Pro is a measuring stick. All Decade is a measuring stick. Those show you were considered best at your position during the time you played. If you were not in that discussion you def shouldn’t be in HOF consideration.”

In a different tweet, Sherman said: “There’s no measuring stick that makes Stafford a hall of famer other than playing in the most passer happy decade in NFL history. Inflated numbers make ever(y) QB that starts 10+ years a hof.”

Every word of Sherman’s critique is 100 percent accurate. I agree with every single word. The Hall of Fame has lowered the standard for induction. Very good players are being enshrined alongside all-time greats. Stafford, at the moment, is not worthy of Hall of Fame consideration.

Sherman’s commentary is fair. It’s just extremely unusual coming from an active NFL player, especially a player as accomplished as Sherman. Stafford and Sherman are peers. They’re the same age. Their careers overlapped. There’s a fraternity among NFL players. They’re generally highly reluctant to criticize each other in a straightforward manner. Unless they’re in the process of transitioning to a second lucrative career.

Richard Sherman is done as a player. He finished the 2021 season on injured reserve for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs picked him up in October. He played his last game in mid-December. Since then, Sherman has focused on his podcast.

A week before the Super Bowl, on his podcast, Sherman began his attack on Stafford’s legacy. Those comments were mostly ignored. Sherman aired his Stafford critique on Twitter so that the media would notice, particularly media executives.

A few years ago, it was a foregone conclusion that Sherman would easily transition into a TV broadcasting career. That was before cameras caught Sherman terrorizing the home of his wife and in-laws in July 2021. Sherman wrestled with police. He was eventually arrested and charged with driving under the influence, endangering roadway workers, resisting arrest, and domestic-violence-related counts of malicious mischief and criminal trespass.

The incident raised questions about Sherman’s mental stability and undermined his prospects of landing a high-priced, cushy studio job.

Enter Matt Stafford. The Rams’ quarterback offered Sherman an ideal opportunity to remind television executives why they coveted his services before the domestic dispute. Sherman has been on the radar of TV networks since his 2014 NFC Championship postgame interview, when he shocked Fox Sports sideline reporter Erin Andrews with a boisterous attack on 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree.

“Don’t you ever talk about me!”

It’s arguably the most famous postgame interview in the history of sports. It established Sherman as the loudest mouth in football and football’s answer to Charles Barkley.

It was easy to imagine Sherman earning $5 to $10 million a year talking football. That’s quite the football golden parachute. Thanks to the domestic incident, things are much trickier for Sherman.

Enter Matt Stafford. The Rams’ quarterback offered Sherman the perfect opportunity to promote his podcast and tempt TV executives. Criticizing Stafford is low-risk. He’s white. His wife once criticized Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling and complained that Michigan’s mask mandates were authoritarian. Plus, at this moment, Stafford’s resume is unworthy of Hall of Fame consideration.

Richard Sherman can’t lose. Publicly ripping Stafford is a win-win-win situation for Sherman. It’s a good controversy. It overshadows his last controversy – the video of him trying to bulldoze his father-in-law’s front door. The criticism of Stafford demonstrates Sherman’s ability to state opinions that drive conversation on other platforms. Sherman’s handlers will take the stories written about the reaction to his Stafford comments and show them to media executives as proof that the media has moved beyond his domestic incident. It’s all forgotten.

Sherman’s next publicity stunt will be to take a strident political stance or accuse someone white of racism. Maybe he will offer strong words in support of Brian Flores and his discrimination lawsuit against the NFL.



Richard Sherman was supposed to be the left-wing Charles Barkley. He is in the process of rehabilitating his broadcasting career. Stafford is just a pawn in Sherman’s personal chess game.

Who knows? Tom Brady could be Sherman’s next chess move.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-richard-shermans-criticism-of-matt-stafford-shows-sherman-still-plans-to-be-left-wing-charles-barkley,2022-02-15
Whitlock: Rittenhouse trial demonstrates the folly of ‘racial justice’ and trolling white conservatives,"The slippery slope of televised ""racial justice"" started with us, black people, wrapping our arms around O.J. Simpson during a double murder trial 27 years ago. It did not matter to Simpson's supporters that the all-time great running back eschewed any semblance of racial loyalty or that Simpson likely committed the murders.

Duty called. Black people clung to the hem of Simpson's garment as if miracles would be derived from the agitation of white people incensed by the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

The slippery slope we boarded in 1994 has hit rock bottom in the Kyle Rittenhouse double murder trial. In our never-ending zeal to agitate white people, we have wrapped our arms around Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, two deceased white criminals.

Rosenbaum was a convicted pedophile. A decade ago, a grand jury in Arizona indicted him on 11 counts of child molestation involving five boys ranging in age from 9 to 11. The charges included anal rape. He copped a plea and was convicted of two of the 11 counts. He suffered bipolar disorder. He attempted suicide. He was released from a mental institution hours before confronting Rittenhouse, threatening to kill Rittenhouse, and trying to take Rittenhouse's AR-15 rifle.

Huber was a serial domestic abuser. He pled guilty to strangulation, suffocation, and false imprisonment. He had been charged with disorderly conduct and use of a dangerous weapon. In the moments before Rittenhouse shot him, Huber clubbed Rittenhouse with a skateboard.

Rosenbaum and Huber are the new O.J. Simpson. They are the stars of ""White Is the New Black,"" a docu-series airing on CNN, MSNBC, and across all social media platforms illustrating the utter lunacy of a ""racial justice"" agenda built around irritating conservative white people.

That's the point of racial justice. Irritating white people.

We, black people, are so confused, so misled, so lacking in strategy, leadership, integrity, and substance that we've reduced black progress to trolling white people. We replaced Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with ""Black Twitter.""

How does convicting Rittenhouse of murder for defending himself against the attack of psychotic criminals advance the cause of black people?

It doesn't. It's no different from the acquittal of O.J. Simpson. A handful of black comedians made money cracking O.J. jokes. Johnnie Cochran burnished his reputation as America's best trial lawyer. And black people got to giggle among themselves about how irate their co-workers were that O.J. walked.

But nothing changed for the betterment of black people. The biggest winners were the cable news channels. O.J. launched TV careers and networks. Fox News and MSNBC launched in the aftermath of the Simpson trial. Greta Van Susteren, Geraldo Rivera, Dan Abrams, David Gregory, Nancy Grace, Harvey Levin, Jeffrey Toobin, and Eliot Spitzer all rode the Trial of the Century to fame and fortune.

O.J. benefited the white people who were willing to go on TV and lie about what was happening inside the courtroom. The O.J. trial is the only trial I watched start to finish. Cochran and his dream team of attorneys destroyed the prosecution from voir dire to closing arguments. The TV experts pretended that prosecutors Marcia Clark and Chris Darden were holding their own.

The same thing is playing out in the Rittenhouse trial. Corporate media are pretending the prosecution is proving Rittenhouse is guilty of murder, and black people are foolishly anticipating a moment of frustrated-white-people satisfaction.

Black people are Charlie Brown kicking a football that white people keep pulling at the last second. The frustration of white people does not improve the lives of black people.

If we want to be taken seriously, we need a far more tangible goal. The current one is embarrassing and counterproductive. It makes black people look weak, illogical, and immoral. The current goal forces us to turn O.J. Simpson, George Floyd, Jacob Blake, Joseph Rosenbaum, and Anthony Huber into martyrs and heroes.

Racial Maddow, aka Joy Reid, shouted Rosenbaum's name on TV the other night like she was referring to Medgar Evars.

A Black Lives Matter clown from Portland, Oregon — Greg McKelvey — tweeted yesterday that employers should give their black employees a day or two off from work after the Rittenhouse verdict… regardless of the verdict. McKelvey says it's going to be hard for us to work and it isn't fair for our employers to expect us to.

The deaths of a white pedophile and a white domestic abuser have shaken black people to the point that we need time off work to recover? McKelvey is insane. He suffers racial dysphoria. He's half black and half white, born to a black dad and a white mom. He's married to a white woman. His children look whiter than Mike Pence in the dead of winter.

McKelvey is the worst kind of half-white liberal. He absolutely loves the white fruit, but his blue-check public persona is based on pretending to hate the white tree that produced it.

McKelvey is just another power-obsessed liberal using ""racial justice"" to seize power and fame. It's all a consequence of the slippery slope.

Yesterday, during closing arguments, assistant district attorney Thomas Binger put an exclamation point on the absurdity of the racial justice being sought in the Rittenhouse trial. Binger rationalized the violent and bizarre behavior of Rosenbaum on the night of the shooting, including excusing Rosenbaum's use of the N-word.



""Oh, and he said some bad words,"" Binger mocked. ""He said the N-word. Tsk, tsk, tsk.""

A pedophile who dropped the N-word is the newest racial justice martyr. Never thought I'd miss the days when O.J. Simpson was a hero.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-rittenhouse-trial-demonstrates-the-folly-of-racial-justice-and-trolling-white-conservatives,2021-11-16
Whitlock: Soccer star Megan Rapinoe benefits from ‘Alphabet Mafia’ triple-protection coverage,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe lives in the protected space created by social media's glorification of the BLM-LGBTQ+, the Alphabet Mafia.

Rapinoe is untouchable. She can't be criticized or questioned without fear of social media retribution. Her actions and motives are all assumed to be pure and driven by a purpose much greater than your own.

That's why most of the mainstream media summarily rejected and/or ignored Hope Solo's recent critique of Rapinoe. On Monday, Solo, a former member of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, claimed that Rapinoe subtly forced other soccer players to kneel during the national anthem. Solo said Rapinoe ""almost bullied"" her teammates to support Colin Kaepernick's kneeling publicity stunt.

""I think the kneeling thing can be very divisive,"" Solo said during a podcast interview. ""I've seen Megan Rapinoe almost bully players into kneeling because she really wants to stand up for something in her particular way.""



The purple-haired Rapinoe is a darling of corporate media. She's engaged to WNBA star Sue Bird. In the sports world, they are the ultimate power couple, a symbol of LGBTQ perfection.

Only a homophobe or a bigot would dare question the actions, motives, and agenda of Megan Rapinoe. So few people do. And certainly no one who aspires to work in corporate media would even consider taking Solo's allegation seriously. So few people did.

Instead, the immediate reaction was to point out that Solo was booted off the USWNT months before Kaepernick and Rapinoe began kneeling during the fall of 2016, the inference being that there was no way for Solo to know or see what Rapinoe did to win the support of her teammates. Yesterday, USA Today published a story hammering this point.

Yep. No way Solo has communicated with any of her former teammates over the last five years. Former teammates don't gossip and chat. I get that Solo said ""I've seen."" She's speaking loosely during an informal podcast interview. It's easy to misspeak or exaggerate in that setting.

Beyond that, anyone who has been following the Kaepernick controversy the last five years knows that many kneeling participants have been bullied. The threat has been clear: Kneel or be labeled racist.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was bullied into kneeling. Jones is an old billionaire. How much easier is it to bully a young athlete who lacks Jones' financial security? What percentage of NFL and NBA players do you think authentically believed in taking a knee during the national anthem?

The BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia stuck a gun to everyone's heads and made athletes offers they couldn't refuse. Everyone saw what happened to Saints quarterback Drew Brees when he offered tepid resistance. He was shot in the streets like Sonny Corleone in the original ""Godfather"" movie.

We've created a world where Alphabet Mafia members can't be questioned at all, but athletes such as Tim Tebow can be ridiculed with impunity. ESPN, the self-proclaimed ""Worldwide Leader in Sports,"" has spent the past decade analyzing and criticizing Tebow's motives and actions. The devout Christian knelt in prayer after big plays and touchdowns. He was the anti-Kaepernick long before Kaepernick became a polarizing figure and household name.

Tebow's cult of personality was much larger than his on-field performance warranted and a problem for his coaches to corral. His NFL career flamed out nearly a decade ago. This year, Tebow and his former college coach, Urban Meyer, resuscitated the Heisman Trophy winner's football career. At 34 years old, Tebow signed a deal to be a backup tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Both Tebow's and Meyer's motives were critiqued and questioned. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith accused Tebow and Meyer of exemplifying white privilege. Other broadcasters thought so little of Meyer's character that they claimed Meyer would give Tebow a regular-season roster spot whether he deserved it or not.

On Monday, Tebow was among the first players cut by the Jags and Meyer. Stephen A. Smith again claimed ""white privilege"" benefitted Tebow.

Would any of this be said about Megan Rapinoe? She's white.

If Tebow championed homosexuality, atheism, and Black Lives Matter, would any ESPN broadcasters have the courage to criticize him?

The U.S. women's soccer team turned in an embarrassing performance in the Tokyo Olympics, finishing in third place. It was supposed to be the Dream Team of women's soccer, arguably the most talented team ever assembled. Hope Solo strongly insinuated the team failed to win the gold medal because Rapinoe's agenda interfered with team chemistry.



""I think that's really hard being on the main stage right now with so many political issues for athletes,"" Solo said. ""There's a lot of pressure, and ultimately at the end of the day, our number one focus should and has always been to win first.""

Did the U.S. women lose because they were focused on politics rather than competition? It's a fair question. It makes sense. No country has spent more money on developing female soccer players than the United States.

Had the men's basketball team lost, the members would have been pilloried 24 hours a day, because they don't have the kind of triple Alphabet Mafia protection as Megan Rapinoe. She's female, gay, and pretends to worship Saint George Floyd.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-soccer-star-megan-rapinoe-benefits-from-alphabet-mafia-triple-protection-coverage,2021-08-18
Whitlock: The NFL’s COVID hypocrisy and French philosopher Voltaire enlighten us on how to combat unfairness,"Imagine being Cole Beasley, Kirk Cousins, Lamar Jackson, or any of the NFL players refusing to take the COVID vaccine, walking onto a football field this past weekend and seeing a packed stadium of mostly maskless fans.

How would you feel? What would you think?

You might think COVID-19 is something the NFL won't let impede its pursuit of success. You might think the league mirrors your belief that COVID, like other deadly viruses such as the flu, is something we all need to learn to live with and work around. You might see a larger lesson in the league's handling of the pandemic, an example that can be applied to all aspects of life, including the NFL's alleged fixation on racial justice.

The NFL established a restrictive set of protocols and potential fines for its unvaccinated players. Beasley and Cousins have been criticized across social media and on national media platforms for being selfish vax deniers. They're allegedly endangering their vaccinated teammates and jeopardizing the competitive edge and finances of their teams.

But on game days, 60,000 spectators will cram into a stadium and sweaty, hard-breathing football players will collide and wrestle with each for three solid hours. Every safety protocol is broken in deference to financial success.

That's what happened this weekend as a full slate of NFL exhibition contests played out on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The NFL canceled its maskerade on game day.



The whole thing was disconcerting. Every day we're told that COVID is an existential threat. Anyone who doesn't wear a mask is an irresponsible narcissist and a possible insurrectionist.

I'm someone who takes COVID seriously. As I wrote last week, my media sidekick, Uncle Jimmy, contracted the virus within the past week. He's been at home sick, battling a fever and several of the other complications related to the virus. Also, my own obesity makes me take the pandemic seriously. But I simply do not know what to believe about COVID safety.

This confusion is particularly true when it comes to professional sports. What's the agenda? Safety? Or vaccine propaganda?

Last year, we watched football and basketball players compete on the field and court while their mask-wearing coaches shouted instructions at them. The whole thing was stupid. Most coaches pulled down their masks when they had something important to say and really wanted to be heard. There was no consistency or legitimate purpose to what they were doing.

The government had clearly convinced our sports leagues to participate in a marketing campaign to promote mask-wearing. Live sports are the best vehicle to push a wide message. If millions of Americans see superstar quarterback Tom Brady wearing a mask on the sidelines of an NFL game, they will assume cloth over your mouth and nose slows a deadly virus.

It's not true, but modern society loves cosmetic theater and the appearance of effort. It's the equivalent of watching a quarterback take a knee during the national anthem, then justifying it by claiming, ""Well, he's starting a conversation about racism, and the conversation is the first step."" America and Americans have been talking about race and racism for 400 years. Colin Kaepernick did not start a conversation. He exploited the existing conversation.

COVID might be like a lot of potentially deadly viruses, including racism. The solution is likely in learning to live with it and taking the necessary preventive steps to stop it from harming you and your loved ones. Exercise, weight loss, a vitamin regimen, and an immune system-supporting diet are the equivalent of racism fighters such as education, self-reliance, nuclear families, and religious faith.

Last season, Tom Brady and other NFL players wore silly slogans and/or the names of resisting criminal suspects allegedly harmed by police misconduct on the backs of their helmets. Brady chose two words, ""End Racism.""

Maybe this season he'll choose ""End Colds"" or ""End the Flu"" or ""End Sin"" or ""End Smelly Farts.""

Human beings are flawed. All of us occasionally or consistently give in to our biases. It's not a good thing. However, anyone with an elementary understanding of world history knows racial bias will never end and that no country has done more to combat and subdue racism than America. Americans, black and white, sacrificed their blood seeking fairness and racial harmony. We've removed racist laws, enacted new legislation to redress racial sins, and created institutions to investigate, discourage, and punish instances of discrimination.

Unfortunately, unfairness is not going anywhere. Our human flaws make unfairness impossible to eradicate. Same as COVID.

The price of freedom directly correlates to the level of risk an individual or group is willing to tolerate.



During the age of enlightenment, Voltaire, the prolific French writer and philosopher, explained that ""perfect is the enemy of good"" and that the pursuit of perfection disrupts progress.

Have our idealistic standards and quest for perfection disrupted COVID and racial progress? Have they sparked a deadly division within the United States?

You don't need me to answer those questions. We haven't been this divided in 160 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-the-nfls-covid-hypocrisy-and-french-philosopher-voltaire-enlighten-us-on-how-to-combat-unfairness,2021-08-16
Whitlock: The war between fitness model Brittany Renner and NBA player P.J. Washington exemplifies the dangers of WMD: Women messaging directly,"For those of you who have followed my work for any length of time, you know I consider the HBO show ""The Wire"" television's bible. The crime drama depicting the relationship among Baltimore police, politicians, drug users, and drug dealers explains America.

I can pretty much analogize anything to ""The Wire."" Today, I'll use the show to explain Instagram fitness model Brittany Renner, NBA small forward P.J. Washington, NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson, and the dangers of social media addiction.

Renner, 29, and Washington, 22, are back in the celebrity-gossip news cycle. A few months ago, the pair had a baby. A few weeks ago, Renner and Washington split as a couple. Yesterday, internet gossip spread that Washington would be forced to pay Renner $200,000 a month in child support.

Social media memes ran wild with the news, joking that Renner had scored a supermax ""Thot"" contract from a naive professional athlete. An old video appeared of Renner saying the easiest way for a woman to score a huge payday was to get knocked up by a dumb jock. The Renner-Washington news and the countless memes provoked me to join the tweet onslaught. I tweeted:



""P.J. Washington caught in the real Trap House. But for the grace of God there go I. Four years ago, I used to spend 30 minutes a day looking at Brittany's IG.""

The tweet and admission formed the best kind of joke — humor laced with a kernel of truth and soaked in self-deprecation.

This leads me to my ""The Wire"" analogy. There are two problematic users in modern society — drug users and social media users. Both users chase the same dopamine high. In ""The Wire,"" the highest form of heroin was nicknamed ""WMD,"" a weapon of mass destruction. The same is true on social media corners. Women Messaging Directly is the best high.

When you see those three dots bubbling, you have the same excited anticipation the fictional junkie Bubbles had when he placed a needle deep inside a vein in his arm. You lie back and wait for the high. If she never hits send or the message is negative, you complain about the quality of the product and go buy dope on a different corner.

Brittany Renner is Proposition Joe. She is a weapon of mass destruction. Her dope is straight off the boat from the Greeks. It's uncut. Brittany buys for a dollar and sells for two.

The former Jackson State University soccer MVP started posting on Instagram eight or nine years ago under the name Bundle of Brittany. I can't remember when I discovered her. It was probably around the time she was dating Colin Kaepernick, back in 2014, before Kap turned woke. Back then, Kap was my favorite player. And good Lord, I loved looking at pictures of Brittany. I exaggerated when I said I spent 30 minutes every day perusing her IG page. But once a month I did.

I had an Instagram addiction. It was my Pornhub. At one point, I followed probably 75 IG models. Bundle of Brittany was my favorite.

I bring all this up because I actually have sympathy for P.J. Washington and, to a lesser degree, Deshaun Watson. If I were in my early 20s, super wealthy, single, famous, and attractive like them, I would likely be mainlining WMD.

It took 50 years of life experience for me to wean myself off my baby-got-back IG addiction. No way would I have conquered my addiction at 25. IG is heroin. It's an incredible delusion that cheapens all forms of human interaction. The sexual component makes IG more addictive and harmful than even Twitter.

Watson ruined his reputation and perhaps his career searching for rub-and-tug massage therapists on Instagram. A young kid with monopoly money could satiate his lust simply by reaching for his cell phone and direct-messaging the fitness model/massage therapist of his choice. It's too easy. It's too tempting.

Anything worth having should require some difficulty and discipline. Technology is removing difficulty and discipline from our lives. It's not improving our lives. Humans were meant to hunt and gather. We now Uber and DoorDash. I'm a symptom of an American reality. We're the most overweight place on earth.

Relative strangers create children after swiping right on Tinder or connecting over DMs.

Renner likely fished Washington out of her Instagram river. When Washington was a sophomore at the University of Kentucky, the then-27-year-old Renner started showing up at his basketball games decked out in Kentucky gear. She'd already been in relationships with or linked to former Jackson State quarterback Casey Therriault, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, NBA players James Harden, Jamal Murray, and Ben Simmons, entertainers Lil Uzi Vert, Drake, Trey Songz, Tyga, and Chris Brown.

She was considered a ""Thot,"" a new slang word for groupie. The letters stand for ""that ho over there."" She posed naked on the cover of her 2019 book, titled ""Judge This Cover."" She wrote explicitly about her illicit sexual lifestyle with high-profile men.

It's fair to blame Washington for allowing himself to get trapped by someone so open with her immorality.

But Washington is just a kid. How would we view this situation if a 27-year-old male porn star targeted a female sophomore in college?



I apologize for making excuses for Washington. I deeply apologize if this comes off like I'm excusing Watson. It's easy to point out Washington's and Watson's failures. I'm writing this so we can assess some of the other factors in play. The phony social media world baits all of us into phony casual relationships.

But for the grace of God, there go I.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-the-war-between-fitness-model-brittany-renner-and-nba-player-p-j-washington-exemplifies-the-dangers-of-wmd-women-messaging-directly,2021-08-12
Whitlock: Veneration of George Floyd is racist and must be stopped,"The deification of George Floyd harms black people and America.

The statues unveiled last week in Newark, New Jersey, and Brooklyn, New York, that memorialize the final nine minutes of George Floyd's life denigrate and diminish the reputation of black men.

George Floyd was a victim — of his drug addiction, self-destructive behavior, and Derek Chauvin's misconduct.

Floyd is not Jesus. He's not Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, or Medgar Evers, black men who died tragically in service of promoting racial fairness. Floyd isn't Crispus Attucks, the first man killed in America's Revolutionary War. Floyd isn't Emmett Till, an innocent victim of anti-black bigotry.

Floyd isn't any of the black men I know who are terrific fathers, husbands, providers, and protectors. Floyd isn't ""Uncle Jimmy,"" my media sidekick, whose primary job is father to his young sons, James and Jamill.

George Floyd is a prop corporate media uses for attention, a pawn liberal politicians use to push policy, and a punching bag social activists use as a symbol to explain black people and promote themselves.

A prop, a pawn, and a punching bag.



That is not the recipe for deification and statues. It's a recipe for the impugnment of the character, integrity, and reputation of black people.

The politicians, activists, celebrity influencers, and media personalities — the exploiters of George Floyd — are determined to transform an amateur porn star, violent criminal, and drug abuser into a national hero. They do so because they have no respect for black men or black people.

Yes, I'm talking about Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Shaun King, LeBron James, Don Lemon, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, Jemele Hill, Michael Eric Dyson, Al Sharpton, Joy Reid, Joe Scarborough, Chris Cuomo, Jack Dorsey, Colin Kaepernick, and the editors and writers at the New York Times, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, and the Daily Beast.

The entire satanic cabal of cultural elites, both white and black, are using George Floyd and other forms of racial division to overthrow a flawed system of governance that has outperformed any other system ever invented.

The orchestrated destruction of the American black man is an orchestrated attack on America's moral conscience. The retelling of the black American journey as a narrative of victimhood rather than victory is the central strategy in painting the American experiment as a failure in need of a Marxist overhaul.

America's global elites prefer China and the Communist Chinese Party. That's why we're erecting statues honoring George Floyd's last nine minutes of life. That's why President Biden suggested Floyd's death was more meaningful than Dr. Martin Luther King's.

Biden and the elitist revolutionaries want us to believe that America's system of government denies black people agency. We're defenseless punching bags for Trump supporters, Proud Boys, conservative evangelicals, rural militias, Republicans, and every other group that doesn't pledge allegiance to the Democratic Party.



In their reimagining of our history, we have no accomplishments more compelling than our suffering. Our story isn't about what we've done or will do. It's about what has happened to us. We're an American tragedy.

George Floyd is relevant only because of the actions of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. The new fixation on the ""Tulsa Massacre"" is a story about what happened to black people. The new Juneteenth national holiday is a story about what happened to black people.

No one who wants to promote a positive self-image and inspire young people to achieve would explain their journey the way black people are being coerced into explaining theirs.

It's offensive to build a statue celebrating a man whose most memorable accomplishment is having a policeman kneel on his neck and back for nine minutes. It's insane.

Let me use the story of LeBron James as an example. If LeBron wanted to inspire his own kids with a story about his basketball career, would he tell a story about what happened to him in the NBA Finals series against the Dallas Mavericks or what he did in the Finals series against the Golden State Warriors in 2016?

Would he paint himself as a panicked loser or a courageous champion?

How does the George Floyd statue paint black men? The statue in Newark has Floyd seated on a park bench wearing a ""wifebeater"" shirt. I'm shocked the sculptor didn't put a crack pipe in one hand and a 40-ounce of beer in the other.

The statues of Floyd need to be torn down immediately. They're racist.



They're designed to symbolize that America turns black men into lazy, criminal drug addicts. I reject that in the name of Frederick Douglass, Richard Allen, Booker T. Washington, Benjamin Banneker, George Washington Carver, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas, Colin Powell, Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, Ben Carson, Nat Turner, and so many more. I reject it on behalf of my father, my brother, and so many of my friends.

As black men, we must put a stop to politicians, activists, and corporate media using us for an agenda that doesn't serve us. And those of you who love this country must join us in putting a stop to this exploitation and bigotry.

Elites denigrate black men as a means to tear down America. Elites finance, platform, and promote black degeneracy in music, movies, social media, podcasting, police interaction, etc., as a means to destroy America.

Challenging the left's systemic racism is the duty of every God-loving, patriotic American.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-veneration-of-george-floyd-is-racist-and-must-be-stopped,2021-06-22
Whitlock: Weak men embolden Mina Kimes and Maria Taylor to play the victim and undermine honest debate,"Yesterday, Mina Kimes nailed herself to the same Twitter cross that transformed sideline Barbie Maria Taylor into a multimillionaire NBC broadcaster.



Kimes, an ESPN NFL expert, posted a disparaging email she received from an alleged sports fan questioning her qualifications to discuss male sports, particularly football.

“Mina, stop embarrassing yourself and pretending to actually know anything about male sports,” the email read. “The only reason you’re at ESPN is due to affirmative action. Jeff Saturday must privately feel so emasculated having to pretend to have an intellectual back and forth about professional football with someone wearing lipstick and high heels. Viewers see you as a bad joke that they’re forced into enduring.”

Kimes claimed she posted the email to enlighten female sports broadcasters about the nonstop harassment they will receive.

“I understand that ‘Don’t amplify’ argument, I really do,” she wrote on Twitter. “But I get asked by women every day whether it’s normal, and I want people to see: It never ends and it has absolutely nothing to do (with you).”

No. Here’s what Kimes understands: Using Twitter to play the victim is an easy route to advance your personal brand and leverage TV executives into promoting you into a position you don’t deserve.

It worked for Taylor. In September 2020, an inconsequential Chicago radio host tweeted criticism of Taylor’s style of dress. Taylor and her then-ESPN colleagues Jalen Rose and Jay Williams leaned into the criticism, hosting an on-air pity party for Taylor that included the presentation of a flower bouquet. Over the next year, Taylor pretended that co-worker Rachel Nichols’ private remarks about Taylor’s meteoric rise at ESPN were the near-equivalent of Emmett Till’s murder.

Taylor demanded a salary equal to Stephen A. Smith’s. When ESPN balked, Taylor bolted to NBC’s Sunday Night Football broadcast team. She’s overpaid and far out over her skis at NBC.

Kimes is laying the groundwork for TV networks to reward her victimhood. Yesterday, verified Twitter exploded with notes of sympathy and support for Kimes. Jeff Saturday and Dan Orlovsky, former NFL players turned ESPN football experts, played the same roles for Kimes that Jalen Rose and Jay Williams played for Maria Taylor. Saturday and Orlovsky stepped into Twitter phone booths and donned Superman capes.

Saturday claimed he frequently consults Kimes on the use of analytics in football. Orlovsky testified to Kimes’ general “brilliance.”

Kimes hit the Twitter/social justice jackpot. She increased her personal brand by pretending to take a courageous stand for women. She offered weak men the opportunity to improve their social media/social justice credit score. Her bait was irresistible.

The blind ambition, greed, and lack of integrity are obvious.

But this is larger than an individual woman using unethical measures to advance her career. Men and women do that equally. Kimes is no different from the male sports writers who dominated sports journalism in the 1990s and 2000s by writing Tuesdays-with-Morrie, perfect-quote hagiographies about every athlete and executive who gave them access. Kimes and Taylor are the Mitch Albom and Joe Posnanski of the 2020s.

Kimes and Taylor are exploiting a system primarily run by weak men with no respect for truth. The weak men running the system are the real problem. They have allowed the feminization of male spaces.

I don’t have a problem with Mina Kimes or Maria Taylor talking about male sports as long as they’re willing to abide by the pre-existing rules. Angry emails questioning the qualifications of the writer/broadcaster are the fair price of stating an opinion on a large platform.

As a columnist at the Ann Arbor News, the Kansas City Star, ESPN.com, and FoxSports.com, as a radio and TV host, I received an endless supply of angry, disparaging emails and letters that questioned my qualifications and aptitude. We used to publish some of them in the newspaper.

I wasn’t a victim. I was a voice that mattered.

Today, via Twitter and Instagram, I’m the constant target of malicious and threatening tweets and direct messages as a result of the opinions I state publicly. My voice still matters.

Mina Kimes isn’t special. She’s weak. She accepted the paycheck and the position but wants to be shielded from the price. Criticism, much of it mean-spirited, is the price men and women must be willing to pay to espouse opinions on large platforms.

The marketplace of ideas is a high-contact area. It has to remain that way if we want to seek uncomfortable truths. It’s a mistake to feminize debate. It compromises truth. We can’t treat the debate of ideas like it’s football and make rules to eliminate head trauma.

If you can’t shake off unfair personal attacks from strangers without nailing yourself to a cross, you’re not man or woman enough for the job.

Kimes isn’t woman enough for the position ESPN placed her in. She’s not qualified. ESPN is trying to pass her off as an NFL expert able to debate football at the same level as former players. That’s a space meant for former NFL players and coaches. Adam Schefter, ESPN’s top football newsbreaker, isn’t debating football with Marcus Spears, a former NFL player. Schefter provides information and leaves the football debates to players and coaches.

Weak men, in the name of diversity, put Kimes in position to fail. The consequence of the emasculation of debate includes the perversion of sports debate. It’s why so much time and energy are now wasted on analyzing fashion, dating lives, emotions, and social issues attached to sports.

Maria Taylor can talk for hours about how football players should feel about the death of Saint George Floyd. Taylor can offer a credible opinion on whether LeBron James likes Kyrie Irving. Should Tristan Thompson break up with Khloe Kardashian? Was Drew Brees racist for defending the national anthem? Is Colin Kaepernick a hero for kneeling?

Women can talk about all of this stuff. Some of it is interesting. But is it truthful? It can’t be when many of them spend every waking moment in fear of receiving angry emails or tweets.

As men, we’ve adopted the female standard that words break as many bones as sticks and stones. This is why so many male broadcasters on ESPN have resorted to crying on air for no good reason. Randy Moss, Ryan Clark, and Kirk Herbstreit.



Weak men turn incredibly phony, dishonest, and weak around women, particularly attractive women. We’ll do almost anything to please a woman. Lying and crying are easy.

Pretending that Mina Kimes is a football expert? We can do that all day and twice on Sundays.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-weak-men-embolden-mina-kimes-and-maria-taylor-to-play-the-victim-and-undermine-honest-debate,2022-01-04
Does George Soros have 'blood on his hands' when it comes to the rise in US killings? One award-winning filmmaker sure thinks so.,"Americans have been watching increasing violent crime devastate U.S. cities.

Observers have been trying to figure out what's going on, and many have landed on the fact that too many district attorneys are unwilling to enforce the law and that the left's agenda has led to policies for more ""fairness"" for criminals.

But who is pushing those policies and supporting those DAs?

If you guessed that one of those culprits is George Soros, you would be correct.

The usual political critics of the billionaire philanthropist on the right have long gone after Soros' efforts to push policies, groups, and politicians antithetical to historic U.S. sentiments, including the most infamous of these DAs, Los Angeles' George Gascon, and defund-the-police advocates like the Color Of Change PAC.

But now an award-winning filmmaker is calling out the left's favorite sugar daddy and accusing him of having ""blood on his hands"" for the increase in killings across the U.S.

In a piece for the New York Post headlined ""George Soros has blood on his hands for the rise in killings nationwide,"" Cuban-American video producer Robby Starbuck, who is running for U.S. Congress from Tennessee, went after Soros for funding DA candidates and pushing policies that effectively lead to the deaths of Americans.

""Over the past six years or so, Soros has poured tens of millions of dollars into the campaigns of DA candidates from coast to coast, achieving a remarkable degree of success by simply overwhelming all the other candidates,"" Starbuck wrote. ""Whereas normal DA candidates typically run on five-figure budgets, Soros-backed DA candidates routinely enjoy seven-figure war chests.""

""Just as President Barack Obama seized upon the notion of 'prosecutorial discretion' to grant de facto amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants after failing to get amnesty passed by Congress, Soros recognizes that local prosecutors can exercise the same discretion to selectively enforce laws,"" he added. ""Rather than spending tens of millions of dollars per state on numerous higher-profile races for state lawmakers, he can spend comparatively smaller amounts on DA races knowing that the outcome will determine how — and even whether — laws are enforced.""

""It’s part of the Hungarian-born investor’s push of progressive policies around the world through his Open Society Foundations.""

Starbuck included the list of Soros-backed leftist prosecutors:

Philly DA Larry Krasner, whose policies let Latif Williams, the accused killer of a Temple University student, out on the streets;

Chicago DA Kim Foxx, famous for her soft treatment of Jussie Smollett;

St. Louis circuit attorney Kim Gardner, who went after the McCloskeys for defending their home; and

San Fran DA Chesa Boudin, who once worked for Venezuela strongman Hugo Chavez — oh, and happens to be the child of Weather Underground terrorists.

""Once in office, these prosecutors implement policies that are tailor-made to increase crime and reduce public safety,"" Starbuck wrote. ""They eliminate or significantly lower bail requirements, making it easier for criminals to get back out on the streets after being arrested. They refuse to prosecute certain crimes, such as vagrancy, prostitution and public urination. In recent years, they’ve even used the COVID pandemic as an excuse to release convicted criminals from prison, many of whom have gone on to re-offend.""

Soros' other projects are just as harmful, the filmmaker said, leading to ""a surge in violent crime as criminals take advantage of indulgent prosecutors more interested in enforcing their peculiar conceptions of 'fairness' than enforcing the law or punishing those who victimize their fellow citizens.""

Soros-backed policies and DAs ""are cultivating a culture of lawlessness,"" Starbuck said.

The solution? The right needs to get behind people to challenge Soros' minions.

""Until conservatives start funding viable challengers to the Soros prosecutors, the crime wave that’s taking place in communities all over the country is going to keep getting worse, and many more people will needlessly die,"" Starbuck concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/george-soros-blood-on-his-hands,2021-12-03
'Joke with biological women as punchline': Swimming magazine editor calls out Lia Thomas' NCAA title for what it is,"The world saw Lia Thomas, the onetime male swimmer for the University of Pennsylvania who now identifies as a woman, take a NCAA swimming title Thursday. The ongoing Thomas saga has been a fight between trans-activists and their acolytes on one side and protectors of women's sports, rights, and advances on the other.

One of the leading voices in defense of women swimmers has been John Lohn, editor-in-chief of Swimming World. In a piece for the magazine Thursday night, Lohn — an on-record critic of how Thomas has perverted and harmed NCAA women's swimming — called out Thomas' victory in the 500-yard women's freestyle as nothing short of a ""joke.""

But this joke, which had women as the ""punchline,"" was ""hardly a laughing matter.""

""A joke was told in Atlanta on Thursday night,"" Lohn began. ""It wasn’t funny.""

Noting Thomas' win, Lohn continued, ""Most times, a national championship should be celebrated, the athlete commended for her hard work, dedication, and discipline.""

""Not this time,"" he added.

Instead of celebrating the trans-athlete's success in beating the competition over whom he had a clear biological-male advantage, Lohn said Thomas' win ""should be met with nothing less than a head shake, an eye roll or a shrug of the shoulders.""

""Why?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Because Lia Thomas’ victory is an insult to the biological women who raced against her. Against those who fought for Title IX and equal opportunities for female athletes. Against science, and the unmistakable physiological differences between the male and female sexes.""

Lohn's criticism wasn't just for Thomas' decision to swim against girls after years of a mediocre ""ho-hum"" career swimming against boys.

He also offered criticism for NCAA and what he has previously called its ""antiquated"" guidelines:

Because the NCAA only required one year of hormone-suppressant therapy for a transgender female to compete in women’s sports, Thomas was eligible to race for the Quakers. And, to be clear, Thomas has followed all rules. The problem is that the NCAA’s guidelines were based on outdated science and didn’t account for the advantages of Thomas undergoing male puberty and significant testosterone production. A 6-3 frame. Greater natural strength. Larger hands and feet. Enhanced lung capacity. None of these edges, for the record, can be fully mitigated.

""A transgender female competing against biological females is not a fair fight,"" Lohn continued.

The NCAA's refusal to follow USA Swimming's rules meant that Thomas' win ""was anything but honest.""

And it was clear to Lohn that the NCAA, the Ivy League, and UPenn were far more concerned about one person's preferences than 50% of the population's rights:

Thomas’ story became the most hotly debated topic in the sport, and a fractured environment emerged at Penn, as team members’ allegiances were split. Some supported Thomas and her desire to live her authentic life. Others viewed the issue from another angle, which noted that unfairness was the prevailing theme. When the Ivy League and Penn told swimmers to accept the situation, it was clear that one person’s rights were valued over hundreds of others. And when the NCAA made it clear it would not protect women’s rights, it was obvious the NCAA Championships would become a circus – a combination of protestors appearing and Thomas swimming with her male-puberty-supplied jet pack.

Naturally, the trans world has gone after Lohn and Swimming World for their take on the Thomas imbroglio, calling them transphobic.

Lohn wasn't surprised.

""That strategy seems to be a go-to tactic, thanks to its biting nature,"" he wrote. ""But this debate – once again for clarity – is about fairness, and everyone on the blocks having an equal pre-race chance. With Thomas, that has never been the case.""

The NCAA, Lohn said, should not only put an asterisk next to Thomas' win, but also should be ""remembered for turning its back on biological women and producing a competitive environment that was anything but legitimate.""

""[T]he Lia Thomas situation, spurred by the NCAA, has long been a joke — although not a laughing matter,"" Lohn concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/swimming-magazine-editor-lia-thomas-ncaa-title-joke,2022-03-18
WSJ to AOC: Put your money where your loud mouth is and run against Chuck Schumer,"New York socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D), like many of the nation's leftist progressives, has long lamented the ""undemocratic"" nature of the U.S. Senate.

These folks lament that states like Wyoming and Idaho have the same representation in the Senate as New York and California, but they repeatedly fail to understand that the purpose of the Senate is not to be a representation of the people but of the states. It's the House that represents the people.

Even the left's judicial nominees can't seem to get this straight — just look at Dale Ho, President Joe Biden's pick for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. He went to so far as to call the U.S. Senate not merely undemocratic but ""anti-democratic."" An interesting take from a guy looking to land a lifetime job in the third, co-equal branch of government that doesn't get voted on by the people — or the people's House.

But back to AOC.

After West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin sounded the death knell for Biden's Build Back Better boondoggle this year, AOC complained — erroneously — that it wasn't fair for Manchin's vote to have so much power since her congressional district has as at least as many people as the whole Mountain State. It doesn't, but AOC didn't let that stand in her way. She went on to call it a ""farce in terms of plain democracy.""

Then she blasted the institution of the Senate itself.

""It is unconscionable the way the Senate operates. It’s fundamentally undemocratic,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. ""What we really need to do is crack down on the Senate, which operates like an old boys’ club that has a couple of gals in it that have managed to break through.""

So the Journal's editorial board offered a suggestion to AOC in a Wednesday editorial: ""Run, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Run.""

""If that’s how she really feels, here’s an idea: Run against Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer next year,"" the paper urged. ""The New York City Congresswoman has played coy for a year on a potential Democratic primary run. Why not finally drop the pretense and have the courage of her loud convictions?""

The idea might cause fear in the hearts of normal Americans, the Journal noted, but how would anyone be able to tell there had been a change? AOC has been forcing Schumer's hand all along anyway:

Some might shudder at the prospect, but what difference would it make it this point? In January we wrote an editorial, “Schumer and His Shadow,” as the powerful Senator seemed to mimic every demand from AOC. He’s echoed her plan to forgive student loans and adopted more or less the entire progressive agenda. He supports blowing up the filibuster rule as does AOC. And he did it again Monday in calling for a Senate floor vote on Build Back Better as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez commanded.



She’s already the shadow Majority Leader, so she might as well try and make it official. If the Senate is so awful, run to win and clean it up.

The good news if AOC runs — for both Schumer and the country: Should Schumer win, no more AOC in Congress.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/wsj-to-aoc-run-against-chuck-schumer,2021-12-22
"Leftist prosecutors refuse to enforce abortion bans, setting up conflict with pro-life states","Dozens of locally elected prosecutors from all over the country, many from Democratic areas within red states, are refusing to enforce abortion restrictions that have now been legalized following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

After the court overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision Friday — permitting pro-life state legislatures to enact abortion restrictions — 90 elected prosecutors collectively representing more than 91.5 million people from 31 states and territories and the District of Columbia declared their intention to ignore pro-life laws restricting abortion, calling them ""a mockery of justice.""

""We stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions,"" the prosecutors said in a joint statement organized by Fair and Just Prosecution, a left-leaning legal nonprofit.



""As such, we decline to use our offices' resources to criminalize reproductive heath decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions,"" the statement reads.

The actions of these pro-abortion attorneys will escalate a growing conflict between liberal prosecutors who support abortion rights and pro-life state attorneys general and legislatures who, in accordance with the will of voters, enact restrictions on abortion.

Many of the prosecutors who signed on to the joint statement are from 12 states where abortion is now banned or likely to be banned, including Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and others. They argue that prosecutorial discretion permits them to prioritize other crimes instead of pursuing cases against abortion providers.

Pro-life advocates harshly criticized their position. James Bopp Jr., the general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee, said the prosecutors' statement was ""anti-democratic"" in a statement to CNN. His organization has published model legislation for pro-life lawmakers that would enable state attorneys general to take up abortion cases when local prosecutors refuse to do so.

""They were not elected to decide what the law was,"" Bopp told CNN. ""If they don't want to enforce these laws, then we'll have somebody else do it.""

Some state attorneys general already possess the power to override local prosecutors. Alabama and Arizona are two states, among others, where the attorney general holds the power to supersede local prosecutors for any reason, according to Emory Law Journal. They each have elected Republican attorneys general and have laws banning abortion that may take effect after the Supreme Court's decision.

Florida, Michigan, and several other states give broad powers to state officials to override local prosecutors when they deem it to be in the public interest, Politico reported.

Republicans have criticized the abuse of prosecutorial discretion by Democratic prosecutors.

""We have no doubt they are sincere in their pledge to not do their jobs,"" a spokeswoman for Georgia attorney general Chris Carr told the Center Square after local district attorneys said they would not enforce the state's heartbeat bill.

""It's a dereliction of duty for district attorneys and solicitors to pre-emptively pick and choose which laws they will enforce,"" Carr spokeswoman Kara Richardson said. ""It undermines the rule of law and erodes our system of self-governance.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657593491,2022-06-30
"124 retired generals and admirals say US in 'deep peril' under Biden, warn of his 'mental' condition","More than 120 retired generals and admirals have signed a letter saying that the U.S. is in ""deep peril"" under the leadership of President Joe Biden, specifically warning that the mental condition of the nation's oldest commander in chief ""cannot be ignored.""

What are the details?

The letter was released by Flag Officers 4 America, and was signed by 124 retired ""military officers entitled to carry a flag indicating their rank,"" The Daily Caller noted.

It begins, ""Our Nation is in deep peril. We are in a fight for our survival as a Constitutional Republic like no other time since our founding in 1776. The conflict is between supporters of Socialism and Marxism vs. supporters of Constitutional freedom and liberty.""

The retired military leaders went on to say that ""without fair and honest elections that accurately reflect the 'will of the people' our Constitutional Republic is lost,"" saying that ""aside from the election, the Current Administration has launched a full-blown assault on our Constitutional rights in a dictatorial manner, bypassing the Congress, with more than 50 Executive Orders quickly signed.""

At the end of a long list of bullet points citing ""additional national security issues and actions,"" Flag Officers 4 America wrote:

""The mental and physical condition of the Commander in Chief cannot be ignored. He must be able to quickly make accurate national security decisions involving life and limb anywhere, day or night. Recent Democrat leadership's inquiries about nuclear code procedures sends a dangerous national security signal to nuclear armed adversaries, raising the question about who is in charge. We must always have an unquestionable chain of command.""

The officials ended the letter with a call for action, urging ""all citizens to get involved now at the local, state and/or national level to elect political representatives who will act to Save America, our Constitutional Republic, and hold those currently in office accountable,"" concluding, ""The 'will of the people' must be heard and followed.""

What else?

Biden, 78, is the oldest American president to ever be elected, and he faced questions from opponents during both the Democratic primary and the general election over his mental fitness for office.

A White House spokesperson told People magazine Wednesday that Biden ""is planning to have a checkup later this year, and the results will be made public.""

The outlet noted that White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week that the administration ""will be transparent"" to reporters about the results of Biden's first physical when it happens.

People also reported that ""Biden similarly promised during the 2020 campaign to be 'totally transparent in terms of my health.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/124-retired-generals-and-admirals-say-us-in-deep-peril-under-biden-warn-of-his-mental-condition,2021-05-13
2 former Democrat public officials who pleaded guilty to vote-buying conspiracy sentenced to prison,"Two former Democratic public officials in Amite City, Louisiana, were sentenced on Tuesday to one year in prison for violating federal election laws after an investigation uncovered their involvement in a vote-buying scheme, the Department of Justice reported.



An investigation conducted by the FBI New Orleans Field Office found that former police chief Jerry Trabona, 73, and councilmember Kristian Hart, 50, who were both candidates in the 2016 primary and general elections, conspired with each other to pay individuals residing in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, to vote for them.

In July, Trabona and Hart pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit vote buying. Hart also pleaded guilty to three counts of paying and offering to pay voters.

At the time of the guilty pleas, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division stated, “The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that illegal voting, including vote buying, has no place in our nation’s electoral system.”

FBI New Orleans Field Office Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Williams Jr. said, “Today’s guilty plea sends a clear message that individuals like former Amite Chief of Police Jerry Trabona and current Amite City Councilmember Kris Hart, who engaged in voter fraud, will be held accountable.”

The duo also hired individuals to act as vote buyers responsible for identifying people who had not yet cast a ballot and offering them money for their vote. Trabona and Hart also covered transportation costs to bring the voters to polling places.

The public officials allegedly provided paid-for voters with sample ballots that contained the names of all the candidates the two supported.

A co-conspirator, 69-year-old Sidney Smith, used the money provided by Trabona and Hart to pay voters. For every bought voter, the vote buyers would allegedly receive $20.

Vote buyers were also asked to sign a contract guaranteeing they would not “make any overture of any kind to any voter or other person of financial award or benefit in exchange for a vote,” the Heritage Foundation reported.

Trabona, who served as the Amite City chief of police from 2005 to 2020, was also ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. According to the Heritage Foundation, Trabona also attempted to buy votes during his 2020 reelection in both the primary and general races.

On Wednesday, a co-conspirator in the vote-buying conspiracy was sentenced to four months in prison.

Two other men, Calvin Batiste and Louis Ruffino, previously pleaded guilty to their involvement in the scheme and are awaiting sentencing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2-former-democrat-public-officials-who-pleaded-guilty-to-vote-buying-conspiracy-sentenced-to-prison,2022-12-01
"7,000 NYC nurses go on strike over wages, staffing shortages","Early Monday, approximately 7,000 nurses from two New York City hospitals went on strike to voice their concerns about understaffing and salary expectations after overnight contract negotiations failed, WABC-TV reported.



As a result, the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan were forced to postpone nonemergency surgeries, divert ambulances to other medical clinics, and recruit temporary staff. Additionally, the hospitals enlisted the help of administrative staff with previous nursing experience to manage the shortage.

Contract negotiations were unsuccessful last night after the New York State Nurses Association and the hospitals could not agree regarding pay and the nurse-to-patient ratio.

""We are here to negotiate in good faith to make sure that the nurses have enough resources to care for the patients. It's not up to the nurses. It's up to the bosses to sit there and come up with a fair contract so our nurses could continue to care for our patients,"" said NYSNA President Nancy Hagans on Sunday.

""Our bosses created the understaffing classes by failing to hire and retain enough nurses out of facilities, leaving the rest of us to work short-staffed. Hospitals haven't done enough to keep nurses at the bedside,"" Hagans added.

Nurses in the picket lines say they plan to continue the walkout until an agreement that addresses their concerns is reached.

""We were heroes only two years ago,"" Mount Sinai nurse Warren Urquhart told the New York Post. ""We [were] on the front lines of the city when everything came to a stop.

Mount Sinai nurse Darla Joiner told the Post, ""I'm supposed to have six patients max. I have eight or nine regularly, and if I have to cover someone, [I have] 16 or 18. That's not good!""

""Safe staffing is the most important issue to all of us here today,"" Joiner added. ""It seems like after COVID, nurses weren't being hired. And the new ones that were hired had no clinical experience at all.""

A Mount Sinai Hospital spokesperson explained, ""Not only do they continue to demand additional wage increases, they also continue to make demands on staffing, though they responded to our offer to hire an additional 50 nurse positions by stating they would prefer those dollars to instead be reallocated to wages.""

A spokesperson for Montefiore Medical Center told the Post it was ""a sad day for New York City.""

""Despite Montefiore's offer of a 19.1% compounded wage increase — the same offer agreed to at the wealthiest of our peer institutions — and a commitment to create over 170 new nursing positions … NYSNA's leadership has decided to walk away from the bedsides of their patients,"" said the medical center.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/7000-nyc-nurses-go-on-strike-over-wages-staffing-shortages,2023-01-09
"'A First Amendment victory': Christian baker can refuse to make a cake for lesbian wedding, California court says","A Christian baker can refuse to make a cake for an event, such as a same-sex wedding, that conflicts with her religious beliefs, a California judge has determined.

In 2017, Cathy Miller — the owner of Tastries Bakery and Boutique in Bakersfield, California — was approached to bake a customized cake for an upcoming lesbian wedding. Because the event conflicted with Miller's Christian beliefs regarding the nature of marriage, she refused to lend her artistry to a customized cake. However, she did offer the couple, Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio, two alternatives: She could bake them a generic, pre-made cake that would not require her personal artistry, or she could recommend to them other bakeries which could accommodate their request.

Miller's attorneys at the Thomas More Society claim that after this ""polite refusal,"" Miller was then ""targeted by gay activists"" and sued for discrimination by the state Department of Fair Housing and Employment.

In multiple lawsuits, the DFHE argued that, by denying the lesbian couple a customized cake, Tastries and Cathy’s Creations Inc. had violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a California law passed in 1959 and since expanded to protect consumers against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or religion.

Paul Jonna, TMS special counsel and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP, noted that there is ""a certain irony ... that a law intended to protect individuals from religious discrimination was used to discriminate against Cathy for her religious beliefs.""

And, based on excerpts of cross-examination from the civil trial held in July, it appears that the state's attorneys did indeed ""discriminate against Cathy,"" probing her about the depth and sincerity of her Christian beliefs. According to a statement from TMS, attorney for the state Gregory Mann even asked Miller whether she adhered to Old Testament dietary laws ""in terms of not eating pigs, not eating shellfish, et cetera"" in an effort to cast doubt on Miller's testimony that she does her ""best"" to follow ""everything that the Bible says.""

Despite the state's best legal efforts, Judge Eric Bradshaw of the Superior Court of California in Kern County ruled in favor of Miller. The DFHE ""is barred by defendants' rights to Free Speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution from enforcing the Unruh Civil Rights Act to compel or prohibit defendants' speech,"" Bradshaw's ruling said in part.

TMS, which provided legal counsel to Miller pro bono, has celebrated the ruling as ""a First Amendment victory.""

""The freedom to practice one’s religion is enshrined in the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court has long upheld the freedom of artistic expression,"" said Charles LiMandri, special counsel at TMS and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP.

Miller has always insisted that she never meant to discriminate against anyone. She wanted only to run her business in accordance with the precepts of her religion. Back in 2017, she told news reporters, ""Here at Tastries, we love everyone. My husband and I are Christians, and we know that God created everyone, and He created everyone equal, so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups. There is just certain things that violate my conscience.""

The Associated Press reported that Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio expect the decision to be appealed.

"Abortion advocate says she will apply Dobbs ruling as federal judge, but Republicans aren't convinced","In her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 21, Julie Rikelman faced scrutiny from Republican senators over whether she would enforce the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs ruling. Although she answered in the affirmative, stating that she would follow it just as she would follow all Supreme Court precedents, not all were convinced. After all, Rikelman was the career abortion advocate who argued on behalf of the Jackson Women’s Health Organization in the case that resulted in Roe v. Wade's overturning.

President Joe Biden nominated Julie Rikelman on August 1, 2022, to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. If confirmed to this lifetime position, Rikelman would replace Judge Sandra Lea Lynch.

'Warrior for reproductive rights'

Rikelman, who served for nearly a decade as senior litigation director for the Center for Reproductive Rights (CPR), a pro-abortion advocacy organization, suggested in a December 2021 Salon interview that academic, financial, and professional gains enjoyed by women were made possible by abortion.

Claiming abortion to be a right, she indicated that one of her biggest goals was ""to make sure that the voices of women were heard at the court and were present in the courtroom ... to make sure that the impact of taking this right away, something the court hast [sic] never done, ... would be felt.""

Touted by her alma mater as a ""warrior for reproductive rights"" and ranked second on InStyle's 2022 list of ""The Badass 50,"" Rikelman was lead litigator for the plaintiff in the 2020 Supreme Court case June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, where the high court ruled in favor of her client, which had challenged a Louisiana state law placing hospital admission requirements on abortion clinic doctors.

After the decision, Rikelman told the Harvard Gazette that ""it's really important for people to remain vigilant, because we know that the opposition is relentless,"" arguing that laws like Louisiana's must be ""permanently blocked.""

Prior to the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs ruling, she recommended ""expanding access to abortion,"" stating that the ""status quo is not good enough"" and that she was committed to the ""battle against outright bans on abortion.""

Advocate or judge

On Wednesday, Rikelman claimed that she would ""apply Dobbs faithfully,"" separating her lifetime of abortion advocacy from her potential work as a federal judge.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) drew attention to a 2018 article penned by Rikelman, wherein she deemed pregnancy resource centers to be ""faux clinics."" Concerning those individuals from such centers who had previously testified before Congress, Hawley asked, ""Is your testimony here that these folks are lying under oath ... that these centers are all fake?""

Rikelman, who refused to speak to her own views on abortion, reiterated that she would keep her role as advocate and her prospective role as judge separate.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), similarly concerned with Rikelman's vocal opposition to pregnancy resource centers, asked whether she would recuse herself in cases where they are involved.

Rikelman answered, ""I will carefully look at the recusal statute and consider all of the circumstances of the case, consult with my chief judge, and do absolutely whatever the code of traditional conduct requires.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) pointed out that it may be difficult for Rikelman to disentangle a passion for abortion to which she has devoted her life from the duties of the post for which she was nominated. He stated that her support for full legalization of abortion, including in the ninth month of pregnancy, is well outside the mainstream.

Cruz cited Rikelman's nomination as part of a broader effort by President Joe Biden to ""fundamentally change our judiciary."" He said, ""Biden has decided with the complicity of Senate Democrats to abandon the notion of fair and impartial judges who apply the law and instead to fill the bench with partisan zealots.""

Cruz told Rikelman that her career embodies ""precisely this pattern,"" having spent the majority of her professional life as ""an extreme zealot advocating for abortion.""

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) referred to a statement made by Rikelman wherein she said the impact of Dobbs will be ""swift and severe,"" insisting that ""we are on the verge of what may be the biggest public health crisis we have ever seen in decades.""

""In a world in which more babies are being born and being born alive than being aborted, you call that a public health crisis?"" Lee asked, ahead of invoking the COVID-19 pandemic and AIDS epidemic as historic crises that might also have qualified for the top spot.

Rikelman responded by saying that her comments, which were made in an advocacy report, pertained to ""the implications of forcing women to give birth against their will, not about the implications for women who want to have a child.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) questioned Rikelman about her approach to violent crime, noting the relevance of her answers amid skyrocketing levels of murders ""not seen since the 1990s.""



Cotton suggested that much of the spike in violent crime can be attributed to ""left-wing pro-criminal policies"" like those Rikelman advocated for in her 2007 article in the Baylor Law Review, where she ""argued that it was unconstitutional for law enforcement to log DNA samples from convicted criminals."" In response to her answers, Cotton suggested that Rikelman misrepresented the article before the committee.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-advocate-dobbs-nominated-judge,2022-09-22
"Absentee ballot fraud, voter intimidation alleged as judge orders new Democratic election in Mississippi town","A Mississippi judge last week ordered a new election after allegations of absentee ballot fraud and voter intimidation surfaced in connection with a Democratic runoff last June for an alderman seat in Aberdeen, the Monroe Journal reported.

What are the details?

The final vote tally was 177 for Nicholas Holliday and 140 for Robert Devaull, the Journal reported.

Devaull challenged the election in court, and Judge Jeff Weill said 66 of 84 absentee ballots cast in the runoff were invalid and should never have been counted, WCBI-TV reported.

Weill also issued a bench warrant for notary Dallas Jones, who admitted during a hearing to violating notary duties, WCBI said.

Lydia Quarles, attorney for Devaull, told the station that ""when you have an absentee ballot, there's an envelope, and you vote, and then you fold the ballot up, and you put it in this envelope, then you lick the flap, and then you sign across the flap, and then the notary signs your election certificate, and she essentially testified that she didn't sign in front of anybody, she didn't see anybody sign ... she just notarized them, she just stamped them.""

What's more, Jones testified that she was called to the home of then-Alderwoman Lady Garth in June to correct her father's absentee ballot paperwork — and while there, Jones testified that she notarized ""about 30 something ballots,"" the station said.

Jones was arrested and charged with voter fraud, WTVA-TV reported. The judge set her bond at $500, the Journal said. WCBI reported that Jones has since been released.

The filing also stated that testimony from a second notary public, Lu Stephens, was not believable, the Journal said.

In addition, the judge found that 83 regular ballots were counted without being initialed by election workers — another violation, the station reported.

Weill also said there was clear evidence of voter intimidation and harassment at the polling place on Election Day, the station said. While state law says candidates and supporters must stay at least 150 feet away from polling places, Weill said in his ruling that Holliday — as well as Police Chief Henry Randle and former Mayor Maurice Howard — acted as if they were above the law, repeatedly violating criminal statutes, WCBI reported.

What did the candidates have to say?

Devaull hopes the judge's order for a new election will mean a fair contest for the Ward 1 seat, the station said.

""It was always a lot of distraction in Ward 1 ... I would like to see going forward that ... be cleaned up, people be able to come and go as they like, to vote, and vote for who they want to,"" Devaull told WCBI.

Aberdeen City Attorney Walter Zinn represented Holliday and said he and his client ""are left offended in part and befuddled by the ruling of the court. While we respect this legal process and the days of deliberation of each party, the findings of fact are grossly inconsistent with testimony of the witnesses and reflect more of the 'copied and pasted' sentiments of the Defendant than what the record from the proceedings would affirm,"" the station reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/absentee-ballot-fraud-voter-intimidation-alleged-as-judge-orders-new-democratic-election-in-mississippi-town,2021-03-05
‘Abused from the beginning’: Rand Paul calls for repeal of Espionage Act,"According to a search warrant that the FBI used to seize materials from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, the Justice Department is investigating the former president for potentially violating the Espionage Act.

The Espionage Act of 1917 has been used to prosecute the most notorious spies in U.S. history, including Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames, who are both serving life sentences for spying for Soviet and Russian intelligence services while they were working for the FBI and CIA.

The Espionage Act has long received criticism for its perceived over-aggressiveness — particularly towards journalists and whistleblowers. In an interview with Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting, journalist Chip Gibbons remarked that it was ""almost impossible, if not impossible, to mount a defense"" against charges under the Espionage Act.

Now, a sitting senator has called for repealing the Espionage Act altogether. In a tweet Saturday evening, Sen. Rand Paul stated, “The espionage act was abused from the beginning to jail dissenters of WWI. It is long past time to repeal this egregious affront to the 1st Amendment.”





The espionage act was abused from the beginning to jail dissenters of WWI. It is long past time to repeal this egregious affront to the 1st Amendment.



Repeal the Espionage Act – The Future of Freedom Foundation https://t.co/3KCgujpS9z

— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) August 13, 2022

Paul included a link to a 2019 article by Jacob Hornberger, a former Libertarian Party presidential candidate and founder of the Future of Freedom Foundation. The article called the Espionage Act a ""tyrannical law."" Hornberger wrote about appealing the Espionage Act in response to the criminal indictment of Julian Assange.



Paul initially opposed Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, and questioned several of Trump’s moves as President — in response to the U.S.’s April 2017 missile strike in Syria, Paul stated, ""While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked."" However, Paul also was a vocal supporter of President Trump against Trump’s loudest critics.

Paul was also one of the leading proponents of prosecuting Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information during her tenure as Secretary of State. In July 2016, Paul noted, “The FBI showed clearly that Clinton violated classified procedures and carelessly, recklessly endangered national security—and did so repeatedly, over 100 times.”

Paul has yet to formally introduce legislation repealing the Espionage Act. If he does propose such a bill, it is not expected to garner the votes necessary to pass Congress.

The provision of the Espionage Act for which Trump is under investigation carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abused-from-the-beginning-rand-paul-calls-for-repeal-of-espionage-act,2022-08-14
Oscars quickly unravel after best actor Will Smith rushes stage and slaps comedian Chris Rock in the face: 'Keep my wife’s name out your f***ing mouth!',"Actor Will Smith — who would go on to win best actor during Sunday night's 94th Academy Awards — slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during the evening show after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife's alopecia diagnosis.

Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, shared an emotionally charged video earlier this month detailing her struggle with alopecia — an autoimmune disorder that results in sporadic hair loss.

What happened during the show?

Rock, while presenting an Oscar for best documentary feature, joked about Pinkett Smith's condition, quipping that the star looked like she was gearing up to play in a nonexistent sequel to ""G.I. Jane"" — a film in which actress Demi Moore shaves her head bald.

""Jada, I love ya,"" he said. ""'G.I. Jane 2,' can't wait to see it.""

Following the joke, Smith could be seen making a beeline for the stage and slapping Rock across the face.

A stunned Rock simply stood there as Smith exited the stage.

After a moment, the comedian composed himself and said, ""Oh wow. Wow. Will Smith just smacked the s*** out of me.""

Smith, by this time in his seat, then screamed at Rock, ""Keep my wife's name out your f***ing mouth!""

Rock answered, ""Wow, dude! It was a 'G.I. Jane' joke!""

Smith fired back once more, ""Keep my wife's name out your f***ing mouth!""

Rock conceded and said, ""I'm going to, OK?""

(Content warning: Rough language):

Smith wins best actor — and addresses the slap in acceptance speech

Smith addressed the incident during his best actor acceptance speech for his role in ""King Richard,"" in which he portrayed Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena Williams.

The audience gave the emotional-looking Smith a standing ovation as he took the stage to accept his award.

He began his acceptance speech by saying, ""Oh man. Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world.""



""Making this film, I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who is one of the most strongest, most delicate people I’ve ever met,"" he continued. ""I got to protect Saniyya [Sidney] and Demi [Singleton], the two actresses that played Venus and Serena [Williams]. I'm being called on in my life to love people, and to protect people, and to be a river to my people.""

Smith added, ""Now I know that to do what we do, you gotta be able to take abuse, you gotta be able to have people talk crazy about you in this business, you’ve got to be able to have people disrespecting you. You’ve got to smile and pretend like that’s OK. But Richard Williams, and what I loved ... thank you, D. Denzel [Washington] said to me a few minutes ago, he said, 'At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you.'""

""It’s like, I want to be a vessel for love,"" an openly weeping Smith continued. ""I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena, I just hope they didn't see that on TV. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for trusting me with your story. That’s what I want to do — I want to be an ambassador for that kind of love and care and concern.""

Image source: Twitter video screeenshot

He then went on to issue an apology to the Academy and to his fellow nominees — notably excluding Rock from the moment.

""I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees,"" he said. ""This is a beautiful moment, and I'm not, I'm not crying for winning an award. It’s not about winning an award for me, it’s about being able to shine a light on all of the people. Tim and Trevor and Zach and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue, and the entire cast and crew of 'King Richard,' and Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. Love will make you do crazy things. To my mother, this moment is really complicated for me, but to my mother, she didn't want to come out; she had her knitting friends. She has a knitting crew that she’s in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother, my family, my wife, I’m taking up too much time.""

He concluded, ""Thank you for this honor, thank you for moment. I thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene [Williams] and the entire Williams family. Thank you, I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you.""

What else is there to know about this?

The Academy issued a statement in reference to Smith's on-stage antics later that evening.



The statement read, ""The Academy does not condone violence of any form. Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world.""

'The individual involved has declined to file a police report'

The Los Angeles Police Department also issued a statement on the matter, announcing that Rock had declined to press charges against Smith.

""LAPD investigative entities are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program. The incident involved one individual slapping another,"" the statement read. ""The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.""

A spotty history

During 2016's Academy Awards, Rock made another joke at the expense of Pinkett Smith, who at the time was boycotting the awards ceremony to protest what she said was a lack of racially and culturally diverse nominees.

""Jada got mad, said she’s not coming,"" Rock said at the time. ""Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties. I wasn’t invited. You get mad. It’s not fair that Will was this good and didn’t get nominated. It’s also not fair that Will was paid $20 million for ‘Wild Wild West.’""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/academy-awards-quickly-unravel-after-best-actor-will-smith-slaps-chris-rock-in-the-face-over-wife-joke-keep-my-wifes-name-out-your-f-ing-mouth,2022-03-28
ACLU faces friendly fire after defending Facebook and Instagram's decision to reinstate Trump,"The American Civil Liberties Union sustained heavy rhetorical fire on Wednesday after posting a tweet defending Meta's decision to reinstate former President Donald Trump to its Facebook and Instagram social media platforms.

""This is the right call,"" the nonprofit civil liberties advocacy organization tweeted Wednesday. ""Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country's leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech.""

The ACLU's statement is consistent with the stance the organization adopted on May 10, 2022, concerning Elon Musk's announcement of his intention to reinstate Trump to Twitter's platform. In that statement, ACLU executive director Anthony D. Romero said, ""You'd be hard-pressed to find a more steadfast opponent of Trump and his policies than the ACLU, but Elon Musk's decision to re-platform President Trump is the right call. When a handful of individuals possess so much power over the most important forums for political speech, they should exercise that power with restraint.""

In commentary on ACLU's website published just days after the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021, Romero called for President Trump's impeachment, saying, ""President Trump [when acting in his official capacity] doesn’t have unfettered free speech rights to subvert the results of a fair and free election.""

Trump responded to news of his pending reinstatement on Truth Social, suggesting his deplatforming had cost Meta ""billions"" and insisting no president should be subjected to a similar fate.

Retribution for ACLU's tweet praising Trump's reinstatement to social media giant Meta's platforms was relentless and swift. The attacks stemmed primarily from progressive figures, with praises emanating largely from conservatives and libertarians.

""Bad Feminist"" author Roxane Gay expressed surprise at the ACLU's stance, noting that former President Trump has access to alternative venues for self-expression (e.g., Trump's social media platform, Truth Social).

The Hollywood Reporter's editor at large, Kim Masters, indicated she may no longer donate to the organization.

Commentator Keith Olbermann added his voice to the backlash, suggesting the ACLU had mistaken government-related free speech suppression with private companies' rights to operate as they see fit.

Figures on the right-leaning side of the political spectrum praised the ACLU's stance, heralding it as a victory for First Amendment-related liberties. Responses ranged from mocking those decrying the ACLU's stance to more thoughtful support.

Republican activist Scott Presler's response was simple and direct. ""Excellent,"" he said.

National security expert and best-selling author Brigette Gabriel also expressed her agreement with ACLU's statement. ""Correct,"" she tweeted.

Meta's global affairs president, Nick Clegg, told Fox News ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier that former President Trump's reinstatement is conditional. If he were to violate the site's terms of service, he could face a second ban.

Activist Democratic lawyers suffer another setback in Florida,"A Florida appellate court has openly blasted a lower court ruling which attempted to instate a redistricting map favored by Democratic lawyers as as 'patently unlawful,' which raises the likelihood that the map favored by Governor Ron DeSantis (R) and the Republican Florida legislature will in fact be used in the November elections.

Democrats, led by controversial attorney Marc Elias, sued the state in April, alleging that the redrawn map violated the Florida Fair Districts standards, alleging that the newly-drawn congressional districts diminished minority voting power and also did not follow county, city, or geographic boundaries. The largest source of controversy concerned Florida's Congressional District 5, which has historically been a majority-black district.

DeSantis took particular aim at this district, calling it an impermissible racial gerrymander, and threatening to veto any plan passed by the legislature that continued to preserve its historic status.

The plaintiffs were initially successful, as Leon County Circuit Judge Layne Smith — who was appointed to the bench by DeSantis — not only issued a temporary injunction preventing the newly-drawn map from taking effect, but also attempting to order the state to implement one of the maps proposed by the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs' crowing was short-lived, as the 1st District Court of Appeal promptly issued a stay on the injunction last week in a brief order that did not explain their reasoning.

In a ruling release Friday, the appeals court broadsided the temporary injunction issued by Judge Smith as ""patently unlawful,"" taking particular aim at the trial court's decision to not only issue an injunction against the legislature's map, but to install a map favored by the plaintiffs.

""In the order, the circuit court even acknowledges that it is crafting a remedy for the appellees until there can be a trial. The grant of this provisional remedy, unmoored from an adjudication, was an unauthorized exercise of judicial discretion, making the temporary injunction unlawful on its face,"" the court said.



The plaintiffs have asked the Florida Supreme Court to lift the stay imposed by the appellate court, but the Supreme Court has not yet responded.

This is not the only recent loss suffered by activist Democratic lawyers in Florida. Earlier this month, the federal 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an order issued by district judge Mark Walker, an Obama appointee, which found that a new Florida law restricting the use of drop boxes and ballot-harvesting to be unconstitutional. The ruling means that the law, signed last year by governor DeSantis, will go into effect.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/activist-democratic-lawyers-suffer-another-setback-in-florida,2022-05-28
Activists demand boycott of Home Depot because company didn't strongly denounce Georgia voting law,"Activists in Georgia are demanding a new boycott of Home Depot, not over something the company said or did, but precisely because they believe the home improvement retail store did not disavow Georgia new election law with strong enough language.

What is the background?

Critics of Georgia's voting law — which has been the subject of rampant misinformation — claim the law makes voting more difficult. Supporters of the law, however, say the law was necessary to improve election integrity and have noted that many other states have enacted similar provisions.

With building pressure from activists, and such claims from President Joe Biden that the law is ""Jim Crow in the 21st century,"" many major corporations spoke out against the law, and Major League Baseball even moved its All-Star game from Georgia over growing pressure to address the law.

The Coca-Cola Company and Delta Air Lines — two companies whose headquarters are located in Atlanta — denounced the bill. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said his company ""does not support this legislation,"" citing claims that it makes voting more difficult, while Delta CEO Ed Bastian called the law ""unacceptable and does not match Delta's values.""

Home Depot also addressed the law, saying, ""We believe that all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We'll continue to work to ensure our associates, both in Georgia and across the country, have the information and resources to vote.""

What are activists saying?

According to the New York Times, a coalition of black faith leaders are demanding a boycott of Home Depot because they believe the company ""abdicated its responsibility as a good corporate citizen by not pushing back on the state's new voting law.""

Bishop Reginald Jackson, who leads all 534 African Methodist Episcopal churches in the Peach State, claimed Home Depot ""demonstrated an indifference, a lack of response to the call, not only from clergy, but a call from other groups to speak out in opposition to this legislation.""

""We don't believe this is simply a political matter,"" Jackson told the Times. ""This is a matter that deals with securing the future of this democracy, and the greatest right in this democracy is the right to vote.""

Rev. Timothy McDonald III, a pastor in Atlanta, added, ""This is not just a Georgia issue; we're talking about democracy in America that is under threat. We've got to use whatever leverage and power, spiritual fortitude that we have, including our dollars, to help people to understand that this is a national campaign.""

However, other activists who spoke with the Times said they could not support a boycott because such efforts impact working-class people.

Still, others suggested any impact to workers is acceptable collateral damage.

""It is unfortunate for those who will be impacted by this, but how many more million will be impacted if they don't have the right to vote?"" said Jamal Bryant, the senior pastor of a church in Lithonia. ""And so in weighing it out, we understand, tongue in cheek, that this is a necessary evil. But it has to happen in order for the good to happen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/activists-boycott-home-depot-georgia-voting-law,2021-04-20
"Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield rejects strict representation in acting roles, says it kills 'empathic imagination'","Actor Andrew Garfield rejected the idea that people should only portray people of their own demographics and explained that it kills ""empathic"" imagination.""

Garfield made the comments in an interview with The Telegraph when he was questioned about controversy over his portrayal of a gay character when he is straight.

""I think it's two different conversations getting conflated,"" Garfield replied.

""One is about equality of opportunity, and I'm completely in on that. Because we should want a world in which no matter your sexual orientation, your color or your heritage, everyone gets a fair whack,"" he explained.

""But the other is about empathic imagination, and if we only allow people to be cast as exactly who they are, it'll be the death of it,"" Garfield continued. ""So, the two separate conversations have to happen simultaneously. Because I'm not willing to support the death of empathic imagination. It's what we need most as a culture, and it's beautiful. It's the only thing that's going to save us right now.""

Garfield had previously addressed the controversy in 2017 by claiming that he was a gay man ""just without the physical act."" Many on the left were outraged at his comment and lashed out angrily on social media.

Among the actors who were criticized for casting outside of their demographic is Scarlett Johansson who was forced to drop a role portraying a transgender person in 2018. She was initially defiant against the uproar from the left but later apologized.

Still later, she lashed out at critics and said that it was not her job to play politics in her acting roles.

""Your job is to reflect our experience to ourselves; your job is to be a mirror for an audience, to be able to have an empathetic experience through art. That is what your job is,"" Johansson explained. ""The other stuff is not my job.""

Garfield is best known for his portrayal of Peter Parker in the wildly successful Spider-Man superhero franchise.

What are the details?

In a recent interview with The Independent, the two-time Academy Award-winning actor and his daughter, Dylan Penn, promoted their upcoming film ""Flag Day.""

During the interview, the 61-year-old actor said that he believes American males have become ""quite feminized.""

""I have these very strong women in my life who do not take masculinity as a sign of oppression toward them,"" he explained. ""There are a lot of, I think, cowardly genes that lead to people surrendering their jeans and putting on a skirt.""

What else is there to know about this?

Penn's remarks were an echo of these he made earlier in January.

""I am in the club that believes that men in American culture have become wildly feminized,"" he said at the time. ""I don't think that being a brute or having insensitivity or disrespect for women is anything to do with masculinity, or ever did. But I don't think that [in order] to be fair to women, we should become them.""

He added that gender roles are too challenged due to an ""absence of male behavior.""

Penn also hit out at social media, and said that he believes people are willing to compromise their true selves and stuff away their stances on important issues in order to be well-liked and roundly accepted.

“We give too much of a s*** about what we are going to be accused of by people who want to be self-righteous because they can get a quick reward,"" he said. ""And they’re self-righteous hypocritically – they damn this, but don’t worry about why kids are being bombed in Yemen, because it’s not getting them into a club right away.”

"Actress Evan Rachel Wood accuses musician-actor Marilyn Manson of underage grooming, 'horrific' abuse — and then more women come forward","Actress Evan Rachel Wood says that her ex-fiancé, musician and actor Marilyn Manson, ""horrifically abused"" and ""brainwashed"" her, even grooming her as a teenager.

Wood and Manson began dating in 2007 when she was 19 years old and he was 38.

What are the details?

Wood, 33, says that Manson — real name Brian Warner — carried out heinous acts of abuse on her during their relationship.

In a Monday morning Instagram post, Wood wrote, ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""

Her post continued, ""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

Indeed, in 2009, Manson told Spin magazine that he often ""fantasized about smashing [Wood's] skull in with a sledgehammer"" after they broke up at one point during the tumultuous affair.



Wood first spoke of experiencing partner abuse during a 2016 Rolling Stone interview. She did not announce the name of her alleged abuser at the time, saying only that she endured disturbing abuse.

In 2018, Wood testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee in support of the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights, saying that she personally experienced ""toxic mental, physical, and sexual abuse"" and more. She did not announce the name of her alleged abuse at that time, either.

Wood's latest allegations opened up a floodgate of other women who reported having been abused by the performer.

Some of the women report experiencing rape, torture, physical abuse, death threats, and more.

What other women are saying

According to a Monday Vanity Fair report, a bevy of other women have come forward with alleged experiences of their own.

In a since-deleted Instagram post, Ashley Walters, a woman who was seen in public with Manson in 2011, writes, ""I continue to suffer from PTSD and struggle with depression. I stayed in touch with quite a few people who went through their own traumas under his control. As we all struggled, as survivors do, to get on with our lives, I'd keep hearing stories disturbingly similar to our own experiences. It became clear the abuse he's caused; he continues to inflict on so many and I cannot stand by and let this happen to others. Brian Warner needs to be held accountable.""

Another woman, Sarah McNeilly, said that she, too, suffered from PTSD after her entanglement with Manson.

""I have been afraid to bring any spotlight upon myself as to avoid winding up in his crosshairs again,"" she admitted. ""As a result of the way he treated me, I suffer from mental health issues and PTSD that have affected my personal and professional relationships, self-worth, and personal goals. I believe he gets off on ruining people's lives. I stand in support of all that have and all will come forward. I want to see Brian held accountable for his evil.""

McNeilly said that she was initially lured in as Manson posed as ""the perfect boyfriend,"" ""claiming he was just misunderstood.""

""I was locked in rooms when I was 'bad,' sometimes forced to listen to him entertaining other women,"" she wrote. ""Kept away from certain friends or if I didn't he would threaten to come after them. I was told stories of others who tried to tell their story and their pets ended up dead. I wasn't allowed to go near other artists working on the same set, as he told me they had aids and were disgusting and if I did so he would be very upset and 'I wouldn't want that.'""

She later wrote, ""I was thrown up against a wall and he threatened to bash my face in with the baseball bat he was holding, for trying to get him to pick out a pair of pants prior to a music video.""

A woman named Gabriella added, ""It has taken me five years to speak out and say that I was in an abusive relationship. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and still suffer from nightmares. I blocked out a lot of the memories, but the feelings remain and manifest in different ways. The reason I'm finally sharing this traumatic experience is for my healing and because I'm done being silent. I don't believe it's fair for someone to not be held accountable for their horrific actions. I'm not a victim. I'm a survivor.""

She also insisted that the performer forced her to take drugs, made fun of her black heritage, and cut her while the two had sex.

A woman by the name of Ashley Lindsay Morgan wrote, ""I have night terrors, PTSD, anxiety, and mostly crippling OCD. I try to wash constantly to get him out or off of me. ... I am coming forward to he will finally stop,""

What else?

In 2011, a police report was issued against Manson for ""alleged sex crimes,"" according to Vanity Fair. He denied all accusations of wrongdoing through his attorney, the outlet reported, and later issued a statement in 2020 denying any such allegations by Wood.

""Unfortunately we live in a time where people believe what they read on the internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence,"" a spokesperson for the performer said at the time. ""The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non-fact-based information is wholly irresponsible.""

In November, Loudwire asked Manson to respond to reports of abuse.

In a lengthy statement, a spokesperson for the entertainer said:

Personal testimony is just that, and we think it's inappropriate to comment on that.



You then go on to talk about Manson being accused of ""terrible things"" by unnamed ""critics"" but offer no guidance on who these critics are and what these things are, so it's not possible to comment.



You then mention Mickey Rourke. It is my understanding that Evan Rachel Wood dated multiple people around the time she was dating Manson. Basic internet research will give you a host of other names that have not come up in any of our discussions.



Your next couple of points deal with comments Manson made in Spin magazine in 2009. Your confusion around the timeline of this is extremely worrying. The comments in Spin where Manson had a fantasy of using a sledgehammer on Evan and he cut himself 158 times was obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account. The fact that Evan and Manson got engaged six months after this interview would indicate that no one took this story literally.



You go on to talk about Manson commenting on sexual harassment, Me Too and specifically the experiences of his ex partner Rose McGowan. These are all issues that Manson has publicly addressed and are available online. Please see Channel 4 interview from 15th December 2017.



Manson has never shied away from public comment – equally he does not have to make the same comment twice.



There will be no further comment on specific songs. Your journalist had the opportunity to ask Manson about his music – one of only two interviews granted in the UK – and he chose not to. Trying to weave one section of one song from an artist with a 30 plus year career to fit a narrative is both disingenuous and troublesome.

You mention Manson's ex fiancée Rose McGowan in your questions. Rose is one of the bravest and most outspoken figureheads of the Me Too movement. Manson remains friends with McGowan and she talks very fondly of their three a half years together. There are multiple sources worldwide. I link to a Washington Post article on McGowan's memoir 'Brave' (2018).



You fail to mention Manson's ex-wife Dita Von Teese, who remains good friends with Manson. Quoting from a Female First article published in 2018, 'Dita admits she has been “lucky"" to avoid any abusive episodes in the entertainment industry in her career'.



There are also numerous articles over multiple years where Evan Rachel Wood speaks very positively about her relationship with Manson. In NetAPorters.com's The Edit (2015): “I wouldn't trade any of [our relationship],"" Wood told the mag. “I appreciate everything he taught me. I just don't think we were right for each other.""



Finally you talk about death threats. Manson knows all about those – he has had many. He has spent his career being blamed for everything from Columbine to teenage suicide. Unfortunately, we live in a time where people believe what they read on the Internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence. The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible. All we can try and do, as the media and individuals, is to use facts and truth and not hide behind gossip and conjecture to further our own agendas.

A spokesperson for Manson did not respond to TheBlaze's request for comment in time for publication.

"Kinzinger, no-fly zone, Ukraine","As brave Ukrainian citizens battle invading Russian forces, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is calling for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace.

Kinzinger described the situation in dramatic fashion: ""The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west. Declare a #NoFlyZone over Ukraine at the invitation of their sovereign govt. Disrupt Russias air ops to give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight. It’s now, or later,"" he tweeted.

""History teaches that taking a stand is inevitable and gets more costly with time. We own the skies, Russia cannot hold a candle to our Air power. Do this. Putin is too dangerous to hope he is satisfied with 'just Ukraine,'"" he added.

Some people on social media pushed back against the idea.

""This psycho -- held up as some Profile in Courage by establishment liberals who still wake up every morning distraught about January 6 -- is now demanding direct US military hostilities with Russia, which Putin said would precipitate nuclear war. So that's where we're at,"" one person wrote in response to Kinzinger.



Kinzinger fired back, ""Putin threatening nukes is a good reminder that Putin must be stopped. <side note Putin will NOT use nukes over a no-fly zone>. The legit govt of Ukraine has a right to defend their skies with help. Full stop.""

The congressman, who is not seeking reelection, was recently chastised by the Republican National Committee, which passed a resolution censuring him and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.



The two lawmakers, who have both been vocal critics of former President Donald Trump, were among the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump last year in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

Alliance Defending Freedom slams Gov. Kristi Noem for vetoing girls' and women's sports bill,"Supporters of South Dakota's Fairness in Women's Sports bill are accusing Republican Gov. Kristi Noem of ""betrayal"" and ""pandering to special interests"" after she vetoed the legislation, sending it back to the state legislature with recommended changes.

The legislation, H.B. 1217, would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex. So, for example, a boy who identifies as female and takes hormones to affirm his gender identity would be prohibited from playing on girls' sports teams or competing against girls.

Republican majorities in the state legislature sent the bill to Noem's desk for her signature, and although at first she said she was ""excited"" to sign it, on Friday Noem issued a ""style and form"" veto, sending it back to lawmakers.

In a statement, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a non-profit legal group that supports social conservative causes, blasted the governor's decision.

""Gov. Noem had an opportunity to protect women and girls by signing the Fairness in Women's Sports bill, but instead she pandered to the demands of special interests,"" Alliance Defending Freedom General Counsel Kristen Waggoner said. ""In what was an abuse of her 'style and form' veto power, she gutted protections for collegiate athletes and took away legal recourse for girls forced to compete against biological boys.""

The South Dakota state constitution empowers the governor to send bills ""with errors in style or form"" back to the legislature with specific recommendations for change.

In a letter to lawmakers, Noem stated her belief that ""boys should play boys' sports, and girls should play girls' sports,"" but said she was ""concerned that this bill's vague and overly broad language could have significant unintended consequences.""

Among her concerns is that the bill is ""unrealistic in the context of collegiate athletics."" Both the NCAA and the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce reportedly lobbied Noem against the bill. The NCAA objected to policies it views as discriminatory against transgender athletes, and the Chamber of Commerce was concerned that the state could lose millions of dollars of business revenue if South Dakota colleges and universities lose NCAA accreditation and tournament games are no longer held in the state.

""Competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics,"" Noem wrote to lawmakers.

""The proposed revisions limit House Bill 1217 to elementary and secondary school athletics, which are primarily conducted among South Dakota schools and at the high school level are governed by the South Dakota High School Activities Association, a creature of South Dakota law. The proposed revisions will also remedy the vague language regarding civil liability and the use of performance-enhancing drugs,"" she said.

Republican sponsors of the bill said Noem's proposed changes would significantly weaken the legislation and be morally inconsistent.

""The recommended changes will substantially change the content of the bill. The legality was removed, which leaves the bill with a very weak authority. Removing the collegiate is simply saying that biology matters in high school, but not in college,"" Republican state Sen. Maggie Sutton, the bill's lead sponsor in the state senate said.



Republican state Rep. Rhonda Milstead, H.B. 1217's sponsor in the House, accused the governor of violating the state constitution with her veto.

The state constitution says: ""Bills with errors in style or form may be returned to the Legislature by the Governor with specific recommendations for change."" Milstead argues the proposed changes go beyond ""style"" or ""form"" to be tantamount to legislation from the executive branch.

""It is overreaching by trying to legislate law as the executive branch,"" Milstead said.

Noem's explanation was also received poorly by the Alliance Defending Freedom.

""We are shocked that a governor who claims to be a firebrand conservative with a rising national profile would cave to 'woke' corporate ideology,"" Waggoner said.

She continued: ""The governor tried to explain her betrayal with claims that her hands were tied by NCAA policy. But there is no NCAA policy that requires schools to allow males to compete on women's teams as Gov. Noem suggests. The governor also vetoed the part of the bill that gives girls any legal recourse against unfair policies that arise. What's left is mere lip service for women and girls forced to compete against biological males.""

"Three Air Force Academy cadets who refused COVID-19 vaccine won't be commissioned, will receive bachelor's degrees instead, may need to repay gov't for education","Three U.S. Air Force Academy cadets who refused the COVID-19 vaccine won't be commissioned as officers and will graduate with bachelor’s degrees instead, the academy told the Associated Press.

A fourth cadet who also refused the vaccine but changed his mind about a week ago will graduate and become an Air Force officer, Academy spokesman Dean Miller added to the AP.

What else?

Miller also said the three cadets ""will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated,"" the outlet reported, adding that the secretary of the Air Force will decide if the trio will owe the government for the costs of their educations in lieu of service.

The Air Force Academy as of Saturday is the only U.S. military academy not commissioning cadets who refuse the vaccine, the AP said, adding that all of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at West Point graduated and were commissioned as officers Saturday — and all were vaccinated. The Naval Academy said Saturday that no Navy or Marine Corps seniors are being denied commissions over vaccine refusals, the outlet said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation Wednesday in Colorado, last year made COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members — including those at military academies — saying the shots are critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force, the AP said.

But members of Congress, the military, and the public have questioned whether the military's exemption reviews have been fair, the outlet said, adding that multiple lawsuits have been filed against the mandate, mainly in regard to how few service members have been granted religious exemptions.

Lt. Col. Brian Maguire — an Air Force Academy spokesman — said a week ago all four cadets met with the academy’s superintendent, were told about potential consequences, and had time before graduation to change their minds, the AP reported.

The military academies for years often have required students to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior years, the outlet said, adding that many such cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems — and the cost can be as much as $200,000 or more.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/air-force-cadets-no-vaccines,2022-05-23
Air marshals tasked with 'making sandwiches' for illegal aliens at southern border despite looming threat of jihadist terrorism,"The Biden administration has tasked federal air marshals with babysitting criminal noncitizens who have stolen into the country, even though neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the White House is willing to declare the border crisis an emergency.

This mandated work may appear even more intolerable for the highly trained agents since there is now cause to suspect that Islamic terrorists are once again scheming to attack American citizens.

An old foe with the same M.O.

Despite getting roundly whipped by American forces since the September 11 attacks, elements of al Qaeda have nevertheless managed to slither into the new year.



This week, al Qaeda affiliates claimed responsibility for two simultaneous attacks in southeastern Mali, reported Africanews. The Malian Ministry of Security and Civil Protection noted Tuesday that two firemen and three civilians were murdered in one of the attacks.

Al Qaeda also vowed in the latest issue of its magazine Ghazwa-e-Hind to demolish the Ram temple being built in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, in order to replace it with a mosque.

The international jihadist group may also have new deadly designs closer to home.

Judicial Watch has obtained a document from high-level DHS sources indicating that ""Al-Qaeda says upcoming attacks on US, possibly involving planes, will use new techniques and tactics.""

Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned in September 2021 that it would take between one and two years for the terror organization, rebuilding in Afghanistan, to have ""some capability to at least threaten the homeland.""

Biden administration juggling crises it won't name

Such an attack may exploit the Biden administration's monthly assignment of 150-250 air marshals to the southern border to tackle ""a surge in irregular migration"" — a surge atop an already unprecedented wave of criminal noncitizens into the nation under President Joe Biden's watch.

Air marshals are normally tasked with securing the nation's transportation system and protecting the flying public under the supervision of the DHS' Transportation Security Administration.

Air Marshal National Council executive director Sonya LaBosco explained to Judicial Watch on Jan. 1 that the Biden administration now has tasked highly trained marshals with ""making sandwiches for [illegal aliens] and driving them around like Uber or picking up supplies.""

Fox News Digital reported that mid-2021, the Federal Air Marshal Service asked for volunteers to head down to the southern border for 30-day stints. However, in late October, the Biden administration made such tours to the border mandatory.

These mandatory deployments reportedly leave just one in 100 American flights protected by a marshal.

David Londo, president of the Air Marshal National Council, told the Washington Examiner that normally, 8% of U.S. commercial flights typically have marshals keeping watch. The Federal Air Marshal Service has roughly 3,000 marshals in its employ.

The National Association of Police Organizations questioned the DHS' decision, stating, ""We strongly question the decision by the Department of Homeland Security to divert much-needed aviation security to the southern border especially as we enter the busiest travel season of the year, particularly as a Federal emergency has not been declared at the border.""

House Republicans criticized the DHS for the move, stating that ""redirecting these Air Marshals away from their critical law enforcement functions in our nation’s skies, creating a massive risk to public safety.""

The Air Marshal National Council similarly criticized the move, filing a formal complaint accusing Federal Air Marshal Service Director Tirrell Stevenson and TSA administrator David Pekoske ""of fraud, waste, and abuse of authority and violations of federal law.""

The council noted that the TSA administrator does not have ""any authority to deploy TSA or FAM employees to the southern border to perform non-transportation-security-related matters.""

The exception that still has not been met, said the complaint, is if an emergency has been declared by the DHS secretary, which has yet to take place.

Backlash

Londo, who has warned that marshals are growing increasingly willing to risk termination over the mandated border service, recently penned a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Stevenson, and Pekoske, once again expressing concern about the misuse of the marshals in light of the more pressing need to protect America from the Islamist threat.

Londo wrote, ""As you are aware currently hundreds of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) are deployed to the southern border to preform [sic] humanitarian work to include warming up sandwiches for migrants.""

The council director previously characterized these mandated tasks as ""non-law enforcement civilian humanitarian duties.""

""We have been informed that these deployments are indefinite, in other words no end in sight for sending hundreds of FAMs to the southern border,"" he noted.

Citing the news of al Qaeda activity potentially targeting American aircraft, Londo underscored that ""deploying FAMs to the southern border to perform humanitarian work is reckless and putting [our] Nation and the people we serve at extreme risk.""

The council president noted that DHS Secretary Mayorkas had testified under oath before Congress that the border was secure and that the White House has not yet declared the crisis it facilitated at the border an emergency, intimating marshals were being wasted on a problem the Biden administration still refuses to properly acknowledge.

Londo concluded the letter by writing, ""We have to ask how can you justify sending FAMs to the border in huge numbers, when the border is in your words secure, and there is no emergency? Yet we have major security incidents happening right now affecting our aviation security.""

LaBosco, who signed both the letter and the complaint, told ""Fox & Friends First,"" ""We don't understand why these decisions are being made. The intel is clear. Al Qaeda is watching for our weak areas. Our aviation is a high-risk area. We're not protecting our aviation domain, and we're going to the border. It is absolutely madness.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/air-marshals-tasked-with-making-sandwiches-for-illegal-aliens-at-southern-border-despite-looming-threat-of-jihadist-terrorism,2023-01-06
Judge allows Alan Dershowitz's $300 million lawsuit against CNN to proceed: 'I think CNN is quaking in its boots!',"Famed civil liberties attorney Alan Dershowitz won a procedural victory in court Tuesday that will allow his $300 million lawsuit against CNN to proceed to depositions.

Attorneys for CNN filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in November but a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida did not agree with their argument and said Dershowitz can proceed.

The lawsuit claims that CNN unfairly edited comments from Dershowitz about whether former President Donald Trump could have been impeached if he committed an illegal act that he believed was in the public interest.

Dershowitz says in the lawsuit that CNN repeated that clip over and over in order to make him appear as if he ""had lost his mind.""

Following the airing of that clip over and over again, the hosts, together with their panel guests, including CNN employees and paid commentators, exploded into a one-sided and false narrative that Professor Dershowitz believes and argued that as long as the President believes his reelection is in the public interest, that he could do anything at all – including illegal acts – and be immune from impeachment. The very notion of that was preposterous and foolish on its face, and that was the point: to falsely paint Professor Dershowitz as a constitutional scholar and intellectual who had lost his mind.

CNN's attorneys argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed based on the fair reporting privilege of the press.

Dershowitz appeared on Newsmax to explain that the fair reporting privilege didn't extend to CNN's actions exactly because the network unfairly misrepresented what he said.

""They took out the words 'lawful and illegal' in order, deliberately, to convey the impression that I thought the president could engage in illegal and unlawful conduct and still not be impeached, exactly the opposite of what I said,"" said Dershowitz.

In an email to Law & Crime, Dershowitz said he was looking forward to ""deposing the commentators and heads of CNN and of the truth coming out.""

Here's the interview with Dershowitz about the lawsuit:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alan-dershowitz-million-cnn-lawsuit,2021-05-28
Alaska GOP vows all 'legally permissible' action to prevent Sen. Lisa Murkowski' re-election,"The Alaska Republican Party has censured Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) for voting to convict former President Donald Trump in his second Senate trial in January.

Of the seven Republican senators who voted ""guilty,"" many have faced censure from their state parties. But the Alaska GOP went further. Not only did the state party members censure Murkowski, but they vowed to actively campaign against her in 2022.

What are the details?

The Alaska GOP passed a censure resolution during a meeting in Anchorage over the weekend.

In a 53-17 vote, the Alaska GOP censured Murkowski not only for supporting Trump's second impeachment, but also for several past votes that have angered Republicans, the Associated Press reported. Also cited was Murkowski having ""consistently opposed placing limits on abortion"" and the fact that she supported Deb Haaland's nomination to become interior secretary

""The party does not want Lisa Murkowski to be a Republican candidate,"" Tuckerman Babcock, former chairman of the Alaska GOP, told the AP.

Babcock explained the censure resolution directed Alaska Republicans to do everything in their power to ensure Murkowski is not re-elected.

""It went further than censure, which was strong,"" Babcock said. ""But it also directed the party officials to recruit an opponent in the election and to the extent legally permissible, prevent Lisa Murkowski from running as a Republican in any election.""

The resolution states:

Resolved that under Alaska Republican Party Rules, Article 1, Section 4 (f) 4, the Party hereby will recruit a Republican primary challenger to oppose and prohibit Senator Murkowski from being a candidate in any Republican primary to the extent legally permissible.

""The committee decided that they need to speak up early in order to encourage a candidate to come forward,"" Babcock added.

Trump has declared that he will campaign against Murkowski.

Why did Murkowski vote to convict?

After voting ""guilty,"" Murkowski released a lengthy statement explaining that she believed Trump was guilty of inciting the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Later, when faced with the prospect of censure, Murkowski reiterated that her loyalty is to the U.S. Constitution — not Trump.

""They can make that statement. But I will make the statement, again, that my obligation is to support the Constitution that I have pledged to uphold, and I will do that, even if it means that I have to oppose the direction of my state party,"" Murkowski said last month.

Who might replace Murkowski?

Murkowski is up for re-election in 2022, but it's not yet clear if she will pursue another Senate term. However, several names have emerged as possible candidates for her seat.

Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, teased challenging Murkowski after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh in a procedural vote during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.

""Hey @LisaMurkowski — I can see 2022 from my house..."" Palin tweeted in 2018.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) is also a potential challenger.

Surprisingly, Fox News host Laura Ingraham even voiced interest in running for Murkowski's seat after the senator's vote against Kavanaugh in 2018.

""I like Alaska...a lot. Maybe it's time to run for Senate after all. @lisamurkowski has abandoned all principles of due process and fairness. Disgraceful,"" Ingraham said at the time. ""Embarrassing to Alaska and to any who believe in due process and the presumption of innocence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alaska-gop-censure-oppose-lisa-murkowski-re-election,2021-03-17
"Alex Stein video of making Big Tex non-binary, Texans reject","Comedian Alex Stein proposed the idea of transitioning the iconic Big Tex mascot to a non-binary figure, but Texans quashed the idea the moment it was uttered from his lips.

Stein appeared at the annual State Fair of Texas held at Fair Park in Dallas. The State Fair of Texas has been held since 1886, and for the last 70 years, the 55-foot-tall iconic mascot of Big Tex has stood over the festivities.

Conservative provocateur and BlazeTV personality Alex Stein dressed as a Biden supporter and ironically attempted to persuade people into signing a petition to turn the Big Tex mascot to a non-binary gender. Real Texans overwhelmingly and immediately rejected the woke premise.

Stein – ironically wearing a hat supporting President Joe Biden – asked one couple, ""Do y'all think Big Tex should be transitioned to non-binary?""

The bewildered man replied, ""What the hell does that mean?""

Another man laughed at the proposal without giving a comment.

One man said, ""Are y'all f***ing crazy?"" He added that the ""son of b***h on your hat hasn't been good for America.""

Another fair attendee stated, ""You know you guys are just barking up the wrong tree.""

One person declared, ""I would hate that, honestly.""

Stein mockingly asked the few people who supported making Big Tex non-binary to name their ""favorite gender"" and their favorite COVID-19 vaccine to hypothetically inject into the mascot.

Many people simply laughed off the idea of making Big Tex non-binary.

At the end of the video, security for the State Fair of Texas are seen questioning Stein over his comedy skit.

In July, Alex Stein garnered headlines and millions of clicks after confronting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.

BlazeTV podcaster Jason Whitlock interviewed Stein after the incident involving AOC.

More recently, Alex 'Prime Time 99"" Stein trolled transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney – who was invited to the White House to interview President Joe Biden.

Alex Wagner's primetime MSNBC show goes off the rails when her teleprompter malfunctions minutes into her first night,"The premiere of MSNBC's newest primetime show went awry after an apparent teleprompter malfunction on her first night.

Host Alex Wagner paused and looked confused during her show, ""Alex Wagner Tonight,"" on Tuesday.

“I am thrilled to be here and honored to have this hour every night Tuesday through Friday’s to spend with you,"" Wagner said at the start of her show.

MSNBC gave Rachel Maddow's 9 p.m. time slot to Wagner after the relatively popular host said she was limiting her television presence to tackle other projects.

""Like most of you watching right now, I’ve been a longtime viewer of the 'The Rachel Maddow Show' and I hope to live up to the incredibly high standard and she has set in covering the stories of the day and bring in context to this moment that we’re living through together,"" she continued.

That's when the teleprompter apparently malfunctioned, leaving Wagner speechless for a few seconds.

Video of the malfunction was shared widely on social media.

She addressed the snafu later on the show.

“Yes, we sure did have a case of the technical gremlins at the top of the show, but this is the first one so we’ll work it out. Now I think we’ve gotten it all under control,"" Wagner said.

Some viewers were angry at MSNBC for the technical foulup while others took the occasion to criticize Wagner.

""Watching Alex Wagner's debut on @MSNBC . What a s***show. Y'all need to get your tech crew on board here...between the horrific camera work, the crappy theme music, glitching over her monologue...it's a real disservice to Alex and to every viewer trying to give her a fair shot,"" read one tweet.

""Not this watching wet paint, malfunctioning teleprompter reader, Alex Wagner! She's struggling & sustained cringe,"" said one detractor.

""While not many can fill Rachel Maddow’s big shoes, Alex Wagner did a lousy job on her first night, a solid C, teleprompter reading skills D-. We will not be watching,"" said another critic.

""HA, She annoys me, won’t be watching. Chris is ok but her no way in hell,"" read another tweet.

"Amazon bans sale of books that suggest transgenderism is linked to mental illness. You can still buy Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf,' though.","Amazon will no longer sell books that suggest transgenderism and other sexual identities or orientations may posssibly indicate mental illness.

What are the details?



The company announced the move in response to Republican lawmakers' requests for more information as to why the online marketplace yanked the sale of Ryan T. Anderson's 2018 book, ""When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Movement.""

The book, which previously sat on the retailer's bestsellers list, can no longer be purchased on the site — even through third-party sellers.

It seems fair to note that Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" is available to purchase directly through Amazon (with free two-day delivery if you're a Prime member!) as well as from third-party sellers.

In a letter sent to Republican Sens. Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio (Fla.), Mike Lee (Utah), and Mike Braun (Ind.), the company said, ""As a bookseller, we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints, including books that some customers may find objectionable.""

""Amazon works hard to ensure customers have a great shopping experience, and access to the widest and most diverse cross-section of written and spoken word in retail today,"" the letter continued. ""We reserve the right not to sell certain content. All retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer, as do we.""

The letter added, ""As to your specific question about 'When Harry Became Sally,' we have chosen not to sell books that frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.""

""Gender dysphoria,"" Anderson explained, ""is listed in the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which Amazon sells.

"Amazon claims in-person vote only way to ensure 'valid, fair' union election","Amazon is reportedly attempting to prohibit employees at an Alabama warehouse from participating in an upcoming unionization vote with mail-in ballots.

What's the background?

Because of the coronavirus pandemic, a significant portion of American voters participated in the 2020 election by casting mail-in ballots. In fact, data from the Pew Research Center found that nearly half of American voters — 46% — cast an absentee or mail-in ballot.

Democrats heavily pushed mail-in voting, likely because mail-in ballots would allow more voters to participate in the election process. Republicans, however, generally opposed mail-in voting, arguing that conducting a large portion of the election by mail potentially increased the potential that voter fraud could mar election integrity.

What's happening with Amazon?

Amazon filed an appeal with the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday over the agency's decision permitting the nearly 6,000 employees who work inside Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse to participate in the unionization election through mail-in ballots.

Instead, Amazon wants the election to be conducted in-person.

From the Washington Post:

Amazon argued in one of two filings that the agency's pandemic-voting policy is flawed, in part because it fails to define what a covid-19 ""outbreak"" actually is. That guidance ""reflected assumptions developed comparatively earlier in the pandemic — before scientific understanding of the virus and possible precautions had developed to where it is today,"" Amazon says in the filing.

In fact, Lisa Henderson, the acting regional director of the NLRB's Atlanta office, told Amazon that requiring the unionization vote to be conducted in-person ""could disenfranchise voters who have covid-19 or are concerned about contracting the disease,"" the Post reported.

""A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests,"" the NLRB decision stated, CNN reported. ""In addition, a mail ballot election will protect the health and safety of voters, Agency personnel, the parties' representatives, and the public during the current health crisis.""

What did Amazon say?

Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox told CNN in a statement that Amazon is fighting for an in-person election because it is ""the best approach to a valid, fair and successful election is one that is conducted manually, in-person, making it easy for associates to verify and cast their vote in close proximity to their workplace.""

American Bar Association nixes 'diversity and inclusion' admission demands on law schools — for now,"The American Bar Association has just announced that it has dropped a ""diversity and inclusion"" proposal after some prominent law professors and law schools warned that it ran afoul of federal law.

On Monday, the ABA revealed that it had decided to scrap a proposal that would have required law schools to ""diversify"" their faculties and student admissions to boost enrollment and representation from historically ""underrepresented groups.""

The measure, first proposed in May 2021, underwent three revisions before the ABA decided to eliminate it altogether. A February 2022 iteration of the proposal required ABA-accredited schools to make ""the study of law and admission to the profession"" accessible to ""all persons, particularly members of underrepresented groups related to race and ethnicity."" It also called for law schools to work toward building ""[a]n inclusive and equitable environment"" for all, irrespective of ""race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, [or] military status.""

It also required all ABA-accredited schools to submit ""an annual assessment of the inclusivity and equity of a law school’s educational environment"" or risk losing their accreditation.

Though 150 law school deans supported the measure, many law professors balked that it would require schools to violate many anti-discrimination laws at the state and federal level, including the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Others worried that the emphasis on racial and ethnic ""diversity"" would undermine other ""underrepresented"" identity groups, such as ""LGBTQ+"" and the disabled.

Though the ABA has opted to move on from the requirement for now, it has not ruled out revisiting it at a later date. As the Washington Free Beacon points out, the U.S. Supreme Court will soon reconsider the value of racial preferences and affirmative action in higher education with the case Students for Fair Admissionsv. Harvard. Should SCOTUS rule against such racial preferences, the ABA may reconsider its own recent focus on racial ""diversity and inclusion.""

The ABA has already approved a measure to compel law schools to ""provide education to law students on bias, cross-cultural competency, and racism."" It has also flirted with the idea of eliminating the LSAT as a requirement for admissions because the test is supposedly biased against minorities.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-bar-association-nixes-diversity-demands,2022-08-11
Report: Americans bear $20 billion burden yearly for the millions of illegal aliens who've stolen across southern border since Biden took office,"Nearly 5 million illegal aliens have crossed the border since President Joe Biden took office. So far this year, of those encountered at the southern border, over 500,000 illegal aliens have been released into the interior of the country by Border Patrol. In addition to depressing the wages of low-skilled American citizens, committing crimes beyond their initial breaking of American immigration laws, and potentially undermining the integrity of elections, illegal aliens also are costing U.S. taxpayers a great deal of money.

A new study published by the Federation for American Immigration Reform determined that to provide for the needs of those criminal non-citizens who have entered the U.S. under Biden, taxpayers must carry the burden of an addition $20.4 billion every year.

FAIR noted that this annual figure is not included in the estimated $140 billion per year that taxpayers are already weighted with, which compensates for the provision of services and benefits to the ""longer-term"" illegal alien population.

Not including those who slipped past Border Patrol, there were 1,734,686 border encounters in 2021, and so far this year there have been a record-breaking 1,946,780 border encounters. Accounting for removals and Title 42 expulsions, FAIR found that nearly 2.3 million illegal aliens have remained in the country's interior since January 2021.

FAIR arrived at the $20.4 billion figure after multiplying the estimated number of illegal immigrants who have recently entered by a conservative cost estimate of $9,232 per illegal alien per year.

Dan Stein, president of FAIR, suggested that this money could alternatively ""address some very important needs of the American public, instead of covering the costs of the surge of illegal migration triggered by this administration's policies.""

FAIR looked at how else this money could be spent and determined that this money might otherwise have been used to:

provide every homeless veteran in America $50,000 per year for ten years;

give every family earning $50,000 or less a $410 grocery voucher;

provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to over 7 million additional needy American families;

hire more than 315,000 police officers nationwide to combat rising crime; and

complete construction of the majority of the southern border wall.

Although the price tag on unchecked criminal migration is high, it is likely to run higher.

If the Biden administration's spring decision to end Title 42 — currently in legal limbo — goes into effect, the burden on taxpayers will only increase. Title 42, a policy introduced during the Trump presidency, enabled border authorities to quickly throw out non-citizens who had entered the U.S. illegally.

In July, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz went on record noting that an internal Border Patrol emergency memo instructed agents to release illegal aliens straight into the U.S. interior upon Title 42's official elimination. The reasoning: When the policy is ended, there will be such an overwhelming number of illegal aliens surging across the border that American authorities will not have the means to stop, detain, and process every individual.

When Title 42 falls either by court decision or by the CDC's decision to let it expire, 18,000 illegal aliens are projected to cross the border daily. At that rate, over 6.5 million would cross over in the course of a year. Given FAIR's per-alien cost estimate of $9,232, this will add $166 million to American taxpayers' annual illegal alien tab every day.

Earlier this year, Republican National Committee spokesman Nicole Morales told Fox News Digital, ""Joe Biden and border czar Kamala Harris have overseen the worst border crisis in DHS history and are actively making it worse by ending Title 42.""

Vice President Kamala Harris does not, however, perceive this massive influx of illegals to be a problem. Over the weekend, Harris appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" where she claimed, ""The border is secure.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/americans-20-billion-illegal-aliens,2022-09-14
"Amid supply chain crisis, GOP must explain what the Biden administration 'grinches' did to wreck Christmas, memo says","As American consumers suffer the consequences of the supply chain crisis, Republicans have the task of explaining what the ""grinches"" at the White House did to wreck Christmas, according to a memo.

The memo to the Republican Study Committee from committee Chairman Jim Banks (R-Ind.) blames the Biden administration for the crisis.

The document declares that ""it's more than fair to say that Joe Biden has caused the current supply chain crisis. It's our job—even our duty—to explain to the American people who is at fault for the skyrocketing cost of living. Only when the current administration feels the stinging pain of tanking public opinion will they be spurred to abandon their far left and economically devastating agenda.""

""The Biden administration caused it. And our job as Republicans is to explain to the American people what the grinches at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave did to ruin Christmas,"" the memo declares.

While the memo suggests that the Biden administration will alter its agenda once public opinion plummets, President Biden's job approval rating is already underwater, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average.

""Biden's economic policies have affected the availability of truckers, port workers and other personnel essential to our supply chains: Paying people to stay at home, vaccine mandates, and other COVID restrictions have kept individuals from rejoining the workforce,"" the memo says.



""The cost of shipping rises as the burden of regulations and fuel prices increase,"" the document notes, pointing to factors such as the Biden administration's action that killed the Keystone XL Pipeline project and its move to rejoin the Paris Agreement.

The memo also pointed toward inflation, as well as U.S. weakness toward, and dependency on, the nation of China.

""By indiscriminately pumping money into the economy, Biden's spurring inflation which, in turn, is spurring the supply chain crisis: The rational consumer response to 5.4% annual inflation is to spend their rapidly devaluing currency, and that increases pressure on our supply chains and further increases inflation,"" the memo states.

Amnesty International's USA director says Israel 'shouldn't exist as a Jewish state',"Nonprofit human rights group Amnesty International's USA director, Paul O'Brien, told an audience Wednesday that Israel ""shouldn't exist as a Jewish state"" and argued that most American Jews want the country to be ""a safe Jewish space"" based on ""core Jewish values.""



O'Brien, who is not Jewish, made the comments at a Women's National Democratic Club lunch event, speaking in front of about 20 people in person and another 30 virtual attendees, Jewish Insider reported. He was discussing a recent report published by his organization that accused Israel of ""apartheid"" in its treatment of Palestinians. The purpose of the report was to ""collectively change the conversation"" regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, O'Brien reportedly said.

Addressing support for Israel among American Jews, O'Brien rejected the results of a 2020 survey conducted by the Ruderman Family Foundation that found that eight in 10 Jewish Americans identify as ""pro-Israel"" and two-thirds feel emotionally ""attached"" or ""very attached"" to the world's lone Jewish state, according to Jewish Insider.

“I actually don’t believe that to be true,” O'Brien reportedly said of the survey results. “I believe my gut tells me that what Jewish people in this country want is to know that there’s a sanctuary that is a safe and sustainable place that the Jews, the Jewish people can call home.”

He argued that American Jews want ""a safe Jewish space"" rather than a Jewish state. ""I think they can be convinced over time that the key to sustainability is to adhere to what I see as core Jewish values, which are to be principled and fair and just in creating that space,” O'Brien reportedly said.

Jewish Insider interpreted these remarks as an argument for the ""one-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that the pro-Israel community rejects such arguments as ""a cover for the dissolution of a Jewish state.""

O'Brien affirmed that Israel ""shouldn't exist as a Jewish state,"" according to Jewish Insider, although he added that ""Amnesty takes no political views on any question, including the right of the State of Israel to survive.""

“The right of the people to self-determination and to be protected is without a doubt something that we believe in, and I personally believe that,” O'Brien reportedly said. But he added, “We are opposed to the idea — and this, I think, is an existential part of the debate — that Israel should be preserved as a state for the Jewish people.”

Amnesty International, a nonprofit international human rights group, has consistently criticized Israel and in its 2022 report accused the Jewish nation of maintaining ""an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis."" The report was slammed by Israel's foreign ministry, which said it ""absolutely rejects all the false allegations"" and accused Amnesty of regurgitating ""lies, inconsistencies, and unfounded assertions that originate from well-known anti-Israeli hate organizations.""

""The report denies the State of Israel's right to exist as the nation state of the Jewish people. Its extremist language and distortion of historical context were designed to demonize Israel and pour fuel onto the fire of anti-Semitism,"" Israel's foreign ministry said in a statement.

The Palestinian government, on the other hand, embraced the report and said it was a ""detailed affirmation of the cruel reality of entrenched racism, exclusion, oppression, colonialism, apartheid, and attempted erasure that the Palestinian people have endured.""

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration rejected the claim that Israel has committed apartheid through its actions towards the Palestinians.

""We think that it is important as the world’s only Jewish state that the Jewish people must not be denied their right to self-determination, and we must ensure there isn’t a double standard being applied,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in February.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/amnesty-international-usa-director-israel-should-not-exist-as-jewish-state,2022-03-11
"MSNBC analyst accuses Fox News of goading viewers into 'terrorism,' and asks if it should be 'allowed to exist'","MSNBC analyst Anand Giridharadas made the case for outlawing the Fox News cable network based on his estimation that they goaded viewers into ""terrorism"" after the rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

""It's time for this question to be front and center: Should Fox News be allowed to exist? Brain-mashing as a business model shouldn't be legal,"" tweeted Giridharadas on Friday.

The first tweet of Giridharadas thread received more than 3.8K retweets and more than 16.2K likes on Twitter.



""I'm not a lawyer, but I don't understand why you're not allowed to manufacture bucatini that doesn't have a certain threshold of iron in it but you can broadcast brain-mashing falsehoods and goad people toward terrorism,"" he continued.

""If the Fairness Doctrine, applying to broadcast, was constitutional, why would a new Fairness Doctrine, applying more broadly, be a violation of that same Constitution?"" asked Giridharadas.

The Fairness Doctrine, originally implemented in 1949 by the United States Federal Communications Commission, required media outlets with a broadcasting license to present both sides of a controversial political issue fairly and equally. The FCC ended the policy in 1987 because it stifled free speech.

""Twelve percent of Americans supported the terrorist insurrection on the Capitol. After the fact. You cannot pin this only on leaders. This has been institutionalized incitement in which the media played a giant role, and democracy is endangered by it,"" Giridharadas continued.

He recognized that such a policy could be abused, but added, ""none of that means, to me, that a business model of incitement and falsehood is absolutely protected.""

Giridharadas' suggestion was immediately denounced as ""fascist"" by some critics on social media, while others questioned the practicality of banning Fox News.

""Curious where @AnandWrites thinks the Fox audience should go? Should they not have news outlets at all, should they go to a new conservative outlet that will somehow suck less than Fox, should they learn to love CNN? What's the plan?"" asked Matt Taibi of Rolling Stone.

""I am amazed that people keep suggesting this without thinking through the obvious consequences. If the government could shut down Fox News, think what the Trump admin would have done to CNN, MSNBC, NY Times, WaPo and more,"" responded Tech editor Mike Masnick.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anand-giridharadas-fox-news-ban,2021-01-22
"Andrew Cuomo grants clemency to convicted murderers, domestic terrorist in last-minute act as governor","Disgraced ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) granted clemency to multiple murderers late Monday to mark the final act of his long tenure as governor of New York.

What are the details?

Prior to departing office at 11:59 p.m., Cuomo commuted the sentences of five convicted murderers — including one domestic terrorist — and fully pardoned another man.

Most notably, Cuomo commuted the sentence of David Gilbert, 76, who was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder and four counts of first-degree robbery in 1983.

Gilbert was a member of the far-left Weather Underground militant group, which the FBI has classified as a domestic terrorist organization. Gilbert participated in the infamous 1981 robbery of a Brink's armored truck, which resulted in the deaths of two police officers and a Brink's security guard. He was sentenced 75 years-to-life. He will now be eligible for parole.

Gilbert is the father of controversial San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin. According to the Associated Press, Boudin had been lobbying Cuomo to grant his father clemency.

The other prisoners include:

Greg Mingo, 68, was convicted of four counts of second-degree murder, first-degree robbery, first-degree burglary, and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. He served nearly 40 years of a 50 years-to-life sentence. He will be released from prison.

Robert Ehrenberg, 62, was convicted of two counts of second-degree murder, and one count of first-degree robbery and first-degree burglary. He served nearly 30 years of a 50 years-to-life sentence. He will be released from prison.

Ulysses Boyd, 66, was convicted of one count of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. He served 35 years of a 50 years-to-life sentence. He will be released from prison.

Paul Clark, 59, was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder, one count of second-degree attempted murder, and one count of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. He served 40 years of his 58-year prison sentence. He will be released from prison.

Meanwhile, Cuomo fully pardoned Lawrence Penn, who pleaded guilty to first-degree falsifying business records in 2015. He served two years in prison, but will now have the offense wiped from his record.

What did Cuomo say?

In a statement, Cuomo likened the last-minute grants of clemency to fairness, equity, empathy, and justice.

""The march towards a more fair, more just, more equitable, and more empathetic New York State is a long one, but every step forward we can take it worthwhile and important,"" Cuomo said.

""These clemencies make clear the power of redemption, encourage those who have made mistakes to engage in meaningful rehabilitation, and show New Yorkers that we can work toward a better future. I thank all the volunteer attorneys representing clemency applicants for their dedication and service to justice,"" the statement added.

Former federal prosecutor explains how DOJ may have self-sabotaged its Trump investigation after special master granted,"Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy explained Monday how government prosecutors may have tainted their investigation against former President Donald Trump.

What is the background?

On Monday, federal District Court Judge Aileen M. Cannon granted Trump's request for a special master to review documents that FBI agents seized from Mar-a-Lago.

Cannon's ruling essentially brings the Justice Department's investigation to a standstill because it bars investigators from using the seized documents for any ""investigative purpose"" until the special master completes the review.

The ruling said:

The Court hereby authorizes the appointment of a special master to review the seized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege.



Furthermore, in natural conjunction with that appointment, and consistent with the value and sequence of special master procedures, the Court also temporarily enjoins the Government from reviewing and using the seized materials for investigative purposes pending completion of the special master’s review or further Court order.

Cannon explained that she ruled in Trump's favor, in part, ""to ensure at least the appearance of fairness and integrity under the extraordinary circumstances presented.""

What did McCarthy say?

Reacting to Cannon's order on Fox News, McCarthy explained the significance of the ruling, namely that investigators may have been violating Trump's constitutional rights by rifling through documents that may be subject to client-attorney or executive privilege.

McCarthy called it a ""big win"" for Trump because of assumptions the government made when assessing the documents.

""What happened here is the Justice Department assumed that Trump only had attorney-client privilege, that he did not have executive privilege, or at least to the limited extent that as a former president he maintains executive privilege, it can’t be asserted against the executive branch itself,"" McCarthy began. ""It's one thing for the government to have that theory — I think it actually may be a sound theory.

""The problem is it’s not 100% settled,"" he continued. ""So I thought it was incumbent on them to get a ruling from the court on that question before they hauled off and did what they did, which was have the privilege team go through all the seized documents assuming that Trump only had attorney-client privilege and then allowing all of the potentially executive-privileged documents to go to the prosecution team.""

So what happens if government prosecutors have in their possession documents subject to privilege and have been using them to build their case against Trump?

According to McCarthy, that possibility ""could taint"" the entire investigation.

""If it turned out they are privileged, that could taint the prosecutors who reviewed them and it could also taint their investigation because they are now conducting an investigation,"" McCarthy said.

""They got these documents two weeks ago, and they've had these documents, the prosecution team has, for about a week. So they've been merrily along conducting their investigation with the agents assuming all these documents were appropriate for the investigation,"" he explained. ""Now the judge is saying hold everything, [Trump] may have executive privilege.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/andrew-mccarthy-doj-taint-investigation-special-master,2022-09-06
Suspended woke prosecutor accuses Gov. Ron DeSantis of 'trying to overthrow democracy' with 'unconstitutional' action,"Andrew Warren, the George Soros-backed prosecutor, is fighting back after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) took the unprecedented step of suspending him.

Warren is the state attorney for Hillsborough County.

What is the background?

DeSantis announced Thursday that he was suspending Warren for ""neglect of duty"" for promising not to enforce state laws on abortion and child sex-change operations.

""When you flagrantly violate your oath of office, when you make yourself above the law, you have violated your duty, you have neglected your duty, and you are displaying a lack of competence to be able to perform those duties, and so today, we are suspending State Attorney Andrew Warren, effective immediately,"" DeSantis said at a press conference.

In suspending the Democratic prosecutor, DeSantis cited his authority under Article IV, Section 7 of the Florida state constitution.

How did Warren respond?

Warren addressed his suspension at a press conference on an unrelated topic, characterizing DeSantis' decision as undermining democracy.

""People need to understand this isn’t the governor trying to suspend the one elected official,"" Warren said. ""This is the governor trying to overthrow democracy here in Hillsborough County.""

To be fair, Warren is duly elected. He won election to his office in 2016 and won re-election in 2020 by a margin of nearly 50,000 votes, according to WTSP-TV.



At the time of the press conference, Warren said he had not yet read the official order suspending him, but said he ""heard it contains a lot of conjecture and lies.""

""I woke up to do my job today, and that’s exactly what I did,"" Warren said. ""Just based on the governor’s track record with unconstitutional orders, I have a feeling that this is going to be just as unconstitutional.""

Warren, however, did not explain what is unconstitutional about DeSantis' order. That did not stop him from accusing DeSantis of engaging in a politically motivated decision meant to boost his presidential aspirations.

""I think the governor is trying to make a good impression on the Iowa caucus voters,"" Warren accused.

And although he has vowed not to follow state laws, Warren defended himself from charges levied by DeSantis. According to Warren, he has not yet had a case involving abortion or child sex-change operations come to his office.

""We’ve had none. None of those cases have been brought to us. We’re not anticipating those cases being brought to us,"" Warren said. ""You should go ask the sheriff whether he has had those cases and whether they’re investigating arresting people for that, because when they do, and they bring us a case, we’ll evaluate it.""

Andrew Yang tweets — and deletes — support for Joe Rogan,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang took heat from social media on Sunday after he shared a tweet appearing to support podcaster Joe Rogan amid a new scandal after Rogan was found to have used the N-word on past podcast episodes of ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

What are the details?

Yang on Sunday spoke out on the latest Rogan controversy and said that he simply didn't believe the popular podcaster — with whom he's had several on-air discussions — is racist.

On Twitter, he wrote, ""I don't think Joe Rogan is a racist — the man interacts with and works with black people literally all of the time. Do I know black friends of Joe's who would swear by him? Yes I do.""

Following heavy backlash, Yang deleted the tweet and explained his decision in doing so in a later thread.

""I like to believe the best of people — especially if I've met and spent time with that person,"" he said. ""Sometimes it makes me miss something. I think we should have the capacity to forgive people — whether a podcaster or mayor — if they mess up. Maybe it's because I mess up too.""

Yang explained that he realized his mistake in tweeting support for Rogan after backlash ensued.

He continued, ""Racism is real, deep, corrosive, and even lethal. I know that. I made a mistake in an earlier tweet tonight that downplayed these realities.""

“I deleted the tweet because it was wrong-headed,"" he added and issued an apology to those he offended with the remarks. ""It also hurt people, which is never my intent. I’m sorry. I’m learning and appreciate those who reached out to express their feelings.""

Yang went on, ""I like to believe the work I’ve done these past years had the goal of uplifting everyone, particularly those on the outside looking in for any reason, be it poverty or marginalization or race. I’ve always wanted to help those with the least the most.”

He concluded, ""I’m going to keep doing all I can for a more fair, equitable, and just country. That means for everyone. Universal Basic Income, Democracy Reform and unity are how we get there.""

What else?



Rogan spoke out about the latest controversy over the weekend and said that he's not racist.

On Saturday, he shared a video to Instagram in which he explained his feelings on the developing scandal.

He captioned the video, ""There’s been a lot of s**t from the old episodes of the podcast that I wish I hadn’t said, or had said differently. This is my take on the worst of it.""

""I know that to most people, there is no context where a white person is ever allowed to say that word, never mind publicly on a podcast, and I agree with that now,” Rogan said in the widely watched video. “Instead of saying the N-word, I would just say the word. I thought as long as it was in context, people would understand what I was doing.”

“I never used it to be racist, because I’m not racist,” Rogan added. “But whenever you’re in a situation where you have to say, ‘I’m not racist,’ you f***ed up. And I clearly have f***ed up.""

Suspect reportedly shoots police officer's mother in the head in broad daylight as she answers the door,"The mother of a New York City police officer was fatally shot as she answered the front door of her home, ABC News has reported.



What are the details?

Police say 51-year-old Queens woman Anna Torres was killed after a suspect shot her in the head after she answered the door.

Surveillance video footage showed the moment the suspect's gun went off, fatally striking Torres and sending terrified children and neighbors fleeing for cover. At least two of the woman's relatives were inside the home at the time of the shooting.

Giuseppe Canzani, the 41-year-old suspect, drove to a local police station and surrendered after the shooting.

In a statement on the shooting, NYPD Deputy Chief Jerry O'Sullivan said that after driving to the precinct, the suspect ""exited [his] vehicle, pulled out a firearm, and placed it on the sidewalk.""

""There were two officers in front of the precinct for station-house security,"" O'Sullivan continued. ""The officers successfully handcuffed the individual and removed the firearm away from the subject.""

Canzani was charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a firearm. He is due to appear in court on Thursday.

A deeper look

WABC-TV reported that a man matching Canzani's description was once seen arguing with Torres in her back yard.

The station noted that Canzani said Torres, a psychic who reportedly did tarot readings inside her home, was a ""witch"" who cursed him and condemned him to death.

""[Her curses] tried to kill me,"" he reportedly told investigators. ""I am supposed to be dead already.""

Torres' husband, David Aguilar, said he can't believe his wife, who possessed a kind nature, is gone.

""My son is the same way,"" he said. ""He's good with everyone. He's fair. She was the sweetest person in the world. I'm lost without her.""

One neighbor called the murder ""unbelievable.""

""It's so quiet and so nice. Everyone knows each other. I've been here almost 6 years. Never, nothing happened,"" the neighbor told the station.

Another neighbor added, ""It's scary that our family lives here. Our grandparents live next door. You don't know was it a home invasion or not; you don't know what it is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anna-torres-shooting-giuseppe-canzani,2022-05-06

""If not, his failure to disclose income from right-wing organizations, recuse himself from matters involving his wife, and his vote to block the Jan 6th commission from key information must be investigated and could serve as grounds for impeachment.""

According to Ocasio-Cortez, Congress will send a ""loud, dangerous signal"" to the Supreme Court ""that [Thomas'] acts are fair game"" if lawmakers fail to hold Thomas ""accountable.""

""This is a tipping point. Inaction is a decision to erode and further delegitimize SCOTUS,"" Ocasio-Cortez claimed.

However, Ocasio-Cortez failed to present a single shred of evidence that Thomas has committed any wrongdoing or engaged in any behavior worthy of impeachment.



The demand follows comments the New York Democrat made on Monday when she told Axios, ""I think what we know, if investigated further, could absolutely be grounds for potential impeachment. I absolutely do believe that.""

But what is the problem?

There are numerous problems with Ocasio-Cortez's assertions.

First, Ocasio-Cortez claims Thomas has failed ""to disclose income from right-wing organizations."" But there is no substantive evidence showing that Thomas makes money from ""right-wing organizations,"" let alone evidence that he has failed to disclose such income.

Second, the Supreme Court has not heard a case involving his wife, thus Ocasio-Cortez's assertion that Thomas has breached judicial ethics by participating in a court case from which he should have been recused is moot. If the Supreme Court had heard a case involving Thomas' wife, he would have undoubtedly recused himself from the proceedings.

Finally, it is true that Thomas voted to block Trump-era White House documents from being turned over to the House committee investigating Jan. 6. Thomas' critics point to his vote — and in fact, he was the lone dissenting vote — as evidence that he is compromised.

However, his wife's text messages to Mark Meadows, in which she urged the White House to continue fighting the certification of the 2020 presidential election, were handed over to the committee before Thomas made that vote. This is significant because it undercuts the claim that Thomas' vote and the text messages are connected.

Meanwhile, Justice Thomas and his wife, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, have maintained for decades that their careers — his as a Supreme Court justice, hers as a political activist — are separate.

""Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles, and aspirations for America,"" Ginni Thomas told the Washington Free Beacon earlier this month. ""But we have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn't discuss his work with me, and I don't involve him in my work.""

Will Thomas be impeached?

Considering the glaring lack of evidence of wrongdoing, Thomas likely will neither resign nor be impeached.

Only one Supreme Court justice — Samuel Chase — has been impeached in U.S. history, but that happened in 1805. Still, Chase was acquitted by the Senate.

Meanwhile, constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley said the calls for Thomas' impeachment are dangerous.

""The calls for the impeachment of Justice Thomas are ludicrous but there is nothing laughable about the impeachment addiction fueling this frenzy,"" Turley wrote in an essay. ""People of good faith can disagree on the need of Thomas to recuse himself from certain Commission-related cases.

""However, impeaching Thomas based on these grounds would expose all justices to the threat of politically motivated impeachments as majorities shift in Congress,"" he explained. ""That is precisely what the Framers sought to avoid under our Constitution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-demands-clarence-thomas-resign-or-be-impeached-but-three-major-problems-exist-with-her-claims,2022-03-29
"AOC calls for 'liberation' of Southern states, accuses all Republicans of supporting white supremacy","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), in a social media rant Tuesday, night stated that all Republicans support white supremacy, that Southern states are not ""red"" states, and that the only way the United States can ""heal"" is if the people in those states are ""liberated"" from ""economic, social, and racial oppression.""

Ocasio-Cortez made these inflammatory claims in an Instagram video in which she suggested Southern states were also ""suppressed,"" asserting that the Democratic wins in the U.S. Senate runoff races in Georgia show how grassroots organization on the left can overcome alleged voter suppression tactics by Republicans. Republicans, she also said, bore responsibility for the violence in the Capitol on Jan. 6, criticizing members of the Trump administration like former Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao for resigning from their positions without invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office.

""You don't get to allow for an attack that kills five people and then afterwards say, I wasn't a part of it. Yes you were,"" she said. ""You were a part of it when you caged kids. You were a part of it when you repealed Title IX. You were a part of it when the president committed the first dozen number of crimes that he committed. You were a part of it when you excused the lawbreaking.



""Those five people's blood is on your hands, what are you going to do? And they think that resigning is going to clean that blood off their hands, it is always on them. They are forever stained with the deaths of five people, especially when they did not invoke the 25th Amendment to remove this president when they had the power to do so. Cowards,"" she continued.

""I don't want to hear or see the Republican Party talk about blue lives ever again. This was never about safety for them, it was always a slogan because if they actually cared about rule of law they would speak up when people break the law. They would speak up. They would enforce fairness and equity, but they don't give a damn about the law. They don't give a damn about order. They don't give a damn about safety.

""They give a damn about white supremacy, they care about preserving the social order and the mythology of whiteness,"" she accused. ""They lust for power more than they care about democracy.""



Occasio-Cortez's claims echo those made by Stacey Abrams and other activists on the left who charge that election security laws supported by Republicans, like voter ID, are intentionally designed to prevent minorities from voting. Abrams to this day claims that she did not lose her race for governor against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, but that the election was stolen by Republicans who engaged in voter suppression.

AOC cited the recent Senate wins by Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff as proof that Southern states that traditionally vote Republican like Georgia are not red states, but that the vote there is suppressed.

""That's what we got to do. We got to organize. And I think what we saw in Georgia is a really good example with black women leading the way, with multiracial and multicultural organizations leading the way, um, they proved that southern states are not red states,"" she claimed. ""They are suppressed states. Which means the only way that our country is going to heal is through the actual liberation of southern states, the actual liberation of the poor, the actual liberation of working people—from economic, social, and racial oppression. That's the only way. That's the only way.""

AOC wears ‘tax the rich’ dress — while attending star-studded $30K-per-person Met Gala,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) raised eyebrows on Monday night when she wore a white dress emblazoned with slogan ""Tax the Rich"" — to a $30,000-per-ticket superstar soirée well known to elite groups as the annual Met Gala.

It is unclear at the time of this reporting whether Ocasio-Cortez purchased a ticket to the event.

What are the details?

Ocasio-Cortez, 31, attended the swanky fete with her boyfriend, Riley Roberts, on Monday night.

The New York congresswoman, a self-described democratic socialist, makes approximately $174,000 per year.

During a red-carpet interview at the event, Ocasio-Cortez said that she and the designer of the dress, Aurora James, collaborated and discussed ""what it means to be working-class women of color"" at the lavish Met event.

""When Aurora and were I first kind of partnered, we really started having a conversation about what it means to be working-class women of color at the Met, and we said, we can't just play along, but we need to break the fourth wall and challenge some of the institutions, and while the Met is known for its spectacle, we should have a conversation about it,"" she explained.

According to CNN, Ocasio-Cortez also told reporters that she believes it's high time to ""bring all classes into the conversation"" about implementing what she considers to be a ""fair tax code.""

""When we talk about supporting working families and when we talk about having a fair tax code, oftentimes this conversation is happening among working and middle class people (on) the Senate floor,"" she told reporters. ""I think it's time we bring all classes into the conversation.""

What was the response?

While many die-hard AOC fans who believe that the self-proclaimed democratic socialist can do no wrong lauded the move, others weren't quite as tickled by the irony.

Actor Michael Rapaport blasted her appearance, saying, ""Custom TAX THE RICH dress while at the most elitist event in the world. @AOC will soon be rich with a ginormous production deal from somewhere & done with Politics, guarantee it. Stop treating ANY of these people like celebrities they are public servants and work for US.""

Virginia congressional candidate Tina Ramirez added, "".@AOC, who makes well over double the national average salary and who voted to give herself a pay raise, showed up at the #MetGala (an event which costs $30,000 per ticket) wearing a 'Tax the Rich' dress. This is obscenely out of touch and completely hypocritical.""

Social media user Jonathan Snoddy added, ""$30k a ticket? my VA Disability is only $1,100 a month how many months — damn i need a drink I like can't even with this right now.""



Another user added, ""Is she working class? 174k, scheduler, driver, staff, deduction for lodging in DC. And there are more perks.""

""Working class women of color ? I'm one of those and could never afford that dress or a ticket. PLEASE think,"" another complained.

'Tax the Rich'

Ocasio-Cortez herself addressed the buzzy appearance on Instagram, writing, ""Proud to work with @aurorajames as a sustainably focused, black woman immigrant designer who went from starting her dream @brothervellies at a flea market in Brooklyn to winning the @cfda against all odds — and then work together to kick open the doors at the Met. The time is now for childcare, healthcare, and climate action for all. Tax the Rich. And yes, BEFORE anybody starts wilding out — NYC elected officials are regularly invited to and attend the Met due to our responsibilities in overseeing our city's cultural institutions that serve the public. I was one of several in attendance. Dress is borrowed via @brothervellies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-tax-rich-dress-met-gala,2021-09-14
AOC Tax the Rich dress designer Aurora James unpaid taxes,"A new report alleges a seemingly hypocritical accusation against the designer of the dress Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wore to the swanky Met Gala. The designer, Aurora James, is a ""notorious tax deadbeat with unpaid debts dogging her in multiple states,"" according to the New York Post.

James, 37, designed the ""Tax the Rich"" dress that Ocasio-Cortez wore to the $30,000-per-ticket posh fete. James, who reportedly has a net worth of $2 million, said the gown delivered a ""powerful message"" at the glitzy event that featured well-to-do celebrities and influential elites.

The controversy stems from the Cultural Brokerage Agency, an LLC that James formed in 2021 to serve as the parent company of her fashion brand, Brother Vellies. The company has been served 15 warrants in total since 2015, according to the outlet.

The New York Post reported:

The company racked up three open tax warrants in New York state for failing to withhold income taxes from employees' paychecks totaling $14,798, the state Department of Taxation and Finance told The Post. The debts — which were incurred before the pandemic — stem from 2018 and 2019.



The company got into a deeper hole with the feds. Between April 2018 and April 2019, the Internal Revenue Service placed six federal liens on Cultural Brokerage Agency totaling $103,220. The liens specifically cite the company's failure to remit employee payroll taxes.

The IRS did not comment on the current status, the Post said.

James' company purportedly received $41,666 in pandemic relief aid from the government.

The report claimed that the Cultural Brokerage Agency was hit with a ""$17,000 fine for not carrying worker's-comp insurance between March 2017 and February 2018.""

A former employee, who remained anonymous, allegedly described the operation as a ""sweatshop that relied on legions of unpaid interns working full-time jobs.""

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) said, ""It's the height of hypocrisy when socialists attend a $30,000 per ticket gala with a message of 'tax the rich' while wearing an overpriced dress by a luxury designer who doesn't pay taxes. What happened to everyone paying their fair share?""

James walked the red carpet with Ocasio-Cortez and her ""Tax the Rich"" dress at the opulent Met Gala, along with their dates. For the ostentatious soirée, James was accompanied by 39-year-old Benjamin Bronfman, who has an estimated net worth of $100 million. His father is Edgar Bronfman Jr., who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, thanks to his family-owned Seagram's alcohol distilling company. He was previously the CEO of Warner Music Group.

The far-left Ocasio-Cortez has made a career of demanding wealth redistribution. Shortly after getting into office in 2019, the progressive called for the rich to be taxed up to 70%. Last week, Bill Maher challenged Ocasio-Cortez's assertion that the ""rich aren't paying their fair share of taxes.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-tax-the-rich-dress-designer-taxes,2021-09-19
Ocasio-Cortez demands taxpayer dollars to 'deradicalize' white supremacists: 'Their world will never exist',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) says that taxpayer funds should be used to ""deradicalize"" white supremacists.

What did AOC say?

Speaking with supporters during a virtual town hall Friday night, Ocasio-Cortez blamed recent violence — including the deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 — on white supremacy.

""The white supremacist cause is futile, it's nihilist — it will never be realized,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""The path forward for all of us is a multiracial democracy that fights for the economic and civil rights of every American.""

She added of white supremacists, ""Their world will never exist. That's why we're seeing violence right now.""

Ocasio-Cortez was speaking in response to a question about how Americans should respond to those who believe in conspiracy theories, but were not part of the violence at the Capitol. Ocasio-Cortez warned that ""this is a problem that doesn't go away on Jan. 20,"" and said it will require ""many, many, many millions of hands"" to help ""pick up the pieces.""

Ocasio-Cortez explained that, during her time on the House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, she has learned about programs that ""deradicalize"" white supremacists. Ocasio-Cortez blamed President Donald Trump for ""pulling the plug"" on funding for such programs.

But if America wants to adequately address the problem of white supremacy, Ocasio-Cortez said taxpayer funding for ""deradicalization"" programs should be significantly increased.

""We need to double, triple or quadruple, or increase funding for these deradicalization programs en masse,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

"Nancy Pelosi's archbishop eviscerates her over abortion support, openly questions her 'devout' faith","Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was put on blast this week by her own archbishop after the pro-abortion politician touted her ""devout Catholic"" faith while defending taxpayer-funded abortions.

What happened?

During a news conference Thursday on Capitol Hill, Pelosi defended a Democratic initiative to permit federal funding for elective abortions by repealing the Hyde Amendment, and cited her religious faith in doing so.

""As a devout Catholic and mother of five in six years, I feel that God blessed my husband and me with our beautiful family,"" she said. ""But it's not up to me to dictate that that's what other people should do.""

""I'm a devout Catholic"". Nancy Pelosi cites her faith while defending taxpayer-funded abortions youtu.be

The California Democrat went on to describe taxpayer-funded abortions as ""an issue of fairness and justice for poor women in our country.""



What did the archbishop say?

Shortly after the news conference, Pelosi's religious overseer, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, publicly slammed her for the remarks and openly questioned her faith.

""Let me repeat: no one can claim to be a devout Catholic and condone the killing of innocent human life, let alone have the government pay for it,"" Cordileone charged in a blistering statement in which he also characterized her position as the ""epitome of hypocrisy"":

The right to life is a fundamental – the most fundamental – human right, and Catholics do not oppose fundamental human rights. To use the smokescreen of abortion as an issue of health and fairness to poor women is the epitome of hypocrisy: what about the health of the baby being killed? What about giving poor women real choice, so they are supported in choosing life? This would give them fairness and equality to women of means, who can afford to bring a child into the world. It is people of faith who run pro-life crisis pregnancy clinics; they are the only ones who provide poor women life-giving alternatives to having their babies killed in their wombs. I cannot be prouder of my fellow Catholics who are so prominent in providing this vital service. To them I say: you are the ones worthy to call yourselves ""devout Catholics""!

Pelosi has yet to respond publicly to the sharp criticism.

Anything else?

While Thursday's statement from Cordileone marked his most pointed rebuke to date, it was not the first time the archbishop had taken prominent pro-abortion politicians, like Pelosi, to task.

In a pastoral letter earlier this year, Cordileone argued that high-profile Catholics ""who erroneously, and sometimes stubbornly, promote abortion"" should be denied the church's holiest of sacraments, communion, since ""their advocacy of abortion definitely leads others to do evil.""

Cordileone's sentiment is shared by a plurality of bishops at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In June, the conference voted in favor of drafting a document to potentially withhold communion from pro-abortion Catholic politicians.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/archbishop-slams-pelosi-over-abortion,2021-07-23
'Are you disciplining African-American boys more than you’re disciplining white boys?' School district will consider race when students break behavioral rules,"A school board in Washington state adopted a ""culturally responsive discipline"" policy earlier this month requiring students' race and ethnicity to be taken into consideration after they break behavioral rules and punishment is administered.

What are the details?

The board for Clover Park School District — which is about an hour south of Seattle — passed the measure March 14 by a 3-2 vote after some debate among board members.

""The Board recognizes the negative and disproportionate impact of exclusionary discipline practices,"" the policy reads, adding that the main goal is to minimize discipline that keeps students out of the classroom.

When one board member asked what a culturally responsive discipline policy ""might look like,"" deputy superintendent Brian Laubach replied that the question for schools would be, ""Are you dispersing discipline across the ethnicities, the racial groups, equitably?"" For example, ""Are you disciplining African-American boys more than you’re disciplining white boys?"" he added.

Laubach also noted that ""classroom teachers"" and ""administrators who dispense that discipline"" for behavioral violations would be asked why sending students out of the classroom was chosen for discipline instead of other options that would have kept them in class.

The state defines “culturally responsive” as harnessing “knowledge of student cultural histories and contexts, as well as family norms and values in different cultures; knowledge and skills in accessing community resources and community and parent outreach; and skills in adapting instruction to students' experiences and identifying cultural contexts for individual students.""

Board member Paul Wagemann wasn't down with the proposed policy.

“Let’s say we both commit the same offense,” Wagemann posed in an analogy, presumably related to students of color versus white students. ""Then the question should be, 'What are the consequences of that offense? And how do we go through that process?' That’s how I see it. And to be fair, if we both did the same thing, we should get the same consequence ... and I think that’s how most children on the playground like to see it. Most of us as citizens in our community like to see it that way. That it’s equal.”

With that he dismissed the idea that the powers that be in the district would “have to look at [a student’s] nationality, or where he was born, or where he lived” prior to administering discipline. Instead, Wagemann said, plain and simple, ""He did an offense; I did the same offense. We should suffer the same consequence. And I think that’s what our system should do.""

Argentina offers 'x' gender option for national ID document and passport,"The nation of Argentina is allowing people to utilize an ""x"" in the gender field on their national ID document and passport, according to Reuters.

""The ideal will be when all of us are just who we are and no one cares about people's gender,"" Argentina's President Alberto Fernández said, according to the outlet. ""This is a step we are taking and I hope one day we get to the point where IDs don't say if someone is a man, woman or anything else.""

"Arizona is 'taking action,' defying Biden administration and refusing to take down improvised border wall","On October 14, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation demanded that Arizona remove the double-stacked, razor-wire-wreathed shipping containers that Arizona installed along gaps in the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma as a means to help stem the flow of criminal noncitizens into the country. On Tuesday, Arizona refused.

The BOR, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, noted that the Department of Homeland Security as well as Customs and Border Protection had awarded contracts to fill in the gaps of the border area located on BOR lands near Morelos Dam. It indicated additional contracts would soon be awarded.

Jacklynn Gould, the regional director of the BOR, expressed concern about a potential conflict between Arizona, which already got the job done, and prospective contract awardees. She also demanded that the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs ""cease further placement of shipping containers on federal or Indian trust lands.""

Gould stated that the ""unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States.""

The Ducey administration placed the containers in order to address the trespass of 2,150,639 illegal aliens into the U.S. so far this year.

The BOR director suggested that the encroachment by DEMA's shipping containers constitutes a ""trespass"" that is ""harming federal lands and resources and impeding Reclamation's ability to perform its mission.""

In a letter sent to the BOR on October 18, DEMA director Allen Clark stated, ""Arizona has not seen any action by the federal government. ... The containers will remain in place until specific details regarding construction are provided.""

Clark wrote, ""The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on that border and in our state.""

""States like Arizona ... cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security,"" said Clark.

The letter also contended that the regulation cited by the BOR didn't actually prohibit Arizona's actions and that the state had a guaranteed right, under Article IV, section 4 of the Constitution, to protect and defend itself.

Ducey’s communications director, C.J. Karamargin, indicated that the BOR's demand is a ""nonstarter.""



""We've been hearing for months now that (the Biden administration) was planning to do something and they've done nothing,"" said Karamargin. ""So while they're talking about it and writing letters, we're actually taking action.""

Karamargin also reiterated that the Ducey administration believes ""it's well within Arizona's rights to take this action.""

Ducey tweeted, ""The Border Barrier Mission is working. Arizona is protecting its citizens. Why the federal government won’t is beyond belief.""

Ducey signed a bill into law on June 30 that would finance the construction of a wall along the Arizona border with Mexico.

$335 million in state funds was directed to ""construct and maintain a border fence, purchase or install border security technologies, and to pay associated administrative costs."" An additional $209 million was allocated to fund ""border-related enforcement.""



President Joe Biden halted construction of the southern border wall when he took office. Only after Arizona took the initiative this summer to buttress American sovereignty did the Biden administration announce that it would complete the border wall near the Yuma sector.



In the meantime, the Republican-led state got to work on shoring up border security.

On August 12, Ducey declared, ""Arizona has had enough. We can't wait any longer. The Biden administration's lack of urgency on border security is a dereliction of duty.""

Ducey indicated that he would fortify gaps in the state's border, using 60 double-stacked 8,800-pound shipping containers, all reinforced with concertina wire at the top. DEMA did just that, successfully plugging the gaps in the border barrier with nearly 130 containers, all double-stacked, linked together, and welded shut, filling 3,820 feet of gaps.

The containers cost the state only $6 million.

In September, Ducey said, ""It's our responsibility to protect our citizens and law enforcement from this unprecedented crisis. With the resources and manpower in the right places, our Border Patrol and law enforcement will be better equipped to do their jobs well and prevent cartels from exploiting our communities. That’s exactly what our barrier mission will do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-is-taking-action-defying-biden-administration-and-refusing-to-take-down-improvised-border-wall,2022-10-20
Armed teenage carjacker dies after victim — a woman carrying concealed — shot him in the head on the south side of Chicago,"A 17-year-old carjacker died earlier this week after a woman carrying concealed shot him in the head during an attempted heist on the south side of Chicago the day before Thanksgiving.

What's the background?

The 23-year-old woman was sitting in a parked vehicle just after 2 a.m. in the 1300 block of East 89th Street when she saw four suspects exit a black sedan, WMAQ-TV reported.

One of the suspects was displaying a gun while trying to open her car door, police told the station.

The woman — a concealed carry license holder, according to cops — fired a single shot, striking the suspect in the head, WMAQ said.

The victim then fled the scene on foot, but another suspect opened fire, striking her in the left arm, the station said.

Paramedics took the shot male to the University of Chicago Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition, police told WFLD-TV. He was pronounced dead earlier this week, police told WMAQ.

The woman was taken to Trinity Hospital and listed in fair condition, WFLD-TV reported. She was treated, according to WMAQ, but the station didn't note her condition or whether she was released from the hospital.

The other three suspects were still at large as of Tuesday, WMAQ said.

Anything else?

In a city filled to the brim with crooks using guns illegally, Chicago concealed carriers have been tallying numerous successes, protecting themselves and others from the worst possible outcomes. Here's a sampling from this year:

"As crime rates soar, New York Gov. attempts to 'improve public safety' by changing law so that 'inmates' will now be referred to as 'incarcerated individuals'","New York Governor Kathy Hochul has just signed a law that stipulates ""inmates"" in her state will now be referred to as ""incarcerated individuals,"" a move that is unlikely to stymie the surge in violent crime that has recently plagued nearly every major metropolitan area in America, including New York City.

According to a statement released by her office, Hochul claims that the language change will help ""justice-involved"" persons feel better about themselves and may perhaps encourage them to engage more seriously in their rehabilitation efforts.

""Individuals impacted by the criminal justice system have long noted that terms such as felon, inmate, prisoner, and convict dehumanize individuals and perpetuate the idea that incarcerated people should be permanently demonized and stigmatized,"" the statement reads in part. ""This language change within state law will reduce stigma against people involved in the criminal justice system and therefore eliminate barriers to opportunities that they face.""

Hochul also added that ""[b]y treating all New Yorkers with dignity and respect, we can improve public safety while ensuring New Yorkers have a fair shot at a second chance.""

Democratic state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, who sponsored the legislation, agreed.

""For too long, we as a society have thought of incarcerated individuals as less than people,"" Gustavo said. ""The use of the word ‘inmate’ further dehumanizes and demoralizes them. This is another concrete step our State is taking to make our criminal justice system one that focuses on rehabilitation, rather than relying solely on punishment.""

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo actually signed the legislation making the language change last summer. However, due to legal technicalities, the law had to be re-signed in the 2021-2022 legislative session, according to WYRK.

While Cuomo, Rivera, Hochul, and other New York officials appear optimistic that the change in language will dramatically alter the self-esteem of convicted criminals, it is unlikely to alter the wave of violent crime in New York City or the depleted morale of the NYPD who have been charged with combating it.

Fox 5 NY reports that violent crime on NYC subways last month was up 57% over July 2021. Meanwhile, big city police departments are struggling to attract new recruits and retain those already on staff.

""We’re getting more calls for service and there are fewer people to answer them,” said Philadelphia police spokesperson Eric Gripp. “This isn’t just an issue in Philadelphia. Departments all over are down and recruitment has been difficult.""

Still, Gov. Hochul remains confident that the new law ""correcting outdated terminology"" will mitigate the ""harmful stigma against incarcerated people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/as-crime-rates-soar-new-york-gov-attempts-to-improve-public-safety-by-changing-law-so-that-inmates-will-now-be-referred-to-as-incarcerated-individuals,2022-08-09
"Washington teenager's pig fetches $95,000 at county fair — and cancer-stricken teen will donate half to charity","A teen's pig took a $95,000 prize at Washington's Asotin County Fair on Saturday, and the young man and his family are donating at least half of it to a cancer charity.

What are the details?

According to a report from the Lewiston Tribune, 18-year-old Asotin High School senior Bryson Stein — who has been battling cancer for the last several years — brought his pig to the fair and met some seriously generous bidders.

The teen suffers from synovial cell sarcoma, and was first diagnosed when he was just 13 years old.

Ahead of Saturday's bidding, Bryson and his family announced that they would donate half of the pig's winnings to a cancer charity in honor of the teen's battle.

The bidding began and quickly increased from $40 per pound to $100 per pound — and then jumped even higher.

""With everyone in the arena on their feet and clapping, the four bidders who had been battling decided to go in together and bought the pig for $400 per pound,"" the report noted.

The pig, named Cabala, ended up taking the record-breaking prize, raking in $95,000 for the teen and his family.

Bryson told the outlet on Sunday that the bidding war was ""awesome.""

""Everyone was going crazy, everyone was standing up and cheering,"" he said. ""It was pretty cool.""

Bryson's father, Craig, added, ""I thought it would go to about $30 a pound or something; I had no idea how big it would get. Thank God our community is a great community ... All those people who did it are just incredible.""

""Honestly, there wasn't a dry eye in the building,"" Craig added. ""Everybody and anybody was crying. It was heartfelt for sure ... Bryson is one of the strongest kids I know. It couldn't happen to a nicer kid. It's good for him, good for the community, and hopefully we're going to help some cancer patients and cancer research.""

What else?

Bryson — who plans to become an oncologist after high school — said that he plans to invest the remainder of his earnings.

""I don't plan on buying anything,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/asotin-fair-bryson-stein-pig,2022-04-25
Associated Press reporter canned over erroneous report suggesting Russia had launched a missile into a NATO country,"An award-winning Associated Press reporter got the boot on Monday after claiming that a ""senior U.S. intelligence official"" had said Russia fired a missile into Poland. Before the AP offered a correction, 35-year-old James LaPorta's report — containing an erroneous suggestion with potentially catastrophic and nuclear repercussions — was widely circulated, generating panic and stoking geopolitical tensions.

The facts

On Nov. 15, Russia launched a brutal missile barrage targeting energy infrastructure in western Ukraine. During the attack, Ukrainian air defenses reportedly fired an errant missile into Poland.

The resultant explosion rocked the Polish village of Przewodów, just five miles away from the Ukrainian border. Two farm workers were killed.

NATO, Polish, and American leaders suggested shortly after the explosion that it was not a direct Russian attack.

Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch told Poland's TVN24 channel days later that there ""are many indications that one of the (Ukrainian) missiles used to shoot down a Russian missile missed the target. Its self-destruct system did not work, and this missile unfortunately led to a tragedy.""

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called the claim that the explosion was Ukrainian-caused a ""conspiracy theory.""

Fake news, real consequences

Hours after the incident, the Associated Press issued a news alert co-bylined by LaPorta and reporter John Leicester, which stated, ""A senior U.S. intelligence official says Russian missiles crossed into NATO member Poland, killing two people.""

A Russian attack on Poland would have been sufficient to trigger articles 4 and 5 of the NATO charter, potentially putting the U.S. into direct conflict with the nuclear power.



The Washington Post noted that the AP report had been sent to and seen by thousands of news outlets. News organizations frequently reprint reports from the AP.

CNN firmed up the narrative, reporting that Poland ""confirms a Russian-made missile"" was behind the explosion. CNN reportedly omitted any mention of how the Ukrainian military also uses Russian-made weapons.

Fox News and the Daily Mail similarly carried the AP reporter's suggestion, the former running a piece entitled, ""Russian missiles cross into NATO member Poland, kill 2: senior US intelligence official,"" and the latter stating, ""'Russian bombs' kill two in POLAND.""

CBS Evening News tweeted ""RUSSIAN MISSILE STRIKE: Two Russian missiles crossed over the Ukrainian border into Poland, a NATO country, killing two civilians.""

Extra to cable news channels and print news organizations spreading the erroneous information, social media influencers began banging the drums of war on the basis of the AP report, signaling that Russia's war on Ukraine had finally spilled out into a NATO country.

For instance, Irish writer Jennifer Cassidy advanced the AP's claim to her 167,000 or more Twitter followers:

Although it is unclear whether he spoke out on the basis of the AP report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a forceful statement, saying, ""Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died.""

Were LaPorta's news alert true, then millions of people would have been promptly informed of the facts of the matter. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Retraction

After having updated the initial report several times, the AP indicated that a new assessment from three U.S. officials ""contradicts information"" in the original article. Shortly thereafter, the article was reportedly taken offline.

The AP issued a retraction later that day, writing: ""In earlier versions of a story published November 15, 2022, The Associated Press reported erroneously, based on information from a senior American intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity, that Russian missiles had crossed into Poland and killed two people. Subsequent reporting showed that the missiles were Russian-made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack.""

On Nov. 21, LaPorta, a former U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan, was fired. Co-byliner Leicester reportedly is still working at the AP.

An AP spokesman did not comment on LaPorta's firing, but told the Daily Beast that the ""rigorous editorial standards and practices of The Associated Press are critical to AP’s mission as an independent news organization. To ensure our reporting is accurate, fair and fact-based, we abide by and enforce these standards, including around the use of anonymous sources.""



Customarily, the AP ""requires more than one source when sourcing is anonymous,"" with an exception when a source is an authoritative figure who ""provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy.""

The Washington Post reported that LaPorta had received and shared the alleged U.S. intelligence official's tip in an electronic message around 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 15.

One editor asked whether to issue an alert on the basis of LaPorta's tip or to seek ""confirmation from another source and/or Poland?""

A second editor said she ""would vote"" for publishing an alert, noting she couldn't ""imagine a U.S. intelligence official would be wrong on this.""

Although this exchange may suggest wider culpability, the Post reported on the basis of an anonymous source at the AP that LaPorta allegedly told his editors that a senior manager had already vetted the source of his tip, even though that manager had not reviewed the missile story.

AP spokesman Lauren Easton indicated there will likely be no discipline for any AP editor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/associated-press-reporter-canned-over-report-suggesting-russia-had-launched-a-missile-into-a-nato-country,2022-11-22
"8 dead at Astroworld Festival, 300 injured in surge event","A ""mass casualty incident"" occurred on Friday night during the sold-out Astroworld music festival in Houston, Texas. At least eight people are dead following a surge of concert-goers who pushed their way closer to the stage during a performance by rapper Travis Scott.

There were an estimated 50,000 people in attendance at the music festival held at NRG Park – where the event turned deadly around 9 p.m. when the Houston native rapper took the stage.

""The crowd began to compress towards the front of the stage, and that caused some panic, and it started causing some injuries,"" Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña told reporters at a news conference. ""People began to fall out, become unconscious, and it created additional panic.""

Peña said the Houston Fire Department transported 17 patients to the hospital, ""11 of those transported were in cardiac arrest."" One 10-year-old child was critically injured, according to Fox News. At least 300 patients were seen at an onsite field hospital throughout the day.

Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite – who was near the front of the crowd – said the massive surge ""happened all at once."" He added that security knew at that moment it was time to end the concert prematurely.

""Suddenly we had several people down on the ground, experiencing some type of cardiac arrest or some type of medical episode,"" Satterwhite said. ""And so we immediately started doing CPR, and moving people right then, and that's when I went and met with the promoters, and Live Nation, and they agreed to end early in the interest of public safety.""

""A lot of times, kids don't make the best decisions,"" Satterwhite added. ""Because they're young and amped up…. I just think it was so many people — and passion — to see this entertainer. I don't know, and a lot of bad decisions""

Video from the concert shows people dancing on top of an emergency vehicle attempting to attend to those in distress.



Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said an investigation is needed to discover what caused the deadly event.



""I think it's very important that none of us speculate. Nobody has all the answers tonight,"" Finner said. ""We're going to do an investigation and find out because it's not fair to the producers, to anybody else involved, until we determine what happened, what caused the surge. We don't know, but we will find out.""

Finner also said they are working to confirm the identities of the deceased. He noted that the event had a ""good security plan,"" with 367 police officers and 241 security officers on hand.

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said, ""Our hearts are broken. People go to these events looking for a good time, a chance to unwind, to make memories. It's not the kind of event you go to where you expect to find out about fatalities. … Obviously, this is the last place we want to be – especially after we've been through so much as a community. But we have incredibly capable law enforcement officials here.""

Organizers of the Astroworld Festival released a statement on Saturday morning:

Our hearts are with the Astroworld Festival family tonight - especially those we lost and their loved ones. We are focused on supporting local officials however we can. With that in mind the festival will no longer be held on Saturday. As authorities mentioned in their press conference earlier, they are looking into the series of cardiac arrests that took place. If you have any relevant information on this, please reach out to Houston Police. Thank you to our partners at the Houston Police Department, Fire Department, and NRG Park for their response and support



Earlier Friday, a mob stormed through barricades to enter the festival. Around 2 p.m., people are seen on the ground being trampled by the crowd. There were reportedly three injuries linked to the storming of the venue gates.

Day 2 of the Astroworld Festival that was scheduled for Saturday has been canceled.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/astroworld-festival-deaths-injuries-concert,2021-11-06
'Biological males' competing as females 'are just taking it away from us': HS athlete blasts Biden DOJ for turning back on transgender lawsuit,"Alanna Smith took it right to biological males who compete as transgender females and then steal awards, accolades, and attention leading to life-changing things like college scholarships from biological female athletes.

""A lot of biological females have missed out on making it to meets that really matter,"" Smith, a Connecticut track athlete, told Fox News Wednesday, adding that ""the transgender athletes have taken spots on the podium that belong to biological females. We train for so many days a week, so many hours to be able to be the best in our state and the best in our region, and these biological males are just taking it away from us, and we really deserve it.""

What's the background?

Smith — as readers of TheBlaze may recall — joined Selina Soule and Chelsea Mitchell in a federal lawsuit about a year ago challenging the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference's policy of letting males compete in girls' sports. At that point a pair of biological males who identify as females — Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood — had been crushing the competition in girls' high school sprint events in Connecticut.

What's more, then-Attorney General William Barr signed a ""statement of interest"" arguing against the CIAC's policy.

But those days are long gone — and with Democratic President Joe Biden now sitting in the Oval Office, his Justice Department unsurprisingly withdrew support for the lawsuit. And it's a decision Smith told Fox News she found ""disappointing.""



What else did Smith say?

Smith — who said she missed out on coming in second place in a 200-meter sprint when a transgender female finished ahead of her — told the network that she and other female athletes ""have worked really hard to get our stories out there to get people to realize that fairness needs to be restored in our sport and in all other women's sports.""

What did Smith's attorney have to say?

Smith's attorney, Christiana Holcomb of Alliance Defending Freedom, told Fox News that the lawsuit will proceed despite the new DOJ's ""politically motivated"" decision to back away from it.

""What is even more concerning is this effort to gut legal protection for women is not just isolated to what we see in Connecticut,"" Holcomb added to the network. ""Even now, the Biden administration is pushing the so-called Equality Act, which ignores the physical differences between men and women and threatens women's privacy, women's homeless shelters, and yes, even women's sports on a national level for female athletes like Alanna.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/athlete-blasts-biden-doj-transgender-lawsuit,2021-02-25
Audubon Naturalist Society to change name since John James Audubon — born in 1785 — was a slave owner and 'white supremacist',"The Audubon Naturalist Society — a leading environmental nonprofit that's more than a century old — will change its name due to John James Audubon's racist reputation, the Washingtonian reported.

What are the details?

Audubon was an American naturalist who lived from 1785 to 1851 and is famous for his study and drawings of birds. But controversy over his past has put Audubon under a negative spotlight: The Washington Post earlier this year ran a lengthy feature on the subject, titled ""The racist legacy many birds carry,"" which was met with a good bit of mockery:

And the Audubon Naturalist Society is taking action.

No longer a 'suitable namesake for us'

""It's very exciting here at ANS. We've been working over a decade to think very carefully about the region we serve — one of the most diverse in the nation,"" executive director Lisa Alexander told the Washingtonian. ""As we began to dig into serving all people in the DC region, we also started to get a fair amount of publicity about who Audubon was — an enslaver of black people, a published white supremacist. He just didn't seem like a suitable namesake for us.""

The outlet said ANS over the last decade has focused on inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility for the first time in over a century and created two annual conferences to highlight environmentalists of color: Taking Nature Black and Naturally Latinos.

The Washingtonian added that ANS is the ""first major Audubon-affiliated organization to scrub the naturalist from its name."" The aforementioned Washington Post article highlighted a different group — the National Audubon Society — and quoted its interim chief executive, who said she's ""deeply troubled by the racist actions of John James Audubon.""

While the Washingtonian said the National Audubon Society announced no plans to change its name, the outlet noted that the Audubon Naturalist Society will take a year to figure out a new moniker — and likely will simply use its ANS acronym in the interim.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/audubon-naturalist-society-change-name-slave-owner-white-supremacist,2021-10-28
Swift backlash hits CNN after outlet says murdered Uber Eats driver died in 'accident',"CNN ignited a firestorm of backlash over the weekend after characterizing what police called ""felony murder"" as a mere accident.

What is the background?

Two teenager girls — ages 13 and 15 — were charged with felony murder after allegedly carjacking Mohammad Anwar in Washington, D.C., last Tuesday.

Police say the teenagers attacked Anwar with a stun gun during the carjacking. The car later crashed, and Anwar died from injuries after being thrown from the vehicle. Anwar was a Pakistani immigrant who moved to America in 2014 to build a better life for his family.

The enhanced murder charges against the teenagers stem from a legal doctrine that ""allows a killing that occurs in the course of a dangerous felony, even an accidental death, to be charged against the felon as first-degree murder,"" according to Nolo's Plain-English Law Dictionary.

Video of the shocking incident later circulated on social media, showing the alleged carjacking in progress and the car speed away with Anwar hanging outside. The car can be heard crashing as the videographer races toward the scene. Nearby National Guardsmen pull the teenage girls from the wrecked car, which rested on its side, as Anwar's mangled body twitched on the nearby ground. The video showed witnesses failed to provide Anwar with aid.

One of the teenage girls can be heard saying, ""Please, my phone is in there. My phone is in there.""

What did CNN say?

The news outlet posted on Twitter Saturday that Anwar died because of ""an accident in which he was fatally injured

""Police said the girls, 13 and 15, assaulted an Uber Eats driver with a Taser while carjacking him, which led to an accident in which he was fatally injured,"" CNN tweeted, along with a link its story on the crime.

What was the reaction?

CNN was universally condemned for its framing of what police say was ""felony murder."" Many critics suggested the race of the suspects, both of whom are black, played a role in CNN softening the language used to describe the crime.

In fact, by Sunday morning, CNN's framing of the crime as an ""accident"" was one of Twitter's top trending topics with more than 100,000 tweets.

""HEY! ANYBODY HOME? THIS IS NOT AN 'ACCIDENT,'"" liberal commentator Keith Olbermann said.

""These girls made a whoopsie when they murdered this man. Total accident. They were in wrong place at wrong time! They're good kids! Kids murder in cold blood/ make mistakes,"" comedian Tim Dillon mocked.

""Wonder what took CNN so long to report what the rest of us did days ago. Doesn't advance their poisonous race narrative, that's why,"" Fox News host Laura Ingraham reacted.

""A white man shoots 6 Asians and 2 white people, and he is a white supremacist. A middle eastern man shoots up a store, and well, 'Don't jump to conclusions,' they say. 2 young black girls assault a man with a taser and murder him, and it's an accident. Oh, the hypocrisy,"" another person said.

Two girls murdered a man after car jacking him. Fixed it for you,"" another person responded.

""They murdered him and one of the girls was more concerned with her cellphone still being in the car than the man she just murdered laying dead on the sidewalk,"" one person noted.

""If these girls were white, this headline would be worded much differently and the outrage factor would be dialed up,"" another person said.

""fair to ask why national media highlight certain local crime activity and not others,"" one person suggested.

""It's always interesting how CNN and other news organizations are highly selective when determining whether or not it's worth mentioning the demographics of those involved in incidents such as this,"" another person noted.

""So they 'accidentally' killed him?"" another person questioned.

""'Fatally injured' is a weird way to say MURDERED,"" another person said.

Fortunately, more than $400,000 had been raised for Anwar's family by Sunday afternoon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/backlash-cnn-felony-murder-accident,2021-03-28
CNN contributor says Democrats opposed to ending filibuster are just like 'segregationists' who opposed civil rights,"CNN contributor Bakari Sellers compared Democrats who are opposed to ending the filibuster to those who were opposed to granting civil rights for African-Americans in the sixties.

Sellers made the comments on CNN Tuesday after a report detailing the lack of support among Senate Democrats needed to change U.S. Senate regulations in order to push a voting rights act through Congress.

""This is as clear as I can be, Jake, and Chris Coons is a friend of mine,"" said Sellers to Jake Tapper.

""But if [Sens.] Chris Coons (D-Del.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) want to be on the side of George Wallace, want to be on the side of Strom Thurmond, and many others who stood in the way of civil rights, even Strom Thurmond came around on voting rights, but if they want to go down in history as standing on the side of segregationists and those who opposed people who look like me having free and fair access to the ballot, then we will remember them as such,"" he continued.

""This is that type of moment and this is the urgency we have to have!"" Sellers concluded.

Sellers' comments were prompted by a speech from President Joe Biden in which he fully endorsed a carve-out for ending filibuster rules for the voting legislation endorsed by Democrats but opposed by Republicans.

CNN anchor Kasie Hunt opined in a tweet that Biden was too weak in the polls to be able to influence any senator to change their vote on the filibuster.

""President Joe Biden, freshly elected, changing his position on the filibuster might have moved the needle in the Senate,"" she tweeted.

""Might have,"" she emphasized. ""It’s a much steeper climb now, as his approval rating downward trend clearly shows.""

Abby Phillips, another CNN anchor, called Biden's comments ""too little, too late"" and said that congressional sources indicated that Biden had not moved the needle at all toward the rule change among Democrats or Republicans.

"Failed Baltimore students this year will pass, school board","Baltimore students who failed this year during the coronavirus pandemic will not be held back. Instead, they will receive a passing grade and graduate to the next level, the city's school board recently announced.

Baltimore students who failed classes during the 2020-2021 school year will still pass on to the next grade will not be penalized. The announcement was made during Tuesday's virtual school board meeting.

""As we approach the end of the 2020-2021 school year, we all recognize that students have experienced incredibly significant challenges and interruptions in their learning,"" said Baltimore City Public Schools CEO Sonja Santelises. ""With that in mind, the district has developed a fair and straightforward process for evaluating and recording students' progress in the current school year.""



""In all of these instances we want to emphasize the word 'yet,"" Santelises said. ""Not completed yet. No credit yet.""

""Community and school members have been evaluating grading methods that reflect the 'unique circumstances' that 'Black people have faced,'"" Fox News reported.



Baltimore City Schools Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said during the meeting that the district is committed to its students and recognizes ""the challenges they have faced this academic school year.""

""We are going to avoid the punitive approach to failing students and the default reaction to unfairly retain students,"" she said. ""Instead, we are going to … commit to our students as we plan for a multi-year academic recovery.""

Pre-K, kindergarten, and first-grade students will have no changes to the grading system. For grades two through five, any student who received an ""unsatisfactory"" grade would have it changed to a ""not complete"" grade. Students who failed middle and high school levels would receive a ""No Credit,"" which means that the students didn't actually pass their school course, but would still advance to the next grade level. Failing students would be given an opportunity to complete their ""NC"" classes to earn credits over the summer.

Maryland's Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford sounded the alarm about the possible negative implications of passing children to the next grade who failed this year during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""There's so much learning loss that occurred this last year as well as just people falling through the cracks, I think that we are just pushing a problem down the road that we are all going to deal with and in another couple of years,"" Rutherford told WBFF-TV. ""I think it's creating a major challenge going forward.""



Rutherford pointed out the flaws in the Baltimore school system's decision to pass all students regardless of merit.



""I understand that they're not going to get a failure on their transcript, but they won't get credit. It's almost the same thing,"" Rutherford noted. ""I don't see how you can move to the next grade if you're not getting credit.""

""We've already had a challenging situation with many of our school districts, particularly Baltimore City, and it's going to be even worse"" Rutherford warned.

A 2019 report found that Baltimore City Schools were the third-most funded school system in the United States with $16,184 being paid per student. Despite the money pouring into Baltimore's education system, the report ranked Baltimore as the third-lowest performing large school system in America.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/baltimore-students-failed-pass-covid,2021-05-30
'You should think seriously about an electric vehicle': Bank Australia to phase out loans for gas and diesel vehicles by 2025,"A small Australian bank has just made major waves in the global conversation regarding electric vehicles. Bank Australia is expected to announce formally that it will no longer offer loans for gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2025.

""We think that the responsible thing for us to do next, is to ensure that our vehicle lending doesn’t lock our customers in to higher carbon emissions and increasingly expensive running costs in the years ahead,"" Sasha Courville, the Bank Australia chief impact officer, recently said in a statement.

""Ultimately, our announcement today is the beginning of a conversation with our customers,"" the statement continues, ""and a signal to the wider market that if you’re considering buying a new car, you should think seriously about an electric vehicle – both for its impact on the climate and for its lifetime cost savings.""

Bank Australia, which is owned by its 185,000 members, claims to be a financial institution committed to ""a fair and inclusive society"" and ""a world where people and the planet thrive."" So this attempt to incentivize people to eschew vehicles that use gas or diesel in favor of EVs is in keeping with the company brand.

However, despite enthusiasm from the likes of Bank Australia and the Greens Australian political party, EVs have not sold well thus far. Reports claim that in 2021, EVs composed just 2% of new car purchases made throughout the country and just 9% of new car purchases made throughout the world.

Still, Bank Australia seems to be attempting to tap into consumer frustration with high gas prices, as it has pitched the move as a means of liberating prospective buyers from ""higher carbon emissions and increasingly expensive running costs.""

And the bank admits that many car buyers do not want to purchase a new vehicle, either because of circumstances or personal preference. To accommodate the needs of those customers, it will still offer loans for used vehicles with internal combustion engines, even after the 2025 deadline has expired.

""While we will cease car loans for new fossil fuel cars from 2025, we are deeply aware that we need to support people not yet able to afford an electric vehicle while the market grows,"" Courville said.

According to the Guardian, Bank Australia is expected to officially announce this new policy at a national EV summit on Friday. Australia's climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, is likewise expected to speak at the summit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bank-australia-loans-gas-vehicles,2022-08-24
ESG-supporting Bank of America offers special mortgages to black and Hispanic communities,"The Bank of America Corporation announced new zero down payment, zero closing cost mortgages – but the offer is only available for black and Hispanic communities.

On Tuesday, Bank of America rolled out a new ""special purpose credit program"" called the ""Community Affordable Loan Solution."" Bank of America said that the zero down payment, zero closing cost mortgages will only be available to first-time homebuyers in ""black/African American and/or Hispanic-Latino neighborhoods in Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Miami.""

The press release from Bank of America did not mention that the offer was available to other minority communities, such as Asian, Native American, or Pacific Islander. The lender also did not make the offer to white communities.



""Homeownership strengthens our communities and can help individuals and families to build wealth over time,"" said AJ Barkley, head of neighborhood and community lending at Bank of America. “Our Community Affordable Loan Solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more black and Hispanic families, and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve.”



Barkley told Bloomberg that applicants don't need to disclose their race. The megabank will utilize U.S. Census data to determine which eligible neighborhoods are predominately black or Hispanic.

ESG-supporting Bank of America said, ""The Community Affordable Loan Solution aims to help eligible individuals and families obtain an affordable loan to purchase a home.""

The advantageous mortgage program will not use credit scores, but instead will be ""based on factors such as timely rent, utility bill, phone, and auto insurance payments.""

NBC News noted, ""The loans require no mortgage insurance — the additional fee typically charged to buyers who put down less than 20% of the purchase price.""

Bank of America stated, ""Individual eligibility is based on income and home location.""

Bank of America justified the enticing mortgage program by citing a report from the National Association of Realtors that found that the homeownership rate for black Americans was nearly 30% less than white Americans in 2020. The gap between white Americans and Hispanic Americans was nearly 20 percentage points.

The report also noted that Hispanic American homeownership is at an all-time high and above 50% for the first time. In addition, the report said that Asians were the racial group least likely to be rejected for mortgage loans.

According to data compiled by Bloomberg, ""Approval rates for homeowners looking to lower their payments have also varied by race, with BofA approving 66% of black refinancing applicants and 78% of white ones in 2020.""

There is no minimum or maximum loan size under the Community Affordable Loan Solution.

Bank of America did not specify the scope of the program.

Bank of America also announced the launch of a new ""Small Business Down Payment Program."" The special purpose credit program will cater to minority and women business owners in an effort to ""help create generational wealth opportunities"" for ""historically disadvantaged small business borrowers.""

The National Fair Housing Alliance defines special purpose credit programs as ""a way for financial institutions to meet the special credit needs of people who have been impacted by lending discrimination, systemic racism, and redlining.""

In February, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) – ""an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System"" created after the Great Recession that ""empowers consumers with the information they need to make financial decisions in the best interests of them and their families"" – urged ""lenders to explore opportunities available to them to increase credit access through special purpose credit programs (SPCPs) to better serve historically disadvantaged individuals and communities.""

Brian Moynihan is the CEO of Bank of America and the chairman of the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council.

Bank of America boasts of a collaboration with the WEF ""to support social and environmental progress through investment, philanthropy, and responsible business operations.""

In May, Moynihan told Financial News that the transition to ESG is a “big business opportunity” for the bank.

In March, Politico noted that Moynihan had ""pushed an environmental, social, and governance agenda that seems to be working for shareholders"" since he was named the CEO of Bank of America.

A blog post on the Bank of America website posted in January 2021 reads: ""While profits and shareholder value remain vital, stakeholder capitalism places a high value on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Stakeholder capitalism repositions capitalism to play an essential role in solving climate change, poverty, hunger, and other challenges outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).""

Former AG Barr slams 'secular progressive orthodoxy' in 'government-run schools' in first speech since leaving DOJ,"In his first public address since leaving the Trump administration, former Attorney General Bill Barr criticized the ""secular progressive orthodoxy through government-run schools"" and suggested public funding for education may be unconstitutional given the hostility of state-funded schools toward religious believers.

""The time has come to admit that the approach of giving militantly secularist government schools a monopoly over publicly funded education has become a disaster,"" Barr said at an event in Naples, Florida, according to Fox News.

The former attorney general said ideology running rampant through the public school system is incompatible with traditional Christianity and other major religions in the U.S. As such, he suggested ""it may no longer be fair, practical or even constitutional to provide publicly funded education solely through the vehicle of state-funded schools.""

Barr made these remarks at the Council for National Policy's annual meeting, where he received an award from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal group that defends religious liberty.

His speech touched on critical race theory being taught in the classroom as part of Black Lives Matter curricula, which he called ""Marxism substituting race for class antagonism,"" and also on school materials that promote the idea that gender is not immutable, but rather fluid and open to self-interpretation.

""This is not established science,"" said Barr, but is rather the ""moral, psychological, metaphysical dogma of the new orthodoxy.""

He called these ideas ""a broadsided attack on natural law.""

""It's monstrous of the state to indoctrinate students into alternate belief systems,"" he added.

Conservatives and Republican elected officials who represent them have become increasingly concerned about what children are being taught in school as U.S. test scores show American students continuing to fall behind the rest of the developed world in reading and mathematics.

Several Republican-controlled state legislatures have passed or advanced legislation that would ban or impose restrictions on teaching critical race theory in public schools. The marxist, post-modern theory, which has roots in legal scholarship, is premised on the idea that race is a socially constructed concept historically used by white people to oppress and exploit non-white people. Proponents of the theory maintain that U.S. institutions are inherently racist because they have discriminated against minorities in the past and produced inequitable outcomes for them when compared to white people living today.

GOP states have also moved to enact laws prohibiting transgender athletes who were born males but identify as or have begun to transition to female from playing on girls sports teams.

Parents have also spoken out against sexually explicit material being taught in the classroom.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/barr-secular-progressive-orthodoxy-government-schools,2021-05-21
Sen. Sasse rips Democrat's 'sinister ... paranoid obsession' that the FBI conducted a 'fake' investigation of Justice Kavanaugh,"Left-wing progressive Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made headlines this week with his letter to U.S Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding the Department of Justice look into the FBI's ""perhaps fake"" investigation of allegations of misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh that were brought up during his 2018 Supreme Court nomination hearings.

Whitehouse has made a bit of a name for himself with his rabid rants against and conspiracy theories about Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices.

For example, the far-left New England Democrat garnered a lot of attention for a long-winded diatribe about a conspiracy connecting ""dark money"" to federal courts that he believed he had uncovered and then ""exposed"" during the nomination hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Now GOP Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) is standing up to Whitehouse and telling him to knock it off, warning that his most recent nonsense is a threat to the republic.

What happened?

Whitehouse sent a letter to Garland on Monday accusing the FBI of conducting ""a politically-constrained and perhaps fake FBI investigation into alleged misconduct by now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.""

The senator was upset that the law enforcement agency did not find corroboration of the allegations against Kavanaugh — corroboration that the justice's accusers failed to provide themselves.

Whitehouse claimed that the FBI ignored multiple witnesses and sent ""tips"" down a virtual ""garbage chute."" He went on to accuse FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""stonewalling"" congressional inquiries about the investigation.

Following publication of Whitehouse's allegations, Sen. Sasse decided it was time to punch back against the Democratic senator's ongoing ""sinister"" bloviation that, according to the Nebraska senator, is actually a threat to the nation.

“If senators want to join conspiracy theory book clubs, wear tinfoil hats, and talk about Roswell, that's their prerogative, but this is something more sinister,"" Sasse, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee with Whitehouse, told National Review.

Whitehouse's rhetoric goes beyond political differences over SCOTUS nominees, Sasse said. Now, the Rhode Island senator is actually attempting to use the Justice Department to take down a member of the nation's highest court.

""A United States Senator who once peddled lies about a Supreme Court nominee is now trying to weaponize the DOJ against a sitting Supreme Court Justice,"" Sasse added. ""This kind of paranoid obsession is Nixonian poison to public trust.""

Not the first Sasse-vs.-Whitehouse conspiracy kerfuffle

This isn't the first time Sasse has taken Whitehouse to task for his conspiracy twaddle.

In July, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a government panel that creates binding conduct guidelines for federal judges, was considering changing its rules in order to ban judges from being members of the Federalist Society, at least in part at the urging of Sen. Whitehouse, who has repeatedly attempted to connect the organization with ""dark money"" plots and underhanded conservative movements.

The committee ultimately decided against the Federalist Society membership ban, to which Sasse responded with thanks and a dig at Whitehouse's penchant for perpetuating conspiracy theories.

""I'm glad the Judicial Conference decided not to participate in a vicious liberal smear campaign against the Federalist Society,"" Sasse said. ""Senator Whitehouse can hyperventilate about the Illuminati all he wants, but the Federalist Society is a group of law students and lawyers with diverse opinions who formed a debate society. Because they take the Constitution and the rule of law seriously, they've been the target of a ruthless blitz that will ultimately erode confidence in an independent and fair Judiciary. The Judicial Conference made the right call.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ben-sasse-sheldon-whitehouse-paranoid-obsession-brett-kavanaugh,2021-03-17
"Bernie Sanders: Enough 'talk about numbers,' now is 'the time to borrow' for gargantuan spending packages","Outspoken socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lamented this week all the ""talk about numbers"" and ""process"" surrounding the Biden administration's mammoth $6 trillion budget proposal, arguing such needless deliberation ignores ""the needs of working-class Americans.""

Rather than carefully considering spending trillions of dollars in taxpayer money, the senator proclaimed that Congress should just borrow the money now and figure out how to pay for it later.

Speaking with MSNBC's Chris Hayes on Sunday about the spending package, Sanders said, ""One of the things that has bothered me in the last month or so is this: a lot of talk about numbers — $6 trillion, big number — a lot of talk about process. You know what there is not a lot of talk about? About the needs of working-class Americans and what we have got to do.""

Sanders went on to argue that with ""real wages"" in America today ""lower than they were 48 years ago"" and wealth disparity only increasing, Congress must act quickly to retain the faith of the American people. To do so, he argued, lawmakers must make gargantuan investments in progressive wish list items such as climate initiatives, free education, free health care, paid family leave, housing stipends, and more.

""First of all, you got to deal with climate. Right now, the West Coast is, you know, aflame in a sense,"" he said. ""It's record-breaking, heatwave, Australia, etc. We have got to deal with climate. And if we do not significantly invest in transforming our energy system, future generations will never forgive us.""

Bernie Sanders: People Are 'Sick And Tired' Of Working For Inadequate Wages youtu.be

""We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth,"" he continued. ""That is why we have to extend or make permanent the child tax credit, $300 per child for working-class families. Does anyone deny that our child care system is totally dysfunctional? We've got to deal with that.""



""In the richest country on Earth, you got to elderly people have no teeth in their mouth because Medicare does not cover dental, we don't cover hearing aids, we don't cover eyeglasses. We have got to do that. We have got to have universal pre-K. We have got to have a major housing bill ... we got to make higher education affordable,"" the lawmaker noted.



Near the end of Sanders' lengthy rundown, even Hayes appeared to grow weary.

The left-leaning anchor asked: ""Is there some part of you that worries about a level of spending that is too much for the economy to deal with?

In response, Sanders trotted out his classic argument, asserting that the programs would be largely covered ""by demanding that the wealthiest people and largest corporations start paying their fair share of taxes.""

But then the socialist lawmaker acknowledged that for the excess, borrowing and figuring out how to pay it back later will do, given the current low interest rates.

""Let me tell you, what I think most economists would agree with, and that is, at a time when we have record-breaking low interest rates, now is precisely the time to borrow and invest in one-time infrastructure projects,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-now-is-time-to-borrow,2021-06-30
"Mouthy leftist Bette Midler actually claims Planned Parenthood 'isn't killing children,' chalks up their deaths to the NRA — and gets bashed for it","Bette Midler — the outspoken left-wing activist who's also known for singing and acting — posted a tweet over the weekend actually claiming Planned Parenthood ""isn't killing children"" and that the National Rifle Association really is to blame for their deaths:

“Planned Parenthood isn’t killing children,” Midler's tweeted meme states. “You’re thinking of the NRA.”



Say what?

The Daily Wire pointed out that while the NRA supports legal and responsible gun ownership and provides firearms training, it doesn't sell guns or ammunition.

But according to Planned Parenthood's most recently available stats, the organization performed 354,871 abortions in its 2019-2020 fiscal year — and a number of commenters on Midler's tweet argued in that spirit, saying Planned Parenthood certainly does kill children.

""Funny, I haven’t killed anyone, and I’m a lifelong NRA member. I also don’t know anyone who owns a firearm, that has killed a child with said firearm. However, I can name several acquaintances who have had abortions — some multiple abortions,"" one commenter replied.

""Planned Parenthood was designed to eradicate the black children in the U.S. by Margaret Sanger. It is still going on today. 79% of Planned Parenthood offices are in poor neighborhoods,"" another user told Midler. ""What does that tell you?""

""So why is it considered double homicide to kill a pregnant woman? If it's not 'killing a baby'? And NRA isn't killing people. People are killing people. With knives, swords, guns, blunt objects, cars, hands, etc.,"" another commenter pointed out.

""Planned Parenthood has been murdering babies for decades...that's their main purpose for existing...taxpayers should not have to pay for other people's abortions...you fund them..please post examples of the NRA killing babies...you liberal lunatic..."" another user wrote.

And then there was this comeback:

Hooray, there's more!

Midler's tweet was far from her only social media activity in the wake of last week's news of a leaked draft decision from the Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal across the country in 1973:

She just can't keep that thing buttoned, can she?

Biden says abortion should be codified into federal law. But he once supported overturning Roe v. Wade.,"President Joe Biden released a statement Tuesday demanding that abortion rights be codified into federal law.

The statement came after Politico leaked a Supreme Court draft opinion that indicated the court will overturn abortion precedents. Chief Justice John Roberts has confirmed that the draft is authentic.

What did Biden say?

The president called on lawmakers to pass legislation codifying abortion rights into federal law and urged that more ""pro-choice"" lawmakers be elected.

""[I]f the Court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November,"" Biden said.

""At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law,"" he added.

The president also claimed that Roe v. Wade should not be overturned because it ""has been the law of the land for almost fifty years"" and ""basic fairness and the stability of our law"" demand that it remain intact.

Such an argument is perhaps the weakest for not overturning Roe. In fact, nothing prevents the Supreme Court from overturning landmark decisions.

If justices complied with universal stare decisis (the legal doctrine of honoring court precedent), then segregation might still be legal. For example, when the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 that segregation is unconstitutional, the court overturned the existing ""law of the land,"" the 1896 Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson, a landmark ruling that said ""separate but equal"" was constitutional.

Still, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed Tuesday to hold a vote on abortion legislation.

But what did Biden do before?

When Biden was a U.S. senator, he supported a proposed constitutional amendment that sought to overturn Roe v. Wade and do exactly what Alito suggested should happen regarding abortion rights: return the issue to state legislatures.

According to the New York Times, the so-called ""Hatch-Eagleton Amendment"" passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1982 with Biden's support.

The amendment simply declared, ""A right to abortion is not secured by the Constitution.""

Ultimately, the amendment failed to pass the Senate by a 49-50 vote, thus falling 18 votes short of passing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-abortion-codified-federal-law,2022-05-03
Biden admin unveils Title IX rules intended to get transgender athletes back in girls' sports,"The U.S. Department of Education on Thursday released its long-awaited overhaul of Title IX rules, undoing one of the major achievements of the Trump administration under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act prohibits sex discrimination at educational institutions that receive federal funding. Under the Biden administration's proposed rule change, the definition of ""sex"" would be expanded to include sexual identity and gender orientation, which proponents say would prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in schools.



The Biden administration would also roll back several Trump-era due process protections for students accused of sexual harassment. When DeVos was education secretary, she released a rule that permitted those accused of sexual misconduct greater opportunity to defend themselves during Title IX proceedings.

The rules, which were controversial at the time, required that alleged ""sexual harassment"" had to be ""so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activities"" in order to trigger Title IX proceedings.

Due process advocates praised the Trump administration for ensuring that colleges and universities give those accused of sexual harassment a fair opportunity to defend themselves during live hearings and cross-examination. But critics said the rules made it harder for victims of sexual assault to seek justice against the person who violated them.

""Over the last 50 years, Title IX has paved the way for millions of girls and women to access equal opportunity in our nation's schools and has been instrumental in combating sexual assault and sexual violence in educational settings,"" Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said Thursday.

""As we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of this landmark law, our proposed changes will allow us to continue that progress and ensure all our nation's students – no matter where they live, who they are, or whom they love – can learn, grow, and thrive in school. We welcome public comment on these critical regulations so we can further the Biden-Harris Administration's mission of creating educational environments free from sex discrimination and sexual violence,"" he added.

A potential consequence of the Biden administration's new Title IX rules is that schools that do not allow gender dysphoric male athletes to compete on women's sports teams could lose federal funding.

The Biden administration is setting up a conflict with 18 states that have enacted laws prohibiting men who identify as women from playing in girls and women's sports leagues.

DeVos called the new rules ""a bridge too far"" in an interview with Fox News Thursday.

""That they would attempt to expand the definition of biological sex through a rulemaking process, it really is a bridge too far,"" she said. ""And I hope that, and I trust that many people will raise their voices if what is rumored to be true actually unfolds.""

""They're also getting a ton of pushback from people who are concerned about protecting women's sports in particular, and protecting the very important due process protections that we ensured were a part of the whole Title IX requirements for how institutions must handle these issues,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-admin-unveils-title-ix-rules-that-get-transgender-athletes-back-in-girls-sports,2022-06-23
Biden administration declares support for sex-change surgeries and hormone substitutions for minors,"President Joe Biden's administration has released documents endorsing sex-change surgeries and cross-sex hormone substitutions for minors under the politically correct and inaccurate label of ""gender-affirming care.""

The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs on Thursday released a document titled, ""Gender Affirming Care for Young People."" Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Child Traumatic Stress Network — which operates under the authority of HHS — released a document declaring, ""Gender-Affirming Care is Trauma-Informed Care.""

The HHS documents, first reported by Fox News, assert that ""gender-affirming care"" is the ""standard of care for transgender, gender diverse, and intersex youth"" that is approved by ""major medical associations,"" including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics. These groups say that the best medical care for transgender minors is to affirm their self-proclaimed gender identities, rather than affirm and teach them to accept the bodies they were born with.



Biden's administration supports applying puberty blockers to children who identify as transgender to prevent them from developing naturally. The documents suggest that cross-sex hormone substitution is beneficial in ""early adolescence and onward,"" specifically ""Testosterone hormones for those who were assigned female at birth"" and ""Estrogen hormones for those who were assigned male at birth.""

Cross-sex hormones substitutions are only ""partially reversible,"" according to the OPA fact sheet. They also have unmentioned risk factors, including blood clots, stroke, heart disease, certain cancers, liver damage, and infertility.

While sex-change surgeries are ""typically used in adulthood,"" the document observes they can be used ""case-by-case in adolescence."" These include mutilating ""'Top surgery' — to create male-typical chest shape or enhance breasts,"" and ""'Bottom' surgery — surgery on genitals or reproductive organs."" These surgeries are ""not reversible.""

""Medical and psychosocial gender affirming healthcare practices have been demonstrated to yield lower rates of adverse mental health outcomes, build self-esteem, and improve overall quality of life for transgender and gender diverse youth,"" OPA states.

The second document from NCTSN is longer and more detailed than the fact-sheet from OPA, but it shares the basic contention that ""gender-affirming care broadly refers to creating an environment that facilitates youth to move through the world safely as the gender they know themselves to be.""

""Providing gender-affirming care is neither child maltreatment nor malpractice,"" NCTSN states, in what appears to be a direct rebuke of action taken by Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott (R) to have state agencies investigate sex-change procedures for transgender minors as ""child abuse.""

""The child welfare system in the US, charged with 'improv[ing] the overall health and well-being of our nation’s children and families,' should not be used to deny care or separate families working to make the best decisions for their children’s well-being. There is no scientifically sound research showing negative impacts from providing gender-affirming care,"" NCTSN claims.

The documents, and an accompanying video from President Joe Biden, were released as part of ""Transgender Day of Visibility,"" an annual event founded by activist Rachel Crandall on March 31, 2009, to raise awareness for transgender people and issues.

Biden instructed parents of children who identify as transgender that ""affirming your child's identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe.""

The president also announced that his administration would take steps to fight laws that prohibit gender dysphoric males from competing against women in sports, such as the ""Fairness in Women's Sports"" laws passed in several Republican-controlled states.

Biden called these laws ""simply wrong"" and ""hateful,"" declaring that his administration is ""standing up for transgender equality in the classroom, on the playing field, at work, in our military, in our housing and health care systems – everywhere.""



A judge in Texas has blocked the governor's order asking state agencies to investigate sex-change procedures for minors as ""child abuse."" A lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal accuses the order of being unconstitutional.

Biden administration spent $324 million in taxpayer funds on illegal immigrants' dental and health care at holding facilities,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued its annual report last week, revealing the lengths to which the Biden administration has gone to take care of illegal immigrants who flouted American laws and stole into the nation.

The ICE Health Service Corps' operating budget in 2022 was roughly $324 million, representing an increase of $8 million over the previous year.

According to the annual ICE report, that money was spent on providing ""direct care – including medical and dental health services – to over 118,000 non-citizens housed at 19 IHSC-operated facilities throughout the United States, which exceeded 1.1 million visits over the course of the fiscal year.""

The IHSC ""also oversaw compliance with healthcare-related detention standards for more than 120,500 non-citizens housed in 163 non-IHSC-staffed facilities.""

Among these foreign nationals were illegal immigrants, 2.37 million of whom poured over the southern border last year, and nearly 500,000 of whom had already been encountered by the end of November this fiscal year.

One perk of breaking into the country and landing in ICE custody is ""an initial medical screening, including for mental health needs, as well as all necessary follow-up care"" at taxpayers' expense.

Individuals flagged as ""public safety"" or flight risks are also rendered these services.

This care is administered by 1,640 U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers, civil servants, and contract health professionals at ICE-owned facilities and elsewhere.

According to composite scores recently developed by Gallup along with the nonprofit organization West Health, nearly 112 million (44%) of Americans are presently struggling to pay for health care.

West Health noted in a March 31, 2022, press release that unlike the illegal immigrants in ICE detention facilities, over a third of ""cost desperate [American] adults report that they have cut back on utilities, and half have cut back on food in the past 12 months to pay for necessary healthcare.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted in 2020 that 31.6 million Americans had health insurance, largely those under the age of 65.

3.7 million American children were found to have been uninsured.

While more and more foreign nationals enjoy services that tens of millions of Americans don't have, U.S. taxpayers bear a greater and greater burden.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform published a study in September showing that to provide for the needs of illegal immigrants who've entered the U.S. under Biden, taxpayers must shoulder burden of an additional $20.4 billion every year.

FAIR revealed that this annual figure was not included in the estimated $140 billion per year that taxpayers were already footing, which compensates for the provision of services and benefits to the ""longer-term"" illegal immigrant population.

In 2018 – years before the border crisis ballooned under Biden – Forbes reported that Americans cross-subsidized health care for illegal immigrants to the tune of $18.5 billion a year.

A new Los Angeles Times/YouGov survey conducted between Dec. 9 and 14 highlighted how the Biden administration's immigration policies are widely unpopular.

The Center Square reported that 64% of respondents said illegal immigration is a problem while 42% said that they should be ejected to their countries of origin.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who announced this week that he was suing the Biden administration over a rule that penalizes taxpayers to pay down the cost of illegal immigration, said that the Biden administration ""is committed to opening the borders to aliens who lack the ability to take care of themselves. Texans should not have to pay for these costly immigrants, nor should any other American.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-spent-324-million-in-taxpayer-dollars-on-criminal-noncitizens-dental-and-health-care,2023-01-06
Biden administration details vaccination plan for kids ages 5 to 11,"The White House on Wednesday told reporters the details of its plan to provide COVID-19 vaccines to millions of U.S. children ages 5 to 11 as soon as government health agencies authorize the shot for them.

Once the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention give the go-ahead, the Biden administration says it is ready to deliver shots to arms for 28 million children this holiday season.

The White House said vaccines will be available at doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and school- and community-based sites. By partnering with state governments, the federal government has enlisted more than 25,000 pediatricians' offices and other primary care sites and more than 100 children's hospitals and health systems nationwide to administer the vaccines.

FDA officials are currently reviewing Pfizer/BioNTech's application seeking authorization of its two-dose COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than 12. According to Reuters, an FDA panel of outside advisers will make a recommendation on the vaccine's use for younger children on Oct. 26.



A similar advisory panel for the CDC will meet Nov. 2-3 to discuss the vaccine's use for young children.

""We expect the FDA and CDC's decision on Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 in the next couple of weeks,"" White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients said at a COVID-19 Response Team press briefing Wednesday. ""We know millions of parents have been waiting for COVID-19 vaccine for kids in this age group, and should the FDA and CDC authorize the vaccine, we will be ready to get shots in arms.""

Zients said the administration has worked with Pfizer to modify the packaging of pediatric vaccine doses to make it easier to distribute for children, including using smaller needles.

""By sending vaccines to pediatricians, pharmacies, community health centers, and rural health centers; working with children's hospitals to host vaccination sites, including on nights and weekends; helping schools stand up vaccination clinics; and deploying mobile clinics to meet families where they are, we will ensure that vaccinations for kids ages 5 through 11 are easy, convenient, and accessible to every family,"" Zients said, adding that the administration is prioritizing ""equity and fairness"" in the pediatric vaccine program.

While children can get sick with COVID-19, those infected with the disease typically have milder symptoms than adults and some may not show symptoms at all. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that U.S. children represent about 15% of all COVID-19 cases. The CDC added that hospitalization rates for COVID-19 are lower compared to adults, but some children develop acute symptoms that require hospitalization.

According to the CDC, between August 2020 and August 2021, 1,790 children ages 0-17 were hospitalized with COVID-19 and a total of eight in-hospital deaths were recorded related to the virus, out of 73 million American children.

Underlying health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and asthma may increase the risk of children developing serious illness. Additionally, a phenomena known as ""long covid"" has been observed in children that contract the illness and experience fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems and heart palpitations well after initial recovery. The long-term effects of COVID-19 in children is still being studied.

Speaking at Wednesday's news conference, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Americans ""cannot be complacent"" and children in schools must be protected from COVID-19 as the winter months approach.

""Right now, we are going to continue to recommend masks in all schools for all people in those schools. And we will look forward to scaling up pediatric vaccination during this period of time,"" she said.

Biden administration will soon reinterpret Title IX to strike down Fairness in Women's Sports laws,"President Joe Biden's administration will soon take action to overhaul federal civil rights laws and enact a new regime of Title IX rules for college athletics, according to a report.

The U.S. Department of Education is writing new rules that would make discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity illegal under Title IX, a 1972 law that bans sex discrimination in education, the Washington Post reports.



In other words, it would be illegal for states prohibit gender-dysphoric male athletes who present as female from competing against women in college athletics. Schools that receive federal funding must permit transgender athletes to compete according to their self-identified gender or risk losing those funds.

The new rules will be published in April, according to the report. The changes are currently under review by the White House. Next, the government must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and give the public a chance to comment before they are finalized.

Draft text reportedly reads, ""Discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex-related characteristics (including intersex traits), pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”

Biden's change to federal law, enacted via executive order, would set up a direct confrontation between the federal government and twelve Republican-run states that have passed ""Fairness in Women's Sports"" laws banning males who identify as girls or women from participating in girls' and women's sports. These states include Utah, Texas, Florida, Idaho, and South Dakota.

Republicans have argued that male athletes who present as female have biological advantages over girls, but this point is contested by LGBTQ+ advocates.

Debate has raged on this issue as transgender swimmer Lia Thomas — a man who identifies as female — controversially won the NCAA Division I championship in the 500-yard women’s freestyle. Thomas swam for the Penn men's team before beginning to take cross-sex hormones and present as female.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) rejected Thomas' victory as a ""fraud,"" issuing a proclamation that declared second-place finisher, Emma Weyant, a Sarasota resident, the ""real winner.""



The Biden administration announced its intention to change how Title IX is interpreted last summer and began holding public hearings on the proposal. The decision followed the Supreme Court's 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., a 6-3 ruling that said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects gay and transgender workers from employment discrimination. The court majority reasoned that people being fired for being gay or transgender were being treated differently because of their sex, which is illegal.

Because Title IX is very similar to Title VII, the Biden administration has argued that the same reinterpretation of illegal sex discrimination should apply in education.



Both supporters and opponents of the change were given an opportunity to make their case to the Education Department during hearings, the Post reported.

“Under the Title IX, every student who wants to should be able to play and feel welcome as who they are,” said Amit Paley, chief executive of the Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ youth. “By ensuring that LGBTQ young people have access to a welcoming and affirming school environment, the Department of Education can improve student mental health and well-being and ultimately save lives.”

In contrast, Cynthia Monteleone, a world champion sprinter and girls' track coach, told the department that including transgender athletes in women's sports creates unfair competition. She described how her daughter came in second place in a race against a male transgender runner who played volleyball as a boy.

“My daughter trained for two years for this first race. This transgender athlete trained for track for two weeks,” she said.

Stating that as a coach, she teaches girls that hard work pays off, she asked, ""How can I continue to teach this … when, quite literally, average boys can change their identity and beat the top female in the competition?”

In a statement issued Friday afternoon, the president legitimized the feelings of outrage that some may have in response to the not-guilty verdict but asked Americans to acknowledge the fact that the ""jury has spoken.""

Biden also requested that those upset over the trial's outcome ""express their views peacefully,"" adding that ""violence and destruction have no place in our democracy."" Nevertheless, he pledged to the state of Wisconsin ""any assistance needed to ensure public safety,"" as many fear the verdict could spark more rioting in Kenosha and across the country.

Below is the statement in full:

While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken. I ran on a promise to bring Americans together, because I believe that what unites us is far greater than what divides us. I know that we're not going to heal our country's wounds overnight, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to do everything in my power to ensure that every American is treated equally, with fairness and dignity, under the law.



I urge everyone to express their views peacefully, consistent with the rule of law. Violence and destruction of property have no place in our democracy. The White House and Federal authorities have been in contact with Governor Evers's office to prepare for any outcome in this case, and I have spoken with the Governor this afternoon and offered support and any assistance needed to ensure public safety.

What else?



Arriving back at the White House after undergoing a routine colonoscopy at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the president initially told reporters, ""I stand by what the jury has concluded. The jury system works and we have to abide by it.""



During the brief exchange, Biden declined to reiterate claims he made last year describing Rittenhouse as a white supremacist, Axios reported.

After 26 hours of deliberation, jurors found Rittenhouse not guilty on five counts Friday — including first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree attempted intentional homicide, and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.

Biden's reasoned initial response as the sitting president stands in complete contrast to remarks he made as a presidential candidate last September shortly after the incidents occurred.

Long before the facts of the case had been investigated, Biden tweeted a derogatory video that flashed images of Rittenhouse carrying an AR-15, and above the video, he wrote, ""There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.""

When asked about the president's remarks during Rittenhouse's trial this week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to denounce ""the president's past comments,"" but added, ""We shouldn't have, broadly speaking, vigilantes patrolling our communities with assault weapons.""

Why does it matter?

The president's most recent statement will hopefully serve to disarm widespread negative reaction to Rittenhouse's acquittal, which many fear will spark more rioting in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and elsewhere around the country.

But bringing peace and calm was far from the president's mind last year when he joined his Democratic counterparts in Congress and in the media to foment anger and push the unfounded narrative that branded Rittenhouse a white supremacist vigilante.

His words have not been forgotten.

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted on Friday that Biden should ""publicly apologize"" to Rittenhouse. And during the trial, the teen's mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, left open the option of suing Biden for defamation.

""Our lawyers are gonna handle that,"" she said when asked by Fox News reporters if her son's defense team would file lawsuits against powerful Americans such as Biden for ""interfering in the justice system"" and ""defaming"" her son.

Later, she suggested that Biden defamed her son ""for the votes.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-angry-concerned-rittenhouse-verdict,2021-11-19
Biden says the Catholic Church wouldn't agree with Lindsey Graham's abortion bill,"On September 13, Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham (S.C.) introduced a bill entitled ""Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act."" The proposed bill would prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.

This week, President Joe Biden, the second self-declared Catholic president in U.S. history, discussed Graham's bill when speaking to a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in New York. He said, ""I happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic. ... My church doesn't even make that argument now.""

The claim that pro-abortion policies comport with church teaching or that the act itself is regarded as permissible by the church, though both have been repeated by other Democrat politicians and are potentially politically expedient, is wrong, at least according to the pope and the church.

Not according to the pope

Earlier this summer, Pope Francis referred to Biden's support for abortion as ""incoherent."" Referring to an unborn baby, the pope said, ""There is human life. Is it fair to eliminate a human life?""



In 2018, Pope Francis answered in the negative, claiming it is wrong to take a human life, regardless of what age or stage of development it is in. ""Getting rid of a human being is like resorting to a contract killer to solve a problem.""



The pope added, ""How can an act that suppresses an innocent and helpless life as it blossoms be therapeutic, civil or, simply, humane?""

Pope John Paul II, recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 2014, condemned abortion and euthanasia as moral ""crimes,"" which he suggested had been misconstrued as individual rights in a growing ""culture of death.""

Building on his predecessor's thematics, Pope Francis has since criticized a ""culture of indifference and waste"" and urged families not to allow themselves ""to be poisoned by the toxins of selfishness.""

""We are victims of the throwaway culture. ... Today [abortion] has become a 'normal' thing,"" he said in an address on September 27, 2021, ""a habit that is very bad; it is truly murder.""

This summer, the pope told Reuters that he respects the Supreme Court's June 24 ruling, which overturned Roe v. Wade. While admitting he did not understand the full legal significance of the court's ruling from a ""technical point of view,"" he emphasized that abortion ""is a problem.""

He suggested that the science is clear. ""Science today and any book on embryology ... tells you that 30 days after conception there is DNA and the laying out already of all the organs. ... It's a human life — that's science. The moral question is whether it is right to take a human life to solve a problem.""

While aboard the papal airplane on September 15, Pope Francis said, ""It is true that the West degenerates. ... The West has taken the wrong paths."" Contrary to Biden's suggestion, the Roman pontiff stated, ""If you kill — with motivation, yes — in the end you will kill more. It’s not human. Let’s leave killing to the animals.""

Not according to the Catholic Church

""The Catechism of the Catholic Church"" is an official document that summarizes the main beliefs of the Catholic Church. It indicates the church's explicit condemnation of abortion along with its procurement, its provision, and its support. Furthermore, it indicates that those who formally cooperate in an abortion are excommunicated and thereby cut off of from the church.

With scriptural and theological reasons and corroborates also provided, the catechism states the following :

""Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception"" (2270);

""Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law"" (2271);

""Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life"" (2272);

""The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and political authority. These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents; nor do they represent a concession made by society and the state; they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin"" (2273); and

""Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being"" (2274).

According to its catechism, the Catholic Church not only condemns abortion of the kind Graham's bill seeks to ban, but would similarly support the prohibition of abortions before 15 weeks, including the killing of embryos.

American bishops speak out

After the Dobbs decision, Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore issued a statement saying, ""In response to the Dobbs decision, I called for the healing of wounds and repairing of social divisions ... and for coming together to build a society and economy that supports marriages and families, and where every woman has the support and resources she needs to bring her child into this world in love.""

Furthermore, he said, ""It is deeply disturbing and tragic that President Biden is choosing instead to use his power as President of the United States to promote and facilitate abortion in our country, seeking every possible avenue to deny unborn children their most basic human and civil right, the right to life.""

Archbishop Lori said that after the Dobbs ruling, Biden sought to use ""the power of the executive branch ... to facilitate the destruction of defenseless, voiceless human beings.""

In August, responding to Biden's executive order facilitating abortion, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities stated: ""Continued promotion of abortion takes lives and irreparably harms vulnerable pregnant mothers, their families, and society. It is the wrong direction to take at a moment when we should be working to support women and to build up a culture of life.

In 2008, then-Vice President Joe Biden was similarly called out by Bishop Joseph Martino (now bishop emeritus). ""I cannot have a vice president-elect coming to Scranton to say he's learned his values there when those values are utterly against the teachings of the Catholic Church.""

At the time, Kansas City's Archbishop Joseph Naumann said of self-declared Catholic politicians who support abortion: ""They cannot call themselves Catholics when they violate such a core belief as the dignity of the unborn.""

Graham's bill

According to Graham, by adopting his bill, ""We would be in the mainstream of most everyone else in the world. ... There are 47 of 50 European countries that have banned abortion from 12 to 15 weeks.""

Graham explained the significance of the 15-week mark. Besides the fact that over 90% of abortions in the U.S. are executed before 15 weeks, it is at that point in a pregnancy that ""science tells us"" that unborn babies have the requisite nerve endings to feel pain.

He asked, ""If you need to provide anesthesia to keep the baby from feeling pain to help save its life, should we as a nation be aborting babies that can feel excruciating pain from an abortion?""

Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, claimed, ""Politicians voting against this bill will stand against science and the American public, not to mention compassion for women and babies.""



House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another self-declared Catholic who has suggested it is ""sinful"" to restrict abortion, suggested that Graham's bill is the product of ""those in the party that think life begins at a candlelight dinner the night before,"" those she would also refer to as ""extreme MAGA Republicans.""

The bill, as proposed, would, among other things, eliminate ""particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures,"" preserve ""the integrity of the medical profession,"" and mitigate fetal pain.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-catholic-church-graham-abortion-bill,2022-09-23
"Biden claims 'We're gonna free Iran,' undoing weeks of calculated messaging around Iranian protests","Amid a discussion about how his administration might improve care for veterans, particularly those who recently fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Joe Biden told Democrat supporters at a rally on Thursday that ""we're gonna free Iran.""

Biden's comment reportedly negates weeks of work by U.S. officials to carefully counter the Iranian regime's narrative that America is steering the Persian protests.

Comment and context

Biden went to a Democrat rally in San Diego to promote Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.), who is at risk of losing his seat to Republican challenger Brian Maryott.

Outside the event was an Iranian freedom protest. There was some spillover of the protesters' sentiment into the rally, as several audience members held up ""free Iran"" signs.

The Hill reported that Biden was talking about veterans' health care and expanding benefits for millions of military members exposed to toxins while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Audience members' tangential concern — not with American veterans' health, but with the Iranian regime's persecution of women, anti-government protesters, and others — captured the president's attention.

Biden said, ""Don't worry. We're gonna free Iran. They're gonna free themselves pretty soon.""

Freeing Iran

It was not immediately clear what Biden meant.

Although one NSC spokesman claimed Biden had just been reiterating his support for the Iranian protests, Bloomberg reported that Biden's remarks ""undercut the carefully constructed US approach to the protests,"" which sought to ""avoid the impression that the US is somehow steering them, as Iran's leaders have claimed.""

Although Biden's remarks may soon be walked back by the White House as another ""gaffe,"" the we/they framing of the hypothetical Iranian liberation prompted the Iranian regime to recall previous U.S.-backed we/they interventions.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi responded to Biden's remarks saying, ""Mr. President, Iran was freed 43 years ago. ... Iran is determined not to fall into your captivity and will never become your cash cow.""

Raisi was referencing the 1979 Iranian revolution, when the last shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown. Pahlavi had been installed as the result of an internationally coordinated coup.

On Aug. 19, 2013, the CIA formally admitted that it had helped the British overthrow Iran's democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosadegh, in 1953. NPR reported that Mosadegh had indicated that, after decades of British control over the country's oil, he would break off negotiations and deny British involvement.

Sanctions, exclusions, and bombs

Biden has recently faced pressure to ensure that Iran doesn't acquire nuclear bombs and to hold Raisi's regime accountable for ""ruthlessly gunning down its own citizens in the streets.""



Presently, the Biden administration has sought to use diplomatic pressure and sanctions, despite the same not having worked on Russia in recent months.

CNN reported that the U.S. aims to remove Iran from the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in the wake of the death of a 22-year-old woman held captive by Iran's ""morality police.""

On Oct. 26, the U.S. imposed new sanctions against Iranian officials in light of the regime's nationwide crackdown on protesters.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the U.S. ""is committed to supporting the Iranian people and ensuring that those responsible for the brutal crackdown on the ongoing nationwide protests in Iran are held accountable.""

Last week, the Pentagon revealed in its new ""National Defense Strategy"" that the U.S. would dispense with Biden's pledge only to use nuclear warheads to deter or respond to a nuclear attack. Now, non-nuclear targets are fair game for nuclear strikes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-claims-were-gonna-free-iran-undoing-weeks-of-calculated-messaging-around-iranian-protests,2022-11-04
Biden delivers hyperbolic and intensely partisan speech accusing Republicans of 'un-American' opposition to democracy,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday castigated Republicans for supporting popular election security reforms with a hyperbolic stream of invective accusing his opponents of subverting elections, of posing a ""dangerous"" threat to democracy, and generally being ""un-American.""

""We are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. That's not hyperbole,"" Biden said, speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

The president spoke partly to condemn his predecessor Donald Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, partly to criticize Republican-controlled states like Georgia and Texas for passing election security bills, and partly to rally support for the For the People Act — federal voting legislation supported by Democrats that would weaken state voter ID requirements and override other Republican reforms at the state level.

The president made no mention of the Senate filibuster or the fact that the Democrats lack the 60 votes needed to overcome opposition to the major pieces of his agenda, including voting reforms. Instead, Biden used the bully pulpit of the presidency to paint concerns over election security as conspiratorial and supportive of a broad attack on democracy itself.

""The 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history. Challenge after challenge brought to local, state and election officials, state legislatures, state and federal courts, even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice. More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments. In every case neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering the historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges,"" Biden said.



""The Big Lie is just that: A big lie,"" he declared, referring to Trump's claims that the election was fraudulent and that Biden's victory was illegitimate.

""In America, if you lose, you accept the results, you follow the Constitution. You try again. You don't call facts fake and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you're unhappy. That's not statesmanship – that's selfishness,"" Biden said.

Biden tied Republican opposition to the For the People Act with historic efforts to deny black Americans and women the right to vote. He cast the Democratic voting bill as an antidote that would ""end voter suppression in states."" And he predicted that Republicans would launch ""a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression and raw and sustained election subversion"" ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, calling on Congress to act now.

The president said that a recent Supreme Court decision upholding two controversial election reforms in Arizona ""does not limit the Congress' ability to repair the damage done.""

He went on to slam election laws like those passed in Georgia and Texas, calling them ""racist and discriminatory.""

Biden accused Texas Republicans, for example, of wanting ""partisan poll workers"" to intimidate voters.

""They want voters to drive further"" and ""wait longer to vote,"" he claimed, repeating falsehoods about the Texas law. He made the incredible and unsubstantiated claim that Republicans ""want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses,"" comparing the actions of Trump-supporting Republicans to those of autocracies around the world.

He further called 28 Republican voting measures enacted across 17 states a ""21st century Jim Crow assault.""

Even as Biden launched explicitly partisan attacks against his opposition, he sought to portray Democratic efforts to undo GOP election reforms as a bipartisan cause.

""We'll be asking my Republican friends in Congress and states and cities and counties to stand up for God sake and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our election and the sacred right to vote,"" Biden said.

""Have you no shame?"" he demanded of Republicans.

""This isn't about Democrats or Republicans. It's literally about who we are as Americans. It's that basic. It's about the kind of country we want today.""



Closing, the president said Republicans are leading ""an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections. An assault on democracy. An assault on liberty. An assault on who we are.""

It was a starkly divisive speech from a president who aspired to unite the country.

Reacting, the Republican National Committee dismissed Biden's speech as ""lies and theatrics.""

""After Democrats failed to pass their federal takeover of our elections (H.R.1), Biden is continuing their dishonest attacks on commonsense election integrity efforts,"" said RNC spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez. ""Meanwhile, Republicans are engaged in state-led efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat, and polling shows Americans overwhelmingly support these laws.""

The president's remarks are the beginning of a major messaging effort by the administration to attack Republican election reforms and rally support for Democrats ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. However, Biden's strategy of using a public pressure campaign betrays the reality that even with full control of government, Democrats do not have enough support among their own members to go nuclear and steamroll the minority.

Outspoken moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) may attract public scorn from progressive activists for being opposed to abolishing the filibuster, but there are more than a handful of Senate Democrats who have kept their own opposition quiet. Without their support, Biden's words remain all bark and no bite.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-delivers-hyperbolic-and-intensely-partisan-speech-accusing-republicans-of-un-american-opposition-to-democracy,2021-07-13
Biden DOJ targets Arizona election integrity law with lawsuit,"President Joe Biden's administration has filed a lawsuit against the state of Arizona to block an election integrity law that requires voters to show proof of citizenship in order to vote in federal elections.

The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division claims that an Arizona state law, known as H.B. 2492, is ""a textbook violation of the National Voter Registration Act,"" The Hill reports.

DOJ's lawsuit, filed Tuesday, argues that the proof of citizenship requirement to vote also violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

“For nearly three decades, the National Voter Registration Act has helped to move states in the right direction by eliminating unnecessary requirements that have historically made it harder for eligible voters to access the registration rolls. Arizona has passed a law that turns the clock back on progress by imposing unlawful and unnecessary requirements that would block eligible voters from the registration rolls for certain federal elections,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.

The lawsuit states that a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision rejected a previous attempt by Arizona to require proof of citizenship documents of voters, and that the current state law violates that court decision, according to Reuters.

The DOJ further contends that a provision of the law requires election officials to reject certain voter registration forms based ""on errors or omissions that are not material to establishing a voter’s eligibility to cast a ballot,"" in violation of the Civil Rights Act.



This is not the first time Biden's Civil Rights Division has targeted Arizona over the state Republican-led effort to secure elections.

During a state Senate audit of the 2020 presidential election last year, Pamela Karlan, the deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division sent a letter to Republican Senate President Karen Fann threatening potential legal action over any attempt to canvass voters. In May 2021, Karlan wrote that efforts by auditors to go door knocking and verify voter registrations were ""potential intimidation of voters.""

The threat succeeded when Fann announced in reply to Karlan that plans to canvass voters had been put on indefinite hold.



Karlan, a political appointee and the No.2 official at the Civil Rights Division, has been criticized by conservative activists for using her position in the DOJ to advance an extreme-left agenda.

The American Accountability Foundation, a conservative watchdog group, has set up a website dedicated to exposing Karlan's radical record, including how she has advanced transgender ideology in schools and prisons and worked with George Soros-funded nonprofits to intervene in Arizona's election audit.

AAF founder Tom Jones said Tuesday's lawsuit against Arizona ""is exactly why Pamela Karlan was brought to DOJ.""

""Whether it is voter ID or door-to-door canvases Ms. Karlan is committed to using the tools of the United States Government to block the state of Arizona from using reasonable election oversight tools to administering a fair election,"" Jones said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-doj-targets-arizona-election-integrity-law-with-lawsuit,2022-07-05
Biden administration allows illegal immigrants to access federal housing aid,"The Biden administration will not require beneficiaries of a massive federal emergency housing initiative to prove that they are legal residents of the country, Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge announced Monday.

The department announced last month that it would dole out $5 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to help communities address homelessness by providing affordable housing and services. But the funds will not be specially earmarked for American citizens or otherwise legal residents; rather, illegal aliens may soon benefit from the money as well.



According to the Washington Times, when asked if the administration would implement a policy similar to one pursued under former President Trump to make sure only American citizens receive housing aid, Fudge replied, ""The answer is no.""

""We are doing everything we can possibly to take any living person in this nation off the streets,"" she reportedly added. ""That's kind of our posture.""

The news is sure to spark criticism from conservatives especially amid the ongoing immigration crisis as unprecedented numbers of migrants surge into the country illegally in expectation of lenient treatment from the new administration under President Joe Biden. As a result of the crisis, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have reportedly been released directly into the country, presumably without court dates.

In 2019, during Trump's presidency, then-HUD Secretary Ben Carson proposed tightening regulations to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving federally subsidized housing aid.

At the time, Carson argued the federal government needed to ""make certain our scarce public resources help those who are legally entitled to it.

""Given the overwhelming demand for our programs, fairness requires that we devote ourselves to legal residents who have been waiting, some for many years, for access to affordable housing,"" he added, according to the Washington Post.

That same sentiment, however, is not shared by officials within the Biden administration.

In a follow-up news release issued on Monday, Fudge announced that her department plans to send 70,000 housing choice vouchers to at least 750 local public housing authorities across the country. The initiative aims to provide some 130,000 households with safe, quality housing.

""While most of us spent more time in our homes than we ever have, more than half a million Americans had to spend the last year either in crowded shelters or sleeping outside,"" Fudge said in a statement. ""With HUD's swift allocation of this $5 billion in American Rescue Plan funding, we are providing communities the resources to give homes to the people who have had to endure the COVID-19 pandemic without one.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-illegal-immigrants-housing-aid,2021-05-17
President Biden indicates there was no way to exit Afghanistan 'without chaos ensuing',"President Joe Biden has come under heavy scrutiny for presiding over a chaotic effort to pull out of Afghanistan, but during an ABC News interview the president indicated he does not believe there was an avenue for America to withdraw ""without chaos ensuing.""

Biden said, ""The idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens.""

""So for you that was always priced into the decision?"" interviewer George Stephanopoulos asked.



""Yes,"" the president said.

""Now exactly what happened, I've not priced in,"" Biden said, according to ABC News. ""But I knew that they're going to have an enormous -- Look, one of the things we didn't know is what the Taliban would do in terms of trying to keep people from getting out. What they would do? What are they doing now? They're cooperating, letting American citizens get out, American personnel get out, embassies get out, et cetera, but they're having -- we're having some more difficulty having those who helped us when we were in there.""

The Taliban has swiftly taken over Afghanistan and the U.S. is currently scrambling to evacuate American citizens and others.

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said during a press briefing Wednesday that the speed of the collapse of the Afghan army and government had not been anticipated.



""There was nothing that I or anyone else saw that indicated a collapse of this army and this government in 11 days,"" Milley said.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that a ""fair amount"" of U.S. defense materials supplied to Afghanistan have fallen into the Taliban's hands.

Republicans have been heavily critical of the Biden administration, saying that the U.S. withdraw has been badly bungled.

GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said in a video statement on Tuesday that Biden ""oughta hide his head in a bag.""

Nikki Haley, a former U.S. Ambassador to the UN who served during a portion of the Trump administration, declared during a Tuesday interview on Fox News that Biden ""failed miserably"" and ""humiliated America.""

Biden tweet suggests making corporations pay 'fair share'' would help lower inflation,"The Biden administration is suggesting that making corporations cough up ""their fair share"" would help alleviate the nation's inflation problem.

""You want to bring down inflation? Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share,"" a tweet posted Friday on President Joe Biden's ""@JoeBiden"" Twitter account declared.



The tweet comes as Americans are being clobbered by soaring inflation that is rapidly eating away at the purchasing power of their hard-earned money.

Critics pounced on Biden's post.

""That’s not how it works boss. Stop printing so much money and the free market will take care of the rest,"" Anthony Pompliano tweeted.

""The newly created Disinformation Board should review this tweet, or maybe they need to form a new Non Sequitur Board instead. Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection,"" Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tweeted.

""This is the 'wearing sweatpants out to dinner' of inflation tweets. They're not even trying any more,"" Scott Lincicome of the CATO Institute tweeted.



""It’s like he had an idea but then got sidetracked by an unrelated thought,"" former U.S. Rep. Justin Amash tweeted.



""Wow! Impressive. Congratulations, sir,"" Blaze Media CEO Tyler Cardon tweeted — Cardon's post included a video featuring a song with lyrics that included, ""Congratulations, that was one of the stupidest things that I've ever seen anybody post on the internet before.""

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data earlier this week. ""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending April, a smaller increase than the 8.5-percent figure for the period ending in March,"" the BLS noted.

As Americans are sinking in a raging sea of inflation, 80 U.S. senators on Thursday voted in favor of confirming Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to a second term.

""President Biden has a plan to tackle inflation – by lowering costs that families face and lowering the federal deficit by asking the large corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share,"" a White House press release states.

The release says that, ""one of the main ways Congress and the executive branch can act to lower price pressures is to reduce the federal budget deficit.""

""President Biden’s plan will make the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations pay their fair share, including through a new Billionaires’ Minimum Income Tax.

"Biden judicial nominee Dale Ho said Senate, Electoral College are 'anti-democratic' institutions: 2018 video","A Biden judicial nominee is making headlines after a video from 2018 surfaced in which he makes the claim that the United States Senate and Electoral College are ""anti-democratic.""

Dale Ho, President Joe Biden's nominee for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, has previously been accused by GOP senators of showing ""open contempt for the Constitution."" Video of a speech he gave at the 2018 National Civic Leadership Training Summit is likely to affirm that charge in the minds of Senate Republicans.

""We had obviously lots of practices that are anti-democratic, that entrench in some ways minority rule in this country, and I'm talking about things like, you know, the Senate, the Electoral College, and the maldistribution of political power that results from those institutions,"" said Ho, who is the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's voting rights project.



He also said that the United States should change its laws to make ""voting easier"" and that ""long-standing barriers"" such as ""felon disenfranchisement"" strip ""the right to vote from people because of a criminal conviction.""

Ho, who was nominated for a lifetime appointment to an unelected office, came under fire from Republicans during his confirmation hearing earlier this month for a series of controversial statements he made on social media during the Trump administration.

Republicans brought up several tweets he posted criticizing GOP lawmakers including Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), each of whom serve on the Judiciary Committee and are overseeing his nomination.

“I very much regret the tone that I’ve taken on social media from time to time, particularly if it’s given anyone the impression that I wouldn’t be impartial,” Ho told lawmakers at the hearing.

Lee made a point of bringing up a tweet in which Ho suggested Republicans would use a Supreme Court majority to stay in power if the ""Electoral College, Senate malapportionment and extreme gerrymandering"" were not enough.

Ho said he was referring to news reports in 2020 of states potentially appointing their own presidential electors to overturn the election, but Lee said his tweet showed ""open contempt for the Constitution"" and was disqualifying for a potential federal judge.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also grilled Ho about writings in which Ho said a colleague once asked him if he works as a voting rights lawyer because he wants to help people or because ""you hate conservatives."" Ho said the point of that question was to highlight how ""anger"" can be a ""tremendous source of power.""

""I was relaying a joke that someone else had told, the point of which was that that kind of temporary sugar rush from being angry at someone — while it can feel powerful in a moment — it’s not the kind of thing that is sustaining for a human being, in the long run, that at the end of the day, if you want to do good work in the world, it has to come from a different place, a place of love for your fellow person,"" Ho said.

Ho has made other controversial statements. Earlier this week, Fox News reported comments Ho made in 2015 while speaking about voter identification requirements at an event in Wisconsin. Ho compared voter ID to ""chemotherapy.""

""We always have to weigh the costs against the methods, so let me talk about for a second about what you asked — that question about does this enhance the integrity of our elections, right? Obviously, we all believe that election integrity is important, right?"" Ho said at the event.

""Obviously, all of us are against voter fraud, right?"" he continued. ""The question that I think we have to ask ourselves is whether or not the mechanism that we’re using to try to prevent this problem is appropriate to the task. I’m against cancer, but I don’t think everyone in this room should get chemotherapy.""

Ho is supported for confirmation to the federal bench by progressive groups and has a glowing endorsement from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Ho was also strongly supported by Democratic lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee, with Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) commenting that Ho's passion should not be mistaken for anger.

President Biden says victims of 'long COVID' might qualify for disability,"President Joe Biden said this week that people who suffer from ""long COVID"" may qualify for Social Security disability support.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes ""long COVID"" as coronavirus-related symptoms that are long-term — weeks, months, and longer — after having recovered from a COVID-19 infection.

What are the details?

Biden said on Monday that those suffering from the lengthy affliction could receive assistance and support through the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, according to a Tuesday report from Insider.

""Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain, and fatigue,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House Rose Garden. ""These conditions can sometimes rise to the level of a disability.""

He added, ""So, we're bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID, who have a disability, have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law, which includes accommodations and services in the workplace, in school, and our healthcare system so ... they can live their lives in dignity and get the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.""

His remarks came in a speech commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In Monday guidance, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice said that not everyone who suffers from long COVID would qualify for disability.

""An individualized assessment is necessary to determine whether a person's long COVID condition or any of its symptoms substantially limits major life activity,"" the organizations said in joint guidance.

In June, FAIR Health released research revealing that a quarter of people who were diagnosed with COVID-19 sought care for new or continuing medical problems for at least 30 days after being diagnosed with the virus.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-long-covid-disability,2021-07-27
Biden reportedly planning largest tax hike in almost 30 years,"President Joe Biden is reportedly planning the largest hike in federal taxes in almost three decades to fund a long-term economic recovery program to follow in the footsteps of the recently passed $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

Unnamed sources confirmed the plans to Bloomberg News over the weekend, reportedly indicating that the major tax hike — the first since 1993 — is expected to pay for key Biden administration initiatives such as ""infrastructure, climate, and expanded help for poorer Americans.""

But the sources said the planned changes are not designed to fund only the key priorities of the administration. With the tax hike, Biden's team hopes to address what Democrats argue are ""inequities in the tax system itself."" According to the Bloomberg report, the changes include:

Raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%

Paring back tax preferences for so-called pass-through businesses, such as limited liability companies or partnerships

Raising the income tax rate on individuals earning more than $400,000

Expanding the estate tax's reach

A higher capital gains tax rate for individuals earning at least $1 million annually

""His whole outlook has always been that Americans believe tax policy needs to be fair, and he has viewed all of his policy options through that lens,"" Sarah Bianchi, a former Biden economic aide, told Bloomberg. ""That is why the focus is on addressing the unequal treatment between work and wealth.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-planning-major-tax-hike,2021-03-15
Biden plans to fund international 'independent media' using tax dollars,"President Joe Biden announced Thursday that the U.S. would provide funding for media outlets around the world in an effort to globally support free speech.

Biden announced his plan to fund journalism as part of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal while addressing world leaders at the International Summit for Democracy.

""A free and independent media — it’s the bedrock of democracy. It’s how publics stay informed and how governments are held accountable,"" Biden told world leaders in his opening remarks.

The White House released a fact sheet with an overview of Biden's initiative. The administration's goals include supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, advancing technology for democracy, and defending free and fair elections and political processes.

Biden's initiative would direct USAID to give up to $30 million to the International Fund for Public Interest Media, a new multi-donor fund that seeks to ""enhance the independence, development, and sustainability of independent media, especially in resource-poor and fragile settings."" USAID will also provide an additional $9 million to support a global defamation defense fund that will provide liability coverage to journalists and the companies that employ them. The defamation defense fund would ""guard the essential work of journalism from spurious legal claims aiming to silence legitimate work,"" according to the White House.

In addition, the State Department will spend $3.5 million to create a ""journalism protection platform"" that will provide at-risk journalists with ""with digital and physical security training, psychosocial care, legal aid"" and provide additional forms of assistance to journalists in need.

Biden promised world leaders to commit ""critical seed money"" to the International Fund for Public Interest Media as part of America's commitment to ""sustain independent media around the world,"" Fox News reported.

IFPIM is a new initiative from Luminate Group, a global philanthropic organization that works to ""empower people and institutions to build a fair society"" by ""supporting for-profit and non-profit organizations that impact in the areas of Civic Empowerment, Data & Digital Rights, Financial Transparency, and Independent Media,"" according to the fund's website.

When asked about the intended goal of IFPIM, a senior official from the Biden ministration told Fox News that the new initiative would ""operate by supporting independent media — including those led by and giving voice to women and other marginalized groups.""

Luminate Group was founded in 2018 by the Omidyar Group, which was established by the founder of eBay, Pierre Omidyar, and his wife.

Luminate Group has supported 348 organizations in 17 countries with over $414 million in funding since the group's founding, according to their website.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-plans-to-fund-international-independent-media-using-tax-dollars,2021-12-10
Biden says 2022 midterm elections could be illegitimate,"President Joe Biden is facing swift backlash after he said that the 2022 midterm elections could be ""illegitimate.""

During President Biden's rare press conference on Wednesday, he was asked if the 2022 midterm elections would be ""fairly conducted"" and the results ""legitimate"" if Congress doesn't pass voting rights legislation.

""Well, it all depends on whether or not we’re able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election,"" Biden responded, referring to more stringent voting rules enacted by Republicans following the 2020 election.

""Well, I think if, in fact — no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and — and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote,"" Biden said. ""I think you’re going to see the people who they’re trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.""



Later in the press conference, a reporter asked a follow-up question about the legitimacy of the 2022 midterms.

""I just wanted to clarify: A moment ago, you were asked whether or not you believed that we would have free and fair elections in 2022 if some of these state legislatures reformed their voting protocols. You said that it depends,"" the reporter said, before asking, ""Do you — do you think that they would in any way be illegitimate?""



""Oh, yeah, I think it easily could be — be illegitimate,"" Biden replied. ""Imagine — imagine if, in fact, Trump had succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.""

The reporter attempted to focus the question back on the 2022 midterm elections.

Biden reacts, ""Oh, 2022. I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit.""

""I mean, sure, but — I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit,"" President Biden said of the 2022 midterm elections.

""The increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these — these reforms passed,"" Biden said.

""But I don’t think you’re going to see — you’re not going to see me and I don’t think you’re going to see the Democratic Party give up on coming back and assuming that the attempt fails today,"" Biden concluded.

Republicans skewered President Biden for making claims that the upcoming November elections could be illegitimate. Many noted that former President Donald Trump was attacked by the media and Democrats for questioning the results of the 2020 presidential election.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) told Fox News: ""It's unfortunate. As you know, the Democrats have been highly critical of those Republicans who refused to accept the results of the last election and use the word ‘rigged’ to say that elections weren't fair. They're using the exact same language and casting doubt on elections. It's irresponsible.""

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) declared: ""I think it was shocking, to be honest with you. Just shocking. To have the president of the United States trying to undermine the results of an election before there's actually an election is a stunning manifestation.""

Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) remarked: ""Joe Biden dangerously claiming results of 2022 elections will be illegitimate unless Congress passes his election power grab.""

Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel slammed the president: ""In the same press conference, Biden continued to baselessly smear election integrity provisions, and then signaled to Putin that a 'minor incursion' into Ukraine is ok. Unreal.""

But it wasn't just Republicans who slammed Biden for proclaiming that the 2022 midterm elections could be illegitimate.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) disagreed with Biden: ""We might have a difference of opinion. I believe in the Department of Justice doing its job.""

As the Daily Wire pointed out, even CNN blasted President Biden for suggesting that the midterm election results could be tainted.

CNN chief national correspondent John King emphasized: ""It is striking to hear an American president not named Donald Trump raise questions about the legitimacy and sanctity of our democracy.""

CNN anchor Jake Tapper said: ""And quite strikingly, the president said that the upcoming midterm elections might not be legitimate if the election reform bills before the Senate are not passed. … President Biden just said, with Donald Trump’s history when it comes to the big lie on the elections, but he refused to say that the election results this midterm — in these midterms in November would be legitimate. He refused it.""

CNN anchor Dana Bash slammed Biden: ""Well, particularly the first part, Anderson, what he said, was — actually the entire thing, but the first part was probably the most jarring to hear a President of the United States who is not Donald Trump, even suggest ahead of time that an election isn’t legitimate.""

On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki attempted to do some damage control: ""Let's be clear: @potus was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election. He was making the opposite point: In 2020, a record number of voters turned out in the face of a pandemic, and election officials made sure they could vote and have those votes counted.""



""Today"" host Savannah Guthrie pressed Vice President Kamala Harris on Biden suggesting that the 2022 elections could be illegitimate.



""[Biden] openly cast doubt on whether the 2022 midterm elections would be legitimate. He said it all depends, which is astonishing to hear a president question whether our elections will be legitimate. We’ve heard it before, but not from this president,"" Guthrie said, then asked, ""Is he really concerned that we may not have fair and free elections?""



Harris dodged the question and responded, ""The president has been consistent on this issue. And the issue at hand, the issue — I was there last night in the chamber of the Senate, and the issue is that there are two bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, that have been the solution that has been offered to address the fact that around our country states have put in place laws that are purposely making it more difficult for the American people to vote.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-press-conference-illegitimate-election,2022-01-20
Biden's Education Department to 'immediately and permanently' disband national 'Parents Council' following parental rights groups' lawsuit,"According to court documents filed Monday, the United States Department of Education agreed to disband its new National Parents and Families Engagement Council following a lawsuit filed against the council by multiple parental rights groups, Fox News Digital reported.



The Education Department launched the controversial council in June 2022 to provide ""a channel for parents and families to constructively participate in their children's education,"" according to a now-deleted page from the department's website.

The council's goal was to hold meetings to discuss ""the different ways schools are providing academic, mental health and social and emotional support, and how families can best constructively engage with schools.""

Organizations on the council included Al Sharpton's National Action Network and Black Lives Matter supports such as Mocha Moms Inc., United Parent Leaders Action Network, and UnidosUS.

Parental rights groups, including Fight for School, Parents Defending Education, and America First Legal, filed a joint lawsuit against the Education Department in July and accused the council of being politically biased and violating several provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The groups alleged that the council members disproportionately supported the Biden administration and that nearly 80% of their leaders donated to Democrats.

""To have a fair balance of viewpoints and competent deliberation on students' needs, there must be fairly equal representation from both sides of the political spectrum,"" the lawsuit read. ""That is not the case here, as the Council consists of groups that are already supportive of this administration.""

Court documents filed Monday revealed that the Education Department agreed to ""immediately and permanently"" dissolve the council, and consequently, the parental rights groups agreed to dismiss their lawsuit without prejudice.

Parents Defending Education President Nicole Neily told Fox News Digital that she was pleased with the decision.

""We are gratified that Secretary Cardona's Potemkin village 'Parents Council' will be disbanded, because families should never be used merely as props to advance progressive policies,"" Neily stated. ""Parental engagement is essential for students to succeed; accordingly, it is critical that ALL voices and perspectives be integrated into any feedback mechanism that the Biden Administration operates — and that the Department of Education respect the rule of law.""

Following the agreement, the Education Department released a statement addressing the council's termination.

""On June 14, the Department announced the creation of the National Parents and Families Engagement Council,"" the Education Department stated. ""Several organizations subsequently sued, alleging that the Department violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) when it established the Council. The Department disagrees but has decided to not move forward with the National Parents and Families Engagement Council. The Department will continue connecting with individual parents and families across the country, including through townhalls, and providing parents and families with a wide array of tools and resources to use to support our students.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-s-education-department-to-immediately-and-permanently-disband-national-parents-council-following-parental-rights-groups-lawsuit,2022-12-05
"Sen. Joe Manchin resists own party, delivers possible death blow to Democrats' massive spending bill: 'Fiscal insanity'","Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia broke from his own party to torch the $3.5 trillion social welfare and climate change spending bill. Manchin proclaimed that the government spending trillions right now would be ""fiscal insanity.""

""Every Member of Congress has a solemn duty to vote for what they believe is best for the country and the American people, not their party,"" Manchin declared in a statement released Wednesday. ""Respectfully, as I have said for months, I can't support $3.5 trillion more in spending when we have already spent $5.4 trillion since last March. At some point, all of us, regardless of party must ask the simple question — 'how much is enough?'""

""What I have made clear to the President and Democratic leaders is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs, when we can't even pay for the essential social programs, like Social Security and Medicare, is the definition of fiscal insanity,"" Manchin continued.

""Proposing a historic expansion of social programs while ignoring the fact we are not in a recession and that millions of jobs remain open will only feed a dysfunction that could weaken our economic recovery,"" Manchin said. ""This is the shared reality we all now face, and it is this reality that must shape the future decisions that we, as elected leaders, must make.""



Manchin proposed that ""any expansion of social programs must be targeted to those in need, not expanded beyond what is fiscally possible."" He also recommended that the tax code ""be reformed to fix the flaws of the 2017 tax bill and ensure everyone pays their fair share but it should not weaken our global competitiveness or the ability of millions of small businesses to compete with the Amazons of the world.""

The Democrat suggested, ""The amount we spend now must be balanced with what we need and can afford — not designed to reengineer the social and economic fabric of this nation or vengefully tax for the sake of wishful spending.""

Manchin sounded the alarm that spending trillions would cause even more inflation that would hurt American families.

The Consumer Price Index climbed 5.3% in August from a year earlier. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned lawmakers this week that inflation will likely continue in the coming months.

""While I am hopeful that common ground can be found that would result in another historic investment in our nation, I cannot — and will not — support trillions in spending or an all or nothing approach that ignores the brutal fiscal reality our nation faces,"" Manchin said.

""America is a great nation but great nations throughout history have been weakened by careless spending and bad policies,"" Manchin concluded. ""Now, more than ever, we must work together to avoid these fatal mistakes so that we may fulfill our greatest responsibility as elected leaders and pass on a better America to the next generation.""

The defiant statement could spell a potential death blow to the massive spending bill because Manchin's vote could derail the proposal. Republicans oppose the $3.5 trillion spending bill — which could cost between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion over a decade. Democratic leadership desperately wants to pass the huge spending bill, but would need a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate to pass it. That would require a ""yes"" vote from every Senate Democrat, including Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). Both Manchin and Sinema have publicly opposed the hefty price tag of the bill.

Sinema said in July, ""I have also made clear that while I will support beginning this process, I do not support a bill that costs $3.5 trillion — and in the coming months, I will work in good faith to develop this legislation with my colleagues and the administration to strengthen Arizona's economy and help Arizona's everyday families get ahead.""

President Joe Biden reportedly canceled a planned trip to Chicago on Wednesday to attempt to get all Democrats on board with the spending bill.

""Biden reportedly met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) at the White House Wednesday afternoon following a series of meetings Tuesday with Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), who oppose both the size of the social spending package and key provisions in it,"" the Fiscal Times reported.

Meanwhile, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) contended that the reconciliation bill should spend $3.5 trillion ""at a minimum.""

""If Mr. Manchin is concerned about the deficit — I think we all are, national debt — I'm sure he understands that this bill is not going add one nickel to the deficit because it's all going to be paid for by demanding the wealthy and large corporations starting to pay their fair share of taxes,"" Sanders said Wednesday, echoing the Democratic talking point that the entire $3.5 trillion in spending will ""cost zero dollars"" and be paid for by taxing wealthy Americans and big corporations.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-spending-bill-manchin-sinema,2021-09-30
Biden stops ICE from making arrests at courthouses,"The Biden administration on Tuesday acted to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from making immigration arrests at courthouses, reversing a controversial Trump administration policy.

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas issued directions to ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placing new limits on arrests made at courthouses. The intent of the policy is to remove the ""chilling effect"" placed on migrants who were unwilling to report crimes or testify in court for fear of arrest and deportation, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

Under a 2018 directive from the previous administration, ICE officers were instructed to take immigration enforcement action against ""specific, targeted aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, national security or public safety threats, aliens who have been ordered removed from the United States but have failed to depart, and aliens who have re-entered the country illegally after being removed.""

The Trump policy was opposed by immigration rights activists and civil liberties groups who warned that illegal immigrants who were witnesses or victims of crimes would be discouraged from using the U.S. legal system for remedy.

New York state and others sued ICE to stop arrests at courthouses, calling the policy ""unlawful and unconstitutional.""

The new directive from the Biden administration supersedes former President Donald Trump's 2018 order, mostly ending that policy.

""Ensuring that individuals have access to the courts advances the fair administration of justice, promotes safety for crime victims, and helps to guarantee equal protection under the law,"" said Secretary Mayorkas. ""The expansion of civil immigration arrests at courthouses during the prior administration had a chilling effect on individuals' willingness to come to court or work cooperatively with law enforcement. Today's guidance is the latest step in our efforts to focus our civil immigration enforcement resources on threats to homeland security and public safety.""

ICE is now instructed to only make arrests at courthouses in ""limited instances,"" including for national security reasons, or if there is an imminent risk of death, violence, or physical harm to a person. Arrests made during ""hot pursuit of an individual who poses a threat to public safety"" or while ""there is an imminent risk of destruction of evidence material to a criminal case"" are also exempted.

""The interim guidance also makes clear that civil immigration enforcement is permitted against public safety threats in the absence of hot pursuit where necessary and with prior approval,"" DHS said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-stops-ice-from-making-arrests-at-courthouses,2021-04-27
"Reporter asks Biden if student debt relief is fair to people who already paid, and his response gets instant backlash","President Joe Biden was challenged by a reporter about the fairness of his student debt relief order, and his answer was immediately lambasted by many on social media.

Biden was speaking about the student debt program he ordered Wednesday when a reporter asked him to comment on the challenge that the policy was unfair to those borrowers who worked hard to pay off their loans.

""Is this unfair to people who paid their student loans or chose not to take out loans?"" asked Karen Travers of ABC News.

""Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multibillion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax breaks? Is that fair? What do you think?"" Biden responded.

""What about people who paid their loans, though, struggled to pay their loans, and now others don't have to?"" asked another reporter.

Biden simply walked out of the room.

Many on social media ripped into Biden for the response.

""What in the world is he talking about?"" asked Tim Carney of the American Enterprise Institute.

""I have no idea what this means but they had months and months to come up with an answer to this obvious question and here is the result,"" responded Scot Bertram of NRO.

""Confused Biden can’t tell the difference between American taxpayers keeping more of the money they earn, and the federal govt raiding the coffers to buy votes,"" read another reply.

""This isn't just comparing apples to oranges, it's comparing apples to fish that's been sitting on the counter for 3 days,"" said one critic.

""SO GIVE PEOPLE TAX BREAKS! CUT OUR TAXES! Let people keep more of THEIR money, don't force them to subsidize other people's debt. Did he think that thought all the way through?"" tweeted the official Young Americans for Liberty.

However, many on the left liked Biden's defiant reply.

""More of this version of Biden please,"" responded Ana Kasparian of the Young Turks.

One video of Biden's comments garnered more than 2.1 million views on Twitter.

Biden threatens oil companies with new tax over 'war profiteering.' But top Dem economist says it will backfire.,"President Joe Biden threatened oil and gas companies with a ""windfall tax"" on Monday, accusing them of ""war profiteering.""



What did Biden say?

Speaking at the White House, Biden accused oil companies of netting ""outrageous"" profits, which he attributed to the exploitation of the war in Ukraine.

Biden said oil companies need to reinvest their profits and reduce the cost of oil — or else.

""If they don’t, they’re going to pay a higher tax on their excess profits and face other restrictions,"" Biden said. ""It’s time for these companies to stop war profiteering, meet their responsibilities to this country, and give the American people a break and still do very well.""

The U.S. is not, in fact, at war.

Moreover, Biden claimed that if oil companies were not profiteering, then Americans would be paying, on average, at least 50 cents less per gallon of gas. He did not provide evidence to back that claim.

What was the response?

Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary who served in the Clinton and Obama administrations, predicted Biden's windfall tax will backfire.

""I’m not sure understand the argument for a windfall profits tax on energy companies. If you reduce profitability, you will discourage investment which is the opposite of our objective,"" Summers pointed out.

""If it is a fairness argument, I don’t quite follow the logic since even with the windfalls Exxon has underperformed the overall market over the last 5 years,"" he noted.

As Summers observed, the oil business is highly volatile.

For instance, while Biden emphasizes the industry's current profits, the five biggest oil companies — ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and TotalEnergies – lost $76 billion in 2020. Biden, however, made no mention of that.

Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute also pointed out in a response to Biden that the oil industry does not control the price at the pump.

""Oil companies do not set prices—global commodities markets do,"" API president and CEO Mike Sommers said.

Economists at the Federal Reserve of Dallas have explained why oil companies are not responsible for the high prices of gas at the pump. According to their calculations, less than 60% of the price of gas is directly related to the price of oil. Other costs associated with the price of gas include oil refining, distribution, and taxes.

The truth is that gas stations control the price of gas at the pump.

""Since only 1% of service stations in the U.S. are owned by companies that also produce oil, U.S. oil producers are in no position to control retail gasoline prices,"" the Dallas Fed explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-threatens-oil-companies-windfall-tax,2022-11-01
Biden admin ties funds for school lunches to compliance with transgender mandates,"President Joe Biden's administration has moved forward with a new interpretation of Title IX anti-discrimination laws that could potentially strip federal funding for school lunches from schools that do not let transgender students use their preferred bathrooms or play on preferred sports teams.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it will interpret federal anti-discrimination law ""to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity."" Its decision is based on an executive order Biden signed after assuming office in January 2021, as well as the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which found that Title VII protections against sex discrimination extend to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

“As a result, state and local agencies, program operators and sponsors that receive funds from FNS must investigate allegations of discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation,” the USDA said in a May 5 statement, first reported by the Center Square. “Those organizations must also update their non-discrimination policies and signage to include prohibitions against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.”

What this means is that any recipients of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Services child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program, could lose federal funding if they do not comply with Biden's new interpretation of Title IX.

If, for instance, a school does not permit a boy who identifies as a girl to use the girls' restrooms or locker rooms, the school may lose access to the lunch program as a consequence. The same goes for school sports teams. This would be in line with the stated intention of the White House.

""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,"" the president's Jan. 20, 2021executive order reads.



The federal government is already receiving pushback from Republican governors. In a statement on Thursday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem accused Biden of holding school lunch money ""hostage"" and vowed to take legal action.



“President Biden is holding lunch money for poor Americans hostage in pursuit of his radical agenda. He is insisting that we allow biological males to compete in girls’ sports or else lose funding for SNAP and school lunch programs,” Noem said. “South Dakota will continue to defend basic fairness so that our girls can compete and achieve. I would remind President Biden that we have defeated him in litigation before and are ready to do so again. Mr. President, we’ll see you in court.”

""It is appalling that the Biden Administration is threatening to withhold food from disadvantaged children in order to advance a deranged political agenda – that Floridians have rejected. Sadly, this would not be the first time that Biden has pursued petty political score-settling to the detriment of Americans’ well-being,"" said Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).

She continued: ""We will not allow Biden to force Floridians to choose between children’s food and parents’ rights. That is the kind of 'decision' that a totalitarian regime would force upon its citizenry.

""The federal government has no authority to follow through on these threats, but Governor DeSantis will always remain vigilant in protecting Floridians from unconstitutional federal overreach.""

DeSantis, Noem, and other conservative governors have championed so-called Fairness in Womens Sports legislation, which prohibits gender-dysphoric males from competing in women's sports leagues.



The Biden administration maintains that LGBT people need protections from discrimination to ensure that all Americans have an equal and equitable access to government assistance.

“USDA is committed to administering all its programs with equity and fairness, and serving those in need with the highest dignity. A key step in advancing these principles is rooting out discrimination in any form – including discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity,” Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a May 5 statement. “At the same time, we must recognize the vulnerability of the LGBTQI+ communities and provide them with an avenue to grieve any discrimination they face. We hope that by standing firm against these inequities we will help bring about much-needed change.”

The Department of Education is expected to release its own regulatory proposal on Title IX sometime in June. Politico reported that Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will unveil new discrimination protections for transgender students as well as new rules for how schools must respond to sexual misconduct complaints. The Biden administration is also expected to reverse due process protections for those accused of sexual harassment enacted by the Trump administration.

"Biden: Unemployment benefits are not causing a labor shortage. Also, if you don't take a job offer, you'll lose your benefits","President Joe Biden denied Monday that the generous federal unemployment benefits were a contributing factor to Friday's disappointing jobs report while at the same time clarifying that anyone who has been offered a ""suitable job"" must take the job or lose their benefits.

The president delivered remarks on the economy Monday at the White House after a Friday jobs report stunned economists who had predicted the U.S. economy would add nearly 1 million jobs in April, only to find out only 266,000 jobs were created and the unemployment rate actually rose from 6% to 6.1%.

""Let's be clear, our economic plan is working,"" Biden insisted, noting that since he took office in January more than 1.5 million jobs have been created in the U.S. as the country reopens from COVID-19 lockdown policies and business restrictions. ""I never said and no serious analysis ever suggested that climbing out of the deep deep hole that our economy was in would be simple, easy, immediate or perfectly studied.""

Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce blamed the lackluster jobs numbers on the $300-per-week unemployment insurance benefits generously offered in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that passed in March. The benefits, which critics say pay unemployed people more than they would earn if they found a job, were extended through September under the Biden plan.

Biden explained Monday that anyone currently collecting unemployment insurance is liable to lose their benefits if they are offered a job but refuse to take it.

""Anyone collecting unemployment who is offered a suitable job must take the job or lose their unemployment benefits,"" Biden said, adding that there are some COVID-19-related ""exceptions.""

Responding to his critics, Biden said ""we don't see much evidence"" of people being paid to stay home rather than go to work.



""It's easy to say, the line has been, because of the generous unemployment benefits that is a major factor in labor shortages. Americans want to work,"" Biden said. ""I think the people who claim Americans won't work even if they find a good and fair opportunity underestimate the American people.""

The president announced several actions his administration will take to distribute economic aid from his coronavirus relief package and hopefully spur job growth.

The U.S. Treasury Department will begin to send state and local governments more than $350 billion in bailout funds to cover their budget deficits and rehire about 1.8 million government employees who were laid off during the pandemic, including teachers, first responders, sanitation workers, and other essential workers. The administration is also beginning to send relief checks to some 16,000 restaurants who applied for assistance.

Biden encouraged employers to take advantage of programs offered in his American Rescue Plan, like the ability to hire back laid-off workers part-time without having those workers lose their unemployment benefits or a tax credit for keeping workers on payrolls.

Republicans say the administration needs to do more to make unemployment benefits less attractive than finding and maintaining a paying job. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) announced legislation to convert unemployment benefits into a federal hiring bonus that will supplement qualifying workers' paychecks if they find a job by July 4, 2021.

State officials are also taking action. Last week, the governors of South Carolina and Montana announced that enhanced federal unemployment benefits would end for residents in their state, claiming the benefits are discouraging people from finding work and causing labor shortages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced separately that his state will require residents to show proof they are looking for work to continue to receive unemployment insurance.

The Biden administration claims that there is no evidence to support the idea federal benefits are causing the labor shortage. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said Sunday that many Americans aren't returning to work yet because of ongoing fears about contracting COVID-19 and difficulty in finding childcare while schools remain closed for in-person instruction. President Biden has proposed a $1.8 trillion plan that would in-part subsidize child care for American families and federally fund free pre-school tuition for 3- and 4-year-olds.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-unemployment-benefits-labor-shortage,2021-05-10
Bill Burr blasts Gina Carano's firing from 'The Mandalorian': 'Liberals proved her point',"Comedian Bill Burr blasted the firing of former ""Mandalorian"" actress Gina Carano and said that liberals proved the point she was trying to make about being Republican in Hollywood.

What's a brief history here?

Disney and Lucasfilm fired Carano — an MMA fighter turned actress — from the ""Star Wars"" spinoff in 2021 after she said that ""hating someone for their political views"" in America is similar to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. She also previously voiced support for former President Donald Trump and criticized mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the time, Lucasfilm said a variety of her social media posts were “abhorrent and unacceptable” and thus justified the termination of her contract with the hit show.

What are the details?

During a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, the longtime comedian — who starred alongside Carano in the Disney+ streaming show — said that he didn't think it was fair that Carano lost her job over her personal and political opinions.

""I thought it was funny that the liberals proved her point,"" he told the outlet. ""They just use outrage because they don't like your politics.""

He added, ""As someone who considers himself liberal, it's disappointing to see the left become how the right used to be when they went after the Dixie Chicks after they criticized George W. Bush. There's not a lot of people like that — most are just trying not to get in trouble. But there's this small collection of lunatics — either on the right or the left, at any given moment — that cause hysteria.""

Burr added that can't understand why those people with opposite political ideals would go out of their way to sabotage someone's career.

""That somebody's opinion — or their political beliefs — makes people try to destroy their ability to make a living, it's f***ing bizarre to me,"" he mused.

Following her controversial 2021 firing, Carano's talent agency dropped her. She also lost out on a role in a planned spinoff series featuring her ""Mandalorian"" character, Cara Dune.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-burr-gina-carano-mandalorian,2022-04-29
Bill Maher says Christianity to blame for US Capitol riot — just weeks after defending Trump supporters,"HBO's Bill Maher said recently that Christianity was to blame for the riots and violence that took place in January at the U.S. Capitol.

What are the details?

During Friday's episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" the namesake host, now 65, said that a belief in Christianity is comparable to a belief in conspiracies like QAnon, and helped spur on the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

""As long as we're going to go to the trouble of another impeachment trial,"" he said, ""we might as well be honest about what it's really about: The events of Jan. 6 were a faith-based initiative.""

Maher said that Trump supporters who belong to a ""Christian nationalist movement"" are firm in their beliefs that God ""literally sent [Trump] from heaven to save them,"" and pointed to remarks made by Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who once said that God personally chose Trump for president of the United States of America.

""There's a lot of talk now in liberal corners about how Republicans should tell their base who still believe the election was rigged that they need to grow up and move on and stop asking the rest of us to respect their mass delusion,"" Maher continued. ""And, of course, it is a mass delusion. But the inconvenient truth here is that, if you accord religious faith the kind of exalted respect we do here in America, you've already lost the argument that mass delusion is bad.""

The longtime political commentator then went on to make a direct comparison between Christianity and QAnon.

""It's fun to laugh at QAnon, with the baby-eating lizard people and the pedophile pizza parlors,"" he added, ""but have you ever read the book of [Revelation]? That's the Bible. That's your holy book, Christians. And they've got seven-headed dragons and locusts that have the face of men and teeth of lions and other stuff you see after the guy in the park sells you bad mushrooms.""

He also explained that ""magical religious thinking"" — such as faith in Jesus' resurrection — is not dissimilar to a ""current mutation"" of the QAnon ""virus.""

""All the armies of the world will gather and Jesus will come down on a flying horse, shooting swords out of his mouth,"" Maher added, ""and have a thousand-year cosmic-boss battle with Satan, the Beast, and the antichrist. ... It's like 10 'Avenger' movies plus 10 'Hobbit' movies plus a night out with Johnny Depp.""

""Please, magical religious thinking is a virus and QAnon is just its current mutation,"" he insisted. ""That's why megachurches play QAnon videos. It's the same basic plot. 'Q' is the prophet and Trump is the messiah. There's an apocalyptic event looming, 'The Storm.' There's a titanic struggle of good versus evil, and if you want good to win, just keep those checks coming in.

""We need to stop pretending there's no way we'll understand why the Trump mob believes in him. It's because they're religious! They've already made space in their heads for s**t that doesn't make sense,"" Maher railed. ""When you're a QAnon fanatic, you're also a fundamentalist Christian. They just go together like macaroni and cheese.""

What else?



It seems fair to point out that Maher just a few weeks ago defended Trump supporters and said that they shouldn't be judged by the 5,000 people who rioted.

""Let's not confuse 5,000 people with 74 million,"" Maher said of the rioters versus Trump supporters at large. ""Yes, even supporting the insurrection in spirit is, well, deplorable. But there's a difference between holding illiberal beliefs and acting violently on them. At least that's what they always told me about Islamic terrorism.""

He continued, ""I keep wrestling on this show with the hard question of how do Americans, all of us, learn to share a country with a**holes you can't stand. I preach, and still do, you can hate Trump, but not all the people who like him. And as counterintuitive as it may seem, you can like something run by a**holes without being one yourself.""

"Bill Maher says covid pandemic over, blasts blue state rules","Liberal talk show host Bill Maher bucked the COVID-19 messaging that most Democratic politicians have been drilling into Americans in recent months of the pandemic. The ""Real Time"" host railed against face masks, stressed the rational acceptance of natural immunity, and proclaimed that the pandemic is ""over.""

During the panel session of Friday night's episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" the HBO host mocked Dr. Anthony Fauci's flip-flopping on whether it is safe for Americans to participate in holidays. Maher expressed hope that people and children could gather on Halloween, adding that it has been his ""position since the beginning of this"" that people should be free to live their lives.

""Just resume living,"" Maher said, according to Fox News. ""I know some people seem to not want to give up on the wonderful pandemic, but you know what? It's over. There's always going to be a variant.""

He declared, ""You shouldn't have to wear masks.""

""Also, vaccine? Mask? Pick one! You've got to pick. You can't make me mask if I've had the vaccine,"" Maher exclaimed.

The Atlantic staff writer Caitlin Flanagan compared the COVID-19 pandemic to an ""abusive boyfriend,"" with who she ""broke up"" with.

""I stayed home the first year. And then I got the vaccine,"" Flanagan said. ""I walked out of the CVS. I hadn't been that thrilled coming out of the drugstore since I got the birth control pill in 1981.""

""I've had cancer. I'm triple vaxxed. If it gets me, fair play to it because it will put up a fight against me but I'm not staying in my house again,"" Flanagan declared.



Maher then turned to his other guest – Democratic Sen. Chris Coons from Delaware – to point out, ""I travel in every state now, back on the road, and the red states are a joy and the blue states are a pain in the a**. For no reason.""

Coons avoided saying that Democratic-controlled states should ease COVID-19 restrictions, but instead said the U.S. should pay for the coronavirus vaccines for other countries.

""One of the critical things that's being discussed right now by President Biden, one of the things we have to recommit ourselves to, is supporting vaccination around the rest of the world,"" Coons replied. ""There's still a lot of countries that are very, very minimally vaccinated because if a variant develops out in the world that is able to defeat the vaccine, we are all the way back to the beginning. So in the United States, in most of the western world, we're ready to be done with this, but we're not done until the world is safe and we're not safe as a world until the world's vaccinated.""

Maher rebutted, ""Except the world recognizes natural immunity. We don't.""

He continued, ""Because everything in this country has to go through the pharmaceutical companies. Natural immunity is the best kind of immunity. We shouldn't fire people who have natural immunity because they don't get the vaccine. We should hire them. Yes?""

Coons acknowledges, ""If someone is having tested with antibodies."" However, President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate does not allow an exemption for people willing to submit an antibody test or those who have had a past COVID-19 infection.

Maher responded, ""Well, OK. But you know, people who've had it – I've had it. I mean, I shouldn't be tested anymore. I got the vaccine.""

Flanagan chimed in that first responders should not lose their job over a vaccine mandate.

""And if someone's willing to be a fireman, if someone's willing to be a policeman, if someone's willing to go into a burning building and says, 'I'm just not that afraid of COVID and I don't want to take the vaccine,' that should be enough,"" Flanagan said. ""You shouldn't be losing a job, you shouldn't be furloughed without pay, the guy that saves lives because he doesn't want to take the vaccine. It's ridiculous.""

Maher said people alone walking alone outside wearing a mask is ""stupid,"" and about the messaging instead of science.

Maher cited a Gallup report that stated, ""The hospitalization rate for the vaccinated population is 0.01% (or 1 in 10,914), and the rate for unvaccinated adults is 0.89% (or 1 case in 112 people).""

The poll found that ""41% of Democrats replied that at least 50% of unvaccinated people have been hospitalized due to COVID-19,"" compared to 22% of Republicans.

""They thought it was over 50,"" Maher said. ""How do people, especially of one party, get such a bad idea? Where did that come from?""



Coons added, ""We frankly shouldn't let up on the urgency of still promoting vaccination"" so that ""we can enjoy reopening our society.""



Then Maher questioned how many people died directly of COVID-19, and how many passed away from complications from COVID-19.

""We're looking at people with complicated health histories a lot of the time,"" Flanagan said. ""We're looking at obesity as an issue but no one wants to say it because it's body positivity. And we're looking at poverty. That's what we need to be focused on, people who live really close together. But there's a lot of people within different poor communities so don't want to take it. We just have to take our chances, be thoughtful and careful and go back out there and make sure that people who live in dense housing have complete access to the vaccine. And if they don't want to take it ""



""We have to get back to life. I mean, you might look at the sporting events that are … all three sports are playing now including basketball, which is inside. Nobody seems to be having super-spreader events,"" Maher noted, then joked, ""I mean, you know, it was great. It was so much fun having a pandemic but, you know, buh-bye.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-covid-pandemic-over,2021-10-30
Bill Maher asks why Putin invaded Ukraine under Biden not Trump,"Bill Maher roasted both political parties for manipulating Russia's invasion of Ukraine to score political points. The ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host also noted that it's ""worth asking"" why Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine when Joe Biden was in the White House and not when Donald Trump was president.

During the New Rules segment of Friday's episode, Maher blasted Americans for trying to make the war in Ukraine about them.

""Don’t make World War III all about you,"" Maher opened. ""Watching the reactions to war in Ukraine these past few weeks, it’s become obvious that America in this age suffers acutely from a particular disease of the mind, which is: Everything proves what we already believed and everything goes back to the thing we already hate.""

""All issues today: Pandemic, war, whatever, become a stress test for our reflexive partisanship,” he continued. “Can you take a vastly complex situation that is 100% not about your thing and somehow still make it about your thing? Our answer is, 'Watch me.'""



Maher noted that Republicans ""naturally"" blamed the invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden because they believe he is the ""worst president ever."" Maher also stated that Democrats feel the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened because they believe Donald Trump was the ""worst president ever.""

The liberal talk show host criticized Biden who asserted that Putin's latest aggression was brought on by the Jan. 6 riot.

During a speech about infrastructure on March 2, Biden claimed, ""Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to split up the United States. Look, how would you feel if you saw crowds storm and break down the doors of the British Parliament and kill five cops, injure 145? Or the German Bundestag or the Italian Parliament?""

Five Washington, D.C., police officers died following the Jan. 6 riots, however one died from a stroke and four others died because of purported suicides.

Maher asked the question, ""OK, but if Putin thought Trump was really that supportive of him, why didn't he invade when Trump was in office?""

""It's at least worth asking that question if you're not locked into one intransigent thought,"" Maher said.

Maher also questioned Trump's reason for Putin's invasion.

""Now, one guy we know is locked into one thought is Donald Trump, who was asked what went wrong with Ukraine said, 'Well, what went wrong was a rigged election.' Kanye thinks less about Pete Davidson than Trump thinks about the rigged election,"" Maher joked.

Maher was also befuddled by ""1619 Project"" author Nikole Hannah-Jones – who suggested that Ukraine was garnering attention because they ""appear white.""

The HBO host mentioned that there was a Vanity Fair piece that said the war in Ukraine is ""also a fight for LGBTQ rights.""

""Don't take this personally, but don't take everything personally,"" Maher said.

""Ukraine is not mostly about your pet grievances, it's about Vladimir Putin. And Putin is bad, very, very, very bad,"" he added and then joked, ""But he's still better than the guy who brings every conversation around to bitcoin.""

"Bill Maher says punishing the Russian people in response to the Ukrainian invasion is 'not fair,' says it would be 'racist' if Russians 'weren't white'","On Friday, late night television host Bill Maher took to the air to lambast people who are using the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine to condemn and ostracize Russian people who are not involved in any way with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war.

Fox News reported that Maher asked the panelists on his eponymous talk show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” “Do you think we’re, um, lumping the Russians too much with their government?”

He said, “I feel like in this country what we’re doing now, everything Russian is bad an every Russian is bad.”

“First of all, it’s not fair,” Maher continued, “If they weren’t white, I feel like we’d call that racism, you know. To lump everybody together – not every, I mean a lot of the Russian people don’t know what’s going on.”

One of Maher’s guests, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, suggested that the anti-Russian sentiment has spilled over and “gone way too far” after mentioning how Alexander Malofeev, the 20-year-old Russian piano prodigy, had his Canadian engagements canceled because of his Russian heritage.

Author Max Brooks, another of Maher’s guest panelists, said that the global ostracization of the Russian people is “unwise.”

He said, “What we were very smart about doing in World War II is, we knew the war was going to come to an end. And we knew that if we punished all Germans the way we did after World War I, we would back them into a corner.”

“So we crafted the narrative that ‘You Germans are led astray by Hitler,’” he continued, “because we knew, even if in some cases it wasn’t true, you know, we said to the average Nazi, you still got to run to the post office.”

Brooks, son of comedic legend Mel Brooks, said, “We have to think, we cannot back the Russians as an entire ethnic group into a corner. If we can separate Putin from the Russians in general, then we don’t only have a victory, we have a post-war plan.”

Maher, an avowed liberal-Democrat, has been considerably outspoken about the American government’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

He criticized both the Democratic and Republican parties for making the conflict into partisan mess.

Maher said, “Don’t make World War III about you. Watching the reactions to war in Ukraine these past few weeks, it’s become obvious that America in this age suffers acutely from a particular disease of the mind, which is: Everything proves what we already believed and everything goes back to thing we already hate.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-says-punishing-the-russian-people-in-response-to-the-ukrainian-invasion-is-not-fair-says-it-would-be-racist-if-russians-weren-t-white,2022-03-19
Bill Maher torches AOC with fact check over 'Tax the Rich' dress: 'The rich pay a lot of the taxes',"Liberal comedian Bill Maher torched far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on his HBO show Friday night, targeting the New York Democrat for her political stunt at the Met Gala and her recent comments about abortion.

What did he say about the dress?

Responding to the provocative gown that Ocasio-Cortez wore to the Met Gala — which had the words ""Tax the Rich"" emblazoned on it — Maher challenged the assertion that ""the rich"" don't pay enough taxes.

After noting, for example, that the richest 65,000 New Yorkers pay more than half of all the taxes in New York City, Maher exclaimed, ""Let's not lie.""

""It's not like we don't tax the rich at all,"" Maher said. ""I'm all for ending income inequality, but let's not lie. The rich pay a lot of the taxes.""

""I'm just saying, you wear 'tax the rich' on your ass, and people are always saying the rich don't pay taxes. They pay some taxes!"" Maher later added. ""They pay a big part of the freight already. I'm not saying it shouldn't be more perhaps, but let's not lie.""

Real Time with Bill Maher FULL EPISODE September 17th 2021 youtu.be

The top 1% of income-earners in America, in fact, pay more than 40% of all income taxes. The bottom 50%, however, pay less than 3% of the total income tax collected by the Internal Revenue Service.

What about abortion?



Maher criticized Ocasio-Cortez for making the issue of abortion not just about woman and recently scolding people who disagree with her progressive gender ideology when she said, ""People can stay mad about that if they want, or they can grow up.""

""This has always been a women's issue,"" Maher said. ""Maybe if the tone wasn't like, 'You morons who don't know that men can menstruate and what two-spirit is, catch up!' That's what people hate.""

""Maybe, you know, help us along, explain, don't have this attitude like the part of the country that isn't completely caught up with this is just moronic and 'I can't even bear to deal with you. Grow up.' First of all, it's just bad politics,"" Maher went on to say. ""I don't know if she thinks it's only Republicans are in that camp who don't know what 'two-spirit' is. But I think a lot of people are just learning about some of this stuff. And it's new!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-torches-aoc-tax-the-rich,2021-09-18
"Billionaire businessman takes to Twitter to defend 'civic-minded patriot' Kyle Rittenhouse, rips media for 'destroying lives' with biased reporting","The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, who faces homicide charges for his actions in three shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020, during riots in the city, has been quite an event to observe. Rittenhouse has claimed from day one that he shot three men, killing two and wounding another, in self-defense. The state — as well as pro-rioting, anti-gun commentators, reporters, and activists — has claimed Rittenhouse went to Kenosha intending to kill people, which, in their reasoning, is the only reason he brought a rifle to the riots.

Over the last week, the courtroom proceedings have not gone the way Rittenhouse's critics had hoped. For example:

The prosecution has seemingly imploded, with its own witnesses undermining their case.

The presiding judge in this case ripped into the government's lawyers on multiple occasions.

Rittenhouse took the stand in his own defense and refused to crack under cross-examination.

Now people across the U.S. have had a chance to see Rittenhouse, hear from him, and view the full evidence — evidence the liberal media did not bother to share with the public over the last 15 months.

And the minds of some are being changed (even a member of the Young Turks) as they find out that the media hasn't actually told them everything about the incident.

Included in that group is billionaire businessman Bill Ackman — and he was more than happy to call out the media in a Twitter thread for failing to tell the whole Rittenhouse story and to blast them for biased reporting that is ""destroying lives.""

Instead of being the blood-thirsty gun-nut much of the media portrayed Rittenhouse to be, Ackman said he found the 18-year-old to be a ""civic-minded patriot.""

""Last night, Neri and I watched several hours of [Kyle Rittenhouse's] direct testimony and cross examination. We came away believing that #Kyle is telling the truth and that he acted in self defense,"" Ackman wrote, adding. ""We found him to be a civic-minded patriot with a history of helping his community as an EMT and fireman in training, in his removing hate graffiti earlier that day from a local school, and ultimately in volunteering to protect a business during the night of August 25th in Kenosha.""

He noted that his and his wife's ""impressions of Kyle were materially different from those we had previously formed based on media reports and opinion pieces that we had consumed.""

Turns out Ackman is not a big fan of agenda-driven media — especially when he expects news outlets to get stories right on difficult issues that he or the public might not fully understand.

""I have always been frustrated to read an inaccurate press report about a subject I know well, yet somehow I continue to believe other articles in the same newspaper about subjects I know less well,"" Ackman said. ""Media and political bias are dividing our country and destroying lives.""

""While we have not heard the entire trial, based on our assessment of Kyle on the stand, we believe that he will be found innocent by the jury,"" he added.

He followed that prediction with a warning and a suggestion for communities that might ""react negatively and even violently after a jury verdict"" that catches them by surprise based on biased media reports they've ingested: ""I encourage you to watch the trial, or at a minimum his testimony and cross examination, before you form a view of his guilt or innocence.""

Noting that he's not a gun owner or NRA member and is, in fact, a proponent of more stringent gun regulations, Ackman lamented that ""society's view of #kyle's innocence depends more on one's views about gun control rather than on what actually took place last August.""

And that's unacceptable, the businessman continued, because ""Kyle Rittenhouse's life is at risk.""

""Justice demands a fair trial,"" Ackman said. ""Society would benefit greatly if politics did not enter the court room and convict innocent people.""

As if to prove Ackman's own point, a reporter contacted him, he said, asking if his Twitter account had been ""hacked.""

Apparently, he said, ""the reporter couldn't conceive of the idea that I could believe that Kyle is innocent because I am not a right winger. Crazy.""

Black college student claimed she was hate crime victim; campus protests erupted. But it was yet another hate hoax; student now charged with felonies.,"A black college student who last month claimed she was a hate crime victim — which resulted in protests on the campus of Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville — has been accused of making up the whole thing.

What are the details?

Kaliyeha A. Clark-Mabins, 19, was charged Friday with three counts of disorderly conduct for telling campus police that two notes were posted on her dormitory room door reading ""BLACK PEOPLE DON'T BELONG"" and ""DIE BITCH,"" the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, citing charging documents.

The College Fix posted the charging documents identifying Clark-Mabins as a black female. The college's police department added in a statement that the Madison County State’s Attorney’s Office charged Clark-Mabins with filing a false police report and that the resulting disorderly conduct counts against her are class 4 felonies.

The Post-Dispatch said no lawyer was listed for Clark-Mabins, adding that she couldn't be immediately reached for comment.

Campus police added that its investigation — which also involved the U.S. Secret Service — concluded that two individuals originally accused have been cleared of any involvement.

University officials said they were ""saddened by the harm"" the accused pair ""endured because of false accusations,"" the Post-Dispatch reported.

The paper said the school added: ""Although false reporting of racial and bias incidents is isolated and rare, this case should remind every member of our community how important it is to preserve and protect due process and fairness in our procedures and communications.""

Here's a video report that aired prior to the revelation that the hate crime accusation was fabricated:

SIUE police investigate racial incident on campus youtu.be

What's the background?

Campus police on Jan. 23 said they received a report of a hate crime involving the posting of handwritten notes on the dorm room door in Woodland Residence Hall, along with an alleged anonymous text message thread from the fall of 2021 containing threatening and racially hostile content.

Students then launched protests in the wake of what appeared to be white-against-black hate crimes, KSDK-TV reported.

David Daniel, a senior and vice president of the Black Student Union on campus, told the station the school's administration sent a campus-wide email about a bias incident. Soon images of the sticky notes were being shared — and KSDK said text message images contained racial slurs and threats, including the N-word and ""lynch.""

Daniel then organized a demonstration during which students chanted and held up posters, the station said, adding that in one clip students were seen facing the college chancellor and other staff.

""They say it's under investigation, but I feel like [the accused] shouldn't be on campus period,"" Daniel added to KSDK. ""Because you threatened to lynch students on this campus.""

Report: Black Lives Matter sent millions to charity that bought mansion that was formerly Communist Party of Canada headquarters. Questions surface about who controls BLM's $60M war chest.,"There are questions surfacing about who controls the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation's $60 million war chest. At the same time, there is a report that the BLM organization funded the purchase of a mansion that was formerly the headquarters of the Communist Party of Canada.

""M4BJ, a Toronto-based non-profit set up by Janaya Khan and other Canadian activists, snagged the 10,000 square foot historic property for the equivalent of $6.3 million in cash in July 2021,"" the New York Post reported, noting that it had reviewed Toronto property records. The outlet reported that Black Lives Matter ""transferred millions"" to the M4BJ charity.

Coincidentally, Khan is the wife of Patrisse Khan-Cullors – a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. Cullors – a self-described ""trained Marxist"" –resigned from the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation in May after weeks of criticism surrounding the purchase of high-end real estate properties.

The Washington Examiner reported, ""The U.S. charity that serves as the face of the BLM movement provided the bulk of the funding for the purchase of the 10,000-square-foot property in July.""



The purchase of the property – which was formerly the headquarters of the Communist Party of Canada and is known as the Wildseed Centre for Art and Activism – was criticized by two former senior members of the Black Lives Matter Toronto chapter – who resigned earlier this month over the organization's lack of transparency.

Canadian BLM activists Sarah Jama and Sahra Soudi said in a statement, ""For BLM Canada to take money from BLM Global Network [Foundation] for a building without consulting the community was unethical. For BLM Canada to refuse to answer questions from young Black organizers goes against the spirit of movement-building.""

""In other words, the NDA was designed as a constant threat of legal action against us, even though we were volunteering our time to a cause we believed in,"" the activists added.

The criticism of the high-priced property arrives at a time when there are growing questions about Black Lives Matter's finances.

After Cullors suddenly resigned from her role as executive director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation last year, the organization announced that activists – Makani Themba and Monifa Bandele – would step into the role. However, they never actually assumed the position.

“We never actually started in the position, so we never received any detailed information,” Themba told the Washington Examiner.



""Although a media advisory was released indicating that we were tapped to play the role of Senior Co-Executives at BLMGNF, we were not able to come to an agreement with the acting Leadership Council about the scope of our work and authority,"" reads a statement from Bandele and Themba.

""As a result, we did not have the opportunity to serve in this capacity. We wanted to be sure to inform our community of this fact as we move on to serve our movement in other ways,"" the statement says.



There doesn't seem to be any BLM leadership overseeing the $60 million in its coffers.

BLM released its disclosure in February 2021 – which stated the organization ""raised just over $90 million"" in 2020.

""After our expenses and grant disbursements, we are left with an approximate balance of $60 million,"" BLM revealed.

The Washington Examiner noted, ""While a charity's finances are ultimately the responsibility of its board of directors, BLM's bylaws explicitly state that its executive director 'shall have charge of all funds and securities of the Corporation.'""

When the outlet attempted to request BLM's 2020 Form 990 in person at the organization's office in Los Angeles, they were informed by a security guard that there has never been a Black Lives Matter office at the location.

An unidentified BLM spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation does not currently maintain a ""permanent office.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-lives-matter-mansion-finances,2022-01-30
"Facebook user threatens to kill black people at Alabama fair, adds 'white power' message and Confederate flag. Cops say black man is behind post.","An 18-year-old black man is behind a Facebook post that promised to kill black people at an Alabama fair and used white supremacist imagery, police told AL.com.

What are the details?

The Facebook user indicated in the post that he and his friends “are coming to [the] Opelika Alabama fair to kill every NEGRO that we lay eye contact on so be prepared. WHITE POWER,"" the outlet said, adding that the poster’s profile included the Confederate battle flag.

Opelika police said they launched an investigation Sept. 19 after learning about the ""racially inflammatory"" post that included a threat to ""shoot attendees of a certain demographic at the upcoming Lee County Fair.""

The department added that it ""takes threats like these very seriously"" and that it would ""provide additional officers for security to ensure the safety of all fair attendees.""

A day later, police said they had a suspect.

""Officials were able to trace the social media account to a residence in Lafayette, AL,"" police said. ""Through the investigation, 18-year-old Pharrell Smith was developed as a suspect."" Lafayette police arrested Smith on ""unrelated charges"" on Oct. 6, police said.

Opelika police added that once he's released from the custody of Lafayette police, Smith would be extradited to Lee County and arrested on a terroristic threat charge.

Police added that those with information on the case can contact the Opelika Police Department Detective Division at 334-705-5220 or the Secret Witness Hotline at 334-745-8665 — and anonymous tips can be submitted through the Opelika Police Mobile App.

"Black woman calls 'Rush Limbaugh Show' with message for her community: America, police, white people are not our problem, ‘We are our problem!’","A black woman called into the ""Rush Limbaugh Show"" Thursday to deliver a passionate message to fellow black Americans, urging them to disavow the victim mentality that blames white people, systemic racism, and police for all the problems in the black community.

What did she say?

The caller, who identified herself as Joyce from Houston, began the segment by commenting on the conclusion of the Derek Chauvin trial. She said that while she believed Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, should be held responsible for his role in George Floyd's death, she was convinced he could not get a fair trial.

On Tuesday, a 12-person jury in Minneapolis pronounced Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter for his actions, which included kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes despite Floyd's complaints of ""I can't breathe.""

Joyce didn't stay on the subject of the trial for very long, however, but instead quickly transitioned into a plea to the black community to stop blaming others for the problems that routinely plague black Americans.



""I am so sick and tired of this 'systemic racism,'"" Joyce exclaimed. ""There are no organized conspiracies to keep blacks down. There are pockets of bigotry for sure. But they're not powerful enough to keep you down if you have some get-up-and-go about yourself.

""And I hear this constantly. I live in the most dangerous neighborhood in Houston, the sixth in the nation, and we constantly talk about racism. 'Who is keeping us down?'"" she continued. ""I get so tired of telling my people, 'The old rich white Republicans [are] not our problem. We are our problem' — and until we face the fact that we are our own worst enemies, nothing is gonna change!""

Joyce then lamented the number of black Americans in her community who have been assaulted and murdered, but who have not received any attention from politicians or the media. But everyone knows Floyd's name, she said, taking a dig at Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.

""Ask my congresswoman, Sheila Jackson Lee,"" if she knows their names, Joyce suggested, then claiming that Lee would not be able to recite their names.

""But I tell you one thing, she sure know about Floyd,"" she said.

(Joyce's comments begin at the 1:03:44 mark in the widget posted below.)

What else?

Joyce then challenged the notion that America is fundamentally racist and an inherently dangerous place for people of color.

""I have traveled out of this country several times and I want to say to the blacks [that are] listening that you're so angry and you come up with this fake racism and every scene. That's not our problem. There's no better place for us, and you're gonna sit here and allow people to use you as pawns to mess up what's best for you today,"" she said. ""There is no better place for us, and I am tired of you blaming someone else.

""In our community, one of the main reasons that these young people are getting shot and killed, [is] because they didn't have — and especially these young black men — they didn't have no dads in the home,"" she argued.

Joyce then recalled something she often heard from fellow black Americans during former President Barack Obama's time in the Oval Office.

""When Obama was in the White House, all in my community just, 'Oh, we are so blessed! We have a black man in the White House,'"" she remembered. ""I said, 'We need to a black man in the black house!'"" referring to fatherless black kids.

Instead of being taught to respect authority by their fathers, too many young black kids are taught from a young age to hate the police, she argued.

""There are few bad policemen, but basically the policeman is out there to do a job to protect us,"" Joyce said. ""And I get so tired of, 'Oh, they arrest more blacks than they do whites.' Well, hell, we do more crime! So what are they gonna do, just let us go?""

""We have got to change,"" she concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-woman-message-to-black-community-rush-limbaugh,2021-04-23
Blaze Media CEO calls out New York Times for 'ominous framing' of Glenn Beck quote ripped out of context,"Blaze Media CEO Tyler Cardon called out the New York Times on Wednesday for using ""ominous framing"" in an article about ""election falsehoods"" that took comments from BlazeTV host Glenn Beck out of context.

The Times article, ""Election Falsehoods Surged on Podcasts Before Capitol Riots, Researchers Find,"" reported on a study by researchers at the Brookings Institution who reviewed transcripts of nearly 1,500 episodes from 20 of the most popular conservative podcasts looking for election misinformation leading up to the 2020 presidential election.

In the opening paragraph, the article by reporter Stuart Thompson claimed that Beck made a prediction about the election in which he suggested President Donald Trump would appear to be winning early in the evening but would have his lead erode after questionable mail-in ballots were counted, giving Joe Biden an advantage.

“No one will believe the outcome because they’ve changed the way we’re electing a president this time,” Beck is quoted as saying.

In several tweets, Cardon called attention to how the Times article left out important context surrounding Beck's remarks.

""Read this opening paragraph from New York Times piece about 'election falsehoods' that published yesterday. Note the ominous framing. Apparently, on a random day in September, big bad broadcaster Glenn Beck outlined his prediction for Election Day in a single sentence,"" Cardon wrote.

""But the quote they pulled was from a segment in which GB was reacting to a report by the Transition Integrity Project, which got a ton of media coverage largely because it predicted the end of the Republic in all scenarios except a Biden landslide,"" he continued, providing a partial transcript of Beck's remarks from the Sept. 16, 2020 episode of his radio program.

Beck was discussing an Aug. 3, 2020 report by a bipartisan group of experts convened by the Transition Integrity Project to run tabletop simulations of the 2020 presidential election. The report predicted it was highly likely ""that November’s elections will be marked by a chaotic legal and political landscape."" The report urged policymakers to prepare for a contested election and presciently predicted how Trump would contest the results of the election by alleging there was voter fraud.

The researchers ran four hypothetical scenarios with opposing teams representing the Biden and Trump camps. Two of the scenarios ended with close elections, which both resulted in what Beck described as a ""nightmarish"" situation where the election is contested. In a third scenario where Trump clearly won the Electoral College vote but Biden won the popular vote, ""game play ended in a constitutional crisis,"" the researchers said.

Only the fourth scenario of a decisive victory for Biden in both the Electoral College and popular vote was resolved without a major crisis. Reacting to this information, Beck agreed with that assessment and said it would take a ""landslide"" victory by either candidate to convince a majority of Americans the election was legitimate.



""Where's the lie?"" Cardon asked Wednesday. ""You need to look no further than the TIP report itself to find support for GB's 'prediction' here. The only difference is that GB is more generous to the Dems by assuming they'd accept a Trump landslide. In the report, this resulted in 'constitutional crisis.'""

Supporting his case, Cardon shared a video montage of ""prominent politicians"" — including many Democrats — expressing their doubts about the integrity of the electoral process leading up to the 2020 election.

""The NYT (and other dusty, legacy media outlets) are desperate to connect every effective dissident voice in today's media landscape to some flavor of 'dangerous misinformation,' not because it's true, but because they're losing influence & want to silence their competition,"" Cardon said.

Reached for a response, New York Times Vice President of Communications Danielle Rhoades Ha said, ""Our editors have reviewed the passage and found the use of the quote to be accurate and fair. Mr. Beck's quote is clearly in reference to concerns about mail-in ballots.""

Black Lives Matter leader Hawk Newsome gets in heated Fox News interview,"A Black Lives Matter leader suggested that a Fox News host enjoys ""white privilege,"" so her opinion on New York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams' remedies for spiking violent crime in the city is irrelevant.

Last month, Adams vowed to bring back NYPD's plainclothes unit that was disbanded in June 2020 under the de Blasio administration.

""It's about bringing back a sense of protection in our city and not the disorder we feel at this time,"" said Adams – a former NYPD captain. ""We’re going to go after the violent crimes we’re witnessing, particularly the over-proliferation of handguns. I’m going to put in place an anti-gun unit, plainclothes, and we’re going to do precision policing and go after those gangs and gun users.""

Adams noted that officers in the plainclothes unit would have bodycams on them.

Days after Adams made his declaration to revive the anti-crime unit, Black Lives Matter of Greater New York leader Walter ""Hawk"" Newsomethreatened consequences if the controversial NYPD unit returned.

""There will be riots. There will be fire, and there will be bloodshed,"" Newsome proclaimed. ""There's no way we're going to let some Gestapos come in here and harm our people. We pray for peace, but black opportunities prepare for the worst.""

""We have people in city council who can create problems for him,"" Newsome threatened. ""We have people in the streets who can create problems for this administration by shutting it down.""

On Thursday, Adams fired back at Newsome for his dangerous rhetoric.

""We’re not going to surrender to those who are saying, 'We’re going to burn down New York.' Not my city,"" Adams said at a Police Athletic League event at the Harvard Club.

Newsome continued this battle with the incoming mayor during an appearance on ""The Story"" on Friday. Newsome argued with Fox News host Martha MacCallum about Adams reinstituting the plainclothes police unit.

""The mayor[-elect] is engaging in a political circus. And my parents didn’t raise a clown,"" Newsome said of Adams. ""So, I’m not here to play these circus-type political games with him.""

Last month, Adams met with Newsome and members of the Black Lives Matter of Greater New York organization – a self-described group demanding ""criminal justice reform, basic public safety, fair and equal access to education, jobs & infrastructure."" However, the meeting ended with Newsome unsatisfied with measures the incoming mayor planned on instituting to counter surging violent crime.

Newsome told MacCallum that Adams utilized his squabble with Black Lives Matter of Greater New York to enhance his public relations with various media appearances.

""Look at what happened after we engaged in this back and forth,"" Newsome said. ""He was on Colbert, He was on Anderson Cooper, he was on Bill Maher. I made him famous, right, for this spat we had. And if the mayor truly cared about what’s best for the city, he would’ve talked about the things we agreed upon in that meeting. But didn’t want to discuss that, Martha. He just wants the hype and the attention.""



Newsome – who wore a ""Critical Race Theory is American History"" sweatshirt during the interview – claimed that Adams ""does not have a plan.""

MacCallum interjected, ""He does have a plan. He's going to put the ant-crime unit police unit back on the street.""

Newsome defended his position by saying, ""Crime isn’t just up in New York City. It’s up around the country, so what is he going to do that's different other than talk?""

MacCallum pointed out that violent crime skyrocketed after the unit was disbanded, and noted, ""21 children have been killed in the streets of New York, mostly in gang violence,"" citing a New York Post report from October.

Newsome responded, ""Ok, there’s this thing called the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment protects us against illegal search and seizure.""

Newsome then attempted to dismiss MacCallum's point of view because of her alleged ""white privilege.""

""But see, you don’t know what it’s like, you don’t know what it’s like to be pulled over and thrown up against walls,"" Newsome said, then telling MacCallum, ""You live from a place of white privilege.""

MacCallum brushed off the allegation, ""Come on, don’t throw that at me.""

MacCallum and Newsome then shouted over each other during the end of the contentious interview.

Less than a month ago, Newsome got into another heated argument during a Fox News interview. The BLM leader walked off an ""Unfiltered"" interview when host Dan Bongino confronted him for allegedly threatening violence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-leader-fox-news-interview,2021-12-11
Boehner gets choked up at Pelosi portrait unveiling ceremony,"Former GOP House Speaker John Boehner became emotional while delivering remarks honoring Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at a portrait unveiling ceremony on Wednesday.

Boehner, who served as speaker from early 2011 through late October 2015, became choked up when saying, in an apparent reference to his daughters, that his ""girls"" told him to tell Pelosi how much they admire her.

Boehner said that no other modern speaker has lead with the ""authority"" or ""consistent results"" as Pelosi, and he described the lawmaker as ""one tough cookie.""

Pelosi later said of Boehner that she would have been a bit ""disappointed if he did not get emotional.""

Pelosi is the first and only woman ever to serve as speaker of the House. While she was recently elected to another term in office, she has opted not to seek the leadership role again. She has served as a lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives for more than three decades.

""John Boehner crying as he paid tribute to Nancy Pelosi is the perfect symbol of uniparty pathology,"" Monica Crowley tweeted.

""Boehner crying in tribute to Pelosi while talking about how his daughters are Democrats is a pretty good summation of Republican leadership over the past couple of decades,"" Ben Shapiro tweeted.

Boston public schools cancel new advanced classes for high performing students because of racial inequalities,"Boston Public Schools officials said that a program with advanced learning classes would be cancelled over concerns that the classes served disproportionate racial groups.

The program known as Advanced Work Classes was intended to serve high-performing students in the fourth, fifth and sixth grade. Students are encouraged to study their subjects in a deeper and non-traditional manner.

School officials became concerned when a report showed that the program was disproportionately serving white students, and underserving black and Hispanic students.

The district analysis found that more than 70% of the students in the program were white or Asian, while nearly 80% of the students in the district are Hispanic or black.

""This is just not acceptable,"" said School Committee member Lorna Rivera in a school meeting in January. ""I've never heard these statistics before, and I'm very very disturbed by them.""

Rivera cited one finding at one school that showed the program included 60% white fourth graders though a majority of third graders are black or Hispanic.

Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told WGBH News on Friday that they would put the program on hiatus over the racial findings.

""There's been a lot of inequities that have been brought to the light in the pandemic that we have to address,"" Cassellius said. ""There's a lot of work we have to do in the district to be antiracist and have policies where all of our students have a fair shot at an equitable and excellent education.""

Students would be eligible in the program if they scored high on a test in third grade. Of those, participants were chosen by lottery. Officials said 453 students were invited to the program last fall, 143 students applied and 116 enrolled for the 2021 year.

Cassellius said students already enrolled in the program could continue, but it would be phased out for fourth and fifth grades.

Boy Scouts go from banning gay participants to participating in gay pride parade in 8 short years,"Back in 2015, the Boy Scouts of America organization officially ended its blanket ban on gay participants in an effort to accord with the spirit of the Obergefell Supreme Court decision, which, at the time, had just effectively legalized gay marriage throughout the United States. Now in 2022, some members of a Seattle-area BSA unit have participated in a local pride parade celebration.

On Sunday, young scouts joined the annual Seattle Pride parade, carrying a mix of American and rainbow pride flags to demonstrate their support for the local LGBTQ+ community. Breitbart reports that the scouts may have even been the first group to march in the parade, leading a series of LGBTQ+-affiliated groups that also included ardent pro-abortion advocates and even some naked male cyclists.

The scouts' participation in the pride event indicates that BSA has veered sharply away from its Christian roots and toward more secular values. Just a decade ago, BSA was embroiled in controversy for excluding gay scouts and scout leaders. Many local chapters were chartered with religious organizations, which often forbade homosexuality, as well as all extramarital sexual acts.

That all changed after Obergefell. Citing that “sea change in the law with respect to gay rights,” National BSA Executive Board members voted overwhelmingly in July 2015 to end the organization's ban on gay members. In early 2017, BSA began allowing transgender male youth into boys-only programs, and the rule banning biological girls from joining Cub Scouts was jettisoned later that year. As a result of these membership changes, Boy Scouts of America officially rebranded itself as ""Scouts BSA"" in February 2019.

Many foresaw this evolution in BSA membership and values when former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was named president of BSA in 2014. Gates is largely credited with undoing the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that governed the United States military for 17 years. In 2015, Gates described the BSA ban on homosexual participants as ""unsustainable.""

Despite this seismic shift toward LGBTQ+ ""diversity and inclusion,"" BSA still retains a faith-based identity. All scouts and scout leaders are required to subscribe to the Scout Oath, which still pledges loyalty to God and country and requires each pledger to ""keep myself morally straight."" Straight here makes no reference to sexual orientation. Rather it implies that scouts adhere to the Scout Law, which among other things, requires reverence toward God, fulfilling ""religious duties,"" and respecting the religious beliefs of others.

And at least in principle, Scouts BSA permits local units, which may be affiliated with religious organizations, to establish their own membership criteria. They may even exclude openly gay scout leaders, a move that BSA says ""respects the right of religious chartered organizations to continue to choose adult leaders whose beliefs are consistent with their own.""

But for now, if such traditional units still exist, they remain in the shadows. Meanwhile the BSA members who participated in the Seattle Pride parade have gone viral on social media, and Seattle Pride has even included a picture of the group on its homepage. Fair or unfair, the scouts in the pride parade have become the current face of Scouts BSA, even as membership numbers continue to decline.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boy-scouts-in-pride-parade,2022-06-27
"Top Georgia official calls out Biden, Warnock for 'false claims' about elections: 'Fairness only in Democratic victories'","Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger called out President Joe Biden and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) for repeating debunked claims about voter suppression in the Peach State.

Democrats, including Biden, have repeated baseless claims that a Georgia election security law passed last year disenfranchises Georgia voters, calling the law ""Jim Crow 2.0."" They claim the law makes voting more difficult. But Georgia experienced record voter turnout in the 2022 midterm elections, dispelling the narrative.

Surprisingly, Warnock has maintained the narrative despite, once again, winning a close election and securing his first full term in the U.S. Senate.

What did Raffensperger say?

The top Georgia official responded to Warnock's and Biden's ""false claims"" in an essay published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal.

""During [Warnock's] victory speech, Mr. Warnock stated: 'Just because [voters] endured the rain and cold and all kinds of tricks in order to vote, doesn’t mean that voter suppression does not exist.' I thought I had heard every conspiracy theory there was after the 2020 election, but the idea that Republicans control the weather to make it harder for Democrats to vote is a new one,"" Raffensperger wrote.

Warnock sees electoral ""fairness only in Democratic victories,"" Raffensperger declared, pointing to Warnock's criticism of elections when Democrats lose but his praise when they win.

""Warnock’s and Biden’s stolen-election claims would be laughable if they weren’t so dangerous to public trust in elections,"" Raffensperger wrote.

Democrats, Raffensperger pointed out, do not even believe their own rhetoric about Georgia's election laws, owing to the fact that the Democratic Party just moved up Georgia's primary election to increase its influence in the next presidential election cycle.

How did Warnock respond?

The Georgia Democrat disputed Raffensperger's claims, but did not actually engage with the substance of his criticism.

""We should not assume that because I won that voter suppression is not an issue in Georgia,"" Warnock said Monday on CBS News.

""The fact that people have had to overcome barriers doesn't mean those barriers don't exist,"" he went on to say. ""We literally saw college student and seniors in lines that were hours and hours and hours long. Maybe he's happy with that. I'm not. I think we can do better than that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brad-raffensperger-responds-georgia-voting-law-warnock-biden,2022-12-20
Victorious Braves fans mercilessly boo MLB commissioner — who took All-Star Game out of Georgia — after he starts speaking at World Series trophy presentation,"Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred had to know it was coming with an Atlanta Braves triumph in this year's World Series.

And sure enough, even though the Braves' clinching win Tuesday night took place on the Houston Astros' home field, a big contingent of Braves fans were in the building — and they hung around after the game, gathered along the third-base line, and dutifully began booing as soon as Manfred began speaking.

Check it out:

Rob Manfred delivers World Series trophy to the BRAVES! youtu.be

It really was like clockwork: Cheers for the Braves at the start of the video, immediate boos when Manfred began to speak, and cheering for the Braves after he was done.

What's the background?

Manfred already was on the hot seat — and getting massively mocked — after the Braves won the National League Championship Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers last week.

The reason? Manfred got woke in April and pulled the All-Star Game out of Atlanta over Georgia's new voting law. At the time Manfred said it was ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,"" that pro baseball ""fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions at the ballot box,"" and that ""fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support.""

Georgia's election reforms include requiring absentee ballots be verified with a photo ID and expanding early voting for primary and general elections — changes generally supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats.

After Manfred dumped Atlanta as the All-Star Game's host city, Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said ""Georgians — and all Americans — should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included.""

The Braves also issued a statement upon hearing the news saying they were ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision and that ""unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.""

Indeed, according to Fox News, the move actually was seen as hurting minorities by moving revenue from 51% black Atlanta to 76% white Denver, the All-Star Game's eventual landing spot.

'Straight KARMA'

Atlanta fans tore into Manfred and relished the vision of him handing the World Series trophy to the Braves — the ultimate revenge.

And then that very thing happened on live TV.

With that, Braves fans got in Manfred's virtual face once again and dined on their three-piece suit-wearing pound of flesh while basking in victory:

""Rob Manfred having to hand the @Braves the World Series Trophy last night is straight KARMA for f***ing them out of the All-Star game,"" one Twitter user declared. ""@MLB needs to thank the @Braves for overcoming the hypocrisy and making this an epic World Series.""

""Reminiscing on how Rob Manfred could not stand straight or avoid looking for the nearest exit while having to congratulate all the people he personally screwed over,"" another user noticed.

""Braves winning the World Series is the perfect bitch slap to Manfred,"" another user said. ""Moving the All-Star Game out of Georgia just for ATL to win it all with even more fans watching and in attendance. Hahaha.""

"Facebook: Trump will remain banned through at least January 7, 2023","Facebook has suspended former President Donald Trump for two years in response to a company Oversight Board ruling, the Washington Post reported on Friday.

The social media giant suspended Trump in January following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and later determined that his suspension would be on an indefinite basis.

The company's Oversight Board ruled, however, that two years is a suitable timeframe, and that an indefinite suspension simply lacked reason.

What are the details?

A blog post on the company's website states that the network will only reinstate the former president's credentials ""if the risk to public safety has receded.""

The Post reported, ""In ruling on whether the social network should reinstate Trump's account on its service, the largely independent Facebook-funded Oversight Board said the social media company was correct in suspending him in the moment but lacked a clear rationale for keeping him off the platform indefinitely.""

In the posting, Facebook Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said, ""We know that any penalty we apply — or choose not to apply — will be controversial. There are many people who believe it was not appropriate for a private company like Facebook to suspend an outgoing president from its platform, and many others who believe Mr. Trump should have immediately been banned for life. We know today's decision will be criticized by many people on opposing sides of the political divide — but our job is to make a decision in as proportionate, fair, and transparent a way as possible, in keeping with the instruction given to us by the Oversight Board.""

The announcement accompanied a graphic depicting how the company will roll out similar suspensions going forward, highlighting ""heightened penalties for public figures during times of civil unrest and ongoing violence.""

Depending on the violation, those people will be banned for a period of a month up to two years, and any ""violations after initial restrictions"" are subject to ""heightened penalties, up to and including permanent removal.""

Clegg added, ""In establishing the two year sanction for severe violations, we considered the need for it to be long enough to allow a safe period of time after the acts of incitement, to be significant enough to be a deterrent to Mr. Trump and others from committing such severe violations in future, and to be proportionate to the gravity of the violation itself.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/breaking-facebook-suspends-former-president-donald-trump-for-2-years,2021-06-04

He added, ""This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections. I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections.""

Original story continues below....



Major League Baseball announced Friday that it will no longer hold the 2021 All-Star Game in Atlanta, citing Georgia's recently passed law that implemented voting reforms.

But reporters say the league's bold move might put them in a ""tricky"" spot, given that other states — including the last host of the All-Star Game — have greater voting restrictions than the Peach State.

The game was scheduled for July 13 as part of the midsummer break that includes the Futures Game on July 11 and Home Run Derby the following night.

What are the details?

MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. issued a statement saying that after consulting with ""Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance,"" he has ""decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft.""

Manfred went on to say that the MLB ""fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions at the ballot box,"" adding that ""fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support.""

He concluded by saying that the league is ""finalizing a new host city and details about these events will be announced shortly.""

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed the state's sweeping new election reforms into law last week, which includes changes such as requiring absentee ballots be verified with a photo ID, and expanding early voting for primary and general elections.

But Democratic politicians are furious over the legislation's passage, with some calling for a boycott of Georgia over the new law, calling it restrictive.

As the news broke of MLB's decision to pull the All-Star Game out of Georgia for political reasons, several journalists were quick to point out that the league might have put itself in a tough position with the move.

The Dispatch associate editor Declan Garvey noted on Twitter, ""The last MLB All Star Game was held in Cleveland in 2019. Ohio requires voters applying for an absentee ballot to provide the same thing Georgia does. Ohio offers 22 days of early voting, Georgia offers at least 17, up to 19.""

Business Insider senior reporter Grace Panetta tweeted that the ""MLB may be putting themselves in a tricky situation here w/ a voting angle for host places for all-star games — do you base it on a state's laws or their recent legislative actions? Bc if it's the former, there are lot more states w more restrictive laws than GA.""

She added, ""like, if Georgia is now out by this standard, all of Texas kinda has to be for.....a while.""

Anything else?

Following MLB's announcement, the Atlanta Braves issued a statement saying the franchise is ""deeply disappointed"" by the league's decision.

The Braves' statement said:

""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion. Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community.

""Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision,"" the Braves added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/breaking-mlb-pulls-all-star-game-out-of-georgia-over-states-new-voting-law,2021-04-02
BREAKING: Rush Limbaugh has passed away,"Talk radio giant Rush Limbaugh has passed away, his wife, Kathryn, announced on his show Wednesday morning.

Limbaugh, the leading voice of the conservative movement, succumbed to his battle with lung cancer at the age of 70 after getting his Stage 4 diagnosis in January 2020.

El Rushbo was a pioneer in the radio industry, leading the way to get conservative and Republican issues and voices heard around the nation. He worked around the liberal monolith of the broadcast networks and the stranglehold Democrats had on the public airways.

Limbaugh began his nationally syndicated ""Rush Limbaugh Show"" in 1988 and at that moment began to reshape the Republican Party and the conservative movement.

The launch of the show came the year after the FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine that required equal time for both sides of political arguments. The repeal gave Limbaugh the opportunity to make the conservative case on political issues without the fear of the federal government cracking down on him for being one-sided.

For more than three decades, he would take to the ""golden EIB microphone"" and make the case to the country for conservative principles and advocate on behalf of elected GOP officials and up-and-coming Republican politicians.



The syndicated show began on just over 50 radio stations, but spread like wildfire. It became the most listened to radio show in the U.S. and was picked up by more than 600 stations. According to his website, Limbaugh's show boasted some 27 million weekly listeners.

Limbaugh was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1993 and the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1998.

Fox News noted that on his final broadcast, Limbaugh revealed that he had outlived his prognosis.

""I wasn't expected to be alive today,"" he said, Fox News reported. ""I wasn't expected to make it to October, and then to November, and then to December. And yet, here I am, and today, got some problems, but I'm feeling pretty good today.""

His love of the United States earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump during the State of the Union Address in 2020, shortly after he received his cancer diagnosis.

""Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country,"" Trump declared during the address.

Breaking: South Dakota House rejects Gov. Noem's 'style and form' revisions to transgender sports bill,"The South Dakota House of Representatives on Monday overwhelmingly rejected Gov. Kristi Noem's ""style and form"" revisions to the Women's Fairness in Sports bill.

State house lawmakers voted 67-2 against certifying Noem's recommended changes to a bill that would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex. The bill, H.B. 1217, was designed to prevent gender-dysphoric males who identify as females from competing in sports against women.

Two weeks ago, Gov. Noem sent H.B. 1217 back to the legislature with a ""style and form"" veto, a power she has under the state constitution to suggest changes to a bill related to the style or form of the legislative text. Noem said that the protections for women's sports teams were ""unrealistic in the context of collegiate athletics"" and asked lawmakers to remove provisions that would apply to collegiate athletics, in addition to other changes conservative supporters of the legislation claimed would gut the bill. The governor used her style and form veto power to dramatically revise the legislation, striking some sections entirely in a move several state lawmakers characterized as an unconstitutional abuse of her executive authority.

The state House considered Noem's proposed changes on ""Veto Day,"" the last day of the legislative session in South Dakota during which lawmakers will consider bills vetoed by the governor.

In debate before the vote to certify Noem's changes, the bill's House sponsor, Rep. Rhonda Milstead (R-Hartford), said the changes were ""not appropriate for the executive branch,"" KELO-TV reports. Other lawmakers said Noem's revisions were not actually related to ""style"" or ""form,"" which is generally understood to mean corrections in grammatical errors or the like, not substantial changes to the proposed law.

The governor needed a simple majority of the state House and then the state Senate to certify her proposed revisions. In the end, only two lawmakers in the House voted in favor of Noem's version of H.B. 1217.

The bill now heads back to the governor's desk. According to South Dakota's Constitution, ""if the Governor certifies that the bill conforms with the Governor's specific recommendations, the bill shall become law. If the Governor fails to certify the bill, it shall be returned to the Legislature as a vetoed bill.""

A spokesman for Noem's office previously told TheBlaze that if the legislature rejected her revisions, Noem would call for a special session of the legislature to draft a new bill.

""If the legislature declines to accept her Style and Form, Governor Noem is proposing that they suspend the rules and pass her recommended changes as a new bill, or she can call them back into special session to accomplish the same goal with a simple majority,"" Noem communications director Ian Fury said.

Last week, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a version of the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act"" that requires athletes to compete on teams that match their sex. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) signed a similar bill that requires student athletes to play on the teams that match the sex declared on their birth certificates.



Editor's Note: This article was updated on 3/29 at 2:00 p.m. ET to correct an error regarding the ""style or form"" revision power in the South Dakota Constitution. Governor Noem will not have an opportunity to sign the original draft of H.B. 1217, she must either certify that the bill comports with her specific revisions or decline to certify the bill, returning it to the legislature as a vetoed bill. TheBlaze regrets the error.

Fox News anchor confronts CDC director on how many deaths are 'from COVID' versus 'with COVID' — but she can't say,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier confronted CDC Director Rochelle Walensky Sunday over several topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether she could explain how many COVID deaths in the United States are ""from COVID"" versus ""with COVID.""

What is the background?

More than 836,000 Americans have died from COVID, but the government has yet to distinguish deaths from COVID and deaths with COVID. The key difference being: Did the person die from their COVID infection or did they die for another reason, but tested positive for COVID before they passed away?

In fact, the CDC explains that up to 95% — or perhaps even more — of all COVID deaths happened in Americans with co-morbidities or other conditions.

""There were co-morbidities or other conditions listed on the death certificate for as many as 95% of all COVID-19 deaths,"" the CDC explains. ""The other 5% of death certificates in which COVID-19 was the only condition listed was likely related to a lack of detail listed about other conditions present at the time of death.""

What happened Sunday?

During an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" anchor Bret Baier confronted Walensky about whether she could explain how many Americans have died from COVID versus with COVID.

""How many of the 836,000 deaths in the U.S. linked to COVID are 'from COVID' or how many are 'with COVID,' but they had other co-morbidities? Do you have that breakdown?"" Baier asked.

Walensky, however, failed to provide the breakdown.

""Yes, of course with Omicron we’re following that very carefully,"" Walensky said ""Our death registry, of course, takes a few weeks to — and is a — takes a few weeks to collect, and of course, Omicron has just been with us for a few weeks, but those data will be forthcoming.""

Later in the interview, Baier asked Walensky if her leadership has eroded the public's trust in the CDC, which she promised to repair when Joe Biden appointed her to lead the agency.



""Do you think that it's fair to say that the trust and confidence the public has gone down with the CDC?"" Baier asked.

In response, Walenksy noted how ""hard"" her job has been.

""You know, this is hard,"" Walenksy said. ""We have ever-evolving science with an ever-evolving variant and my job is to provide updated guidance in the context of rapidly rising cases. And that is what we've done and I'm here to explain it to the American people and I'm committed to continuing to do so and to continuing to improve.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bret-baier-rochelle-walensky-covid-deaths,2022-01-09
Brett Favre blasts Olympic inclusion of trans weightlifter Laurel Hubbard: ‘It’s a man competing as a woman — that’s unfair!’,"NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre said recently that transgender lifter Laurel Hubbard should not be permitted to compete in women's events in next month's Tokyo Games.

What are the details?

During a recent episode on his podcast, ""Bolling with Favre,"" the Green Bay Packers legend said that Hubbard is masquerading as a woman in order to compete in women's Olympic sports.

""It's a man competing as a woman."" he insisted. ""That's unfair! It's not fair for a man, even if this person wants to be a woman or feels compelled — if you want to become the opposite sex, that's fine. I got no problem with it. But you can't compete against — males cannot compete against females.""

Favre added, ""If I was a true female — I can't believe I'm saying that — and I was competing in weightlifting and lost to this person, I would be beside myself.""

Hubbard, 43, is the first transgender woman to qualify for the Olympics and will compete on New Zealand's weightlifting team in the super heavyweight 87-kg category.

What else?

On Monday, Hubbard said, ""I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many New Zealanders.""

New Zealand Olympic Committee CEO Kereyn Smith also announced that Hubbard has the support of the committee, and proclaimed its dedication to perpetuating a sense of ""inclusion and respect for all.""

""We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,"" Smith said. ""As the New Zealand Team, we have a strong culture of ... inclusion and respect for all.""

In May, Belgium weightlifter Anna Vanbellinghen said that the decision to include Hubbard in the women's events at the Tokyo Games is ""like a bad joke.""

""First off, I would like to stress that I fully support the transgender community, and that what I'm about to say doesn't come from a place of rejection of this athlete's identity,"" she said at the time.

She added that ""anyone that has trained weightlifting at a high level knows this to be true in their bones: this particular situation is unfair to the sport and to the athletes.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brett-favre-olympics-trans-weightlifter-unfair,2021-06-23
Brit Hume rebukes January 6 committee as partisan,"Brit Hume delivered a scathing rebuke of the January 6 committee this week. The Fox News senior political analyst noted that in 50 years of covering Washington, D.C. politics, he's ""never seen a committee all of whose members were chosen by one party.""

Hume was responding to a tweet by Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York.

""There's a long tradition of adversarial process in congressional hearings/investigations,"" York wrote on Friday. ""You don't have to compare it to a trial to know something is wrong with the J6 committee.""



Hume tacked on to York's post, ""I've covered Washington for more than 50 years, including 11 years covering Congress specifically. I’ve never seen a committee all of whose members were chosen by one party, and where there is no cross-examination or any attempt to present both sides.""

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) pushed back against Hume's assertation.

""Hey Brit. It’s been all Republicans testifying. Definitely one-sided, just not in how you think it is,"" the ""never-Trump"" Republican tweeted. ""And as you well know, Kevin McCarthy took his ball and went home. You all sound nervous.""

Hume had previously hammered the Jan. 6 committee for being partisan.

On July 1, the Fox News commentator criticized the Jan. 6 committee and media, ""Hyping the events to increase interest, knowing most of the media will eagerly play along is what this committee does best."" He included a link to an article written by York titled: ""The Jan. 6 committee charade.""

On June 11, Hume labeled the primetime hearing as an ""utterly one-sided presentation.""

On June 13, Hume belittled the Jan. 6 committee as ""a televised press release with soundbites.""

""I've never seen anything quite like it in my life, and I certainly never imagined back in the day when I was working for one of the broadcast networks' news divisions, that such an event would ever be put on primetime television by one of the networks,"" he declared during a Fox News appearance. ""And in this case, it was done by all of them. Quite remarkable.""

Brit Hume rips Jan. 6 hearing: A ‘televised press release with soundbites’ www.youtube.com

On June 7, he tweeted, ""It is not normal for a supposedly bipartisan committee to have its members all chosen by one party.""

Hume included a video clip of his appearance on Fox News' ""Special Report.""

Hume pointed out that the Jan. 6 committee is comprised of Democrats Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin, Bennie Thompson, Zoe Lofgren, Pete Aguilar, Stephanie Murphy, and Elaine Luria. He also noted that the ""one-sided"" committee had anti-Trump Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger hand-selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Hume called Cheney and Kinzinger are ""Republican members who could be counted on to agree with the conclusions already reached by"" Pelosi.

""This is very much a partisan hearing, which is not to say that interesting facts won’t come out and they won’t make an interesting presentation in primetime but, look, this is only partially a hearing to determine the facts,"" Hume told host Brett Baier. ""It is as much as anything else an effort to give the Democrats an issue that they can run on when nearly all the other issues that people care about are working against them.""



Rasmussen Reports noted that the Capitol riot or the January 6 committee did not make the top nine midterm issues for U.S. voters. However, issues that are hurting Democrats make up the top four: rising gas prices, inflation, the economy, and violent crime.

Hume conceded that President Donald Trump's behavior following the 2020 election was ""outrageous"" and ""utterly disgraceful."" However, he doesn't believe that the Jan. 6 committee will be able to prove that the United States was close to losing its democracy, as Democrats have blustered.



Hume said on June 23, ""The 1/6 committee is pounding home the point that Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. He certainly did. But the testimony has not come close to establishing Chairman Bennie Thompson's claim that we came 'critically close to losing our democracy' that day.""

""That's because, as the testimony has shown, Trump's scheme was utterly half-assed,"" he continued. ""The legal theory on which it rested was ridiculous. Its linchpin was refusal by vice president Pence to refuse to count the 2020 electoral votes showing Joe Biden the winner. When Pence refused, the scheme collapsed.""

""All this happened in the context of an ugly riot, which Trump had triggered, not by what he said on 1/6 but by the stolen-election bs he had been feeding his supporters for two months,"" he stated. ""In the end, the electoral vote count was delayed for several hours, but went forward that day. Outrageous behavior by a president unable to admit error or defeat to be sure. But the near-death of American democracy? Not even close.""

Last July, Pelosi rejected two appointees chosen by Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on the House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. In response to Pelosi rejecting House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), McCarthy yanked all five of the Republicans he had selected to sit on the January 6 committee.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brit-hume-jan-6-committee,2022-07-02
"Brutal new poll reveals '5-alarm fire' for Democrats as GOP gains significantly among black, Hispanic voters","A new Wall Street Journal poll released Friday depicts what is being described as a ""5-alarm fire for the Democratic Party.""

The poll of 1,500 registered voters showed that a majority of voters (57%) disapprove of President Joe Biden's job performance, while 63% of registered voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and 65% of voters believe the economy is headed in the wrong direction.

Those are horrible numbers for the Democratic Party, which exercises the most political control in Washington. The sentiments also underscore the uphill battle Democrats face if they want to retain that control after the 2022 midterm elections.

In fact, a majority of respondents in the Journal poll overwhelmingly believe that Biden — the head of the Democratic Party — is not focused on the right issues, and disapprove of his handling of the economy, inflation, the border crisis, immigration, and crime. They also agreed that Biden is not a strong leader.

Compounding problems, the poll found that more registered voters are likely to vote for Republicans than Democrats (46% to 41%) in the upcoming election. Thus, they believe the Republican Party is the antidote to the problems that Biden and Democrats have failed to fix.

Despite all of those problems, it somehow gets even worse for Democrats: Republicans are making significant inroads among Hispanic and black voters.

In fact, since the last Journal poll in November, Republicans have gained nine percentage points among Hispanic voters, while Democrats lost 21 points among black voters. In the November survey, 56% of black voters said they favor voting for a Democrat in 2022. Now, just 35% say they favor Democrats. Support for Republicans among black voters, then, rose a whopping 12 points from the November survey to 27% today, the Journal reported.

Philip Klein, writing at National Review, summarized the reality of the poll: ""It’s fair to say that if these numbers are anywhere close to the actual results, Democrats will be massacred in November.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brutal-new-poll-reveals-5-alarm-fire-for-democrats-as-gop-gains-significantly-among-black-hispanic-voters,2022-03-11
"Buffalo's presumptive next mayor is a socialist who admits she hasn't studied socialism since grade school, says it can be 'super confusing'","India Walton — the up-and-coming socialist politician poised to become the next mayor of Buffalo, New York — admitted recently that she hasn't studied the controversial political theory since grade school.

The 38-year-old community activist scored a surprise victory in the city's mayoral Democratic primary earlier this year by touting aggressive socialist policies. But when it came time to explain the theory, she appeared to be at a loss for words.

""I've never studied socialism besides in grade school,"" Walton acknowledged during an interview with Business Insider when asked about the differences between socialism and its trendy new counterpart, democratic socialism.

""My values most closely align with social programming and the belief that government should serve the people,"" she went on to say. ""Getting caught up in the conversation about socialism versus democratic socialism versus democracy is semantics. It's super confusing. The bottom line is that we just put people before profit. Simple as that.""

When the interviewer responded by suggesting she drop the ""semantic baggage"" and simply call herself a progressive Democrat, Walton backtracked.

""Because progressive Democrats have not delivered for the people, and I want to be accountable to the people that I serve,"" she answered.

Walton also went on to criticize the current social-economic structure in largely the way an avowed socialist would, claiming, ""We have a system that's been set up to keep certain groups of people impoverished, while other folks, you know, make record profits off of the labor of others.""

Later she claimed, ""What we do need to do is appeal to the sensibility of a lot of wealthy folks, that they should pay their fair share, that they should pay their workers a fair and living wage.""



Perhaps Walton doesn't realize that governing as a socialist would mean doing more than simply ""appealing to the sensibility"" of wealthy Americans; it would be actually taking money from them through force. Or perhaps she was aiming to pitch the idea in a more positive light.

The latter seems more likely given certain elements of the politician's campaign platform, as reported by Mother Jones:

In her first 100 days, Walton has promised to sign a tenant's bill of rights that would install a tenant advocate and institute rent control. She wants to remove police from responding to most mental health calls. She plans to declare Buffalo a sanctuary city. She would be the first woman to be Buffalo's mayor. While there are other radicalmayors in the United States, Walton would be the only socialist mayor in a major city.

Buttigieg initiative to address racial inequalities in highway systems: 'It's about mending what has been broken',"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has launched an initiative that seeks to redress inequalities created by civil engineering in previous generations.

According to the AP, Buttigieg's Reconnecting Communities project aims to reunify historically black neighborhoods divided decades ago when the interstate highway system was developed and restore the civic pride that comes with safe and beautiful green spaces.

“Transportation can connect us to jobs, services and loved ones, but we‘ve also seen countless cases around the country where a piece of infrastructure cuts off a neighborhood or a community because of how it was built,” Buttigieg said on Thursday.

“This is a forward-looking vision,” he continued. “Our focus isn’t about assigning blame. It isn’t about getting caught up in guilt. It’s about fixing a problem. It’s about mending what has been broken, especially when the damage was done with taxpayer dollars.”

The pilot program allows municipalities up to five years to apply for funding for mass transit lines; green spaces built on top of roadways, known as freeway lids or ""caps""; repurposing defunct rail lines; and perhaps even rerouting or partially removing highways. Targeted areas include New Orleans, Houston, Tampa, and perhaps Nashville.

At least, that's what Tennessee Democrat state Rep. Harold Love Jr. is hoping.

“If you’re born here and all you see are these structures like this that are wrought-iron fences and chain-link fences and the noise from the interstate, what you assume is, ‘I’m not valued,’ because they placed this here,” Love said a year ago. “But if you could change that model and talk about how you were once valued in this neighborhood, and were trying to re-create that value by putting this (cap) here, you may change the mindset of children growing up here.”

Despite the enthusiasm for the project in some circles, Buttigieg and the project have also received their fair share of criticism.

“I heard some stuff, some weird stuff from the secretary of transportation trying to make this about social issues,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. “To me, a road’s a road.”

DeSantis also called it further evidence of ""woke-ification"" of American politics and culture.

Senator Ted Cruz expressed similar sentiments. ""The roads are racist. We must get rid of roads,"" he tweeted last November.

Others say that the project won't be very effective at its current price point of $1 billion, a far cry from the $20 billion President Biden proposed initially. However, those cities that participate in the Reconnecting Communities project will be considered for other Department of Transformation resources as well.

According to the AP, the program is expected to allocate $195 million of the $1 billion this year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/buttigieg-racist-roads,2022-06-30
Caitlyn Jenner backs ban on transgender swimmers competing against biological women — 'What's fair is fair!' — and leftists go nuts,"On the heels of swimming's international governing body banning transgender women from competing against biological women if they don't transition by age 12, former Olympic champion and transgender woman Caitlyn Jenner backed the ban.

“It worked!” Jenner tweeted Sunday in response to the FINA ruling. “I took a lot of heat — but what’s fair is fair! If you go through male puberty you should not be able to take medals away from females. Period.”

How are folks reacting?

Jenner being an outspoken and controversial figure means the former world champion's tweet got a lot of attention — and as you might guess, leftists hated Jenner's take. Here are some examples:

""How do you identify as a female after this statement?"" one Twitter commenter wondered.

""Breaking News - Transgender Celebrity is anti LGBTQI,"" another user declared.

""You are happy about removing your own people from something. Wow,"" another commenter said.

""You’re out of date, Caitlyn,"" another user stated. ""Celebrating a blanket-ban on your own is dreadful.""

""You are a traitor and a fraud. Don't expect a warm welcome at any trans or LGBT thing ever,"" another commenter warned. ""You are despicable.""

""Can we please ban @Caitlyn_Jenner? She's done more to stir hatred against the trans community than anyone on earth,"" another user said. ""But at least she's joined the 1%...vote-wise ...""

""You are a true jackass; I am sure the Republicans will give you the same respect they gave the Log Cabin Republicans,"" another commenter predicted. ""Stay in your wealthy, not-caring-about-anything lane, Caitlyn.""

""How is it that you are trans yourself, but you are a transphobe and a homophobe?! I don't get it,"" another user asked. ""Don't you play on a women's golf team, too?? Maybe you should be banned from that ... No wonder why your kids want nothing to do with you; I'd feel the same way.""

""You are an asshole who doesn’t understand medical suppression or basically human biology,"" another commenter exclaimed. ""You are no friend or ally to the community you claim to be a part of. Shame on you!""

But also a surprising number of commenters agreed with Jenner:

""Speaking as a trans woman, we all understand this truth,"" one user noted. ""Acceptance is vital but not at the cost of defying logic. Unfortunately the political arm of the trans movement doesn't see it that way.""

""Never thought a day would come where I’ll be supporting a transgender woman’s statement,"" another commenter stated. ""I’m glad there are still sane ones amongst them.""

""Thank you for helping so much with this. I know you took a lot of heat, and I know you are NOT anti LGBTQ. You knew from personal experience that this was wrong and you fought to stop it,"" another user said. ""You've become a good role model for the trans community. Thank you!""

FINA's ruling means headline-grabbing transgender female swimmer Lia Thomas can't compete against women in elite events. In March, Thomas became the first transgender individual to win a NCAA Division I title after a victory in the women's 500-yard freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Championships. Thomas told Sports Illustrated in March that swimming at the 2024 Olympic trials is a goal.

In conjunction with its ruling, FINA proposed a new ""open competition policy"" that would allow transgender athletes to compete in another category.

Caitlyn Jenner labeled 'traitor' after saying women's sports must be protected from transgender athletes,"Caitlyn Jenner, one of the most famous transgender people, said Saturday that transgender biological boys should not be allowed to compete in women's sports.

Jenner commented on the controversial issues about one week after announcing she was running for governor of California. Jenner is seeking the office as a Republican in a special election that was triggered after activists gathered more than 2 million signatures to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).

What did Jenner say?

Speaking with TMZ, Jenner said the issue boils down to fairness and protecting the integrity of women's sports.

""This is a question of fairness,"" Jenner, who won the gold medal for men's decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, said.

""That's why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls' sports in school. It just isn't fair. And we have to protect girls' sports in our schools,"" Jenner added.

Jenner declined to answer a follow up question asking whether her perspective was ""delegitimizing"" of a transgender person's identity.

However, Jenner later said on Twitter that her position is ""clear.""

""I didn't expect to get asked this on my Saturday morning coffee run, but I'm clear about where I stand. It's an issue of fairness and we need to protect girls' sports in our schools,"" Jenner tweeted.

In response, Jenner was labeled a ""traitor.""

""You are such a traitor @Caitlyn_Jenner So we need to 'protect girls sports' from other girls now? And fairness? Don't you know how testosterone blockers work?"" one person said.

""Can you please stop pretending to speak for anyone but yourself and your financial interests? Thanks,"" another person said.

""Can you please stop pretending to speak for anyone but yourself and your financial interests? Thanks,"" another person said. ""The only trans girl who shouldnt be allowed to run with everybody else is you lol,"" another person told Jenner.

""'Equality for me, inequality for thee' — Caitlyn Jenner,"" another person mocked.

What are states doing?

Most LGBT activists say that gender identity, rather than biological sex, should be the determining factor for kids who play sports. However, there is widespread disagreement about that — and states are taking action to protect the integrity of women's sports.



This year, numerous states have passed bills prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in sports that correspond with their gender identity, including: Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Florida will become the fifth state enact such a law, while South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) enacted an executive order on the issue.

Dozens of other states are considering similar legislation.

In response, LGBT activists are pressuring corporations to affirm their view of sexuality and gender, denouncing opposition to their perspective as ""discrimination."" The Human Rights Campaign, for example, is even pressuring the NCAA to not hold events in states that enact legislation that protects women's sports.

However, as the Associated Press noted, there has not been actual backlash against the bills, indicating the bills have won overall approval. Still, LGBT activists promise future repercussions.

""A lot of Americans are still getting to know trans people and they're learning about these issues for the first time,"" Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told the AP. ""Over time, they get to know their trans neighbors, they get outraged by these bans, and corporations respond ...

California bans state travel to Florida and four other states over Fairness in Women's Sports laws,"California has now banned state employee travel to Florida and four more states because of laws that purportedly discriminate against LGBTQ Americans, the state attorney general announced Monday.

Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta restricted state-funded travel to Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia, adding these states to a list that now includes 17 states where state-sponsored travel is prohibited.

""When states discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans, California law requires our office to take action,"" Bonta said. ""These new additions to the state-funded travel restrictions list are about exactly that. It's been 52 years to the day since the Stonewall Riots began, but that same fight remains all too alive and well in this country. Rather than focusing on solving real issues, some politicians think it's in their best interest to demonize trans youth and block life-saving care.

""Make no mistake: We're in the midst of an unprecedented wave of bigotry and discrimination in this country — and the State of California is not going to support it.""

The laws Bonta claims ""demonize trans youth and block life-saving care"" are fairness in women's sports bills, legislation that would prevent men who identify as transgender women from competing on sports teams associated with their self-proclaimed gender identity. California lawmakers banned nonessential travel to states that adopted or are considering such laws in 2016, a list that includes Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas.

Bonta's office identified fairness in women's sports laws in Florida, Montana, Arkansas, and West Virginia as cause for the travel ban.

The attorney general also called out Arkansas for passing a law that makes transgender surgeries and cross-sex hormone prescriptions illegal for minors and North Carolina for adopting a law that permits certain publicly funded student organizations, say a religious group, to restrict LGBT students from joining by citing conscience rights without losing funding.

Reacting to the announcement, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' office ridiculed California and accused ""politicians in Sacramento"" of failing to stand up for women's rights.

""Congratulations to California for somehow managing to create a new way to politicize its bureaucracy,"" DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw said. ""The bill Governor DeSantis signed is not discriminatory; in fact, it's the opposite — the legislation ensures that women's sports remain fair. On the contrary, allowing biological males to compete in women's sports is discriminatory, because it puts girls and women at a disadvantage based on immutable, innate characteristics.

""It is disappointing that the politicians calling the shots in Sacramento are not willing to stand up for women and girls in California.""

Pushaw added that despite the ban on state-funded travel, Florida will continue to welcome any Californians who wish to travel for tourism or to become new residents.

""In fact, I am originally from California myself — but I am thrilled to live in Florida now, because progressive dogma has turned my home state into a nightmare of crime, unemployment, closed schools, failing businesses, and high taxes,"" Pusahw said. ""I respectfully suggest that California's government focus on fixing the problems in their own state instead of worrying about Florida.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-bans-state-travel-florida,2021-06-29
"California city will send all adult residents, including non-US citizens, $100 in taxpayer funds to donate to political candidates","Oakland, California, residents passed a measure to give all adult residents $100 in taxpayer-funded vouchers, called ""Democracy Dollars,"" to donate to local political candidates every other year, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.



The ballot measure, called the Fair Elections Act, was approved by nearly 74% of residents, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Every two years, residents 18 years and older will receive four $25 vouchers that can be donated to local political candidates running for mayor, City Council, or school board positions. All legal permanent adult residents, including non-U.S. citizens, will receive those vouchers, which will be paid for by the city's general funds.

The most recent draft of the act explains that the initiative aims to ""curb corruption,"" encourage more public participation in local elections, and help finance candidates not funded by donors with significant wealth. Additionally, the program will prevent former city officials from becoming lobbyists.

Candidates hoping to receive residents' vouchers must first qualify for the program by raising a certain amount in contributions. For instance, a mayoral candidate must receive 400 contributions of at least $10 each. Certified candidates will also have to agree to spending caps.

Daniel Newman, cofounder and president of Maplight, the nonpartisan organization that supported Oakland's measure, told Fast Company, ""We're seeking to help candidates run for office and win, who would be great elected officials but don't have access to wealth.""

The act was based on a similar measure enacted in Seattle in 2017, the first of its kind. According to University of Washington research, the program resulted in more candidates running for local office, creating a more challenging race for incumbents.

Liz Suk, executive director of Oakland Rising, an organization that backed the ballot measure, claimed that Seattle's program was successful at increasing overall resident participation in elections and ""voter turnout from communities of color,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The University of Washington reported that Seattle's programs increased donations in local elections by 53% per race. The number of contributors per race also increased by 350%. However, the study also found that only 2% and 5% of vouchers were used.

Alameda County Taxpayers Association President Marcus Crawley argued that Oakland's measure, which was based on Seattle's existing program, would be ""biased toward incumbents"" and ultimately waste taxpayer dollars.

According to the draft measure, the program will cost at least $700,000 in start-up costs and another $1,850,000 to administer the ""Democracy Dollars.""

California education 'equity' official resigns after being outed for living in Texas,"A second high-ranking California state education official was forced to resign after news broke that she permanently resided in a different state, some 1,500 miles away.

What are the details?

Pamela Kadakia, who formerly served as the California Department of Education's equity project manager, was relieved of her duties last week upon discovery that she and her husband actually live in the Dallas, Texas, area, Politico reported.

Based on her LinkedIn profile, Kadakia, 34, pursued her doctorate in education at Texas A&M University from 2019 to 2021 and, before being hired by California, taught for several years at Richland College. Politico added that, according to public housing records, Kadakia and her husband purchased a home in the Dallas area in 2019.

The California Department of Education confirmed Kadakia's resignation in a statement to the outlet, noting that her employment violated a state law requiring state employees to live in California unless their jobs require them to live elsewhere.

“We sought to ensure that all our personnel were in line with the new guidance. In doing so, we accepted Ms. Kadakia’s resignation,"" the department said.

What else?

Kadakia's controversial work-life situation was made worse by the fact that she lives in a state where California employees are not even allowed to travel in an official capacity, due to a newly enacted travel ban on states with ""discriminatory laws.""

Texas is one of 17 states currently off-limits for state-funded travel from California because the states adopted or were considering adopting laws that purportedly support discrimination against LGBTQ individuals.

Many of the laws in question in the banned states are bills for fairness in women's sports that seek to protect women's athletics by prohibiting biological males from competing against females. Other bills in the banned states make transgender surgeries and hormone therapy illegal for minors or protect the rights of religious groups by allowing them to prevent LGBTQ persons from joining without losing funding.

Anything else?

Kadakia is not the first California education official to lose a job for living out of state. Earlier in December, her boss, Daniel Lee, was forced to resign after Politico reported that he lives in Pennsylvania.

Lee, a Philadelphia-based psychologist and life coach, was named California's first superintendent of equity despite the fact that he was living on the East Coast and working another job at the same time.

California's superintendent of public instruction Tony Thurmond had reportedly been instrumental in Lee's hiring and offered him the job before posting the position to the public.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-education-official-in-texas-resigns,2021-12-27
Fox News reporter gets education secretary to make telling admission about student loan debt forgiveness,"Education Secretary Miguel Cardona openly admitted Wednesday that President Joe Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan will not benefit Americans who already paid off their debt or never used debt to pay for college.

The admission underscores what millions of Americans — those who paid off their loans already — believe is an unfair plan.

What happened?

Speaking with Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy outside the White House, Cardona addressed criticism that says the plan is not fair.

According to Cardona, the aim of the plan is to ""address the effects of the pandemic."" He claimed his responsibility as education secretary is to ensure that people are not worse off now than they were before the pandemic hit. The claim is confusing, because Americans who hold student loan debt have had a pause on repaying loans for 2.5 years.

""But to the fairness question, the people that are sitting at home having just paid off their student loans or having paid them off years ago, what’s in it for them?"" Doocy pushed back.

The secretary, however, completely dodged the question.

""We should be proud that we’re able to help Americans that need help right now, just like we helped small businesses during the pandemic,"" he responded. ""It’s about making sure we’re taking care of Americans and investing in our economy and in our people.""

As the interview went on, Doocy got Cardona to admit that people who paid back their student loans will see zero benefits.

""Just the final one on this: The people that already paid their student loans, they don’t get anything out of this deal?"" Doocy pressed.

""Right,"" Cardona admitted.

Biden was also confronted about the inherent unfairness of the plan at a press conference on Wednesday and responded by sniping at the reporter who dared question him.

""Is this unfair to people who paid their student loans or chose not to take out loans?"" asked ABC News correspondent Karen Travers.

""Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multibillion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax breaks? Is that fair? What do you think?"" Biden shot back.

What is the plan?

Biden announced Wednesday that he will forgive $10,000 of student loan debt for every borrower who earns less than $125,000 annually. For those who received Pell Grants, they will have $20,000 of debt forgiven.

The controversial plan will use a post-9/11 law, known as the HEROES Act of 2003, as the legal standing to unilaterally forgive debt and the supposed national emergency stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic as its justification.

The plan does not address the astronomically high price of college, which is a primary driving factor behind the student loan debt crisis.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cardona-admits-student-loan-debt-plan-unfair,2022-08-25
CBS host offers bizarre excuse for Walgreens shoplifter caught on camera: ‘You’re getting probably something you need’,"Tony Dokoupil, co-host of ""CBS This Morning,"" appeared to defend a man who made headlines this week after brazenly shoplifting from a San Francisco-area Walgreens.

What's a brief history here?

Footage of the incident went viral Tuesday, showing an unidentified male on a bicycle filling a trash bag with what appeared to be hair products.

Two people — including a store security guard — filmed the suspect while he took his time placing items in the sack and watched him as he biked down the aisle and out of the store.

What are the details?

Dokoupil and others discussed the incident Wednesday morning on the daytime TV show.

After the clip aired, Dokoupil began, ""So, crime is never justified of course.""

Co-host Anthony Mason added, ""I will say that I think they could have made a little better effort to stop that bicycle. I mean, you could have disrupted that bike.""

Dokoupil added, ""Well, I mean, I don't know. You don't need to be a hero over some toothbrushes or whatever it is. ... That reads also as an act of desperation. I mean, you're not getting rich off what you take from a Walgreens, you're getting probably something you need.""



Co-host Vlad Duthiers interjected, ""I mean, a bagful? They looked like hair products ... which are valuable, and he's filling his bag full of them.""

Co-host Adriana Diaz pointed out that the items in the bag were, indeed, hair products and not a necessity as toothbrushes or over the counter medication might be.

Anything else to know?

Lyanne Melendez, a KGO-TV reporter who saw the suspect shoving merchandise into the trash bag, told her station that the suspect — who remains unnamed at the time of this reporting — ""sort of ran into me with his bicycle"" on his way out of the store.

""It's hard for me as a journalist to say 'I won't be involved, I can't get involved,' I have to be sort of neutral, but this is also my city,"" Melendez added. ""I live in this city, and I see this constantly. Not only Walgreens, but cars, and my garage ... has been broken into twice.""

She also pointed out that such crimes are becoming commonplace across the city.

""At what point do we say, 'Enough is enough, we want our city back?'"" Melendez asked.

A crime-ridden city

On Wednesday, San Francisco Police Lt. Tracy McCray told Fox News that she has gotten ""used to"" shoplifters taking what they want in stores across the cities without facing consequences.

""What happened in that Walgreens has been going on in that city for quite a while,"" McCray said. ""I'm used to it. I mean, we can have a greatest hits compilation of people just walking in and cleaning out the store shelves and security guards, the people who work there, just standing by helplessly because they can't do anything.""

All fingers, however, seem to point to District Attorney Chesa Boudin as the cause of the behavior.

San Francisco Police Officers Association President Tony Montoya slammed Boudin's laissez-faire policies, which he said are promoting a ""criminals-first"" agenda.

""This brazen criminal behavior is endured every single day by San Franciscans and it is the direct result of District Attorney Chesa Boudin and his enablers' criminals-first agenda,"" Montoya said.



McCray agreed, and said that Boudin's agenda is destroying the city because criminals are not being prosecuted for ""any crimes as a felony or commercial burglary,"" and said that such theft cases ""get slapped down to a misdemeanor.""

""Not enough cops out. You try to put a cop at every corner, which is unrealistic,"" McCray added.""If you steal below $950, you get a citation and you just get to walk away and if you don't show up to court, guess what, maybe you get a bench warrant or maybe they even toss that before it even gets to that point. Anybody can come in and do whatever they want.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-host-excuses-walgreens-shoplifter,2021-06-16
Former CDC chief says he got death threats from fellow scientists after he went public with his belief that the coronavirus came from a lab in China,"Last March, former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield betrayed the COVID-19 ""expert"" community.

Instead of toeing the line on the animal-to-human transmission of the virus, Redfield went on record in an interview with CNN that he believes the coronavirus pandemic began in when the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China — and that it started months earlier than the U.S. knew.

His betrayal, according to a new report from Vanity Fair, led to multiple death threats to the former CDC chief — from his fellow scientists.

What did Redfield say about the labs?

In an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta on March 26, Redfield said it was his opinion that the novel coronavirus did not evolve naturally from animal to human but instead escaped a well-known pathology lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The WIV houses ""the only facility in China permitted to handle the most dangerous known pathogens, including the Ebola and Lassa viruses,"" Axios reported in April 2020, and is ""home to the Chinese scientists who sequenced the complete novel coronavirus genome in early January [2020] and who are now working on a vaccine.""

""I'm of the point of view that I still think the most likely etiology of this pathology in Wuhan was from a laboratory — escaped,"" Redfield told CNN. ""Other people don't believe that. That's fine. Science will eventually figure it out.

""It's not unusual for respiratory pathogens that are being worked on in a laboratory to infect the laboratory worker,"" he said. ""That's not implying any intentionality.""

Redfield noted, “It's my opinion, right? But I am a virologist. I have spent my life in virology.""

Other so-called experts, including officials with the World Health Organization, have maintained that the virus actually is a mutation from a virus that infects animals and that it emerged from a wet market near the WIV. They've also claimed that it is ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus came from the Wuhan lab.

Redfield disagrees. He told CNN, ""I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human and at that moment in time, that the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human-to-human transmission.""

He added, ""I just don't think this makes biological sense.""

Though the U.S. government's line has been that the coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan in December 2019, Redfield told CNN that he believes the virus was making its way around Wuhan as early as September 2019.

Ex-CDC boss believes Covid-19 virus came from China lab www.youtube.com

What's this about death threats?



An exposé by Katherine Eban on the lab-leak theory published Thursday by Vanity Fair examined the ongoing debate about the source of the virus. In it, the outlet laid out Redfield's long-held suspicion of WIV's role in the pandemic.

According to Eban, Redfield offered to help China's own CDC director, Dr. George Fu Gao, immediately after receiving Gao's call on Jan. 3, 2020, about ""a mysterious new pneumonia, apparently limited to people exposed at a market in Wuhan.""

After seeing the data breakdown of the early cases from China, ""Redfield immediately thought of the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Eban reported.

He wanted to test WIV researchers for antibodies, Eban said, and he offered to help. But Chinese officials didn't take him up on his offer. Which, when coupled with his deep understanding of the ""yearslong battle over gain-of-function research"" at the lab, led the then-CDC chief to suspect WIV.

Redfield told Eban that following the CNN interview in which he finally made his thoughts on the lab-leak theory public, death threats ""flooded his inbox.""

And they came from more than just those who would accuse him of being racially insensitive: Redfield's fellow scientists were threatening his life and his livelihood.

According to Eban, the messages came ""from prominent scientists, some of whom used to be his friends.""

""I was threatened and ostracized because I proposed another hypothesis,"" he told Vanity Fair. ""I expected it from politicians. I didn't expect it from science.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cdc-chief-redfield-death-threats-lab-leak,2021-06-03
"Two months after Biden declares unmasking a 'great day in America,' CDC set to reverse some guidelines: Report","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reportedly set to backpedal Tuesday on its current masking guidelines and recommend that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas of the United States in which the COVID-19 pandemic is surging, according to report from the Associated Press.

A federal official speaking on the condition of anonymity spoke to the news outlet for its report.

The CDC is scheduled to hold a briefing at 3 p.m. ET Tuesday, CNN reported.

What's a brief history?

In May, the CDC said that fully vaccinated Americans could stop wearing masks altogether while outside and in the vast majority of indoor settings and added that the 6-foot social distancing guideline is no longer necessary for vaccinated Americans.

In the announcement, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said, “Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing. If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy.""

""Based on the continuing downward trajectory of cases, the scientific data on the performance of our vaccines, and our understanding of how the virus spreads, that moment has come for those who are fully vaccinated,"" Walensky said.

“This is an exciting and powerful moment, it could only happen because of the work of so many who made sure we have the rapid administration of three safe and effective vaccines,"" she added.



What are the details?

CNBC reported Tuesday that the CDC is ""expected to recommend that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in places with high COVID-19 transmission rates.""

""The updated guidance comes ahead of the fall, when the Delta variant is expected to cause another surge in new coronavirus cases and many large employers plan to bring workers back to the office,"" the outlet added.

CNN on Tuesday reported that a senior administration official said the decision was ""spurred by the more transmissible Delta variant.""

""It's based on the fact that the Delta variant is clearly more transmissible than the prior ones,"" the official told the outlet.

It seems fair to point out that CDC guidance is only a recommendation.

On Sunday, White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the COVID-19 situation was ""going in the wrong direction.""

""It's a dynamic situation,"" he said. ""It's a work in progress, it evolves like in so many other areas of the pandemic. You've got to look at the data.""

The outlet noted that some regions across the country — including areas in California and Nevada — are advising all residents, even those who are fully vaccinated, to wear masks while indoors.

Citing CDC data, CNN reported that approximately two-thirds of counties across the U.S. have ""high or substantial transmission"" of COVID-19. According to the data, 46% of U.S. counties have ""high transmission,"" and 17% have ""substantial transmission.""

CNN's Brian Stelter on Tuesday tweeted, ""Some folks on this site are overstating what the CDC intends to say today. Here is CNN's reporting: 'People in areas with high or substantial COVID-19 transmission should resume wearing masks, the CDC is expected to say.' Places with higher vax % tend to have lower transmission.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cdc-reversal-face-mask-guidelines,2021-07-27
Top CEOs threaten to cut off funding for Republicans backing Trump’s election challenge: report,"Several CEOs of major corporations are threatening to pull financial support from congressional Republicans backing President Donald Trump's election challenge, according to Yale School of Management's Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.

What are the details?

Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the prominent business school, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday that more than two dozen chief executives were considering the move as a way to express their frustration with Trump and his Republican allies' attempts to overturn the election.

The business leaders reportedly made the comments during a virtual conference hosted by Sonnenfeld earlier that day, in which 33 unnamed executives from a variety of sectors including finance, pharmacy, transportation, and manufacturing were present.

According to Sonnenfeld, every executive on the call answered ""yes"" to the survey question, ""Should CEOs warn lobbyists privately that their firms will no longer support election result deniers in Congress?"" Additionally, nearly nine in 10 said they were in favor of cutting off support.

""The GOP acting this way — these GOP members are certainly not the voice of American business, large or small. So they're talking about cutting off support,"" Sonnenfeld said.

New CEO survey on public officials denying election results youtu.be

He added the executives on the call, who reportedly joined on the condition of confidentiality, said the situation was causing ""divided communities, angry workforces, and hostile workplaces"" and that ""this is not business as usual.""

They reportedly expressed a desire to move beyond statements and start to ""put our money where our mouth is.""

What's the background?

President Trump has maintained for the better part of two months that the 2020 election was fraudulent, and his legal team has filed numerous legal challenges to the results in battleground states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona, but thus far to no avail.

But, in recent days, a new long-shot strategy has emerged as several Republican House and Senate members announced their intention to object when Congress moves to officially count Electoral College votes on Jan. 6 and demand a commission to audit the results. The challenge, however, is all but certain to fail.

Sonnenfeld said the potential of a chaotic transition is what gave rise to the last-minute the conference Tuesday. Given that fact, it might be fair to assume that the participating CEOs were not ones particularly supportive of Trump in the first place. But due to the call's confidentiality, only Sonnenfeld knows their identities.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ceos-threaten-funding-republicans-election,2021-01-06
Chauvin juror wore BLM shirt with George Floyd references last summer. Now legal experts say it is 'undeniably suggestive of a possible bias.',"New questions have surfaced about the impartiality of a juror who was empaneled for former police Officer Derek Chauvin's trial last month after a picture sparked speculation that he may not have been as unbiased as he told the judge.

What are the details?

During jury selection, Brandon Mitchell — a 31-year-old high school basketball coach who was known as Juror #52 before speaking publicly last week — told Judge Peter Cahill that he only heard ""basic info"" about the high-profile case, and was certainly not aware of any information that would hinder his ability to serve as an impartial juror.

However, Mitchell was pictured last August wearing a T-shirt that included references to George Floyd's death and Black Lives Matter.



The picture shows Mitchell wearing a shirt with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s picture surrounded by the words ""GET YOUR KNEE OFF OUR NECKS"" and ""BLM."" He is also seen wearing a Black Lives Matter baseball cap.

Image source: Facebook screenshot

Mitchell told the Minneapolis Star Tribune he does not remember wearing the shirt but explained the photo was taken during a trip to Washington, D.C., last August when he attended an event commemorating the anniversary of King's famous ""I Have A Dream"" speech.



""I'd never been to D.C.,"" Mitchell said. ""The opportunity to go to D.C., the opportunity to be around thousands and thousands of Black people; I just thought it was a good opportunity to be a part of something.""

""It was directly related to MLK's March on Washington from the '60s … The date of the March on Washington is the date … It was literally called the anniversary of the March on Washington,"" Mitchell explained.

More from the Star Tribune:

Media accounts of the event show it had several components, including: advocating for racial justice, increasing voter registration, pushing for a new version of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and urging participation in the 2020 census. The event also focused on police use-of-force. Floyd's brother and sister, Philonise and Bridgett Floyd, and family members of others who have been shot by police addressed the crowd. It served as a rallying point for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a federal police reform bill.

What does this mean for the Chauvin trial?

Despite Mitchell dismissing the Washington event as ""a national thing,"" legal experts agree the picture is problematic.

Jury consultant Alan Tuerkheimer told the Washington Post that Chauvin's attorney will no doubt use Mitchell to argue for an appeal. But the real question will be whether Mitchell provided false answers during jury selection, Tuerkheimer said.

As the Star-Tribune noted, Mitchell answered ""no"" to questions on the juror questionnaire that inquired whether he participated in demonstrations ""against police brutality"" in Minneapolis or whether he or anyone close to him ""participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality.""

""That could change the outcome of things; if there is anything that makes him seem that he was not forthcoming, it could be an avenue for the judge to reconsider the case,"" Tuerkheimer said.

Civil rights attorney Brian Dunn agreed the real concern is whether Mitchell ""lied about, or failed to provide complete answers on whether he has engaged in public activism, or whether he has any affiliations with BLM that go beyond the mere wearing of the shirt.""

""If it is determined that the juror did not provide full disclosure to the defense, the question then becomes whether this lack of candor violated Mr. Chauvin's right to a fair trial,"" Dunn told the Post, adding the photo is ""undeniably suggestive of a possible bias in this juror.""

""If [Mitchell] specifically was asked, 'Have you ever participated in a Black Lives Matter demonstration,' and he answered, 'No,' to that, I think that would be an important appealable issue,"" Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, similarly told the Star Tribune.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chauvin-juror-blm-george-floyd-shirt,2021-05-04
Leftist Chelsea Handler gets torched online over astoundingly ignorant tweet about Derek Chauvin trial,"Liberal comedian Chelsea Handler faced the mockery and ridicule of many on Twitter after an astoundingly ignorant tweet about the proceedings in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck.

Chauvin is facing charges of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter over his role in the death of Floyd, a black man, in late May. Chauvin has since been fired from his job as an officer with the Minneapolis, Minnesota, police department.

While the trial is under close scrutiny due to the racially sensitive nature of the charges, Handler decided to chime in with an observation that revealed her lack of knowledge about the U.S. justice system.

""So pathetic that there is a trial to prove that Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd when there is video of him doing so,"" tweeted Handler.



Critics pounced on the opportunity to fill in the clueless comedian about the right to a fair trial that has been a pillar of anglo-American jurisprudence for centuries.

""If there wasn't it would violate the constitution. And it would set precedent that the people could throw away trials and punish the innocent. Everyone gets a trial and gets their voice in the courtroom,"" responded one user helpfully.

""How stupid of them to give due process that's in the constitution. Smh. Bunch of damn communists. Yes, I think he's guilty but we have due process and the rule of law in this country!"" tweeted Josh Barnett, a Republican congressional candidate, sarcastically.

""Criticizing due process is a bold move for someone who claims to be in favor of criminal justice reform But hey, Chauvin was white AND a cop, so just hang him I guess,"" tweeted commentator Lauren Chen.

Many others pointed out that her suggestion was not only unconstitutional but very unwise as a policy for the justice system. Nevertheless, she persisted.

""Perhaps we skip trials when there is audio and video footage of the murder,"" Handler responded to one critic.

Handler has been blasted previously on social media many times, including once when she tweeted that the former first lady Melania Trump needed drugs to have sex with former President Donald Trump.

"Attacked by 6 robbers with weapons, Chicago train rider pulls knife, fights back. 3 suspects wounded, all 6 arrested, victim wounded also.","Six robbers with weapons attacked and tried to rob a Chicago train passenger early Friday morning, but the victim pulled a knife and fought back. In the end, three of the suspects were wounded and hospitalized, all six were arrested, but the victim was also wounded and hospitalized.

What are the details?

The 42-year-old victim got on a train at Addison Street on the North Side around 2 a.m. when three people tried to take his cellphone and began attacking him, police Supt. David Brown said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

During the struggle, the victim took out a small knife and stabbed one of his attackers in the back, the paper said.

At the North/Clybourn stop, the three robbers left the train as a fourth person entered it and began attacking the victim, Brown added to the Sun-Times, after which the victim stabbed that attacker in the neck, and the attacker stabbed the victim in the collarbone.

With that, six suspects began chasing the victim around the train platform and train cars, Brown said, according to the paper. In addition, two of the suspects hit the victim in the head with a glass bottle and other objects, Brown added, the Sun-Times said.

What happened next?

Three of the six robbers were hospitalized, the paper said: A 52-year-old man in serious condition with a stab wound to the neck; a 36-year-old man in fair condition with cuts to his arm; and a 24-year-old man with a stab wound to the back who was stabilized.

Charges were pending against all six arrested suspects, the paper added.

The victim was hospitalized in serious condition, police told the Sun-Times. He suffered stab wounds and cuts, Patch said.

In addition, a transit authority employee who wasn't involved in the altercation also was hospitalized for “stress,” the Sun-Times said.

"Far-left Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot granting interviews only to 'black or brown journalists,' local TV news reporters say","Far-left Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is granting one-on-one interviews only to ""black or brown journalists,"" a number of local TV news reporters said on social media Tuesday.

What are the details?

Mary Ann Ahern — a political reporter for NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV in Chicago — tweeted that Lightfoot's spokeswoman said the mayor ""is granting 1 on 1 interviews — only to Black or Brown journalists.""

Ahern also made reference to Lightfoot arriving at the ""midway point"" in her mayoral term, which Fox News said apparently signals that Ahern tried and failed to land an interview with Lightfoot.

Paris Schultz — ""Chicago Tonight"" co-anchor and political correspondent for WTTW-TV — reacted to Ahern's news regarding Lightfoot granting interviews only to reporters of color by tweeting that he ""was told the same thing.""

When George Cardenas, the city's 12th Ward alderman, piped in as well and remarked ""how is that even true, be serious,"" Ahern tweeted back saying indeed it's true, and Heather Cherone — Chicago politics reporter for WTTW — added that ""I can confirm, alderman.""

With that, Cardenas remarked, ""This should be corrected.""

Fox News said Lightfoot's office did not immediately respond to its request for comment.

How did other folks react?

As you might imagine, an outcry ensued on social media charging Lightfoot with racism and discrimination:

""Can you imagine if a white mayor did this???"" one commenter asked.

""That is only slightly racist!! But to be expected,"" another user said. ""She is judging people based on the color of their skin and not the content of their character. What a wonderful role model! NOT! She needs to be removed immediately.""

""So condoning the murders of the people of Chicago wasn't enough, now she admits she is racist,"" another commenter wrote. ""What's next? Will she admit she is a terrorist Hamas supporter, too? I guess being a failed politician wasn't enough.""

But not everyone agreed:

""So, she's doing what white majors [sic] have always done, but in reverse,"" one user observed. ""Where's the lie/problem?""

""Y'all know that white people can read those interviews, too, right?"" another commenter asked. ""I don't understand what the issue is.""

""Thank you Mayor Lightfoot,"" another user said. ""Black and Brown journalist[s] will not distort you[r] words. Our communities have been underrepresented too long. I applaud your efforts for bringing equity, fairness, and celebrating the rich culture in Chicago neighborhoods.""

Anything else?

Fox News noted that it's unclear when Lightfoot began limiting one-on-one interviews to journalists of color — and if the policy applies only to local reporters, given that MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle interviewed the mayor Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-minority-reporters-only,2021-05-19
"'Hold the line': Chicago police union head urges officers to defy Mayor Lightfoot's COVID vaccine mandate, threatens 50% fewer cops this weekend","The head of the Chicago police officers' union has called on its members not to comply with the city's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Chicago Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara warned that there could be half as many cops on the streets this weekend because of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

In late August, Mayor Lightfoot announced that all employees of the city of Chicago would be required to get vaccinated against coronavirus.

""As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, we must take every step necessary and at our disposal to keep everyone in our city safe and healthy,"" Lightfoot said in a statement. ""Getting vaccinated has been proven to be the best way to achieve that and make it possible to recover from this devastating pandemic. And so, we have decided to join other municipalities and government agencies across the nation, including the U.S. military, who are making this decision to protect the people who are keeping our cities and country moving. We have also been in close communication with our partners in the labor movement to create a vaccination policy that is workable, fair and effective.""



This week, Chicago officials included an option for city employees to submit to being tested twice a week at their own expense and on their time to bypass the vaccine mandate through the end of the year.

As of Oct. 15, any city employees who fail to get vaccinated or submit to semi-weekly testing or are not approved for a religious or medical exemption would be placed on no-pay status.

Lightfoot threatened, ""There will be consequences if people are not complying with what the policy is by the Oct. 15th deadline.""

Catanzara – the president of Lodge 7 of the Fraternal Order of Police – challenged Lightfoot's vaccine mandate and urged Chicago Police officers to defy the order. He said city officials have refused to ""bargain in good faith over this subject.""

""It is the city's clear attempt to force officers with a 'chicken little, the sky is falling,' into compliance – do not fall for it. Hold the line,"" Catanzara said.



Catanzara said lawyers for the FOP have already drafted a class-action grievance to cover ""everything under the sun"" that police officers could lose if they refuse to get vaccinated.

Catanzara said he would go into no-pay status on Friday in solidarity with his unvaccinated officers.

""It's safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up,"" Catanzara said. ""That is not because of the FOP. That is 100% because of the mayor's unwillingness to budge from her hard line.""

""I can guarantee you that no-pay status will not last more than 30 days,"" Catanzara added. ""There's no way they're going to be able to sustain a police department workforce at 50% capacity or less for more than seven days without something budging.""

Lightfoot responded to the head of the police union, ""John Cantazara says a lot of things, a lot of it offensive, and racist and foolish.""

The Democratic mayor of Chicago continued, ""It's unfortunate that the FOP leadership has chosen to put out a counternarrative, but the fact of the matter is that if you are not vaccinated, you are playing with your life, the life of your family, the life of your colleagues and the members of the public.""

""The only way we can make this work is we've got to hold people accountable, and we are absolutely prepared to do that,"" Lightfoot said.

41st Ward Alderman Anthony Napolitano said, ""I think the mayor has done her due diligence, as well, but we're asking that there be a repeal of this mandate.""

In May, the Washington Post reported that at least 4,000 active officers outof 12,413 are vaccinated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-police-lightfoot-vaccine-mandate,2021-10-14
Chicago Public Schools abolish sex-specific restrooms to usher in gender-neutral bathrooms to 'increase gender equity',"The Chicago Public Schools system will no longer have girls' and boys' bathrooms, but instead will have gender-neutral restrooms where all sexes are welcome.

The Chicago Public Schools system launched an initiative to abolish sex-specific bathrooms and transform them into restrooms where ""all who feel comfortable are welcome to use this restroom"" regardless of their gender.

CPS Title IX officer Camie Pratt introduced the sweeping new changes in a video posted on social media.

""On top of ensuring that each of our schools is a safe learning environment, we’re also taking steps to create more inclusive and supportive schools,"" Pratt says in the video. ""One change that will be implemented this school year relates to our school bathrooms.""



""In compliance with new federal guidelines, all CPS students and staff will have fair and equitable access to bathroom facilities that align with their gender identity,"" she continues.

""We will be providing all schools with updated signage that makes our bathrooms more inclusive,"" Pratt adds. ""It will identify the fixtures available in each restroom and make it clear that all restrooms are open for use by anyone who feels comfortable.""

Pratt explains the deadline to change to the new signage: ""This is an incredibly important step to increase gender equity for all, which is why we will be requiring all schools to post this signage by December 1 of this school year. Our district’s Office of Student Protections and Title IX is also working on a long-term plan to create more permanent signage for our bathrooms.""

Pratt notes that school teachers will continue to have ""Staff Only"" restrooms available.

Chicago Public Schools touted the new signs on its official Twitter account: ""We’re requiring all schools to adopt new signage to make our restrooms more inclusive. This is a big step forward for gender equity for our students and staff.""

The signs have descriptions such as:



""Gender Neutral Washroom""

""All Gender Restroom. This is a single-stall restroom. All gender identities and expressions are welcome here.""

""This is a gender-neutral restroom with multiple stalls. It is open to users of any gender identity or expression.""

""Men's +: This restroom has both urinals and stalls. All who feel comfortable are welcome to use this restroom.""

""Women's +: This restroom has stalls. All who feel comfortable are welcome to use this restroom.""

There have been issues with gender-neutral school restrooms in the past.

There was a 2019 report that female British students were avoiding drinking liquids and holding their bladders all day in an effort to avoid having to use gender-neutral bathrooms at some U.K. schools.

In 2020, a Wisconsin high school shut down its gender-neutral restroom after one of its students was arrested and accused of sexually assaulting a young victim inside.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-public-schools-gender-equity,2021-12-03
"Chicago teacher battling cancer shows up to school despite canceled classes, warns against people using teachers unions as a 'tool for political gain'","Chicago Public Schools have been canceled since Wednesday after 73% of the Chicago Teachers Union voted to return to remote work because of COVID-19 fears. However, the school district doesn't want teachers working remotely, so all classes have been canceled after the union was accused of staging an illegal walkout. Despite classes being canceled, teacher Joseph Ocol still showed up at his classroom on Wednesday willing to teach his students in person. Ocol is ready to teach in-person classes despite battling cancer.

""There were no students, and I was the only teacher there,"" Ocol told WBBM-TV. ""I miss my students. It’s just that this is a different situation, and I feel sad about this.""

Ocol – who teaches five classes in math and algebra – said he is ""not aware"" of any of his 82 students or any teachers he knows currently infected with COVID-19. He advocates for a school-to-school decision on closing based on COVID-19 cases.

""Of course, I agree that there has to be safety measures, but it should be done in a sweeping way – because there are schools that don't have COVID,"" Ocol said.

CPS Teacher Joseph Ocol Comes To School Despite Remote Learning Vote www.youtube.com

""I joined the Chicago public schools as a teacher first and foremost and I believe my role should be inside the classroom with my students,"" Ocol told host Tucker Carlson. ""I did not join CPS to be a union member.""



Ocol blasted anyone using the Chicago Teachers Union or students as political weapons.

""I believe that there are ways to fight City Hall,"" Ocol said. ""You don’t dangle the plight of the kids in the middle of the fight just to seek your demands.""



""There are other ways. I have nothing against the union,"" he continued. ""But I have something against people using the union as a tool for political gain.""

Ocol warned that remote learning is detrimental to both children and parents.

""I have done the remote learning for more than a year with the students,"" he explained. ""I have seen the limitations and the challenges that a teacher has with remote learning. It's not really effective.""



He noted that some students would simply ""log on and just not be there"" during remote learning sessions.

""I feel it’s not also fair to the parents,"" the teacher added. ""The parents need to be with the students when they should be earning a living.""

Ocol has been a Chicago Public Schools teacher for 17 years, as well as an after-school chess mentor.

""Police surveys [show] that the most dangerous time for a student to be outside a school building is from 3 to 6 p.m.,"" Ocol told Fox News Digital. ""So that's when I opted to start the chess program after school to keep kids inside the building. It's not just about winning games, although later on, the kids were winning medals and trophies, but it's more about saving lives. That was my goal then.""



Ocol's chess team at Earle STEM Academy won a national championship in 2016 and was invited to meet former President Obama.

""Despite my battling cancer, I still have a role to play right now,"" Ocol said during a Fox News appearance on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" ""I just want to make my life relevant somehow, the thought that I can still be of service to my students and I can touch their lives and make a difference in their lives.""

When asked about having cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ocol replied, ""I consider that another challenge in my life. I keep on praying that somehow I'll still be able to manage my life to be significant to my students. At all, you never know the time value of the moment until it's become a memory, and I want to become part of the memory of my students.""

""I learned about the end of life what really matters,"" Ocol said. ""Not what we vote [for], but what we do. Not what we got, but what we shared … More about our success with our significance in the lives of others. I want to live a life that matters. And that's very important for me.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-school-teacher-cancer-unions,2022-01-07
"Child sex trafficker and Clinton friend Ghislaine Maxwell now hosting etiquette classes in prison, touting 'high moral standards': Report","Ghislaine Maxwell, 61, has gone from grooming underage victims with the now-dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein to grooming female felons in prison.

According to the Daily Mail, the convicted child sex trafficker and pedophile, who used to hobnob with Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, is now hosting etiquette classes for fellow inmates.

What's the background?

Maxwell was arrested in July 2020 and found guilty of grooming and trafficking minors on Dec. 29, 2021.

U.S. Circuit Judge Alison Nathan sentenced Maxwell to 20 years in prison on June 28, noting she had sexually exploited and abused multiple underage girls with Epstein over the course of at least a decade.

In July, Maxwell was transferred to Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee, a ""low security federal correction institution,"" with over 820 male and female prisoners.

The New York Post noted that, unlike her previous prison experience in New York — where she was subject to solitary confinement most of the time — she now enjoys plenty of latitude in Florida.

In addition to getting to wear dresses, Maxwell is permitted weekly visits from adults or children and takes full advantage of the ""recreation, leisure and social programs"" on offer at the Tallahassee facility.

Etiquette tips from a child sex trafficker

With this relative freedom, Maxwell has begun teaching women how to conduct themselves, ""maintain high moral standards,"" and attain success like her former acquaintance Hillary Clinton.

Flyers reportedly spotted inside the prison indicate that Maxwell's course details ""the three principles of etiquette – focusing on respect, consideration and honesty.""

According to sources at the prison, the four-week program run by the pedophile also teaches felons how to talk, dress, and comport themselves in business settings, reported the Daily Mail.

Inmates who complete the course get 15 days taken off their sentences in accordance with the First Step Act.

An insider told the Daily Mail that the pedophile's etiquette course is ""less about balancing books on heads and being ladylike, and more about having confidence in yourself – how to behave and talk in a professional manner, the secrets of success in the corporate world, that sort of thing.""

It is unclear if the ""professional manner"" Maxwell is promoting to fellow inmates is the same with which she perpetrated, as U.S. attorney Damian Williams put it, ""heinous crimes against children.""



The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York made clear in June that Maxwell is practiced at coaching females to behave in a way that she and other pedophiles find acceptable.

""Victims were made to feel indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to help them,"" wrote the USO. ""MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse for a victim by discussing sexual topics.""

The pedophile is not only peddling purported principles of etiquette, but teaching a yoga class and picking out books for other female inmates in the prison library.



""Miss Maxwell's message is: So what if you're a woman and a convicted felon? You're not a second class citizen. She's an unlikely role model, but she's very passionate about this,"" added the prison insider.

The pedophile secures the rapist's lawyer

Although Maxwell apologized to her victims for the pain she subjected them to and expressed hope that her conviction would bring them closure, her spokesman maintains that the pedophile is innocent.

Page Six reported that the child sex trafficker recently hired the lawyer who represented rapist Harvey Weinstein in hopes of overturning her conviction. Attorney Arthur L. Aidala will soon file for appeal on her behalf.

Aidala claimed that Maxwell ""did not get a fair trial"" and added, ""[T]he judge ignored the many claims of malnourishment, living with vermin in her cell, lack of sleep, and overall deplorable conditions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/child-sex-trafficker-and-clinton-friend-ghislaine-maxwell-now-hosting-etiquette-classes-in-prison,2023-01-09
Chile roundly rejects woke constitution in national vote,"On September 4, Chileans had a referendum on whether to accept the leftist government's proposed new constitution: a 170-page document containing 388 articles, which would enshrine 100 rights including the right to: a ""nutritionally complete"" diet; ""leisure""; ""neurodiversity""; equality for ""sexual and gender diversities and dissidences, both in the public and private spheres""; housing; sex parity in all public institutions; and to free education.

Every single one of the nation's 16 regions voted ""no.""

In the mandatory vote, approximately 62% of Chile's 19 million residents rejected the constitution, which was written by a convention composed equally of men and women.

The proposed constitution would have greatly increased the size, scope, and power of the government.

The stability afforded to the nation by its senate would have been forgone, as the upper chamber of the legislature would have been replaced with a diminished ""Chamber of Regions.""

According to Javier Couso, professor at Diego Portales University, it would also have made the country a ""less business-friendly environment than what the Chilean entrepreneurs are used to."" The government could seize mines and other properties, but instead of paying the owners the market value, the government would only have to pay a ""fair price"" set by one of its judges.

Article 64 of the proposed constitution stated, ""Every person has the right to the free development and full recognition of their identity, in all its dimensions and manifestations, including sexual characteristics, gender identities and expressions, and sex-affective orientations."" Extra to conferring this right, the state would guarantee the exercise of ""identity"" through ""laws, affirmative actions and procedures.""

Also required by the document (under Article 6): Women must compose over 50% of all public institutions' members. While women could compose a supermajority in a given ministry or on a semi-public board, and men but a sliver minority, the reverse would be illegal.

A dual rejection: Boric's reckoning

The referendum result presents a major setback to Gabriel Boric, the country's 36-year-old president and leader of the leftist Social Convergence party, who had been a cheerleader for the constitution-rewriting process.

On July 4, Boric said ""Once more, it will be the people who have the final say on their destiny."" Since prior to this defeat, his approval rating was 38%, the destiny of Chile's president is now in question.

Mauricio Morales, a professor of political science at the Universidad de Talca, indicated this ""is a very significant political, ideological and strategic defeat for President Boric."" Morales suggested the rejection of the proposed constitution will ""inevitably fracture the governing coalition.""

After having the document he lobbied hard to advance fail by a 24-point margin, Boric said the results indicate that the Chilean people ""were not satisfied with the constitutional proposal that the convention presented to Chile.""

Boric suggested that the process to amend his government's substitute for Augusto Pinochet's 1980 constitution would continue in hopes of crafting a charter ""that unites us as a country.""

To the drawing board

The push to replace General Augusto Pinochet's 1980 constitution was largely a response to the student- and anarchist-led riots that kicked off in 2019, triggered in part by a rise in metro transit fares. Dozens of deaths were reported in the clashes between police and rioters. Millions subsequently took to the streets in Santiago, demanding political change.

In an October 2020 plebiscite, 78% of Chileans voted to change the country's constitution. Even Sebastián Piñera, who was the Chilean president at the time, suggested the inevitability of a constitutional overhaul, noting the vote's results signaled ""the beginning of a path that we must all walk together.""

In 2021, Chileans elected delegates to a constitutional convention. The resultant 155-member assembly was composed primarily of leftists (i.e. socialists, communists, and progressives) and independents.

One conservative delegate, Arturo Zúñiga, anticipated that the leftist skew would produce a result the nation would be unhappy with: ""The proposal is radical because it represents only one sector of the left, which is obviously not what our country wants.""

A spokesman for the Citizens' House for Rejection, Carlos Salinas, said after Sunday's vote: ""Today we're consolidating a great majority of Chileans who saw rejection as a path of hope.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chile-rejects-leftist-constitution,2022-09-05
"Chinese military engineered mice to test virus, covid origin","The Chinese military reportedly ""engineered mice with humanized lungs"" to test viruses on them in 2019, just months before the coronavirus pandemic erupted. The researchers with the Chinese military studied the humanized lungs to evaluate their ""susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2,"" according to the bombshell report from Vanity Fair, which investigated the origin of coronavirus.

Vanity Fair investigative reporter Katherine Eban released a ""months-long investigation"" into the origin of COVID-19. The investigation includes interviews with over 40 people, hundreds of pages of U.S. government documents, internal memos, meeting minutes, and email correspondence. Eban noted that she found ""conflicts of interest"" including large U.S. government grants ""supporting controversial virology research, known as 'gain-of-function.'"" Eban said the conflicts of interest ""hampered"" the investigation into the coronavirus origins by the United States government.

The report noted there were ""two main teams inside the U.S. government working to uncover the origins of COVID-19: one in the State Department and another under the direction of the National Security Council.""



""No one at the State Department had much interest in Wuhan's laboratories at the start of the pandemic, but they were gravely concerned with China's apparent cover-up of the outbreak's severity,"" Eban wrote. ""The government had shut down the Huanan market, ordered laboratory samples destroyed, claimed the right to review any scientific research about COVID-19 ahead of publication, and expelled a team of Wall Street Journal reporters.""

""You had Chinese [government] coercion and suppression,"" said David Feith of the State Department's East Asia bureau. ""We were very concerned that they were covering it up and whether the information coming to the World Health Organization was reliable.""

Thomas DiNanno, former acting assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, reportedly wrote an internal memo to his staff that State Department officials ""'warned' leaders within his bureau 'not to pursue an investigation into the origin of COVID-19' because it would 'open a can of worms' if it continued.'""

""As the group probed the lab-leak scenario, among other possibilities, its members were repeatedly advised not to open a 'Pandora's box,' said four former State Department officials,"" according to Vanity Fair. ""The admonitions 'smelled like a cover-up,' said DiNanno, ""and I wasn't going to be part of it.""

The Vanity Fair piece noted that Xi Jinping ""announced a plan to fast-track a new biosecurity law to tighten safety procedures throughout the country's laboratories"" on February 14, 2020, which was allegedly a ""surprise"" to the National Security Council.

The NSC zeroed in on one particular study first submitted in April 2020, in which ""11 of its 23 coauthors worked for the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, the Chinese army's medical research institute.""



The 11,000-word Vanity Fair exposé highlighted the study, which purportedly ""engineered mice with humanized lungs"" in 2019 to test viruses on them.

Using the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR, the researchers had engineered mice with humanized lungs, then studied their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. As the NSC officials worked backward from the date of publication to establish a timeline for the study, it became clear that the mice had been engineered sometime in the summer of 2019, before the pandemic even started. The NSC officials were left wondering: Had the Chinese military been running viruses through humanized mouse models, to see which might be infectious to humans?

NSC investigators reached out to other intelligence agencies about the curious research, but they were ""dismissed,"" according to Anthony Ruggiero, the NSC's senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense.

""In one State Department meeting, officials seeking to demand transparency from the Chinese government say they were explicitly told by colleagues not to explore the Wuhan Institute of Virology's gain-of-function research, because it would bring unwelcome attention to U.S. government funding of it,"" Eban wrote.

The article placed a spotlight on Shi Zhengli, the lead coronavirus researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who is known as ""Bat Woman."" Shi Zhengli allegedly received $665,000 from the National Institutes of Health between 2014 and 2019. ""Shi's own comments to a science journal, and grant information available on a Chinese government database, suggest that in the past three years her team has tested two novel but undisclosed bat coronaviruses on humanized mice, to gauge their infectiousness,"" Vanity Fair reported.

Shi has denied that COVID-19 emerged from the WIV lab or that the facility conducts military research.

Dr. Richard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, said there are only three laboratories in the entire world that have an ""extensive collection of bat viruses, doing some of the most aggressive research:"" Galveston, Texas; and Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told Vanity Fair that death threats ""flooded his inbox"" after he dared to say that he believed that the coronavirus pandemic originated from the Wuhan lab and did not evolve naturally.

In April 2020, then-President Donald Trump said he had seen classified information indicating that COVID-19 originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Vanity Fair article blamed former President Trump for presenting the lab leak theory, which Eban said ""poisoned the waters for anyone seeking an honest answer to the question of where COVID-19 came from,"" and was ""linked to destructive nativist posturing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-military-engineered-mice-covid-origin-wuhan,2021-06-04
'You sound like an idiot': Chris Cuomo throws down with Italian restaurant owner who posted sign mandating patrons be 'UNvaccinated',"CNN host Chris Cuomo looks to be in rare form this week.

He delivered a highly animated interview Monday trying to bait freshman Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida into a verbal fight, which failed to launch due to Donalds' calm, cool handling of the host's combative tone.

And Cuomo was back for more action Wednesday, going head to head with Tony Roman, owner of Italian restaurant Basilico's Pasta e Vino in Huntington Beach, California, who posted a front-door sign requiring that patrons provide ""proof of being UNvaccinated.""

The smaller print on the sign reads, ""We have zero tolerance for treasonous, anti-American stupidity.""

What happened?

Cuomo began the segment by introducing Roman and adding that the outspoken restauranteur also engaged in other headline-grabbing ventures such requiring patrons to go maskless inside his establishment — as well as putting up a billboard that played on a famous phrase from ""The Godfather"":

Image source: YouTube screenshot

As you can see, Cuomo was not thrilled.

""Of course, it has to be an Italian guy, and he's using 'The Godfather,'"" Cuomo says before appearing to get flustered and shaking his head before moving on.

It's important to point out that in 2019, Cuomo was infamously caught on video threatening to throw a man down a flight of stairs for daring to refer to him as ""Fredo,"" the weak brother in ""The Godfather"" — which likely gets under his skin since his older brother is New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

'Now I know you're Italian'

At that point the interview began, and Roman was shown on the right side of the screen inside his restaurant's lively kitchen. After Cuomo uttered the name of the restaurant, Roman replied, ""Man, you said the name perfectly ... good job. Now I know you're Italian.""

""That's 'cuz I speak the language,"" Cuomo replied. ""Lemme guess, you don't.""

And it was on.

""Tony, is this a little bit of a joke? Can you give me some hope that you really don't want people to not get vaccinated so they can come to your restaurant?"" Cuomo asked, adding a New York-ish accent on the end of his query.

""That's a good question. You're a smart guy,"" Roman replied.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

He added, ""It's an IQ test. And like I say to people when they ask me, if they're so blinded with their rage and their hate, I tell them, 'You know what, if you still don't understand it, maybe we should put up a sign ... that says you're too stupid to come into the restaurant.' I mean, it's very simple. ... I think you figured it out, am I right?""



For the record, a restaurant employee told the Los Angeles Times earlier this week that there's no way they can check if a patron hasn't been vaccinated, which tells you a lot about the intent of the sign.

The pair then begin questioning each other about their vaccination status, after which Roman tells Cuomo that he's ""failing the IQ test .... which I expected. What you're not getting is that this is not an anti-vaccine stand; it's a pro-freedom stand. That's what you're not getting.""

After Cuomo asserts the importance of ""the science"" in regard to COVID-19, Roman shoots back, ""So what's next then? Are we all gonna lock ourselves in our homes whenever there's a flu outbreak? Or there's an outbreak of the common cold? ... Wear a moonsuit? I mean, where does it end?""

Cuomo then claimed ""the only reason"" the spread of COVID-19 variants ""is happening is because people don't protect themselves, Tony. I mean, what are you thinkin'?""

'My ass it's been documented'

Roman replied by bringing up Cuomo's much-publicized bout with COVID-19: ""Then why did you leave your house when you had COVID? ... It's been documented.""

Then as the very old-school instrumental ""Theme from a Summer Place"" was audible from inside Basilico's Pasta e Vino, Cuomo got even more testy: ""First of all ... my ass it's been documented.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The host then briefly ran through his version of events before saying, ""I'm trying to help you, Tony.""



""You're tryin' to help me? I'm tryin' to help you,"" Roman responded before adding, ""Oh, you care about me all of a sudden, huh?""

Cuomo then told him, ""I don't like people making bad decisions for themselves and their family. I was hopin' it was a little bit of a stunt. You have the freedom not to take the vaccine. I just don't know why you don't think it's a good move.""

To which Roman responded, ""Maybe — maybe we should ask your brother about protecting people, right?"" As readers of TheBlaze know, Andrew Cuomo has been deeply criticized for his handling of the pandemic in New York state. And on Wednesday he announced that state employees will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or get tested weekly — and also urged businesses to admit only vaccinated patrons.

""Hey, look, that's his job,"" Chris Cuomo replied to Roman, ""and if he doesn't do it well, people won't vote for him.""

'I don't shy away from much'

As the pair continued to spar, Cuomo threw down: ""Look, Tony, I don't know if you know me too well; I don't shy away from much. I'm asking you about you.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

With that Roman shot back, ""You talk a lot"" and explained to Cuomo that he won't see signs for former President Donald Trump or political slogans at his restaurant and that his stances are not about science but about freedom.



""You're pro-freedom but people can't wear masks,"" Cuomo replied. ""Tony, it doesn't make sense. It really doesn't. I gave you a chance to make the case. I wish you well. I hope your family stays safe.""

""I made my case,"" Roman shot back. ""You didn't have much to say. You didn't have much to say.""

'You sound like an idiot'

Then Cuomo upped the ante: ""I mean, honestly, you sound like an idiot, so there's not much to say. Tony, good luck with it. See ya.""

""And so do you,"" Roman answered, after which Cuomo chirped, ""Yeah, only for having you on the show, that was my only mistake.""

After the interview, Cuomo spoke directly to his viewers: ""Look, it's just stupid. 'I'm pro-freedom' .. what the hell is he talkin' about? ... He doesn't want to know the science. This is my problem with the enablers of guys like this. I hate that he's Italian-American, by the way, 'cause it plays into a stereotype. ... The suggestion that somehow there is a strength in the resistance to the science, to the mandate, to 'being told': 'You don't tell me ... I'll do' ... it just doesn't make any sense. It is such a false sense of strength ... a stupid ethnic stereotype masculine moronic thing to be. You wanna talk about my brother, fine. Fine. I back away from nothing. ... but guys like this? I was hoping it was a stunt. It's not. The joke's on me, but I'll tell you what: Don't be like him.""

It's fair to point out that Cuomo, while criticizing ""ethnic"" machismo, was guilty of it more than once in his own segment. (""I don't know if you know me too well; I don't shy away from much"" and ""I back away from nothing."")

And let's not forget what Cuomo said in public after he was called ""Fredo"" just two years ago.

""Any of you Italian? It's a f***ing insult to your people. It's an insult to your f***ing people!"" he told his adversary before declaring, ""It's like the N-word for us.""

Cuomo also told the heckler, ""If you want to play then we'll f***ing play.""

"Judge sides with Biden, rules that Christian college must open women’s bedrooms and showers to biological males​","A federal judge this week rejected a Christian college's request to bypass new rules under the Biden administration that force religious schools to open their dormitories — including shared bedrooms and shower spaces — to members of the opposite sex.

Judge Roseann Ketchmark issued the ruling Wednesday denying the College of the Ozarks a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, which would have provided temporary protection for the school while its federal court case is pending.

The school filed a lawsuit in April arguing that the Biden administration was forcing religious schools to violate their beliefs by opening up female dormitories to biological males, and vice-versa, under subject of punitive damages, six-figure fines, and attorneys' fees.

After President Joe Biden issued an executive order titled, ""Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation"" in January, the Department of Housing and Urban Development put forward a directive in line with the administration's new interpretation of ""sex.""

The directive holds that entities covered by the Fair Housing Act cannot discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Meaning that a transgender person who is biologically male but identifies as a female must be permitted to share dormitory spaces such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and showers with female students.

""The government cannot and should not force schools to open girls' dorms to males based on its politically motivated and inappropriate redefinition of 'sex,'"" Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Julie Marie Blake said in a statement. The religious liberty law firm is representing the school in its legal fight.

""Women shouldn't be forced to share private spaces — including showers and dorm rooms — with males, and religious schools shouldn't be punished simply because of their beliefs about marriage and biological sex,"" she added. ""Government overreach by the Biden administration continues to victimize women, girls, and people of faith by gutting their legal protections, and it must be stopped.""

The College of the Ozarks is a private, Christian, liberal arts college in Point Lookout, Missouri, that since its founding more than a century ago has held to a belief that biological sex is assigned by God and is unchangeable.

In response to the ruling, the school's president, Jerry Davis, acknowledged he and staff were ""disappointed"" in the ruling, but announced that they would be appealing ""so that schools are not forced to open women's dorm rooms to males and violate their religious beliefs.""

""For more than 100 years, College of the Ozarks has provided a distinctly Christian education to students with financial need. We will not abandon our mission. The fight to protect our religious freedom has just begun,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-college-men-in-womens-showers,2021-05-21
"Christian NFL quarterback got blasted for poor play, even smeared as 'bad teammate.' But rookie QB lauds him as 'unbelievable human being' after quiet, 'classy' gift.","NFL quarterback Carson Wentz made a serious case as the Most Valuable Player during the Philadelphia Eagles' magical season five years ago.

But Wentz suffered a season-ending knee injury late that year — and then watched backup Nick Foles shock the sports world by leading the Eagles to a Super Bowl victory against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.

Things haven't been the same for Wentz since.

He endured further injuries, being benched, a trade to the Indianapolis Colts, and then just a season later, a trade to the Washington Commanders. In that time, Wentz has been ripped constantly for poor play — but far worse, he's been accused repeatedly of being a ""bad teammate,"" not only when he was with the Eagles but also during his stint with the Colts. One writer even accused Wentz of being the recipient of white privilege.

None of this can possibly sit well with Wentz, who's an outspoken and committed Christian. Unfortunately, things this season have been much the same: another injury, another benching, and then heaps of blame for the Commanders missing the playoffs.

But amid what may have been the lowest of low points this season, Wentz quietly did something that shows by many accounts that he's not only a good teammate but also that he possesses a ton of class.

'He's just an unbelievable human being'

Wentz watched from the sidelines as rookie quarterback Sam Howell made his first NFL start Sunday and promptly led the Commanders to a victory over the heavily favored Dallas Cowboys. According to Howell, Wentz gave him his suite at the Commanders' stadium so Howell's family could enjoy the game all the more:

""I know a lot of people have said some negative things about Carson, but he's just an unbelievable human being, and he's just awesome to be around, and for him to give me his suite for my first start means a lot,"" Howell said.

Here's what a few others had to say about Wentz's move:

""Regardless of how things ended up on the field, Carson Wentz was an excellent teammate,"" Commanders Wire tweeted.

""Classy Carson,"" MLFootball tweeted.

""Sam Howell’s family and friends were sitting in Carson Wentz’s suite at FedEx Field Sunday,"" another commenter said. ""Scorned and criticized by fans, Wentz rose above it to do a good thing for his teammate.""

""Never seen an NFL player navigate a gauntlet of injury, regime change, and disrespect the way [Wentz] has and still carry themselves with absolute class,"" another user observed.

""Carson Wentz is and has been nothing but class,"" another commenter noted.

""Even though things didn’t go well here for Wentz, I will always support him because of the class he showed,"" another user said.

Here's a post with some photographic evidence that takes a satirical shot at Wentz's critics. Content warning: Language

Middle Ages food and drink of Medieval Christmas feast,"The word ""Christmas"" was first recorded in 1038, and it comes from the word ""Cristes Maesse,"" meaning ""Christ's mass."" The church in Rome formally began celebrating Christmas on December 25 in A.D. 336.

The four Sundays leading up to Christmas is the season of Advent – a solemn time of prayer and fasting. While modern Christmas festivities last one day, celebrations lasted for 12 days during the Middle Ages. Christians in medieval Europe would hold elaborate festivities with sumptuous feasts and roisterous activities starting on Christmas and lasting until Epiphany on January 6 – where they commemorated the arrival of the Magi after the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem.

""In the Early Middle Ages, Christmas was not as popular as Epiphany on 6 January, the celebration of the visit from the three kings or wise men, the Magi, to the baby Jesus bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh,"" according to Historic UK. ""Indeed, Christmas was not originally seen as a time for fun and frolics but an opportunity for quiet prayer and reflection during a special mass. But by the High Middle Ages (1000-1300) Christmas had become the most prominent religious celebration in Europe, signaling the beginning of Christmastide, or the Twelve Days of Christmas as they are more commonly known today.""

Christmas feast with a boar's head

Boar's head was arguably the most coveted Christmas food – for those who could afford it.

""The boar's head was the heart of the medieval feast for England's elite,"" according to English Heritage. ""As a desired target of the great medieval hunt, the boar was considered difficult to catch and kill, and therefore worthy of esteem; indeed, boar in royal forests were protected by specific laws since at least the 12th century.""

The boar's head was so beloved during the holiday feast that there is a Christmas carol celebrating the swine aptly titled: ""Boar's Head Carol.""

The boar’s head in hand bring I,

Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary.

I pray you, my masters, be merry01

Quot estis in convivio02

Caput apri defero

Reddens laudes Domino03

2. The boar's head, as I understand,

Is the rarest dish in all this land,

Which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland

In honor of the King of Bliss;

Medieval Christmas menu

""For a Christmas dinner held at the Reading Abbey in 1226, King Henry III ordered 40 salmon, heaps of venison and boar meat, and 'as many lampreys as possible,'"" History.com noted. ""Henry V, who ruled in the early 1400s, included even more exotic delicacies on his Christmas menu like crayfish, eels and porpoise.""

On Dec. 25, 1406, Richard Mitford – Bishop of Salisbury – entertained 96 people who enjoyed a special carnivorous Christmas dinner of ""half a cow, three sheep, 24 rabbits, a pig, half a wild boar, seven piglets, two swans, two woodcocks, four mallard ducks, 20 snipes (long-beaked wading birds that bleat like goats), 10 capons (castrated cockerels), and three teal ducks.""



Other foods on the medieval Christmas menu include venison, pease pudding, mincemeat pies, and even peacock.

""During the Medieval ages, some wealthy Europeans dined on peacock at Christmas dinner. The colorful, plumed bird was often baked into a pie, or roasted with its head and tail still intact. Adding to the flamboyant display, the peacock’s feathers were reattached (or the skinned bird was placed back inside its intact skin), and its tail feathers were fully fanned out,"" Mental Floss reported. However, the meat was said to be ""tough and coarse.""



Christmas spirits for the Middle Ages

The 12-day celebration not only had food but also drink. The wealthy enjoyed wine while everyone indulged in ale.

A popular Christmastime adult beverage was a spiced wine called ""hippocras.""

""One thing that comes out very clearly is that drinking was as important as eating, if not more so,"" Anne Lawrence-Mathers – a historian at the University of Reading in the U.K., where she specializes in medieval England – told History.com, which added, ""In just one year, Henry III ordered 60 tons of wine for Reading Abbey with one ton being equal to 1,272 bottles.""



English Heritage noted, ""In 1296, 2½ sesters of wine were consumed on Christmas day at Goodrich Castle: this amounts to between 84 and 120 modern wine bottles.""

The outlet added, ""For most festive revelers, however, including those outside the privileged occupiers of high tables in the kingdom’s castles, abbeys, great houses and manorial centers, the choice of beverage was limited to ale, and from about the 16th century, beer.""

Christmas revelers would go wassailing – a tradition of drinking a spiced mead or hot mulled apple cider drink from a giant bowl and go door-to-door singing carols.

""At Christmastime, the poor expected privileges denied them at other times, including the right to enter the homes of the wealthy, who feasted them from the best of their provisions,"" Robert Doares – an instructor at Colonial Williamsburg – told Mental Floss. ""The poor would either ask to sip from their rich neighbor’s wassailing bowl or would bring their own bowl, asking for it to be filled. According to Doares, “At these gatherings, the bands of roving wassailers often performed songs for the master while drinking his beer, toasting him, his family, his livestock, wishing continued health and wealth.""

There is a Christmas carol ""Here We Come a-Wassailing,"" which gives insight into the tradition.

Here we come a-wassailing

Among the leaves so green;

Here we come a-wand’ring

So fair to be seen.

Chorus:

Love and joy come to you,

And to you your wassail too;

And God bless you and send you

A Happy New Year

And God send you a Happy New Year.

Our wassail cup is made

Of the rosemary tree,

And so is your beer

Of the best barley.

(Chorus)

We are not daily beggars

That beg from door to door;

But we are neighbours' children,

Whom you have seen before.

(Chorus)

Good master and good mistress,

While you're sitting by the fire,

Pray think of us poor children

Who are wandering in the mire.

(Chorus)



We have a little purse

Made of ratching leather skin;

We want some of your small change

To line it well within.

(Chorus)

Call up the butler of this house,

Put on his golden ring.

Let him bring us up a glass of beer,

And better we shall sing.

(Chorus)

Bring us out a table

And spread it with a cloth;

Bring us out a mouldy cheese,

And some of your Christmas loaf.

(Chorus)

God bless the master of this house

Likewise the mistress too,

And all the little children

That round the table go

(Chorus)

And all your kin and kinsfolk,

That dwell both far and near;

We wish you a Merry Christmas

And a Happy New year

(Chorus)",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christmas-middle-ages-food-drink-feast,2021-12-25
VIDEO: Chuck Schumer falsely claims all Americans who wanted to leave Afghanistan have already left,"Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) falsely claimed that all Americans who wanted to leave Afghanistan have already left the Taliban-controlled nation.

Schumer made the claims while he spoke to a WSYR-TV reporter at the New York State Fair on Tuesday.

""At the moment actually, I'm still focused on trying to get some of those brave Afghans out,"" said Schumer.

""The Americans, all of whom wanted to come out, have come out, praise God,"" he claimed.

""But there are a lot of Afghans who have risked their lives for our soldiers and others,"" he continued. ""Many got out, some didn't, and I'm still working on trying to get some of them out.""

Schumer's claim directly contradicts the State Department who has said that they estimated between 100 and 200 Americans who wanted to leave Afghanistan are still in the country.

A spokesperson for Schumer told Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post that he had misspoke.

""He misspoke and regrets the confusion his comments have caused,"" said the spokesperson.

""He intended to say, as he has been saying, that the U.S. will get everyone out that wants to get out,"" they added. ""And he will keep working with the Biden Administration to help everyone who wants to get out.""

More than a hundred Americans are reportedly waiting at an airport in Mazar-i-Sharif while the State Department negotiates their release with the Taliban. Several planes chartered through the efforts of a charity organized by BlazeTV founder Glenn Beck are awaiting the outcome of negotiations to fly those Americans and other Afghans out of the nation.

Only four Americans, a mother and her three children, have been confirmed to have used the overland route to escape Afghanistan. On Monday, one of the organizers of that mission accused the State Department of trying to take the credit for the rescue that rightfully belongs to

"Top Senate Dem says raising taxes, undoing Trump tax cuts is the 'only way to get rid of inflation'","Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) claimed Tuesday the only solution to record-high inflation is raising taxes.

What are the details?

During a press conference, a reporter asked Schumer whether Democrats plan to use the budget reconciliation process to pass legislation (without Republican support) to address the ongoing economic crisis.

""Reconciliation is very, very important,"" Schumer responded. ""If you want to get rid of inflation, the only way to do it is to undo a lot of the Trump tax cuts and raise rates.

""No Republican is ever going to do that. So the only way to get rid of inflation is through reconciliation,"" he added.

Majority Leader Schumer, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Cantwell Speak youtu.be

Earlier in the day, Schumer met with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to discuss combatting inflation, which has remained at record levels for months. After the meeting, Manchin signaled support for using reconciliation to pass legislation aimed at tamping down the economic problems.

""Reconciliation to me is about getting inflation under control, paying down this debt, getting a handle on what’s going on,"" Manchin said after the meeting.

In fact, Manchin supports changing the tax code to achieve those ends. According to The Hill, Manchin voiced support for increasing the corporate tax rate to 25% from 21%, increasing the capital gains tax (which is currently capped at 20%) to 28%, and removing ""loopholes"" from the tax code to ensure that ""everyone pays their fair share.""

If Democrats prepare legislation to raise taxes, Manchin stipulated that half of the revenue raised must go toward deficit reduction because that is the ""only way you’re going to fight inflation.""

The moderate Democrat also clarified that current negotiations are completely unrelated to President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan, which Manchin killed last year.

""There’s nothing formal. There’s no false hopes here. There’s nothing. As far as Build Back Better, there’s no talk about any of that. Just saying, how do we get a handle on inflation?"" he said.

What about the 'Trump tax cuts'?

Data from the Internal Revenue Service shows the tax reform bill passed by Republicans in late 2017 has, in fact, greatly benefited middle-class Americans.

""The available evidence is clear: Based on tax data from 2017 and 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced taxes for the vast majority of filers, led to substantial improvements in upward economic mobility, and disproportionately benefited working- and middle-class households, many of which experienced tax cuts topping 18 percent to 20 percent,"" analysis from the Heartland Institute explained.

Ironically, the San Francisco Federal Reserve has attributed the inflation crisis, in part, to Biden's COVID relief bill, which injected trillions of dollars into the economy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chuck-schumer-raising-taxes-inflation,2022-04-27
NBC anchor floats conspiracy that DeSantis flew migrants to Martha's Vineyard to cover for GOP senator: 'Convenient timing',"NBC News anchor Chuck Todd suggested Sunday that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) sent migrants to Martha's Vineyard last week to distract from abortion issues.

What is the background?

Last Tuesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a new bill that would institute a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks. The timing of Graham's announcement was controversial for two reasons.

First, Graham was criticized for taking attention away from August inflation numbers that showed inflation accelerated last month. Ironically, Graham's announcement came on the same day the Biden administration celebrated the Inflation Reduction Act, which clearly did not reduce inflation.

Second, Graham was criticized for drawing more attention to an issue that will galvanize Democratic voters and possibly hurt Republicans in tight elections. Many Republicans did not publicly endorse Graham's bill, not because they are pro-abortion, but because they agree with the Supreme Court that abortion is an issue that should be adjudicated by individual states.

What did Todd say?

While discussing the border crisis on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and absolving the Biden administration of negligence, Todd highlighted what he believes could be ""convenient"" timing between Graham's announcement and DeSantis' migrant flights.

""There's a timing question I have,"" Todd said. ""Lindsey Graham comes out with his 15-week abortion ban, and all of a sudden, the next day Ron DeSantis gets that off the front page. I'm not saying they're connected, but boy, it seemed [like] convenient timing.""

When panelist Al Cardenas knocked the Biden administration for neglecting the issue, Todd turned to New York Times reporter Peter Baker to double down on his suggestion.

""I've gotten a few people wondering if we're just getting played by DeSantis. He's pulling a Trump on us, right?"" Todd said. ""But boy, he changed the subject and we all went to it.""

Baker agreed that DeSantis succeeded in bringing spotlight to the issue — but called his point a ""rational one.""



""The point that he's making is, you know, a rational one to talk about: What level of responsibility do states that are not at the border have to help out? Fair enough,"" Baker said, noting the strategy has worked for Republicans in the past.

Meet The Press Full Broadcast - Sept. 18 youtu.be

Unfortunately for Todd, Republican governors have not hidden the reason for transporting migrants to Democrat-run cities.

Not only are they sending willing migrants to ""sanctuary"" cities and towns to bring attention to the border crisis and the Biden administration's lack of response, but they strategically choose locations where Democrats will expose themselves as hypocrites.

Martha's Vineyard, for instance, shipped off the migrants the day after they arrived, while Chicago sent migrants to neighboring suburbs, and Washington, D.C., lawmakers decry a ""state of emergency"" over the flood of migrants, which they claim has transformed the nation's capital into a ""border town.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chuck-todd-desantis-migrants-graham-abortion,2022-09-19
Clarence Thomas delivers knockout punch when hearing pro-affirmative action claim: 'I've heard similar arguments in favor of segregation',"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said Monday that pro-affirmative action arguments being made before the court reminded him of pro-segregation arguments.

What is the background?

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina on Monday.

The significance of the cases cannot be overstated. First, the court will decide whether race can play a role in college admissions, which is currently legal and is known as ""affirmative action.""

Second, the court will determine ""whether Harvard College is violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by penalizing Asian American applicants, engaging in racial balancing, overemphasizing race and rejecting workable race-neutral alternatives,"" according to SCOTUSBlog, and whether ""a university can reject a race-neutral alternative because it would change the composition of the student body, without proving that the alternative would cause a dramatic sacrifice in academic quality or the educational benefits of overall student-body diversity.""

What did Thomas say?

During oral arguments, Thomas asked North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park for a definition of ""diversity"" and to explain the ""educational benefits"" of diversity.

""Mr. Park, I've heard the word 'diversity' quite a few times, and I don't have a clue what it means,"" Thomas noted. ""It seems to mean everything for everyone.

""I'd like you to give us a specific definition of diversity,"" he asked.

Park, however, could not provide a specific definition of ""diversity.""

""First, we define diversity the way this court has in this court's precedents, which means a broadly diverse set of criteria that extends to all different backgrounds and perspectives and not solely limited to race,"" he responded.

Regarding the educational benefits of diversity, Park claimed there is no dispute whether diversity is beneficial in education. When pushed further, he pointed to studies about stock trading that claim ""racially diverse groups of people making trading decisions perform at a higher level.""

""The mechanism there is that it reduces groupthink and people have longer and more sustained disagreement, and that leads to a more efficient outcome,"" Park claimed.



Thomas fired back, ""Well, I guess I don’t put much stock in that, because I’ve heard similar arguments in favor of segregation too.""





Thomas' objection to affirmative action is well known.

In a previous case — Grutter v. Bollinger, the case that could be overturned — Thomas explained how the racial considerations innate in affirmative action are dehumanizing.

""The Constitution abhors classifications based on race not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all,"" he wrote in an opinion.



In another affirmative action case, Fisher v. University of Texas, Thomas explicated his comparison to arguments for segregation.

""It is irrelevant under the Fourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed schools produce better leaders,"" he wrote.

""Indeed, no court today would accept the suggestion that segregation is permissible because historically black colleges produced Booker T. Washington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., and other prominent leaders,"" he explained. ""Likewise, the University’s racial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that it will produce better leaders.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/clarence-thomas-affirmative-action-segregation,2022-11-01
"Climate extremists admit failure, will now make working-class lives harder by other means","The climate extremist group Extinction Rebellion has resolved to quit being such a nuisance in the new year. In a statement issued on Jan. 1, ER, a predominantly British group, vowed to ""temporarily shift away from public disruption as a primary tactic.""

In a move that some have suggested indicates a modicum of self-awareness, ER has suggested it will instead seek to ""prioritise attendance"" and foster better ""relationships"" rather than making commuters lives' miserable, blocking thoroughfares, defacing private property, and attacking beloved works of art.



While ER may have caught onto the fact that there is little love lost for it or its cause, in its announcement was a concession pointing to a greater reason for its about-face: ""Very little has changed"" despite all of its public conniption fits and challenges to fellow citizens' mobility.

Leftists find another job they cannot see through

Extinction Rebellion is an allegedly decentralized group of radical leftists keen on ridding Western nations of affordable energy.



ER underscores that ""we must be radical in our response to this crisis"" — a supposed radicality embraced by the Biden administration and other Western governments as well as by companies publicly listed on Wall Street which are similarly committed to environmental, social, and governance frameworks.

While its proponents denounce the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, a stable electrical grid is not the only object of its disdain.

Although admittedly a failure, ER seeks to ignite a popular political movement and thereby develop an eudaemonistic economy, prioritizing happiness over efficiency and functionality.

According to its website, ER's so-called rebellion, which usually involves acts of iconoclasm or road blockades, is against the ""patriarchy's domination and control of women and the Earth, against heterosexism that condemns the beauty of diverse love, against the militarism that destroys living lands, wages war for oil and kills those who protect the green life.""

Extra to the patriarchy, normalcy, and national defense, ER also holds Europe and the West in contempt, claiming ""reparation is needed,"" since ""Europe stole its wealth through its imperialism, colonialism and slavery.""

The group first assembled in the United Kingdom in October 2018 and has since infected other countries.

According to ER's New Year's resolution, instead of staging public tantrums designed to immobilize the unconverted, it will instead ""disrupt the abuse of power and imbalance, to bring about a transition to a fair society that works together to end the fossil fuel era.""

The Independent indicated that public opinion of ER has been unfavorable, particularly because the group has disrupted the lives of the general public rather than elites and politicians.

Spiked, too, reported that ER has ""alienated the public from its cause.""

Members of this extremist group — who sometimes overlap with those in the climate alarmist group Just Stop Oil — shut down a London meat market in 2019, prompting Spiked to brand them ""time-rich, well-connected green activists sneering at working people and preventing them from doing their jobs.""

Extremists from this group tried to lock down London traffic by blocking the Lambeth and Vauxhall Bridges and clogging major arteries across the city in April 2022.

In 2019, the extremists went so far as to block at least one injured individual from getting to a hospital.

ER extremists also adversely impacted electric transit in London, targeting in one incident the city's Docklands Light Railway network. Working-class citizens denounced the extremists, noting that the trains were electric-powered:

Time will tell whether ER can restore its public image. Even if it does so, its aims may still be ruinous.

Lauren Smith, writing for Spiked, suggested that it is the ""policies these people are advocating – not their tactics – that pose the biggest threat to our lives and livelihoods. After all, [ER] is committed to ending the 'fossil-fuel era' by 2025, which would prevent many more journeys and have a much more damaging impact on the economy than a handful of road-blocking activists ever could.""

Whereas ER will try applying political pressure as opposed to engaging in public intimidation, the Guardian reported that Just Stop Oil, funded in part by an ultra-rich oil heiress and other coastal American elites, has made no such commitment.

In fact, Just Stop Oil issued a statement, saying, ""It's 2023 and [ER] has quit. ... But it's 2023, and we are barrelling down the highway to the loss of ordered civil society, as extreme weather impacts tens of millions, as our country becomes unrecognisable … there is now a need to face reality.""

""We must move from disobedience into civil resistance – this is what the nurses and paramedics are doing. They are on the frontline of the harm being wreaked on us and have said no more,"" the statement continued, intimating more kinetic forms of extremism than attacks on property, citizens' mobility, and beloved works of art.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-extremists-admit-failure-will-now-make-working-class-lives-harder-by-other-means,2023-01-03
CNN anchors left cackling after conservative analyst mocks AOC's bizarre accusations about her GOP critics,"Conservative political commentator Mary Katharine Ham caused two CNN hosts to belly-laugh Monday after mocking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

What is the background?

Ocasio-Cortez incited backlash over the New Year's holiday after she accused her Republican critics of being ""creepy weirdos"" who have ""deranged sexual frustrations"" because they ""are mad they can't date me.""

""If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Ya creepy weirdos.""

""It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general,"" she added. ""These people clearly need therapy, won’t do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. It’s really weird.""

The New York Democrat issued the strange accusations after she was sharply criticized for traveling to Florida over the holiday. None of her critics indicated they sought to date Ocasio-Cortez, which compounded the bizarre nature of her reaction.

What happened on CNN?

Network anchors Brianna Keilar and John Berman could not hold back their laughter when Ham reacted to Ocasio-Cortez's bizarre accusations by mocking her.

""First of all, I woke up like this. So I have authority on people being sexually frustrated by my mere existence,” Ham began.

""I’m glad to be able to discuss this important issue with you. The plight of the super-hot in America has long been ignored. AOC has started a national conversation about this,"" she continued. ""You know, I know we have all dealt with it — and by that I mean AOC, and you, Brianna, and myself and John — you know, we can start an organization or something.""

""One day you wake up and you think to yourself, is there more to life than being really, really ridiculously good-looking? You know? I did it. And now I’m here. AOC did it, and now she’s a congresswoman. And in that capacity, you have to answer questions.""

After mocking Ocasio-Cortez, Ham shifted to a more serious tone. She highlighted the absurdity of Ocasio-Cortez's comments because the criticism she received for vacationing in Florida was fair.

""I’m goofing on this because it’s goofy. But to question the motives of every questioner you come across, I don’t think behooves you,"" Ham said. ""She can answer the questions about being in Florida without going here.""

""By the way, I know because I’m talking about this, there are weirdos who will get weird in my comment section right now. ‘Hi, how is it going?' You can’t date me. This is the real plight of actually being a woman in the public eye. And there is some of that out there,"" Ham explained.

""But we also have to answer fair questions,"" she continued. ""And a fair question to AOC is, ‘Hey, is your trip with your partner to Florida dangerous to yourself and others? And if not, why not?’ Because if it's not, it suggests that people can use their personal freedom to make decisions about their risk profiles and go forward in the world of COVID.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-anchors-left-cackling-after-conservative-analyst-mocks-aoc-s-bizarre-accusations-about-sexually-frustrated-critics,2022-01-04
CNN host minimizes Biden insulting Fox News reporter — but had different reaction when Trump did same thing,"After President Joe Biden caused an uproar by calling Fox News reporter Peter Doocy a ""stupid son of a bitch,"" CNN host Brian Stelter worked overtime to minimize the insulting incident.

What happened?

As reporters were being ushered out of the East Room at the White House following a brief appearance by Biden, Doocy asked the president whether he believes inflation and growing economic woes are a political liability in the 2022 midterm elections.

With his microphone still hot, Biden mockingly said, ""No, it's a great asset — more inflation."" Biden then added, ""What a stupid son of a bitch.""

How did Stelter react?

CNN media reporter Brian Stelter, also the host of ""Reliable Sources,"" mostly dismissed the incident as small and not worthy of news coverage.

In the Reliable Sources newsletter, Stelter went to great pains to emphasize that he does not believe the incident is worth widespread media coverage. True to character, Stelter also used the incident to swipe at Fox News.

Stelter wrote:

First, let's stipulate that this is not the most important thing that happened at the White House on Monday. Far from it. Second, let's recognize that the Twitter-type excitement over Biden's profane comment about Fox's Peter Doocy is a reflection of the fact that people feel like they rarely hear ""real"" and ""unscripted"" remarks from politicians. And third, let's acknowledge that Fox is milking this exchange for all its worth.

Stelter advanced the same argument on CNN Tuesday morning: The story is not that important and Fox News is going to talk about it ""as if it is the most important thing in the world."" To be fair, Stelter also admitted in the newsletter and on CNN that he thinks it was ""wrong"" for Biden to insult Doocy.

What happened when Trump was president?

While speaking at a rally in March 2018, Trump called NBC News anchor Chuck Todd a ""sleeping son of a bitch."" At the time, Stelter claimed that Trump's comments increased risk of danger for journalists.

""Calling a journalist a ‘son of a bitch?’ It was wrong when Trump was just a candidate, and it’s even worse now that he’s POTUS,"" Stelter posted in 2018. ""These jabs expose journalists to threats and intimidation.""

Stelter acknowledged late Monday his comments from nearly four years ago. He called both instances ""wrong."" However, now that Biden is president, Stelter urged that Biden's insult must be understood in its ""context"" — a charitable attitude that he did not extend to Trump. In fact, Stelter called it ""different"" altogether.

""Biden doesn't berate the media like Trump, so the context for today is different, but it's still out of line,"" Stelter wrote on Twitter.

Stelter also emphasized ""context"" in the Reliable Sources newsletter and described Biden's insult as ""sarcasm.""

""Context certainly matters, and the backdrop to Biden's sarcasm — after Doocy shouted 'do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?' — is very different than the destroy-the-media context of Trump's behavior,"" Stelter wrote in the newsletter.

One thus wonders why Stelter bends over backward to contextualize Biden's comments and extend him charity, but was seemingly unwilling to do the same for Trump. Perhaps the lack of consistency is why so few Americans trust the mainstream media.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-brian-stelter-minimizes-biden-doocy-insult-different-reaction-to-trump,2022-01-25
"CNN digs up random Princeton alumna, classmate of Justice Samuel Alito, so she can trash his opinion on TV","A CNN segment on Thursday featured a random college classmate of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who was interviewed because she organized a letter protesting his leaked draft opinion that would overturn the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade.

Appearing on CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday, Susan Squier, a member of the Princeton University graduating class of 1972, slammed Alito's draft opinion, saying it reads like ""a greatest hits of misogyny"" and that it reminded her of the Salem witch trials.

""When I read the document -- I read all 98 pages of it, and mind you, I'm trained as a scholar of literature and medicine, and I look at nuance. And when I saw that he had smuggled into the document the wording from the Mississippi Gestational Age Act, which, as I understand it -- now I'm not a lawyer -- but isn't even law yet. And he was referring to unborn children rather than fetuses. I was just stunned,"" Squier, a Penn State University professor, told host John Berman.

""I mean, I have read a lot of medical history going back for doing literature and medicine, and his is like a greatest hits of misogyny,"" she said.

""He doesn't consider the context. And this man was a historian at Princeton. He was a double major in history and Poli sci. But it is as if he doesn't believe history actually involves a record of things changing. Instead, it is history as, 'let's go back to the Salem witch trials.' It makes me so angry,"" she continued.

Alito's draft court majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was leaked to Politico last week, which set off a political nuclear bomb. In his draft, Alito writes, ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have inflamed debate and deepened division.""

Since the opinion was leaked, abortion rights advocates have sounded their fury, protesting outside the homes of the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices and demanding that Democrats act swiftly to codify Roe into federal law.



Squier and a handful of other women who were a part of Alito's graduating undergrad class in '72 joined the protesters with a letter published on May 9, in which they declared their shock and outrage over the conservative justice's draft majority opinion.

""As a pioneering class of Princeton women, we find it bitter indeed to see the draft Supreme Court opinion reverse the strides we thought we were making, as part of one of the first classes of Princeton women, towards a world of equity and fairness for women of all races and social and economic positions,"" the Princeton grads write.

The letter encourages others to protest, stating, ""We ask our classmates, and the community of Princeton, to protest the logic that ties us to a constitutional originalism which resists any movement toward justice but, rather, moves us backwards.""

Squier told CNN that the decision to put the letter together happened very quickly.

""It is not that we're doing this because we hope it will change things. I don't know. Wouldn't that be lovely? I don't know, maybe. I'm not that naïve, but there is a time when you just have to speak out,"" she said. ""And those of us who went to Princeton have a privilege of having gone there, we can get listened to. So, we have to speak for the women who cannot get listened to, the women who are going to be massively impacted -- I hate that word -- by this horrible new decision.""

"CNN's Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo actually defend officer who fatally shot teen girl who swung knife at other females","CNN's Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night appeared to defend the officer who fatally shot a teenage girl caught on police bodycam video swinging a knife at other females during a fight in front of a Columbus, Ohio, residence the previous day.

What did Lemon and Cuomo have to say?



TheBlaze regularly takes to task Lemon and Cuomo for radical, leftist commentary they add to the news, but in this instance the pair delivered fair-minded, sober perspectives on the tragic incident, which took place just before the verdict was read in the Derek Chauvin murder trial.

As Cuomo was signing off his program and passing the baton to Lemon, the pair began talking about the shooting. Lemon noted there was a ""lot of emotion"" and ""lot of anguish"" about it, but he pivoted and said, ""We've got to be fair about what happens when police arrive at scenes.""

He explained that despite the fact that the victim was an adolescent, ""when police are chasing people, they don't know how old they are.""

""When they roll up on a scene, they see people tussling around, someone has a knife, and their job is to protect and serve every life on that scene,"" Lemon continued. ""And if they see someone who is in the process of taking a life ... what decision do they have to make?""

They both also countered arguments many have made asserting that the officer could have used a Taser instead of a gun in that situation.

""Tasers don't work the way guns work,"" Lemon offered.

""Not at that distance,"" Cuomo noted in agreement. ""And not with that amount of time.""

Lemon reminded viewers that Tasters ""don't always connect"" — the prongs have to grab the skin correctly in order for the electrical charge to effectively disable a suspect.

'That's why I'm not a police officer'

Then Lemon invoked the female who nearly became a victim: ""If the woman in the pink was my sister, niece, wife, whatever … you have to make a decision. Is one life on that scene more valuable than another? And if someone is trying to take a life on that scene, do you protect the life of the person trying to take the life, or do you protect the life of the person whose life is in imminent danger at that point? That's why I'm not a police officer.""

He also observed that ""at a certain distance, a stabbing, a knife can be much more lethal than a bullet. And especially if you get stabbed in the artery, in the temple, somewhere that you're gonna bleed out.""

Cuomo said, ""I feel for that officer. You can hear it in his voice when ... the man on the side was saying, 'You shot my baby! You shot my baby!' And [the officer] said, 'She had a knife, she went right at her.' You know this is something that he's gonna have to live with also.""

Lemon added, ""Either way in that position, I think that someone's life probably would have ended. It could have been the other woman in the pink, or it could've been the 16-year-old who sadly ended up dying.""

Cuomo said he had spoken to ""an older woman of color"" about the shooting and that a man told the officer, ""You shot my baby"" — and the woman told Cuomo, ""Shame on him!""

'Where were the parents? What were they doing?'

When Cuomo questioned why the woman had that reaction, he said she told him, ""He came running out of that house; why didn't he stop it? Where were the parents? What were they doing? .. why did the police have to come and control that situation? Why didn't he?""

Cuomo also observed that the man who ran out of the house is seen on bodycam video trying to kick a female in the head: ""He's an active part of the fight; the adults have to be adults, too.""

He also said that, in the end, the officer has a ""duty to use force to protect his own life or the life of another.""

Don Lemon And Chris Cuomo Defend The Officer Who Shot Ma'Khia Bryant youtu.be

Anything else?

Lemon and Cuomo stand out from others on the left who remain upset about the shooting, despite the fact that it's clearly visible that the teen girl was swinging a knife.

Such as NBA superstar LeBron James, who posted a tweet to his 50 million followers threatening the Columbus police officer who pulled the trigger, posting an image allegedly of the officer and adding the text, ""YOU'RE NEXT.""

In addition, numerous media outlets even tried to hide the fact that the teen was swinging a knife when she was shot, outrageously jumping at the chance to refer to her as ""unarmed.""

And as for those who just want to defund police and keep them away from all those commonplace knife fights between kids, the day before the Columbus incident a 13-year-old girl reportedly stabbed another 13-year-old to death in Cincinnati — and cops were nowhere in sight.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-don-lemon-chris-cuomo-defend-officer,2021-04-22
"CNN host left visually shocked when guest bucks narrative on Jen Psaki's insult of Peter Doocy: 'Hmm, right'","CNN host Brian Stelter was seemingly left surprised on Sunday after a guest on ""Reliable Sources"" bucked his narrative on White House press secretary Jen Psaki's alleged insult of reporter Peter Doocy.

What is the background?

In January, President Joe Biden was caught on a hot mic calling Doocy, a White House correspondent for Fox News, a ""stupid son of a b****.""

During an interview on the left-wing podcast ""Pod Save America"" last week, Psaki was asked whether she agrees with Biden's insult.



""He works for a network that provides people with questions that, nothing personal to any individual including Peter Doocy, but might make anyone sound like a stupid son of a b****,"" Psaki responded, adding that she appreciated how Doocy handled Biden's insult with ""grace.""

What happened on CNN?

Whereas Stelter defended Psaki, Lynn Sweet, Washington bureau chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, condemned Psaki for being unprofessional.

""She got lulled into losing her discipline. This podcast is made by her friends. They go back to the Kerry campaign. They worked in the Obama White House,"" Sweet said.

""She was forgetting what her real job is, which is to communicate on behalf of the president. OK? She even repeated some of the swear words that the questioner asked in the question, upping the ante,"" she added



After commending Psaki for acknowledging Doocy's ""grace,"" Sweet said, ""One other quick thing: It’s not a negative to consult your colleagues on what question to ask.""



Stelter responded to Sweet's remarks with a puzzled look, only uttering, ""Hmm, right,"" before moving on.

Last Friday, Stelter defended Psaki and suggested that Doocy is a puppet for Fox News, the exact point that Sweet chided last.

""I think the point she's trying to say there is that Fox pushes storylines that are sometimes nonsense. Doocy does that in the briefing room,"" Stelter said.

""I think Jen Psaki’s like — remember in senior year, spring of your senior year, you're about to graduate and you're just tired of all this? I think we're seeing that from Jen Psaki,"" Stelter went on to say. ""She's about to leave the White house. She's going to go to a job likely at MSNBC, so she’s kind of relaxing and maybe sharing how she really feels.

""But, to be fair, she didn’t really criticize [Doocy] directly,"" Stelter excused. ""She was really criticizing Fox News as an organization.""

"CNN hosts scramble to cover for DC mayor's blatant mask hypocrisy, claim she wasn't actually violating her own mask rules","Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser had quite a weekend of partying and merry-making as the people under her control were forced to step backward into COVID-19 rules they mistakenly believed were history.

First, Bowser declared that she would be re-imposing an indoor mask mandate upon the vaccinated citizens of the nation's capital first thing Saturday morning — which conveniently was scheduled to start hours after a long-planned Friday night birthday bash for the mayor.

Then, Saturday evening — the day the mayor's mask mandate went into effect — the mayor officiated an outdoor wedding and then was caught celebrating at an indoor reception with hundreds of unmasked guests, as reported by Washington Examiner reporter Tiana Lowe.

The mayor denied being in violation of the rules, her office said, claiming that the mayor did wear a mask indoors and was in full compliance with the mandate.

But apparently, for CNN's morning hosts, the mayor's defenses for her own behavior didn't go far enough — so they offered some of their own.

What's all this then?

During Monday's episode of CNN's ""New Day,"" show co-hosts John Berman and Brianna Keilar went out of their way to cover for Bowser.

""She wasn't actually, as far as we know, violating the new rules, correct?"" Berman asked Keilar.

Keilar responded, ""I think that that is fair say, but I think it might also be about, is she violating the spirit of it? I don't know.""

In an attempt to explain Bowser's clear misstep, Berman said, ""It's hard for me to remember what we're all supposed to be angry about, because it wasn't that long ago where we were criticizing politicians for wearing masks still where the science was telling them, oh, they didn't need to be.""

""We kept on asking the White House, 'Why is Joe Biden still wearing a mask when the mask guidance has changed?'"" he continued. ""And now, of course, we're saying, 'She should be wearing a mask even though she was following the guidance.'""

Berman added that he didn't know if she did something wrong ""functionally, policy-wise"" and noted that maybe she was eating or drinking — an excuse the mayor's office did not actually offer.

Keilar offer that maybe the mayor was maskless during the toast, which, again, was not an excuse the mayor or her office offered.

Anything else?



The Washingtonian, a D.C.-based outlet, attempted to undermine Lowe's reporting for the Examiner by pointing out that Lowe wasn't actually invited to the wedding or reception.

Interestingly, one CNN reporter, Kate Bennett, actually did attend the wedding in question as an invited guest. But so far, she has remained silent about the entire affair.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-hosts-cover-dc-mayor-bowser-unmasked,2021-08-03
"CNN medical expert calls for COVID restrictions to be lifted, but only for the vaccinated","Dr. Leana Wen is at it again, folks.

In a recent editorial published in the Washington Post, Dr. Leana Wen — CNN’s medical expert — called for lifting COVID-19 restrictions across the country as the Omicron variant’s presence begins to wane.

Dr. Wen acknowledged that many Americans are likely feeling fatigued with safety precautions that have faded in relevance, such as masking, social distancing, and self-isolating. Omicron was one of several variants that sent society into a tizzy, Wen acknowledges, and it likely won’t be the last now that COVID-19 is endemic.

The likely emergence of new variants that could very well be more lethal than Omicron is precisely why Dr. Wen encouraged relaxing COVID restrictions.

She said “new and possibly dangerous variants are likely to emerge. But it is precisely because of this future threat that we need to allow normalcy now.”

However, Dr. Wen, as indicated by the last word in her statement, isn’t calling for society to return to normal in perpetuity. She calls for COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted to give people a breather right before reimplementing them upon the premiere of the next variant.

Wen writes, “In areas where hospitalizations are declining, the rapid removal of restrictions with the understanding that they may need to come back if new threats emerge. Doing so could give weary Americans much-needed respite while also preserving public-health authority for when it’s needed again.”

She also calls for the local and federal government and businesses to implement rigorous vaccine requirements while allowing the vaccinated to forgo COVID-19 restrictions. Essentially, Dr. Wen is calling for those who received a COVID-19 vaccination not to be burdened by restrictions, while those who are unvaccinated must continue to deal with them.

Paradoxically, Dr. Wen writes, “Keep vaccine requirements and drop everything else. The vaccinated who have done everything right, should not have any restrictions placed on them; it’s not fair to them and it disincentivizes vaccination.”

What Dr. Wen is clearly advocating for is a tiered society in which those who are compliant with vaccination mandates are allowed to participate uninhibited while those who don’t receive the vaccine must continue to jump through hoops on a day-to-day basis.

Dr. Wen wants to force the American public to receive the vaccine. She calls for an end to masking for the vaccinated while hoping for a reality where the unvaccinated are shamed into vaccination due to the embarrassment of wearing a mask.

Wen’s warped wish list for reality comes as Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admit that a lot of the protocols implemented as COVID restrictions were products of social engineering; they wanted to see what people would tolerate.

That said, a new study from Johns Hopkins University revealed that COVID-19 lockdowns and preventive restrictions had little to no effect on reducing COVID’s mortality rate while “imposing numerous economic and social costs.”

The study states that these procedures are “ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.” But, considering that people like Dr. Wen are more concerned with cramming their worldview down the throats of the American people, rather than following the science, it is likely this research will not find its way into public policy anytime soon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-medical-expert-calls-for-covid-restrictions-to-be-lifted-but-only-on-the-vaccinated,2022-02-01
"CNN ratings tank, employees reportedly 'freaking out'","The major changes CNN has made in leadership, philosophy, and structure have not yet borne fruit in the ratings, and now CNN employees are reportedly beginning to panic.

A ""well-placed"" source at the network told the New York Post that “new management is not freaking out but everyone else at CNN is.”

The numbers are indeed cause for concern. In June, CNN primetime shows averaged just 654,000 nightly viewers, despite the allure of the Jan. 6 committee hearings, which the network covered at length. And of those 654,000, just 148,000 of them were in the coveted 25-54 age demographic.

The ratings for Brian Stelter's show ""Reliable Sources"" were particularly abysmal, drawing just 585,000 total viewers and 79,000 key demographic viewers. It was the lowest rating for the show in over 20 years.



As bad as Stelter's numbers have been, the numbers for other high-profile CNN personalities like Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper were far worse, as Stelter outperformed each prime time host in the second quarter. The CNN daily lineup likewise had a poor showing, losing 3% of its audience from May.

Still, executives at the parent company Warner Bros. Discovery remain optimistic. WBD CEO David Zaslav recently told Vanity Fair that he believes new CNN chairman and CEO Chris Licht ""is doing a great job pivoting CNN.""

“Journalism first,"" he continued. ""America needs a news network where everybody can come and be heard — Republicans, Democrats. I think you’re seeing more of that at CNN.""

Licht took over a network that appeared to be in crisis. The former CEO Jeff Zucker resigned unexpectedly back in February when it was discovered that he and a female executive had had an affair that began while both were still married, and the digital streaming service CNN+ lasted less than a month and drew only 10,000 subscribers.

Though the numbers for June may be discouraging for those employed at the network, Zaslav insisted that he and his team are looking at the big picture, not the ratings.

""I think [CNN's] the greatest news brand in the world with the greatest journalists. And we’re going to lean into that. We’re not going to look at the ratings and, in the long run, it’s going to be worth more,” he said.

In order to restore the CNN news brand, Licht has already implemented some key changes. He has advised hosts against using the phrase ""the big lie"" to refer to claims that President Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election, and he has threatened to oust those at the network who cannot maintain some level of objectivity in their reporting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-ratings-tank-employees-freaking-out,2022-07-07
Twitter reactions to CNN reporters politicizing hurricane to attack Ron DeSantis,"There was stern backlash to CNN reporters accused of politicizing Hurricane Ian to attack Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Reactions on Twitter blasted the CNN reporters for ""undiluted partisan hackery.""

Hurricane Ian slammed into southwest Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on Wednesday afternoon with devastating winds of 155 mph – just 2 mph shy of a Category 5 hurricane. Ian made landfall near Fort Myers and Cape Coral with catastrophic winds, a dangerous storm surge, and heavy rain. More than 2 million Floridians are without power. A large portion of the Sanibel Causeway – which connects the barrier island of Sanibel to mainland Florida – collapsed and fell into the San Carlos Bay that flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

On Thursday, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno told ""Good Morning America"" that estimated fatalities were ""in the hundreds,"" based on 911 emergency phone calls.

DeSantis clarified the sheriff's statement by saying the number was an ""estimate"" and that there are two ""unconfirmed"" deaths, but authorities are unsure if the fatalities were related to the historic storm.

The Republican governor of Florida said that 28 large helicopters from the National Guard and the Coast Guard are performing active rescue missions.

DeSantis said, ""The Coast Guard has been performing rescue missions on the barrier islands consistently since the wee hours of the morning.""

DeSantis described Hurricane Ian as ""basically a 500-year flood event.""

CNN reporter Steve Contorno used the treacherous hurricane to disparage DeSantis.

Contorno compared DeSantis encouraging Floridians to listen to local officials regarding hurricane preparations and evacuations to the governor previously advising residents to listen to state guidelines about COVID-19 pandemic instead of guidance from local government.

""As DeSantis prepares Floridians for Ian, he is urging residents to heed advice from the same local leaders he suggested they ignore during COVID and praising a federal agency he previously alleged withheld aid to the state because Biden was playing politics,"" Contorno said on Twitter.



Contorno wrote in the CNN article:

An abrasive political style is what has endeared DeSantis to Republican voters across the country amid his ascent within his party, but it has also resulted in strained relationships with the same local and national leaders DeSantis must now collaborate with to get Florida through this storm. After initially ceding coronavirus action to city mayors and county officials, DeSantis made a hard pivot and stripped municipalities of their ability to manage the pandemic while encouraging residents to ignore local precautions on masks and other mitigation measures. This week, though, DeSantis urged Tampa Bay residents to follow the advice of local leaders and lauded county emergency management teams as experienced professionals.

CNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere retweeted Contorno and added, ""Hurricanes & politics tend to run into each other in Florida, but this time it’s with a governor who has put himself at odds with many local government officials and who has been looking for fights with a president he may end up running against… 6 weeks before Election Day.""



CNN anchor Kasie Hunt also shared the tweet and wrote, ""A major test for this 2024 likely presidential hopeful.""

The CNN reporters were slammed on Twitter for allegedly politicizing the devastating hurricane to attack DeSantis.

DeSantis rapid response director Christina Pushaw: ""Floridians' lives are in danger, so of course CNN is rooting for the hurricane. Not everything is about politics. If you see a Cat 4+ hurricane approaching the coast of the United States and your first instinct is baseless partisan speculation, perhaps you should stop calling yourself a journalist. Because Covid & hurricanes are not the same. If you are seriously equating mask mandates and lockdowns (liberal rain dances that weren’t demonstrated to be effective anywhere in the USA) to HURRICANE EVACUATIONS, which are proven necessary from past experience, reevaluate.""

Radio show host Erick Erickson: ""COVID is not like a hurricane. This is dumb and discrediting analysis.""

Author Rebecca Downs: ""I asked if he has no shame, but sadly I don’t think it’s possible for those in the MSM to have any more, especially if it means getting to politicize and condemn their boogeyman.""

Editor Jennifer Van Laar: ""And? It's like you want Floridians to distrust the local leaders and possibly perish in the storm. What a tool you are.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) adviser Omri Ceren: ""A lot of you are very mad about this sociopathic tweet from a CNN journo but in fairness to him he's just doing his job.""

Meteorologist Ryan Maue: ""CNN is such trash. Can someone yank this garbage off the air and Internet?""



Writer Ellen Carmichael: ""Telling people how to get access to needed supplies or safe evacuation routes is not the same as directing their personal health care. I promise I’ve lived through more natural disasters than you, and I can assure you, no one appreciates this.""

Radio show host Derek Hunter: ""This is pathetic, even for CNN. Weather and a virus are not the same.""

Judge Alex Ferrer: ""Ahhh. Brian Stelter was fired so someone had to be the new George Costanza at CNN.""

Media critic Joe Concha: ""In the running for worst tweet of the day.""

Writer Brad Slager: ""This is undiluted partisan hackery. First, thinking Covid advice and hurricane preparedness are at all comparable is laughably dense. Secondly DeSantis already dealt with a hurricane strike and it’s aftermath, showing prowess in dealing with a natural disaster. Contorno is inept.""

Editor Mollie Hemingway: ""CNN, where this activist produces propaganda against Florida, is such utter and unsalvageable trash.""

Coast Guard accused of illegally using automated system to mass-deny 99% of religious waivers for vaccine mandate,"On Tuesday, the House Oversight Committee Republicans alleged that the U.S. Coast Guard used an automated system to mass-deny nearly 99% of religious accommodation requests seeking COVID vaccine exemptions.



As of September, the Coast Guard had approved only 12 religious waivers but denied 1,231, reported Fox News Digital.

""Religious freedom is protected by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. Despite these protections, information received by Committee Republicans indicates that the adjudication process for exemption applications was a pro forma exercise designed to reach predetermined conclusions—to deny requests and appeals—in nearly every single case,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter to Commandant Admiral Linda L. Fagan.

According to federal law and Pentagon policy, leaders from each military branch are required to analyze every request individually.

Pentagon's Acting Inspector General Sean O'Donnell issued an internal memo that read, ""We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies.""

Over a dozen Republican lawmakers led by Representatives James Comer of Kentucky and Andrew Clyde of Georgia agreed with O'Donnell's finding. They wrote on Tuesday, ""USCG's review system was similarly stood up to reach predetermined conclusions with the goal of rejecting applications."" The mass denial of requests indicated ""no case-by-case determinations were taking place.""

Religious accommodation applicants received blanket denial letters that lawmakers alleged were created by a form tool that automatically generated ""a predetermined reason why that argument was insufficient to overcome a denial."" The software generated a pre-written response based on one of 25 possible arguments religious accommodation applicants could make.

""Under no circumstances should the [Coast Guard] blatantly disregard Americans' religious freedoms,"" Comer told the Daily Caller. ""We fully expect Admiral Fagan to provide answers about depriving these members a fair process.""

R. Davis Younts, a criminal defense attorney, told the news outlet that using an automated tool with a default setting to mass-deny religious waivers would be a ""clear"" violation of federal law.

""Blanket denials of religious accommodations, without the individualized review and without a clear determination that there's a compelling interest and no alternative things to do to accomplish the mission without it, that's absolutely a violation of federal law,"" said Younts.

The Republican lawmakers' letter demanded a staff-level briefing from Coast Guard officials to explain the process used to review and deny the requests. The Coast Guard acknowledged receiving the letter and confirmed that it would investigate the matter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/coast-guard-accused-of-illegally-using-automated-system-to-mass-deny-99-of-religious-waivers-for-vaccine-mandate,2022-10-20
Coca-Cola takes 'pause' on woke diversity hiring requirements that allegedly violated federal law,"Coca-Cola has abandoned, at least temporarily, a controversial company diversity plan that was accused of violating the Civil Rights Act.

What is the background?

Bradley Gayton, who was the general counsel for Coca-Cola, announced a new diversity plan in January that promised to punish outside law firms seeking to work with Coca-Cola.

Under Gayton's plan, outside law firms would be required to use ""diverse attorneys"" for at least 30% of their billable hours with Coca-Cola, half of whom were required to be black. Firms that did not meet the diversity quota would be financially penalized.

The plan stated:

Failure to meet the commitment over two quarterly reviews will result in a non-refundable 30% reduction in the fees payable for such New Matter going forward until the commitment is met and, continued failure may result in your firm no longer being considered for KO work.

Last month, Boyden Gray, writing on behalf of the Project on Fair Representation, said the ""policy of discrimination is illegal,"" and demanded it be immediately revoked. Gray said the quota violated federal law that prohibits racially discriminatory hiring practices.

In fact, Gray said Coca-Cola was aware the quotas are ""indefensible"" because of Gayton's sudden departure as Coca-Cola's general counsel last month. Gayton had joined Coca-Cola less than one year ago on Sept. 1. Gayton transitioned to a consultant role, which is worth $12 million, according to Bloomberg Law.

What is the new development?

Newly hired Coca-Cola general counsel Monica Howard Douglas is reviewing Gayton's plan, and has put the quota policy on ""pause"" — at least for now.

Law.com reported:

When asked about Gayton's diversity initiative, Douglas indicated that Coca-Cola was ""taking a pause for now"" but would likely salvage some parts of the plan, the source said. Douglas didn't provide any additional details about what would remain and what would be scrapped, according to the source.



""She said she … plans to use some of it, but everything is being evaluated. They plan to adopt some of his strategies and passions. Everything was, 'More to come,'"" the source added.

While the details of Gayton's departure were not clear — nor did Douglas address it — a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said the pause is related to Douglas taking over as general counsel.

""When there is a leadership change, it takes time for the new leader to review the current status of the team, organization and initiatives,"" spokesman Scott Leith told Fox Business. ""Monica is fully committed to the notions of equity and diversity in the legal profession, and we fully expect she will take the time necessary to thoughtfully review any plans going forward.""

Anything else?

Coca-Cola also came under fire in February after some employees completed an online racial sensitivity training course that taught participants how to ""be less white.""

At the time, Coca-Cola explained the course was not internal training curriculum, but was a publicly available LinkedIn course. Still, Coca-Cola did not clarify whether employees were forced to participate in the course.

""The video circulating on social media is from a publicly available LinkedIn Learning series and is not a focus of our company's curriculum. Our Better Together global learning curriculum is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace. It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long. The training includes access to LinkedIn Learning on a variety of topics, including on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We will continue to refine this curriculum,"" the company said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/coca-cola-pause-diversity-hiring-federal-law,2021-05-05
"College newspaper editors refuse to publish conservative student leader's letter, mock his request in private messages","The student editors of a college newspaper in Nebraska refused to publish a letter to the editor from a conservative student, mocking his request to have the letter published, according to leaked screenshots of their communications.

Wayne State College Student Senate President Blake Aspen wrote a letter to the editor in September criticizing the editorial decisions of the Wayne Stater — a letter that went ignored. On Wednesday, he sent an email to the student editors of the paper inquiring about his letter, which was written in response to statements from the paper's editor-in-chief boasting of leading an all-female editorial board with no conservative opinions.

""Earlier this year, I sent you a letter that was critical, but fair of [The Wayne Stater's] editorial practices. I'm curious as to when that letter will be published,"" Aspen wrote.

""As you are aware, at Wayne State College, we embrace diversity of all sorts. It's mildly concerning when the Editor-In-Chief publishes statements claiming how proud she is to have an all-female editorial board with no right-of-center opinions shared whatsoever,"" he said.

""Given my willingness to sit down for multiple interviews with your paper, I am looking forward to hearing back from you with a timeline for publishing the letter to the editor.""

After receiving Aspen's email, the editorial team of the Wayne Stater mocked his request, leaked screenshots obtained by Young America's Foundation's Campus Bias Tipline show. The screenshots were given to Aspen, who posted them on Twitter on Wednesday.

""Aww guys he wants his letter published in our paper!"" Laura Spieler, the arts and entertainment editor, wrote.

""Still not gonna do it lmao,"" Editor-in-Chief Kaitlynn Breeden replied. ""I'm gonna respond to his email and try to not be a bitch and explain why I'm not publishing it.""

Aspen's unpublished letter to the editor was a response to an op-ed piece that Breeden wrote last spring criticizing Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts.

""Hi, it's me again <3 Just want to remind everyone that this is the opinion section, this is not news, will not be news, and I will be making fun of Pete Ricketts again,"" Breeden wrote. ""This is just my opinion, nothing about this needs to be taken to heart. If you're a Ricketts fan, maybe skip this one and just read the news section this week.""

In his letter, Aspen criticized Breeden for asking students that support Ricketts to ""skip this one,"" complaining that the tone of her op-ed suggests she has no desire to persuade those that might disagree with her.

""When [The Wayne Stater] editors, and more specifically, the editor-in-chief, openly ask readers who do not align with the writer's perspective to 'sit this editorial out,' it causes grave concern. This shows that you're not even attempting to compel or persuade individuals who might disagree with you,"" Aspen wrote.

In response, Breeden wrote in a new op-ed that her opinion columns are ""satire"" and that she considers op-eds ""to be different than editorials, which try to persuade.""

""The only goal I have when writing my opinion columns is to make the reader laugh. That is honestly it. They are meant to be taken as a joke,"" Breeden wrote.

""[I]f the letter he sent in wasn't a personal attack on myself and other editors, I would've published it weeks ago,"" she added.

Breeden also said she was ""disappointed"" that a member of the editorial team took screenshots of their private chat messages and made them public.

""To be honest, I don't know our staff's political party identifications, and I don't care. But someone may have conservative views, because they sent Aspen a screenshot of our private group messages. This is disappointing to me because this could lead to staff members not expressing what they really think during meetings anymore, due to not wanting someone to leak information about them,"" she wrote.

Aspen told YAF that conservative thought at college campuses faces a ""hostile environment.""

""The reckless ideologues at The Wayne Stater discriminate against conservatives in private, but it's up to conservative students across the country to demand transparency in the way these publicly funded newspapers operate. It's time to end the suppression of speech on college campuses,"" he said.

Responding to a request for comment from YAF, Wayne State College Director of College Relations Jay Collier said: ""The student journalists on the editorial board of The Wayne Stater have the right to determine the content of the publication consistent with Board Policy 3350.""

She added: ""We would encourage the editorial staff of The Wayne Stater to review its editorial policies to ensure accountability and transparency in its decision-making consistent with prevailing journalistic ethical and professional standards.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-newspaper-editors-refuse-to-publish-conservative-student-leaders-letter,2021-10-08
"College students of course favor government's eviction moratorium — then get schooled by landlords, others who know its real price","In the wake of the eviction moratorium extension by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Campus Reform visited college students in Washington, D.C., to get their opinions on renters living for free on properties they don't own while landlords still have to pay mortgages.

Given that just about all college students are renters, generally speaking, you can imagine that they were in favor of the the eviction moratorium put in place due to business shutdowns over the COVID-19 pandemic.

""People don't deserve to be thrown out of their homes, especially in a time like this,"" one student told the outlet.

Another student said the eviction moratorium is a ""basic moral thing"" and a matter of ""forgiveness"" when income has vanished for so many people.



""It seems like a good thing,"" another student said of the eviction moratorium.

In fairness, the students interviewed, by and large, also said it isn't fair that property owners are stuck footing the bills in the absence of rent — however, a number of them said that's where the government has to step in and cover financially for property owners.

Indeed, when they were asked how they'd feel if they were in property owners' shoes, the students admitted that they'd be ""upset"" and ""very pissed"" and ""irritated"" and ""bummed out.""

A splash of cold water

Commenters on the below video showing the interviews with the D.C. college students tore into the students' responses:

""I am a landlord. My tenant hasn't payed rent In a year. This is literally my life,"" one commenter wrote. ""It's frustrating. I might lose the house to taxes because the government didn't stop charging me taxes on the houses when they decided I couldn't rent successfully anymore.""

""'No one should be kicked out of their home.' Umm it's not YOUR house if you're renting it,"" another commenter shot back.

""'People don't deserve to be thrown out of their homes.' They are renting and not paying said rent,"" another commenter observed. ""This is why people don't listen to youth. They are too readily to give advice when they in the same sentence say I don't know any details of the issue.""

""People lose their home[s] because they can't pay the mortgage[s] but the people living in the rented homes live there for free. ... Dems at their best!"" another commenter said.

""It's funny watching these people who believe they are going to 'fight the man' and 'put truth to power' cry and beg for more government control,"" another commenter declared. ""Absolute buffoons.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-students-eviction-moratorium-landlords,2021-08-12
"Colorado GOP state lawmaker flips parties, joins Democrats because of 2020 election claims","A Colorado state legislator has switched parties, resigning from the Republican Party and joining the Democrats because of 2020 election claims and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

State Sen. Kevin Priola, a moderate lawmaker, announced Monday he could no longer support the GOP, which he accused of ignoring existential threats to democracy and the climate crisis. He said he watched the events of Jan. 6 ""with horror"" and felt ""dismay"" that anti-Trump Republicans like Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) were ""met with ridicule and threats.""

""I cannot continue to be a part of a political party that is okay with a violent attempt to overturn a free and fair election and continues to peddle claims that the 2020 election was stolen,"" Priola said in a statement announcing his change in party affiliation.

He also said the Republican Party's inaction on climate change was cause for his defection to the Democrats.

""Today, my Republican colleagues would rather deny the existence of human-caused climate change than take action ... my Republican colleagues consistently, and proudly, seek to impede progress on any reasonable climate measure the legislature has undertaken — and I can't, in good conscience, be silent about that,"" Priola said.

Though he will now caucus with the Democrats, Priola asserted he will not change how he votes on legislation and that his positions on abortion, gun rights, and school choice ""run counter to the Democratic Party platform.""



Even so, with one fewer lawmaker in their conference, Colorado Republicans face an uphill battle to recapture the state Senate majority, which Democrats now hold by four seats. Priola said he will campaign for Democrats to retain control of the state legislature this November.

""Even if there will continue to be issues that I disagree with the Democratic Party on, there is too much at stake right now for Republicans to be in charge,"" Priola said. ""Coloradans cannot afford their leaders to give credence to election conspiracies and climate denialism. Simply put, we need Democrats in charge because our planet and our democracy depend on it.""

Though Democrats had sought to defeat Priola in 2020, he was welcomed into their fold on Monday.

""We are a broad tent party, always seeking good ideas from the left and right to move CO forward. Senator Priola is a strong leader on climate issues & will hopefully be even more effective on the Democratic side of the aisle,"" Gov. Jared Polis (D) said in a statement.

Colorado GOP chairwoman Kristi Burton Brown blasted Priola in a statement, saying he ""finally made the move to the party he's consistently voted with.""

""After lying to his constituents, routinely voting for tax increases, & hurting the working families of his district, he's now admitted his true affiliation: a pro tax-increase Democrat,"" Brown said.

""He will regret this decision when he's in the minority come January 2023,"" she added.

Comedian Gabriel Iglesias blasts cancel culture after NYT columnist complains about Speedy Gonzales as 'corrosive stereotype',"Comedian and voice actor Gabriel Iglesias blasted cancel culture in a Saturday tweet following a New York Times article that branded beloved cartoon character Speedy Gonzales as toxic.

Iglesias voices the cartoon mouse in the upcoming reboot of ""Space Jam.""

What are the details?

On Wednesday, Times columnist Charles Blow took aim at Dr. Seuss' books — and certain cartoons — that he said perpetuate ""corrosive stereotypes.""

In the editorial, Blow wrote, ""Some of the first cartoons I can remember include Pepé Le Pew, who normalized rape culture; Speedy Gonzales, whose friends helped popularize the corrosive stereotype of the drunk and lethargic Mexicans; and Mammy Two Shoes, a heavyset black maid who spoke in a heavy accent.""

In an apparent response to the news, Iglesias — whose nickname is Fluffy — wrote, ""I am the voice of Speedy Gonzales in the new Space Jam. Does this mean they are gonna try to cancel Fluffy too?""

""U can't catch me cancel culture,"" he added. ""I'm the fastest mouse in all of Mexico.""

Can't keep a good mouse down

It also seems fair to point out that Cartoon Network once tried to shelve cartoons featuring the Mexican mouse in 1999 over accusations that it promoted negative stereotypes — but outcry from its Mexican audience prompted the network to return Speedy to the airwaves.

According to a report from Quartz, the League of United Latin American Citizens spoke out on the removal, and by 2002, Speedy was back on the air.

Anything else?



Blow also took a virtual beating over his remarks about Pepé Le Pew on Sunday.

In response to the criticism, Blow took to Twitter and defended his sentiments.

""[Right wing] blogs are mad bc I said Pepe Le Pew added to rape culture,"" Blow wrote on Twitter. ""Let's see. 1. He grabs/kisses a girl/stranger, repeatedly, w/o consent and against her will. 2. She struggles mightily to get away from him, but he won't release her 3. He locks a door to prevent her from escaping. This helped teach boys that 'no' didn't really mean no, that it was a part of 'the game', the starting line of a power struggle.""

""It taught overcoming a woman's strenuous, even physical objections, was normal, adorable, funny,"" he added. ""They didn't even give the woman the ability to SPEAK.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/comedian-gabriel-iglesias-speedy-gonzales,2021-03-08
"Commissioner Rettig insists that the 87,000 additional IRS agents will not be used to increase audit scrutiny on small businesses or the middle class","The Inflation Reduction Act granted the Internal Revenue Services another $80 billion in funding, which will be used to hire 87,000 new agents. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig wrote a letter to the U.S. Senate last week assuring them that the additional resources would be used to crack down on ""large corporate and high-net-worth taxpayers"" that are not paying their ""fair share.""



Rettig expressed gratitude that the funds will bring the department back to ""historical norms in areas of challenge for the agency.""

The Biden administration and the Democratic Party have repeatedly promised Americans that any household with an annual income under $400,000 will not see an increase in its taxes.

Rettig reiterated those guarantees, ""These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans. As we've been planning, our investment of these enforcement resources is designed around the Department of the Treasury's directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for households making under $400,000.""

The Government Accountability Office reported that audit rates have dropped over the past decade. The IRS insisted that the decrease is due to a lack of resources.

Over half of the $80 billion will be specifically dedicated to ""enforcement.""

""The IRS has for too long been unable to pursue meaningful, impactful examinations of large corporate and high-networth taxpayers to ensure they are paying their fair share,"" Rettig wrote.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the IRS would bring in $203.7 billion in revenue over the next decade.

Idaho Senator Mike Crapo (R) released a statement on Sunday speaking out against his colleagues. He explained that the funding boost would not be used only to target millionaires and billionaires but would also impact taxpayers making below $400,000.

""Otherwise, why would the legislative text say the funding isn't intended to target taxpayers below that threshold? My colleagues and Americans know the real answer: small business owners, cash-heavy businesses and those who can't afford legal teams are easy targets for the new IRS agents and their audits,"" Sen. Crapo stated.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R) shared a similar sentiment. He said, ""They're not being created to audit billionaires or giant corporations. They're being created to audit you. The House Ways and Means Committee, the minority, has put out an estimate that under this bill, there will be 1.2 million new audits per year, with over 700,000 of those new audits falling on taxpayers making $75,000 or less.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/commissioner-rettig-insists-that-the-87000-additional-irs-agents-will-not-be-used-to-increase-audit-scrutiny-on-small-businesses-or-the-middle-class,2022-08-10
"Conan O'Brien, leftist actor Sean Penn slam 'ludicrous' cancel culture as 'very Soviet'","Spawned in part from the progressive political correctness movement, cancel culture has become so broadly disfavored that even left-wing Hollywood elites are taking turns trashing it.

What happened?

During a July 5 episode of the podcast ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend,"" former late-night host Conan O'Brien and actor Sean Penn agreed that the practice of collectively ostracizing people and destroying their careers over past politically incorrect statements is worrisome.

""Empathy is a very important word and also forgiveness,"" O'Brien noted. ""This whole concept of cancel culture is ... We found that someone did something in 1979 that is now not appropriate. They're dead to us.""

""It's ludicrous,"" Penn, famous for starring in hit movies such as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Mystic River,"" said.

""People can also be forgiven — if they even need forgiving. What happened to that?"" O'Brien continued, adding, ""It feels very Soviet sometimes.""

At that point, Penn made reference to Alexi McCammond, the 27-year-old reporter who was pushed out of her role as editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue earlier this year after staff members unearthed and condemned offensive tweets about Asian people she posted as a teenager.

""When we're destroying careers like that, what are we really achieving?"" Penn asked. ""Or you look at politicians ... I give a big nod to anyone that's willing to enter the public arena who is doing so because they give a damn.""

Sean Penn · Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend youtu.be

What else?



The conversation started with O'Brien heaping praise on Penn for his portrayal of San Francisco politician and gay rights activist Harvey Milk in the 2008 film ""Milk."" But Penn noted that a straight man portraying a gay character is likely not something that would be permitted in today's society.

""It brings up an interesting point,"" the actor said. ""Another one I think a lot about these days. Today, almost certainly I would not be permitted to be cast in that role. We're living in a time when, if you're playing a gay lead character, you'd have to be a gay man, or a trans character. And there have been these casting issues.""

He added: ""When you have a period of evolution that certainly may [provide] an opportunity for people who have had less opportunities to move forward, that has to be supported. And yet in this pendulum swing society that we're in, you wonder at some point if only Danish Princes can play Hamlet. It is, I believe, too restrictive. People are looking for gotcha moments and to criticize.""

Anything else?

While O'Brien's resistance to cancel culture may not be that surprising — comedians often make a living by telling controversial jokes — Penn's certainly is. The actor was quite literally a friend of communist strongman former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

It's fair to wonder if Penn bristled at O'Brien's description of cancel culture as ""Soviet.""

The actor also practiced his own version of public shaming not so long ago, when he attempted — but failed — to call out evangelical Christians.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/conan-obrien-sean-penn-cancel-culture,2021-07-08
"Concealed carrier, 56, turns the tables on armed carjackers in Chicago, shooting and seriously wounding 2 of them while third suspect breaks leg","A 56-year-old man carrying a concealed gun fought back against a trio of armed teenage carjackers in Chicago and turned the tables on them, shooting and seriously wounding two of the suspects, while the third broke a leg in a car crash.

What are the details?

The man was in his vehicle in the 4700 block of West Arthington Street, which is on the west side of the city, just before 6 a.m. Monday when three male teens approached in a vehicle, police told WLS-TV.

One of the suspects pulled a gun on the man and demanded his belongings, WBBM-TV reported.

But the man wasn't about to become a victim. Instead he exited his vehicle, struggled with at least one of the suspects, and then pulled out a gun of his own and opened fire, WBBM said.

They all suffered the consequences:

The driver of the suspect's vehicle was shot in the head and taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital in critical condition, WLS said.

A second suspect was found several blocks away with a gunshot wound to the shoulder, WLS said, adding that he was taken to Stroger Hospital in serious condition.

The third suspect was in the back seat of the suspects' vehicle and suffered a broken leg after the vehicle crashed, WLS said, adding that he was taken to a local hospital in fair condition.

WBBM said the suspects' vehicle crashed through an open lot. A neighbor who heard the crash told the station it sounded like a ""train got hit or something.""

Police told WBBM the man who shot the suspects has a license to carry a concealed gun and was not injured in the incident, adding that detectives are investigating.

Chicago carjackers getting pushback?

Carjackers in the Windy City seem to have been meeting with resistance of late; a 17-year-old carjacker died last week after a woman carrying concealed shot him in the head during an attempted heist on the south side the day before Thanksgiving.

In July, a woman with a concealed carry license shot at a group of males who pointed a gun at her as they attempted to steal her car — and a 13-year-old male with the would-be thieves was shot.

What are the details?

Police said a 26-year-old man found the kid breaking into his Kia around 2:35 p.m. Sunday on South Langley Avenue in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, the station said. Bronzeville is on the city's south side.

The Kia owner then pulled out a handgun and shot the kid in the leg, police told WFLD.

Police said the 13-year-old boy also was carrying a gun, WFLD reported, adding that when they arrived, police found a gun on the kid.

The boy was taken to Comer Children's Hospital, the station said. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that the boy's condition wasn’t immediately known.

Police took in the concealed carry holder for questioning, WFLD reported, adding that the case remains under investigation.

Similar scenario in July

A woman with a concealed carry license shot at a group of males who pointed a gun at her as they attempted to steal her car in Chicago on July 29 — and a 13-year-old boy who was with the would-be thieves was shot, police told WBBM-TV.

Four to five males were trying to break into a parked car in the 1100 block of East 52nd Street in Hyde Park at 7:58 p.m., police told the station. The 34-year-old woman who owns the car confronted the group, after which one of them pulled a gun and pointed it at her, police told WBBM.

With that, the woman fired her own gun at the group and hit a 13-year-old boy who was with the would-be thieves, police told the station.

The boy was struck in the neck and taken to the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital in fair condition, police added to WBBM.

Police said the rest of the crooks ran off, no weapon was recovered, and no one else was injured, the station reported.

Kias are popular targets

According to WFLD, viral videos show how easy it is to steal some Kias.

An 11-year-old boy was arrested over the summer in connection with an assault and attempted carjacking in western Michigan during which a Kia Sorrento was the target.

In its report of the incident, WOOD-TV noted that police were investigating whether the attempted carjacking was related to other recent Kia thefts. Metro Grand Rapids authorities recently warned of a national theft trend targeting Kia and Hyundai vehicles because they use a standard key rather than a fob, which makes them relatively easy to steal, the station said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/concealed-carrier-chicago-shoots-boy-car-breakin,2022-09-12
Concealed carrier shoots at crooks who steal his car at gunpoint and make getaway. But soon two shot teens turn up — and now they're persons of interest.,"A motorist whose car was stolen at gunpoint Friday morning in suburban Chicago turned out to be a concealed carrier — and he refused to play victim, firing his gun at the crooks, who managed to make a getaway, WGN-TV reported.

What happened next?

No injuries were reported after the white 2014 Nissan Maxima was carjacked around 5:43 a.m. at a Mobil gas station in Hoffman Estates, the Arlington Cardinal reported.

But around 7 a.m., Chicago police said they responded to a call about a shooting in the 3800 block of West Chicago Avenue, WGN said — about 45 minutes southeast of where the carjacking took place.

Seems a pair of 16-year-old males who were in a nearby hospital told cops they were shot in the Chicago location, the Cardinal reported. But police determined the shooting actually occurred in Hoffman Estates after the teens told them conflicting stories, WGN reported.

Believe it or not, the stolen car in question was located a short distance from where it was carjacked in Hoffman Estates, the Cardinal said. The outlet added that it was initially unknown how the teens got to West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park, which a little over two miles from the Chicago location where the teens claimed they were shot.

Persons of interest

Later Friday, police said the two teens were persons of interest in the carjacking case, WGN reported.

Police said one of the teens was shot in the left shoulder and back and was transported from West Suburban to Stroger Hospital in serious condition, the station reported, adding that the other teen was shot in the left leg and is in fair condition at West Suburban.

'Kind of scary'

Folks in Hoffman Estates were taken aback by the armed carjacking.

Armed thug picks wrong man to rob on Chicago train — a concealed carrier who pulls out his own gun and shoots suspect,"An armed man tried to rob a passenger aboard a Chicago train Friday — but it turns out the suspect picked the wrong victim: a concealed carrier who pulled out his own gun and shot the suspect.

What are the details?

The 33-year-old suspect approached and tried to rob a 25-year-old man aboard a Chicago Transit Authority Green Line train near the Laramie Station around 5 p.m., authorities told WMAQ-TV.

But the victim — who holds a concealed carry license and a Firearms Owner's Identification Card — pulled out his own gun and shot the suspect, the station said, citing authorities.

WMAQ noted in its broadcast that the suspect fired his gun, too, and that the victim — who wasn't hurt — shot the suspect in the leg.

Darius Moss was arrested on two felonies — armed robbery with a firearm and being an armed habitual criminal, the station said, citing police. Moss was hospitalized in fair condition, WMAQ added.

Moss was expected to appear Monday in Central Bond Court, the station reported.

Suspect reportedly has quite the rap sheet

According to CWB Chicago, Friday's incident wasn't the first time Moss has been charged with a crime.

The outlet said he was charged with misdemeanor theft in 2021 after a Dunkin' employee called police around 3:20 a.m. Aug. 16 saying someone stole the donut outfit's cash register, CWB said. The outlet said officers reviewed area surveillance camera feeds and spotted a man walking into the Jackson Blue Line station with a cash register.

Officers found Moss sitting on the train with the register, CWB reported, citing prosecutors, and they arrested him.

Prosecutors added to the outlet that Moss was on parole for robbery at the time. CWB said Judge Arthur Willis — prior to releasing Moss on a recognizance bond — told him, ""You’re lucky you weren’t charged with something greater than theft.""

The outlet also reported that Moss was arrested in 2018 after being accused of threatening to shoot a TJ Maxx security guard who tried to stop him from stealing $111 in merchandise Aug. 19.

The guard noted to police that Moss repeatedly told him, “I have a 9-millimeter — what are you going to do?” CWB said.

The outlet added that cops who recognized Moss' facial tattoos stopped him in the 300 block of South Plymouth Court, and the guard identified Moss, after which officers found Moss' bag contained TJ Maxx merchandise.

Judge Michael Clancy set bail for Moss at $50,000, which meant he could go free before trial by posting a $5,000 deposit bond, CWB said.

The outlet also said Moss was charged two months prior to the TJ Maxx incident with soliciting charitable contributions without a license after allegedly approaching people with flyers seeking donations for a “basketball team.”

'Very clear conflict of interest': Explosive new report reveals Stacey Abrams' scandal-plagued nonprofit group poured nearly $10 million into law firm belonging to her campaign chairman,"A special report published on Monday by Politico revealed that the law firm belonging to Stacey Abram's campaign chairman was paid nearly $10 million in legal fees for services rendered to Abrams' nonprofit group, Fair Fight Action, for its work on a lawsuit that recently failed in a federal court.

In addition to raising concerns about a possible conflict of interest, the exorbitant amounts paid to the Abrams-affiliated firm, while not unprecedented, have nevertheless been flagged as exceptional.

A failed lawsuit, a friend's firm, and a big payday

Stacey Abrams is the Democrat candidate currently seeking to unseat Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia's gubernatorial race. The chairman for her campaign, who also happens to be a close friend of Abrams', is Allegra Lawrence-Hardy.



Politico reported that Lawrence-Hardy is one of two named partners at the law firm Lawrence and Bundy. Lawrence-Hardy's firm was reportedly paid $9.4 million by Fair Fight Action in 2019 and 2020.

Fair Fight Action filed a lawsuit after Abrams was soundly defeated in Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election by 54,723 votes — a result the Democrat candidate gained a reputation as an ""election denier"" for rejecting.

The lawsuit claimed that the state had ""grossly mismanaged"" the election, depriving some citizens of their right to vote.

The Fair Fight Action v. Raffensperger trial began on April 11 and was rejected by U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta on Sept. 30.

Jones, an Obama appointee who found for the defendants on all counts, stated that while ""Georgia's election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Act of 1965],"" as had been alleged by Abrams.

Kemp said of the expensive legal failure: ""Today, Stacey Abrams and her organization lost in court - on all counts. From day one, Abrams has used this lawsuit to line her pockets, sow distrust in our democratic institutions, and build her own celebrity.""

$25 million of the roughly $61 million Fair Fight Action raised between 2019 and 2020 went into advancing this failed lawsuit.

Of the eight law firms that worked on the case, the largest amount reportedly went to Lawrence-Hardy's firm, which acted as lead counsel.

The deputy director for litigation at the Legal Defense Fund, Leah Aden, underscored that the legal fees paid to Lawrence-Hardy's firm altogether accounted for an amount obscenely higher than in most voting rights cases brought to federal court.

Aden told Politico, ""The typical case is a couple of hundred thousand dollars and can take a couple of years. ... Beyond $10 million would be very shocking, I would say.""

Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, suggested to Politico, ""Fair Fight Action ought to explain why this lawsuit cost so much. ... I think there are significant questions about this choice of firm and just why this lawsuit was so much more expensive.""

Although Lawrence-Hardy suggested to Politico that her firm provides ""other services for Fair Fight Action,"" she did not specify what those were.

Former Fair Fight Action organizing director Hillary Holley made clear that in speaking of ""other services,"" should Lawrence-Hardy have been referring to work done on a 2020 case brought by Fair Fight Inc. against True the Vote, that case would only have accounted for two months of billings.

It is unclear how many additional millions the law firm may have billed the Abrams group over the past two years.

Conflict of interest?

Lawrence-Hardy's firm made a great deal of money advancing the ill-fated lawsuit that Abrams appeared to have used, in turn, not only to raise money but as a campaign tool.

Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, told Politico, ""It is a very clear conflict of interest because with that kind of close link to the litigation and her friend that provides an opportunity where the friend gets particularly enriched from this litigation.""

""The outcome of that litigation can directly affect her campaign itself,"" added Holman.

Questionable fairness at Fair Fight

Last week, it came to light that Fair Fight PAC, the political action group founded by Abrams, had a director whose inexperienced friends and family were allegedly getting significant paydays while maintaining other full-time jobs.

In response to a critical Fox News Digital report, Fair Fight PAC issued a press release, stating that on Oct. 13, the organization ""became aware that PAC funds may have been incorrectly paid to consultants.""

""Fair Fight strives to serve with the utmost integrity, as is core to our values. We take these matters seriously and have initiated a comprehensive investigation,"" the statement added.

The individual warranting investigation was the PAC's political director, longtime Abrams aide André Fields.

Fields' sister, Darius Faulk, received over $120,000 despite having no political experience. Asa Fludd and Cruz Alvarado, both friends of Fields, received tens of thousands of dollars from Fair Fight PAC — $29,800 and $29,000 respectively.

While Fox News Digital indicated the amount paid by the PAC to these three individuals was over $178,000, CNN's review of the FEC filings from this and the previous election cycles suggests the figure may be closer to $250,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/conflict-of-interest-stacey-abrams-campaign-law-firm,2022-10-24
Congress overrides Trump's veto on defense spending bill,"By a comfortable 81-13 margin, the Senate voted to override President Donald Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act on Friday, completing the first (and perhaps only) veto override of Trump's presidency. The House had voted to override the president's veto by a similarly comfortable margin earlier this week.

President Trump vetoed the bill for a number of stated reasons, including its failure to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, its requirement that the military rename military bases that are named after confederate soldiers, and its provisions prohibiting him from performing certain troop relocations.

Many observers closely watched the veto override in the Senate to see what extent Trump will continue to have on Republicans in Congress when his term ends later this month. Tellingly, the president's veto did not change the vote of any Republican senators. The seven Republicans who voted to uphold Trump's veto all voted against the passage of the bill as well. Those Republicans were: Mike Braun (Ind.), Ted Cruz (Texas), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), John Kennedy (La.), Mike Lee (Utah), and Rand Paul (Ky.).

Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are locked in razor-thin re-election battles in Georgia, were not present for the vote, which was considered to be a foregone conclusion. Perdue is additionally currently in quarantine due to contact with a person who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

It should, however, be noted that multiple Republicans, including John Thune (S.D.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), and John Cornyn (Texas) reported to The Hill that they were not pressured by the president at all prior to the vote.

Nevertheless, Trump voiced his extreme displeasure with the vote on Twitter, calling the vote, ""Not fair, or smart!""





Republicans in Congress this week also effectively ended the president's push to increase the amount of stimulus checks sent to Americans to $2,000 apiece, after failing to reach a deal with Democrats to offset the additional spending these checks would require by trimming wasteful spending from other portions of the bill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congress-overrides-trumps-veto-on-defense-spending-bill,2021-01-02
Convicted murderer may get retrial after presiding judge accused of affair with assistant DA who cross-examined defense witnesses and gave closing argument,"A convicted murderer in Oklahoma may get a retrial after it has come to light that the presiding judge was having an affair with the assistant district attorney who not only cross-examined defense witnesses but also gave the closing arguments, media outlets reported.

What are the details?

Robert Hashagen was convicted of killing his elderly neighbor, Evelyn Goodall, in 2013, KFOR-TV reported. He was sentenced to life in prison, KOKH-TV added.

Benjamin Munda — speaking to KFOR for himself and co-counsel Clay Curtis, both of whom represented Hashagen — said ""we both firmly believe that we were treated extremely unfairly at trial. At the time, we didn’t know why. I think we have a much better idea of that now.""

Turns out the presiding judge in Hashagen's trial — Tim Henderson — was having a ""secret sexual relationship"" for about two years with one of the prosecutors on the case, KFOR reported, citing court documents.

In fact, the assistant district attorney in question cross-examined two defense witnesses and gave the state's closing arguments, KOKH noted.

According to KFOR, that prosecutor has claimed Henderson sexually abused her, but Henderson said their relationship was consensual and said that he was ""fair"" during the Hashagen trial despite their relationship.

Henderson resigned in March after three other women — two of them prosecutors — leveled sexual misconduct allegations against him, KFOR added.

Another judge rules Hashagen entitled to retrial

Another judge assigned to weigh in on the scandal ruled Monday that Hashagen is entitled to a retrial, KFOR said.

Munda told KFOR that this new ruling indicates the judge's relationship with the prosecutor ""created at least the appearance and substantial risk that the proceedings were unfair. It undermined the integrity and confidence in the judicial system and because of that [Hashagen] should be entitled to a new trial.""

Munda also told the station that he's guessing ""dozens to hundreds of cases ... were touched by the assistant district attorneys in question here in front of this particular judge, maybe thousands.""

Now what?

KFOR reported that the Criminal Court of Appeals will look the new finding that Hashagen is entitled to a new trial and make a final determination.

Cops outraged that NYPD cop-killer tapped to help design police reform in New York,"Richard Rivera murdered an NYPD cop execution-style in 1981. Now he has been recruited to sit on a panel tasked with coming up with police reform plans in New York.

Naturally, the family of the murdered cop as well as New York police are not thrilled.

What did Rivera do?

Rivera was convicted of the Jan. 12, 1981, murder of NYPD Officer Robert Walsh and spent 39 years in prison for his crime, the New York Post reported.

The killer was 16 years old when he a four other armed teenagers attempted to rob the BVD Bar and Grill in Queens.

Walsh, a 36-year-old cop with 12 years of service, was off-duty and at the bar when the gun-toting teens attempted their heist. The Post explained what happened next:

As the hero off-duty officer identified himself as a cop and reached for his gun to try to stop the robbery, Rivera shot him in the shoulder. Rivera then walked over to the officer as he lay helplessly wounded on the floor, pressed his gun to the cop's head and blasted him again, authorities said.

Rivera was released in 2019 and told the Post that he has since been working with a nonprofit to provide food and shelter for the homeless.

Blowback for police-reform panel

Rivera is now sitting on a panel for Ithaca and Tompkins County, the Post said, that is designed to help plan police reform in upstate New York, as part of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's New York State Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative executive order that was signed in the wake of George Floyd's death.

The order requires each local government to come up with a plan “that reinvents and modernizes police strategies and programs in their community based on community input"" by April 1. “If you don't do it, local government, you won't get any state funding. Period,"" Cuomo said, according to the Post. “You have to pass a law with your redesigned police force.""

Rivera told the Post that he expected people to be critical.

He was right.

Officer Walsh's son, Robert Walsh Jr., told the paper, ""We're completely shocked that the man who murdered my father is being trusted to create police reforms. My father dedicated his life to serving and protecting New Yorkers. He should be the one serving on a panel to help reimagine policing, but he'll never get that chance.""

The president of the police union told the Post that putting Rivera on the reform panel is ""outrageous and despicable.""

""Not only did this cop-killer get paroled, but now he gets a seat at the table to help dismantle a police department. Did anybody expect him to be fair and open-minded in his review?"" Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said.

""The entire process has trampled on the ideals that police officers like Robert Walsh upheld,"" Lynch added. ""It's the ultimate disrespect to his service and sacrifice.""

The Post said the panel Rivera is serving on did not respond to requests for comment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cops-outraged-nypd-cop-killer-police-reform,2021-03-30
Corrections officer shot dead in prison parking lot: 'He was our family',"A senior corrections officer at a Georgia prison was murdered early Tuesday morning, shot dead in the parking lot of the facility where he worked.

According to reports, Scott Riner, 59, had just arrived for work at the Gwinnett Correctional Center, about an hour northeast of Atlanta, around 6:20 a.m. when he had an interaction with an unidentified ""individual"" in the parking lot. The exact nature and the length of the interaction are currently unknown, but reports indicate that the individual eventually shot Riner and fled the scene on foot. Riner died at the scene almost immediately, even before other officers could come and render medical assistance.

""The best that we can tell at this time is that the victim was involved in some kind of a confrontation or interaction with another individual here in the parking lot and that that individual did shoot him,"" said Gwinnett Police Department's Sgt. Jennifer Richter.

Though police, always eager to defend and honor the memory of one of their own, have made the investigation an immediate priority, they have released little information about the shooting thus far. They are currently looking for information from anyone who may have been ""in the area of Hi Hope Road and Swanson Drive, including Hurricane Shoals Road, Swanson, and Georgia 316 between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. on Tuesday morning,"" FOX 5 Atlanta reports. They are particularly interested in ""dash cam footage"" from that timeframe.

Police have also released a grainy video of the suspect in the hopes that a viewer will be able to give a positive identification:

Video shows man stalk woman at Target for not wearing a mask,"A video is going viral this week that shows a man wearing a COVID-19 vaccination pin on his shirt and harassing a woman in Target because she is not wearing a face mask.

The man is seen on video stalking a female shopper at a Target store in Washington, according to Newsweek. In the footage, the man is wearing a mask and doesn't appear to have a shopping cart or any products in his hands to purchase.

The woman asks the man, ""You're vaccinated?"" He responds that he is vaccinated, and she replies, ""Oh you are? Because I already have natural immunity.""

The woman gives the impression that the man has been harassing her since before the video starts, and states, ""You're not going to follow me around in the store and point at me to people.""

He tells the woman that wearing a face mask is a ""state regulation.""

""It's not a law. You're an idiot,"" the woman says, and she walks away but he follows.



Currently, the Washington Department of Health requires that ""everyone five years of age and older wear a mask in public indoor settings and at large, outdoor events with 500 or more attendees, including sporting events, fairs, parades, and concerts, regardless of vaccination status.""

Another female shopper tells the man to ""leave her alone,"" and purposely moves her cart to keep them separated.

""You got your mask on; you're safe. I'm sure you're vaccinated too,"" the other woman tells the man.

He admits he has a ""badge"" advertising that he is vaccinated, and then points at the woman taking the video. At this point, there is a small crowd watching the incident, including someone who tells him to stop harassing her.

The man then says everyone should shame the woman for not wearing a mask.

""It's all of our job as a community to come together and make sure that people are shamed when they put the rest of us at risk,"" the man said in the video that has over 3 million views on various social media platforms, including TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube.

The woman tells a security officer for the store, ""He was following me; he won't leave me alone.""

She walks away again, but he continued to creepily stalk her to the register area, but he did not have any items to purchase.

""You're making a bad decision. You're a bad American...you're a bad person for doing this,"" the man tells the woman.

The woman sarcastically agrees and then tells him that she voted for former President Donald Trump, eliciting a few cheers from other shoppers.

Another shopper tells the man that getting vaccinated or not is a personal choice.

But the man continues to berate the woman, ""You're putting the community at risk, you're a terrible person.""

The man urges the security guard to escort the maskless woman from the building.

Another woman in another checkout line bashes the vaccinated man, ""You're not at risk! C'mon! This is America!""

The video ends with the security guard talking to the man.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-mask-video-target-stalking,2021-09-18
Americans begin receiving at-home COVID tests — but make shocking discovery on back of packages: 'Made in China',"You literally cannot make this up.

As Americans began receiving free at-home COVID-19 tests kits distributed by the Biden administration this week, many Americans began noticing something odd about the tests: They are made in China.

What are the details?

Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer noted on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday that after ordering four at-home COVID tests — which he received in quick fashion — he observed on the backs of the boxes that the tests were manufactured in China.

""I got mine yesterday. All four of them came. Congrats U.S. government — U.S. Postal Service did a great job,"" Hemmer explained. ""Got my four tests. And on the back of the fine print, Dana, it is made in China.""

""Of course,"" co-host Dana Perino quipped.

The tests in question are manufactured by iHealth Labs Inc. Even though the company is headquartered in California, the backs of the testing packages clearly state that the tests were made in China.

According to Reuters, iHealth Labs Inc. is a subsidiary of Andon Health Co Ltd, a Chinese medical supplies company.

The Defense Department announced on Jan. 14 that the U.S government had awarded iHealth Labs Inc. a contract worth $1.275 billion to produce millions of at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen tests. The contract will supply testing kits that serve up to 250 million people, Reuters noted.

New York and Massachusetts have also signed contracts with iHealth Labs Inc. for rapid at-home antigen tests.

What was the reaction?

As Americans began receiving their Chinese-made tests, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) condemned the Biden administration for procuring COVID tests from China of all places.

Scott said the Biden administration should have prioritized American-made tests instead of sending more taxpayer dollars to China.

""Senator Scott thinks it is unacceptable that the Biden administration would spend American taxpayer dollars on COVID tests from Communist China, which just goes directly to supporting General Secretary Xi and his genocidal regime, instead of supporting American manufacturers and jobs,"" Scott said in a statement.

""The federal government has a responsibility to support American manufacturers, and we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that it was the Chinese Communist Party that lied about this deadly virus, tried to hide it, and has continuously covered up the origins of COVID-19,"" he added.

One week before the Defense Department announced the contract with iHealth Labs Inc., Scott wrote Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra urging him to not buy Chinese-made tests.

What was the Biden admin's response?

An administration official told Fox News that not all of the contracts were awarded to iHealth Labs Inc (in fact, the Defense Department announced on Jan. 14 two contacts for two domestic companies to produce the COVID tests), and explained the administration was forced to look to international manufactures because the U.S. does not have adequate manufacturing capacity stateside.

The statement said:

We are procuring as many US-made at-home tests as are available to purchase, while also purchasing additional, FDA authorized at-home tests that are made in other parts of the world. Together this ensures that we are making available as many at-home tests for the American people as possible and importantly, we’re doing so in a way that ensures we are not interfering with other channels where people can get at home tests, including through their states, pharmacies and online retailers.



Importantly, every at-home test that is available to the American people has underwent a rigorous FDA approval process guaranteeing that it is of the highest quality.

Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was confronted over a damning Vanity Fair report that alleged the Biden administration rejected a plan in October that sought to mass-produce and mass-distribute at-home COVID tests before the holiday season. When confronted, Psaki said the administration rejected the plan because of lagging manufacturing capabilities.

If that was the case more than three months ago and is the case today (as proven by the Biden administration procuring Chinese-made tests), one thus wonders why the Biden administration has not worked to ensure the U.S. acquires the necessary manufacturing capabilities to meet domestic needs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-tests-made-in-china,2022-01-26
Dan Crenshaw schools Liz Warren on taxes: 'Use all the data Senator',"Democrat Sen. Liz Warren (Mass.) offered up some misleading numbers in order to advocate for her far-left wealth tax proposal, but Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw (Texas) set her straight on Twitter.

Warren offered a well-worn argument in support of raising taxes on the wealthy in a tweet Monday.

""The 99% in America paid 7.2% of their total wealth in taxes last year, while the top 0.1% paid only 3.2%. The wealthy and well-connected need to start paying their fair share,"" Warren said.



While the statistic Warren quoted was accurate, it offered a skewed view of who actually takes on most of the tax burden.

Crenshaw offered the other side of the argument.

""Very weak argument, Senator. Facts: The top 1% pay about 40% of total federal revenue,"" Crenshaw responded.

""The bottom 50% of earners pay about 3% of total federal revenue. Use all the data Senator. It will make you better informed,"" he added.



Warren's intellectual sleight of hand involved calculating the rates according to the wealth of each group and not the income of each group, which is how taxes are collected.

A chart from the Heritage Foundation offered further clarification on how progressive the tax system already is in the U.S.

Image Source: Heritage Foundation website screenshot

According to figures from the Internal Revenue Service, the top 1% garnered 21% of all income earned, but paid 40% of all income taxes.



Similarly, the top 5% garnered 37% of all income earned, but they paid 60% of all of the income taxes.

Some economists warn that the kind of wealth tax scheme proposed by Warren and other Democrats would harm the economy and hurt those they intend to help the most.

"Criticism mounts ahead of full implementation of Illinois 'anti-police bill,' which keep criminals and perverts on the streets","On Tuesday, after a weekend in which over 50 people were shot in Chicago, Republican candidate for Illinois governor Darren Bailey suggested that things in the state were about to get much worse.

Bailey, currently an Illinois state senator, held a press conference in Springfield with county sheriffs from around the state. He pointed out that the so-called SAFE-T (""Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today"") Act, which largely goes into effect on January 1, 2023, has already proven counter-productive and in full force will exacerbate conditions in cities like Chicago, which Bailey has previously characterized as a ""hellhole.""

The SAFE-T Act, signed into law by Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker on January 22, 2021, abolishes cash bail, prevents police from detaining a suspect on the basis of a risk assessment, and gives felons sentenced to home detention far greater latitude.

Ed Wojcicki, the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police executive director, called it an ""anti-police bill.""

While potentially making it easier for some criminals to stay out of jail, the law also imposes a host of restrictions and unprecedented requirements on police officers, including:

creating a statewide decertification process for officers;

enabling people to anonymously file complaints against officers;

enabling investigations into anonymously sourced complaints;

enabling complaint filings against officers without sworn affidavits or other legal documentation;

removing requirements that officers under investigation must be informed of either the name of the complainant or the person in charge of the investigation;

preventing police officers from reviewing body camera footage before writing a report about the incident;

requiring officers to intervene if other officers use unauthorized or excessive force; and

requiring that officers must issue a citation rather than arrest for traffic offenses, Class B and C criminal misdemeanor offenses, or petty and business offenses.

The state's attorneys for Vermilion County, Kendall County, Shelby County, and Madison County all argued in a March op-ed that this legislation poses ""a serious threat to public safety — specifically, to victims and witnesses of violent crimes in our community."" They argued that notwithstanding numerous amendments and changes made to the act, the end result still ""contained various reactionary requirements inconsistent with long-standing and sound jurisprudence of our country and state.""

The attorneys noted that one of the many problems created by the law will be that ""violent offenders who are released on electronic monitoring and choose to violate the terms of their release have to be in violation for 48 hours before law enforcement can do anything about it."" So, for instance, an abuser on electronic monitoring can hunt down the person he was initially charged for abusing before police can even respond to indicators that he has broken the terms of his house arrest.

Jamie Mosser, state's attorney for Kane County, noted that the language surrounding pretrial release ""prevents Judges from holding an offender with multiple DUI's, drug dealers, and people who illegally possess or shoot guns when we can't identify a threat to a person or persons.""

The Lake County News Sun reported that in order to detain persons charged with a crime before a trial, the state's attorney must file a petition to detain with the presiding judge. The judge would subsequently determine whether the person was a threat or a flight risk. With cash bail gone, if the judge decides a person is a risk of some sort, no amount of cash bond will free him. However, to Mosser's point, if a threat cannot be properly established, it is possible that violent offenders will be set free.

Springboard detentions and new strictures on police are not the bill's only perceived pitfalls. It will now be harder for police to arrests a variety of offenders.

According the ILACP, if a pervert was peeking into your bedroom window and you called the police, police would not ultimately be able to physically remove that person. They could only issue the person a citation.

In a media briefing held by a bipartisan group of Illinois state's attorneys on April 26, another state's attorney suggested that with the full implementation of the SAFE-T Act, ""our hands will be tied. What sane citizen in this state of Illinois would want the state's attorney's hands tied, the police hands tied, [with] all the perks going to violent offenders?""

Will County state’s attorney Jim Glasgow said in July that the law's full implementation will result in ""the end of days.""



Illinois state Senator Darren Bailey has vowed to restore the death penalty ⁠— abolished by Illinois 11 years ago ⁠— for those who murder cops. Bailey, endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago and Illinois, also set himself up as the spoiler for the ""Three Musketeers of crime, chaos, and tragedy,"" a trio he suggested was composed of Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, and the George Soros-backed Kim Foxx, state's attorney for Cook County.

In addition to those members of law enforcement who are supporting Bailey, he suggested people across the state are similarly ""fed up and they're ... going to rise up and make their voices known.""

Pritzker spokesperson Natalie Edelstein accused Bailey of ""fearmongering and playing footsie with insurrectionists.""

Bailey suggested Illinoisans are already fearful and have every right to be. ""Illinois violent crime has risen since JB took office and remains above the national average. Illinois has had more than 1,000 homicides in 2020, setting a multi-decade high. Chicago's murder count went up 60 percent since JB's first year in office.""

The likelihood of becoming a victim of a violent crime is 1 in 103 in Lightfoot's Chicago and 1 in 239 in Illinois.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/criticism-mounts-ahead-of-implementation-of-illinois-anti-police-bill,2022-09-07
A book included in NYC schools blames racism on white people,"A new book being distributed throughout New York City schools teaches children as young as 2-years-old blames racism and the concept of race on white people.

The New York Post reported that the book “Our Skin,” which was written by Harlem activist Megan Madison and Brooklynite library worker Jessica Ralli, teaches children that the concept of race was created by white people who claimed they were “better, smarter, prettier, and that they deserve more than everybody else.”

The book begins with a discussion of skin tones and then shows an illustration of human skulls encased in glass, sitting on shelves along with an elaborate theory that blames white people for creating the concept of race.

The book states, “A long time ago, way before you were born, a group of white people made up an idea called race. They sorted people by skin color and said that white people were better, smarter, prettier, and that they deserve more than everybody else.”

The book goes on to say “That isn’t true or fair at all” while showing an illustration of a “Caucasian” man holding up the “most beautiful skull.”

The book is written for children ages 2 to 5. It has been distributed to at least one kindergarten on Staten Island, a primary school in Brooklyn, and it appears to be included in New York City’s Department of Education’s new “Universal Mosaic Curriculum.”

The “Universal Mosaic Curriculum” was announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio as a way to standardize instructional materials and “better reflect” the school system’s demographics. The curriculum is expected to begin in 2023.

The book is reportedly on a list of suggested reading that parents can access online and is part of the “Universal Mosaic Independent Reading Collections” for kindergartners created by the DOE’s Library Services.

Vito LaBella, a parent leader in Brooklyn, called the book “inflammatory.”

Referring to a page in the book that showed people being sorted by their skin tone, he said, “That page alone in my mind is just preaching hate.”

LaBella said that at least one school in southwest Brooklyn’s District 20, where he serves on the Community Education Council, received copies of “Our Skin.” Reportedly, the principal had been informed by another school administrator that the books would be coming and that they should be delivered to kindergarten classrooms.

LaBella said, “There were no instructions or curriculum guide with [the books].”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crt-schools-racism-curriculum,2022-05-07
Cruz sends message to woke CEOs: Better hope Democrats take your calls. Republicans are done with you.,"Following passage of Georgia's new voting law, multiple CEOs of major American companies tripped over themselves to condemn the law when America's far-left woke brigade came showed up with torches and pitchforks and threatened to blacklist them if they didn't do more to condemn the law.

CBS News even got in on the act with a ""news"" story headlined ""3 ways companies can help fight Georgia's restrictive new voting law.""

And their efforts worked. For example:

Delta CEO Ed Bastian quickly toed the line when informed by the left that his initial statement on the bill wasn't acerbic enough and issued a condemnation falsely stating that the law ""could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and Brown communities, to exercise their right to vote.""

Major League Baseball pulled the All-Star Game out of Atlanta following pressure from corporate sponsors and the government — including President Joe Biden — and announced the game would take place in Colorado, which has voter ID laws similar to the new Georgia law.

Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey caved to the mob and joined the chorus of lies about the Georgia law, saying it ""would diminish or deter access to voting.""

More than 60 other executives from other businesses have come out to publicly blast the law, the Hill reported. Those companies include American Express, HP, Nordstrom, MasterCard, Starbucks, Verizon, Uber, Pfizer, Google, GE, Merck, Bank of America, and Boeing.

Nearly 200 companies have signed a statement denouncing other Georgia-style voting laws ""threatening to make voting more difficult"" that are being debated across the country, the Washington Post said.

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said this week that it's time the GOP stand up to woke CEOs.

Cruz took to the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal on Thursday to inform those CEOs that Republicans are done with them and wished them luck when taxes and regulations start to bury them and they have to knock on Democrats' doors for help.

The senator began his piece, ""Your Woke Money Is No Good Here,"" blasting the businessmen for clearly not reading the Georgia law and instead relying on crib notes from left-wing activists:

Had these watch-me-woke-it-up CEOs actually read the bill—instead of parroting the radical left's talking points—they'd have discovered they had no idea what they were talking about. A clutch of business leaders tried to win woke Twitter points and clowned themselves instead.

Cruz then said it's time for Republicans to stop ignoring these outrages from CEOs simply because they are ""job creators"" and to instead strike back. It's past time to put these ""fair-weather friends"" in their place:

This time, we won't look the other way on Coca-Cola's $12 billion in back taxes owed. This time, when Major League Baseball lobbies to preserve its multibillion-dollar antitrust exception, we'll say no thank you. This time, when Boeing asks for billions in corporate welfare, we'll simply let the Export-Import Bank expire.



For too long, woke CEOs have been fair-weather friends to the Republican Party: They like us until the left's digital pitchforks come out. Then they run away. Or they mouth off on legislation they don't understand—and hurt the reputations of patriotic leaders protecting our elections and expanding the right to vote. Enough is enough. Corporations that flagrantly misrepresent efforts to protect our elections need to be called out, singled out and cut off.

The lawmaker, who admitted that he had received $2.6 million in corporate PAC contributions, said that from now on he's taking no more of their money. Liberal CEOs and companies have spent years, along with their left-wing pals, attacking GOP values without paying a price.

That time is over, Cruz declared.

""As America's greatest basketball player observed years ago, Republicans buy sneakers, too. We cast votes, too,"" Cruz warned. ""And we pay attention when CEOs come after our own just so they can look good for a few editorial pages and radical activists.""

""To them I say: When the time comes that you need help with a tax break or a regulatory change, I hope the Democrats take your calls, because we may not. Starting today, we won't take your money either,"" he concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cruz-message-for-woke-ceos,2021-04-29
Sen. Cruz pressures NCAA president on threats to states that pass fairness in women's sports laws,"NCAA President Mark Emmert on Wednesday faced questions from Sen. Ted Cruz over his organization's policy on transgender athletes and fairness in women's sports.

Emmert appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee to testify as an expert witness during a hearing on college athlete compensation. But when it was Cruz's turn to ask questions, the senator from Texas pressured the NCAA president on transgender issues and his organization's threat to punish states that pass laws that prohibit male athletes who identify as transgender from competing in women's sports.

""I am concerned about just how political the NCAA has gotten on the question of transgender athletes,"" Cruz said.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association has threatened to pull championship collegiate games from states that enact laws barring transgender athletes from playing on teams associated with their self-declared gender identity.

In a statement issued in April, the organization announced it ""firmly and unequivocally supports the opportunity for transgender student-athletes to compete in college sports"" and that ""when determining where championships are held, NCAA policy directs that only locations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination should be selected.""

""That was a not remotely subtle threat for the NCAA to target and boycott any states where legislatures are acting to protect girls sports and women's sports,"" charged Cruz.

""Now, it used to not be controversial to observe that there are biological differences between boys and girls, and when it comes to athletics, there are, can be significant physical advantages for those who are born biologically male in terms of strength and size. And that's why we have girls sports and boys sports and men's sports and women's sports in organized athletics. And the science continues to demonstrate that,"" Cruz continued.

""Why does the NCAA think it is fair to girls or to women competing in sports to expect them to compete against individuals who were born biologically male? And is the NCAA concerned about some of the results we're seeing, for example, Connecticut high school track where biological males are setting record after record after record in girls track and winning the championships,"" he asked.

""Is that fair to the girls and to the women who had been competing in the sports?""



""Senator, first of all, as you point out, this is a very challenging issues and the member schools of the association have worked very hard to try and not make it a political issue,"" Emmert replied, noting that the NCAA has attempted to align ""as closely as possible"" with what the USA and International Olympics policy is.

He explained that to strike a ""balance"" between what is ""inclusive"" and what is ""fair,"" ""student athletes in NCAA competition who are transgendered women, for example, are allowed to compete but only after they've been under a doctor's care for no less than a year and have had testosterone suppression treatments that have lowered their testosterone levels to be functional equivalent of a woman.""

Emmert added that in the example Cruz cited, the transgender athletes in question ""would not have been allowed to compete in NCAA championships.""

""We've been constantly trying to stay abreast of the science and make sure that we're striking a balance where we don't put women athletes at a disadvantage while still trying to provide an inclusive environment,"" Emmert said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cruz-pressures-ncaa-president-on-threats-to-states-that-pass-fairness-in-womens-sports-laws,2021-06-09
Cruz rips Biden for hypocrisy on media blackout of border,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is pressuring President Joe Biden to be more transparent with the media about the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The White House faces criticism from reporters for restricting media access to Customs and Border Protection facilities that are housing thousands of unaccompanied migrant children. Last week, when Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas led a bipartisan delegation of lawmakers to tour the U.S. border, reporters were barred from covering their tour due to ""privacy and COVID-19 restrictions.""

More than 15,000 migrant children have been detained by the federal government, but the ""crowded, makeshift conditions"" these children were kept in were not reported until Monday when Axios obtained exclusive photos of kids being kept in cage-like ""pods.""

In a letter to the president, Sen. Cruz said it was ""outrageous and hypocritical"" of Biden to bar reporters from access to the situation at the border.

""As part of our oversight duties as Senators, I and 14 of my colleagues will travel to the border this week to talk to the brave men and women on the ground who are working every today [sic] to stop this crisis and secure our border,"" Cruz wrote.

""But it is not enough for members of the Senate to see what is happening — the American people must see. That is why I requested that members of the media be allowed to join us. But your administration clearly and emphatically refused to offer press access. This is outrageous and hypocritical.""

Cruz chastised the president's administration for pledging ""truth and transparency"" and now breaking that promise.

Cruz wrote:

At the beginning of your administration, Press Secretary Jen Psaki stressed the importance of ""truth and transparency"" and a ""deep respect for the role of a free and independent press."" At the beginning of the month, Secretary Mayorkas stated that he would adhere to principles of ""openness and transparency."" But now, when your administration faces a crisis of your own making, you are refusing to allow the very transparency you promised and that you demanded from prior administrations.



Denying the press the ability to observe, film, and report on the conditions at the border is not openness or transparency-it is hiding the truth from the American people. The press and the American people deserve more than denials and excuses from a podium. They deserve to see and understand the crisis for themselves with the help of reporters who are free and independent from your administration.

On Friday, Sens. Cruz and John Cornyn (R-Texas) will lead a delegation of 14 lawmakers to tour the Rio Grande Valley. Cruz said it's ""unacceptable"" that the Biden administration will not permit reporters to join them.

""I call on you to reverse this decision immediately and commit to allowing free and fair reporting on the crisis at the border,"" Cruz said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cruz-rips-biden-hypocrisy-media-blackout-border,2021-03-22
Defiant Cuomo denies AG report finding he sexually harassed numerous women as Democrats demand his resignation or impeachment,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) maintains that did not make sexual advances toward or touch anyone inappropriately, denying a report from the state attorney general's office that concluded he violated federal and state laws by sexually harassing multiple women.

""The facts are much different than what has been portrayed,"" Cuomo said in a pre-recorded video released Tuesday after Attorney General Letitia James announced the findings of the independent probe into the governor's behavior.

""I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances,"" a defiant Cuomo said.

Hours earlier, James held a news conference announcing the findings of an independent investigation tasked with reviewing claims by multiple women that Cuomo made inappropriate sexual comments toward them or touched them in a sexual manner without their consent.



""The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,"" the attorney general said. ""Specifically, the investigation found that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed current and former New York State employees by engaging in unwelcome and nonconsensual touching and making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women.""

A 165-page report published by the attorney general's office stated that Cuomo created an office environment ""filled with fear and intimidation"" and that he had threatened at least one of the women who had publicly complained about his behavior. Several of the witnesses interviewed by investigators were hesitant to provide negative information about the governor for fear of ""harm and retribution,"" acknowledging that Cuomo is known to have a ""vindictive"" nature.

The report detailed the allegations against Cuomo made by numerous women. Former Cuomo aide Charlotte Bennett alleges that during conversations she had with the governor in 2020, Cuomo asked her a series of inappropriate questions she interpreted as sexual advances. Bennett, who had told Cuomo she was a survivor of sexual assault, says the governor asked her about her dating life, whether she had been with older men, and if she was monogamous. She alleges that Cuomo also told her he'd be willing to date someone who was as young as 22 (he knew she was 25 at the time) and during the pandemic told her he was ""lonely"" and ""wanted to be touched.""

Responding to the allegations, Cuomo apologized to Bennett for making her feel uncomfortable and claimed that he was trying to help her recover from the trauma of sexual assault with his questions.

""I did ask her how she was doing and how she was feeling. And I did ask questions to try to see if she had positive support of dating relationships,"" Cuomo said.

He claimed that a family member close to Bennett's age is also a sexual assault survivor and that he thought his personal experience with this person's trauma would enable him to comfort Bennett.

""I was trying to make sure she was working her way through it the best she could,"" the governor said.



""I have heard Charlotte and her lawyer and I understand what they are saying. But they read into comments that I made and draw inferences that I never meant. They ascribe motives I never had. And, simply put, they heard things that I just didn't say,"" he asserted.

""I was trying to help, obviously I didn't.""

Cuomo also responded directly to an anonymous accuser who says he reached under her blouse and groped her breast in the Executive Mansion in November 2020. This accuser alleged that Cuomo engaged in a pattern of inappropriate conduct that included close and intimate hugs, kisses on the cheeks, forehead, and at least once on the lips, touching her butt during hugs, and inappropriate comments about her personal life and relationships.

""Let me be clear. That never happened,"" Cuomo said. ""She wants anonymity, and I respect that, so I am limited by what I can say. But her lawyer has suggested that she will file a legal claim for damages. That will be decided in a court of law. Trial by newspaper or biased reviews are not the way to find the facts in this matter. I welcome the opportunity for a full and fair review before a judge and a jury because this just did not happen.""

Regarding other accusations of inappropriate or nonconsensual touching, Cuomo attributed his behavior to his Italian heritage, ""generational"" and ""cultural"" differences that he learned from ""my mother and from my father."" His video includes a montage of him hugging and kissing people of all ages and sexes, which he used to insist that he treats everyone like so and did not intend to sexually harass anybody.

""I do kiss people on the forehead. I do kiss people on the cheek. I do kiss people on the hand. I do embrace people. I do hug people. Men and women,"" Cuomo said.

""I now understand that there are generational or cultural perspectives that, frankly, I hadn't fully appreciated,"" he said.

The governor also said he's hired an independent consultant to design a new sexual harassment policy for his office and that he and other employees would receive additional sexual harassment training.



Attorney General James described Cuomo's office as a ""toxic workplace"" for women. Responding, Cuomo acknowledged that his office is ""a demanding place to work."" But then he said complaints filed against female managers in his office smacked ""of a double standard,"" indicating these complaints were ""sexist.""

Cuomo concluded the video by chastising his political opponents for purportedly using the numerous, credible sexual harassment allegations against him to ""score political points.""

""At the end of the day we get good things done for people and that is what really matters,"" the governor said. ""And for those who are using this moment to score political points or seek publicity or personal gain, I say they actually discredit the legitimate sexual harassment victims.""

Despite Cuomo's protestations of innocence, various Democratic officials in the state of New York renewed calls for him to resign, though the governor has shown no inclination towards doing so.

""Andrew Cuomo committed sexual assault and sexual harassment, and intimidated a whistleblower. It is disqualifying. It is beyond clear that Andrew Cuomo is not fit to hold office and can no longer serve as Governor. He must resign, and if he continues to resist and attack the investigators who did their jobs, he should be impeached immediately,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has often feuded with the governor, said.

New York Democratic U.S. Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand released a joint statement calling the accusations against Cuomo ""profoundly disturbing, inappropriate and completely unacceptable.""

""The New York State Attorney General has conducted an independent, thorough and professional investigation that found the Governor violated state and federal law, had a pattern of sexually harassing current and former employees, retaliated against at least one of the accusers and created a hostile work environment,"" the senators said.

""No elected official is above the law. The people of New York deserve better leadership in the governor's office. We continue to believe that the Governor should resign.""

Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democratic state lawmaker who has led calls for impeaching Cuomo over his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing homes, said the attorney general's report shows the governor is ""wholly unfit to serve and must be removed from office immediately.""

Kim claimed in February that Cuomo had attempted to intimidate and bully him for criticizing how the governor underreported COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.

""Today's report from Attorney General Letitia James confirms what we have long suspected: Governor Cuomo used his office to sexually assault, harass, intimidate, and humiliate his employees. He is wholly unfit to serve and must be removed from office immediately. There is no measure left to hide this truth: the governor broke the law so we must hold him accountable,"" Kim said.

""We must return to session immediately and begin the impeachment proceedings.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cuomo-denies-ag-report-sexually-harassed-women,2021-08-03
Cuomo aide admits they hid nursing home data after Trump pressured them on Twitter,"An aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo admitted that they hid nursing home data on the coronavirus infections after former President Donald Trump began pressuring them on Twitter.

Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor, apologized to state Democratic leaders about the cover-up in a video conference call, according to a two-hour recording reviewed by the New York Post.

DeRosa also appeared to pass the blame onto Trump by claiming that they were scared by his tweets.

""[R]ight around the same time, [then-President Donald Trump] turns this into a giant political football,"" she said on the recording.

""He starts tweeting that we killed everyone in nursing homes,"" DeRosa continued. ""He starts going after [New Jersey Gov. Phil] Murphy, starts going after [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom, starts going after [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer.""

""And basically, we froze,"" she said.

DeRosa said that Trump directing the Department of Justice to look into the matter forced them to hide the numbers.

""Because then we were in a position where we weren't sure if what we were going to give to the Department of Justice, or what we give to you guys, what we start saying, was going to be used against us while we weren't sure if there was going to be an investigation,"" she added.

DeRosa apologized, not to the families of the thousands of people who died of the coronavirus in nursing homes, but to the state's Democrats for the political inconvenience of their cover-up.

""So we do apologize,"" she said. ""I do understand the position that you were put in. I know that it is not fair. It was not our intention to put you in that political position with the Republicans.""

A spokesperson for Cuomo's office released a statement about the report:

We explained that the Trump administration was in the midst of a politically motivated effort to blame democratic states for COVID deaths and that we were cooperating with Federal document productions and that was the priority and now that it is over we can address the state legislature.



That said, we were working simultaneously to complete the audit of information they were asking for.

The bombshell dropped on the same day as a damaging report by the Associated Press that documented how the New York state health department underreported the true numbers of coronavirus patients sent to nursing homes under Cuomo's order.

"DA Brooke Jenkins won't turn over illegal alien who allegedly attacked Pelosi's husband to ICE, claiming San Francisco is a 'sanctuary city'","The very policy House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long supported may ultimately be the same that keeps her husband's alleged attacker in the country. District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she won't turn over Canadian national David DePape to federal authorities for deportation, citing San Francisco's sanctuary city status.

What are the details?

After having already lived in the U.S. for several years, David DePape — the illegal alien who allegedly attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer — reportedly entered the U.S. again through the San Ysidro, California, point of entry on March 8, 2008, as a temporary visitor. There was nothing temporary about his visit.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, DePape registered as a member of the Green Party, unlawfully declaring that he was a U.S. citizen. He subsequently partook in liberal politics and advocated for public nudity.

After nearly 20 years of feigning American citizenship, DePape allegedly attacked Paul Pelosi on Oct. 28.

DePape was arrested and sent to San Francisco County Jail without bail. He now faces charges of elder abuse, attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, and burglary. The illegal alien also faces federal assault and kidnapping charges.

On Nov. 1, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lodged an immigration detainer on DePape. Accordingly, San Francisco law enforcement is asked to notify ICE prior to DePape's release so that the agency can take custody and then possibly eject the illegal alien once his case is resolved.

Ira Mehlman, media director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, suggested that the ""mere issuance of a detainer request for DePape smacks of disparate – shall we say, inequitable – treatment because of the political connections of the victim.""

""Would ICE have bothered to ask San Francisco to detain a criminal illegal alien, if the victim had been Paul Smith or Paul Jones, instead of Paul Pelosi?"" asked Mehlman.

Though possibly ""inequitable,"" the detainer request may not ultimately matter, because Jenkins flat-out rejected it.

Illegal alien privileges

On Nov. 4, Jenkins issued a statement, saying, ""San Francisco is a sanctuary city and our policy is sacred. ... We will not be collaborating or coordinating with ICE.""

The San Francisco Administrative Code states that the ""City and County of San Francisco is a City and County of Refuge.""

According to the city ordinance, no city or county department, agency, commission, officer, or employee ""shall use any City funds or resources to assist in the enforcement of Federal immigration law or to gather or disseminate information regarding release status of individuals or any other such personal information.""

The ordinance does offer an exception to the rule, however, that is relevant in light of DePape's federal charges. Assistance can be given if ""required by Federal or State statute, regulation, or court decision.""

KTVU reported that the San Francisco sheriff's office wouldn't say whether the sanctuary status would be waived in DePape's case.

According to Kelvin Wu, a spokesman for the SFSO, the sheriff ""reviews ICE requests on a case-by-case basis to determine whether informing ICE of Mr. DePape's release date, if any, is consistent with our local sanctuary city ordinances.""

Since DePape is being held without bail and faces life in prison, Jenkins claimed that deportation discussions ""are moot.""

Sanctuary cities 'make us safer'

In 2017, Nancy Pelosi told a crowd, including a woman whose son was brutally murdered by an illegal alien, that ""sanctuary cities make us safer.""

Pelosi Claims Sanctuary Cities Make America A Safer Place youtu.be

According to FAIR, as of 2021, there were approximately 3,266,000 illegal aliens living in California. The state, like San Francisco and other Democrat-run cities, has been a so-called ""sanctuary"" for illegal aliens since Jan. 1, 2018.



So far in 2022, 1,142 illegals have been criminally convicted for assault, battery, or domestic violence; 62 for murder or manslaughter; 365 for sexual offenses; and 2,891 for a litany of other crimes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/da-brooke-jenkins-wont-turn-over-illegal-alien-who-allegedly-attacked-pelosis-husband-to-ice-claiming-san-francisco-is-a-sanctuary-city,2022-11-08
'She's 13. Stop this': Top Dallas newspaper ripped for 'utterly classless' story on Ted Cruz's teenage daughter,"The Dallas Morning News was sharply criticized after amplifying a tabloid-like story about the 13-year-old daughter of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), which seemingly attempted to pit the young teenager against her father by highlighting differences in political opinion.

What are the details?

The Dallas Morning News published a story last Thursday claiming Cruz found himself in a ""predicament"" last week, which the story identified as ""an outspoken teenage daughter with a TikTok account.""

The newspaper published its story to Twitter with a headline that read, ""Ted Cruz's daughter says she disagrees with 'most of his views.'"" The story, however, did not explain where that assertion derived.

However, the story explained that the Dallas Observer first reported on the existence of the TikTok account. That story revealed the tidbit about the alleged political views of Cruz's daughter.

In a recent video posted to TikTok, Cruz’s teenage daughter Caroline tells her followers about the pros and cons of being a senator’s kid. On the plus side, she says, she gets to travel and sometimes receives gifts and candy in the mail. Downsides include the fact that security has to shadow her wherever she goes, such as on walks through the neighborhood and to her friends’ houses.



Next, Caroline reveals another, more surprising tidbit. “A lot of people judge me based upon him at first glance,” Caroline said, “but I really disagree with most of his views.”

What was the reaction?

The Dallas Morning News was promptly blasted for amplifying a story centering on the teenage child of a U.S. lawmaker. Stories on minor children are widely considered beyond the limit of ethical journalism.

""I cannot imagine any reason why media outlets would write a story about a politician’s 13 year old child—especially when it pits child against parent for political purposes. (See also: George and Kellyanne Conway’s minor daughter). It seems ghoulish,"" MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said.

""She’s 13. Stop this,"" Meghan McCain said.

""Public officials are fair game. Our children are not,"" Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) said.

""Dumb & divisive. The notion that it’s news when someone’s views differ from their parents’ is bizarre. I’m a 32 yr old autonomous person w/a decade+ career in politics & some reporters still refuse to accept my views cd possibly differ from my father’s. Lol (it’s also sexist),"" CNN commentator Alyssa Farah Griffen responded.

""This is gross. The reporters who wrote this crap and their editor should be fired,"" media strategist Giancarlo Sopo reacted.

""Children should be off limits. Social media doesn’t change that. It just makes it more important for us to be the adults,"" political commentator Sarah Isgur said.

""Has the @dallasnews put any time or resources into pursuing any of the myriad criminal scandals surrounding Hunter Biden? Or is it just disagreements between a teenage girl and her senator dad they care about?"" radio host Larry O'Connor reacted.

""What a 13-year-old says about her dad on TikTok — in an account that had been made private prior to publishing this story — is not newsworthy, absent some extraordinary revelation. And I say this as someone who despises him,"" former Obama administration official Eric Columbus said.

""What a 13-year-old says about her dad on TikTok — in an account that had been made private prior to publishing this story — is not newsworthy, absent some extraordinary revelation.

'Two faced' Dan Rather rips Republicans for 'vulgarity' of 'Let's Go Brandon' chant; gives Democrats a pass for shouting 'F*** Donald Trump' from the rooftops,"It may not be accurate any more to define Dan Rather as a leftist in journalist's clothing since the ex-CBS News anchor — who turned in his notepad in disgrace after infamously using unverified documents in a 2004 report on then-President George W. Bush's National Guard service — seemingly has shuffled offall semblanceof non-bias.

What now?

With the rise of the ""Let's Go Brandon"" chant as a comical way of raining down F-bomb criticism on President Joe Biden without actually using profanity, Rather apparently couldn't take the insult any more.

At the moment, leftist keyboard warriors are foaming at the mouth as they call for the head of a Southwest pilot who dared utter the phrase at the end of a flight — and Rather penned with co-author Elliot Kirschner a Substack essay titled ""A Party Embraces Vulgarity.""

The shamelessly partisan piece asserts that the ""Let's Go Brandon"" phrase is ""about much more than political passion or anger. It's about weaponizing the vulgar dehumanization of our entire democratic — small d — experiment."" Wow. Who knew?

He then leaps to Biden's defense, saying he's ""not only a person; he is the President of the United States, whether your tinfoil-shrouded conspiracy brain cares to recognize that fact or not. How many times have we heard Republicans sanctimoniously preach about how Democrats don't 'respect' the office of the presidency for such things as President Obama not saluting properly or wearing a tan suit?""

At this point all fair-minded readers — even if they despise former President Donald Trump — are wondering how Rather will handle the years of profanity-rich anger aimed at Trump by celebrities and everyday folks alike.

Well, allow ol' Dan to oblige:

To be sure, many Democrats have said some form of ""F- Donald Trump."" There was even a rap song to that effect. We all have a right to free speech. But when Republican elected representatives say ""Let's go Brandon"" to end a speech on the House floor, like Bill Posey, a Republican from Florida did, or wear a ""Let's go Brandon"" facemask, like South Carolina Republican Jeff Duncan did, or when Ted Cruz can't get enough of it, something else is going on. This is a movement that has engulfed the party, and party leaders think they can use it to effectively rally their voters. The sad truth is that they are likely right.

Did you catch Rather's one-sentence defense of Democrats who did the same thing Biden-haters are doing now? ""We all have a right to free speech."" That's it. That's the quote.

Rather fails to mention that John Burton, former chairman of the California Democratic Party, in 2017 ended his term in office by sticking up both middle fingers and saying, ""F*** Donald Trump"" — to smiles, cheers, and laughter.

Content warning: Profanity:

He also fails to mention the infamous words of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) on her first day in office in 2019: ""We're gonna impeach the motherf***er!""

Oh well.

But Rather isn't done demonizing the GOP:

The hypocrisy is stunning. This is the political party that had a Republican candidate for governor of Virginia run an ad featuring a mother (who just happens to be a Republican activist) talk about how her son's apparently innocent sensibilities were offended when he was assigned Toni Morrison's classic novel Beloved in his high school's AP English class. Learning about the horrors of slavery and the Black experience in America? No, we have to protect our youth from that. But having your six your [sic] old hear grown men and women use one of the vilest words in the English language to attack the president at a sporting event? That's apparently patriotic free speech. And a hoot at that.

Rather then says the ""Let's Go Brandon"" chant ""perfectly encapsulates the rot and unseriousness of the Republican party — like the smart-alec in the classroom who adds nothing but juvenile taunts and distractions. And let's be honest, it isn't just this chant. Go back to the T-shirts sold at Trump rallies in 2016 and what they said about Hillary Clinton, or for that matter the merchandise showcased at Trump rallies today.""

He also refers to the ""Let's Go Brandon"" chant as ""grotesque"" and to Trump — and his base — as ""fueled by bigotry, misogyny, sanctimony, privilege, unseriousness, flippancy, and ignorance.""

A little experiment

Rather's piece concludes with a paragraph one might argue is sufficiently tone-deaf to allow readers to easily replace ""Donald Trump"" with ""Joe Biden"" in the first sentence and ""Let's go Brandon?"" with ""F*** Donald Trump?"" in the second-to-last sentence, and making it all ring just a little bit truer:

""This is Donald Trump allowing the basest of human instincts to triumph over reason,"" the paragraph reads. ""It is a party that marches, in almost lockstep, under a banner of misplaced victimhood, of vilifying those who are different, of denying the truth, and having the chutzpah — fueled by privilege — to announce a hateful ignorance to the world with raw vulgarity, or the meekest fig leaf of innuendo. Let's go Brandon? How about let's go America?""

How are folks reacting?

It appears those who regularly read Rather's writing on Substack and on social media are more or less in love with the leftist pundit — and they indeed love his latest shot across the bow.

But others took to Twitter to call out Rather for leaving out inconvenient facts that underscore his own hypocrisy:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dan-rather-republicans-vulgarity-lets-go-brandon,2021-11-01
CNN host grills Adam Schiff over motive for not hearing from witnesses who 'challenge' Jan. 6 narrative,"CNN host Dana Bash grilled Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Sunday over why the House Jan. 6 committee is not hearing from witnesses who counter the committee narrative about the United States Capitol riot and former President Donald Trump.

What happened?

At the end of Schiff's interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Bash observed that every public witness the Jan. 6 committee has called thus far only confirmed the committee's narrative.

""Why aren't you calling witnesses in a public way who might challenge the committee?"" Bash asked. ""Is that intentional, because you don't want to deviate from the storyline that you're trying to present to the public and, of course, potentially to the Justice Department?""

Schiff denied that it is ""intentional"" and claimed the committee is willing to hear from any witness who possess ""relevant evidence."" But he did not state whether the committee has, in fact, heard from any witness who challenged their narrative.

""So, like, why not subpoena Mike Pence, for example?"" Bash pressed in response. ""I know you asked him to testify voluntarily. That didn't happen.""

The Jan. 6 committee is not ""taking anything off the table,"" Schiff responded, ""in terms of witnesses who have not yet testified."" He claimed there are several ""high-profile"" people whom the committee would like to speak with, but declined to identify them and whether they would offer testimony challenging the committee's narrative.

In the end, Schiff admitted that former Vice President Mike Pence is ""certainly a possibility.""

Hear what Schiff wants to know from Ginni Thomas youtu.be

Bash's line of questioning highlighted a problem that former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy brought attention to last week, namely that the committee is conducting its public hearings in a manner akin to a kangaroo court.

As I've said from the beginning, they've got a very good story to tell. The problem is, they've set it up in a process that is not a fair process that's aimed at getting to the truth and giving whatever contra arguments there are on their day in court.



And as a result, it's more like messaging than it is like a real investigation. And if you would try this in court, you know, I could have been very impressive in court if there were no defense lawyers, you know. Like the government put on its own case, own witnesses, own exhibits, and then no cross-examination and no defense arguments. I'd have been 1000 - 0.

Anything else?

Earlier in the interview, Bash grilled Schiff after he claimed the Jan. 6 committee has evidence Trump was involved in a scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

Schiff claimed the committee ""will show evidence of the president's involvement in this scheme."" But when Bashed repeatedly asked whether the committee has evidence showing that Trump directed it — asking, in fact, three times — Schiff repeatedly dodged the question.

""I don't want to get ahead of our hearing,"" Schiff said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dana-bash-grills-adam-schiff-witness-challenge-jan-6-narrative,2022-06-20
"Dashcam video captures the moment suspects swarm, beat, strangle police officer during traffic stop","Harrowing dashcam footage showed the moment a group of suspects attacked a police officer following a traffic stop, according to a Thursday report from Fox News.

What's a brief history?

In June, authorities arrested three suspects who reportedly beat and strangled an Aurora, Illinois, police officer during a Monday night traffic stop.

The incident unfolded when an unnamed officer stopped a vehicle after its operator reportedly blew through a stop sign in a residential area.

Authorities identified the driver as 28-year-old Paul Sherrod and Sherrod's passengers as 24-year-old Jennifer Taylor and 26-year-old Sheba Taylor.

Sherrod reportedly began screaming obscenities at the officer during the traffic stop, prompting the officer to demand that Sherrod exit the vehicle. Instead, one of the female passengers reportedly climbed from the vehicle and began confronting the officer.

Sherrod eventually complied with the officer's orders, but reportedly fled on foot as soon as he got out of the vehicle. The officer began pursuing Sherrod on foot, prompting the two female passengers to follow close behind.

One of the women reportedly began brutalizing the officer when she caught up with him, and when it was clear that she had the advantage over the officer, Sherrod and the second female suspect began kicking and hitting the officer with closed fists on his body and head.

One of the female suspects also reportedly placed the officer in a chokehold, cutting off his breath, while the second female allegedly pinned him to the ground.

What's in the video?

Dashcam footage shows the moment backup arrives on the scene and intervenes in the melee.

According to the outlet, the footage did not show the portion of the attack where the officer was allegedly beaten, but did show the portion in which he was dangerously pinned to the ground. The video also purportedly shows at least one of the suspects appearing to sit on the officer's head while police added that a second suspect reportedly applied significant force to the officer's windpipe.

Responding officers were deftly able to free their fellow officer from the suspects' grip and were able to quickly arrest the trio.



Authorities told local media that the female passenger's attack on the officer temporarily left him without the ""ability to breathe.""

The suspects were booked into the Kane County Jail and face a plethora of charges related to the attack and the preceding incident.

""Following an investigation into the incident, the three suspects ... were indicted by a grand jury last week and charged with attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery, and aggravated assault,"" Fox News reported.

Kane County State's Attorney Jamie Mosser added, ""Because of the strangulation and because of the research that we know about how quickly it is for somebody to lose their life as a result of somebody preventing them from being able to breathe, we believe that the property charge was attempted first-degree murder.""

The officer, who remains unnamed at the time of this reporting, is expected to recover from the attack.

All suspects are out on bond and are scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 24.

The Aurora Police Department shared the dashcam footage in a Facebook video, which the department captioned, ""Three people are now facing attempted murder charges after a Grand Jury indicted them on numerous felonies after they attacked, beat, and strangled and Aurora Police officer during the course of a traffic stop on the evening of June 21st.""

Just after 10:30 p.m. on Monday, an Aurora Police officer performed a traffic stop on a car that rolled through a stop sign. As the officer approached the vehicle, the driver began yelling obscenities out the window. The officer also observed two other passengers in the vehicle. Moments later, the rear passenger exited the vehicle. The officer ordered her back into the car several times before informing her that she was under arrest for obstructing. However, before the rear passenger was in custody, the driver also exited the vehicle, continued yelling obscenities, and started approaching the officer at the rear of the car. The driver told the officer that he would fight him if he touched the rear female passenger. The officer informed the driver that he was also under arrest for obstructing. At that moment, the driver took off running, and the officer ran after him. The two passengers also followed the officer yelling obscenities. The female rear passenger approached the officer as they ran, the officer turned around and grabbed her arm to take her into custody, but she slipped out of his grip. The two female passengers then began striking the officer with closed fists and kicking his body and head. The officer heard a male's voice and then was struck repeatedly in the head from several angles. The rear female passenger placed her forearm around the officer's neck and applied significant force to his windpipe, causing him to lose the ability to breathe. A short time later, additional officers arrived and placed the subjects into custody. Detectives from Aurora Police's Investigations Division responded to the scene, interviewed the subjects, and gathered numerous pieces of evidence. Detectives presented the case to the Kane County State's Attorney's Office and they initially authorized numerous felony charges against the three suspects. The investigation continued and on Friday, July 16th, the Kane County State's Attorney presented the facts and evidence of the case to a Grand Jury, and they indicted the three suspects on upgraded charges of attempted murder. Sheba Taylor, 26, was indicted on the following felony charges: One count of Attempted First Degree Murder (Class X) Two counts of Aggravated Battery (Class 2 Felony) Four counts of Aggravated Battery (Class 3 Felony) One count of Aggravated Assault (Class 4 Felony) One count Resisting a Peace Officer (Class 4 Felony) Jennifer Taylor, 24, was indicted on the following felony charges: One count of Attempted First Degree Murder (Class X) Two counts of Aggravated Battery (Class 2 Felony) Four counts of Aggravated Battery (Class 3 Felony) One count of Aggravated Assault (Class 4 Felony) One count Resisting a Peace Officer (Class 4 Felony) Paul Sherrod Taylor, 28, was indicted on the following felony charges: One count of Attempted First Degree Murder (Class X) Two counts of Aggravated Battery (Class 2 Felony) Four counts of Aggravated Battery (Class 3 Felony) One count of Threatening a Public Official (Class 3 Felony) One count of Aggravated Assault (Class 4 Felony) One count Resisting a Peace Officer (Class 4 Felony) The charges against the defendants are not proof of guilt. They are presumed innocent and are entitled to a fair trial in which it is the State's burden to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dashcam-video-captures-the-moment-suspects-swarm-beat-strangle-police-officer-during-traffic-stop,2021-07-22
"Dave Chappelle says movie companies, film festivals won't touch his 'Untitled' documentary due to 'The Closer' controversy. So he's screening it himself.","Comedian Dave Chappelle said movie companies and film festivals won't touch his new documentary — ""Untitled"" — about a series of outdoor Ohio shows Chappelle put together last summer at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Rolling Stone reported.

The comedian said it's all due to continuing transgender anger over his Netflix special, ""The Closer,"" in which he says ""gender is real."" The controversy has ignited protests and walkouts and calls for Chappelle's cancellation.

Therefore, Chappelle said he'll be screening his ""Untitled"" documentary himself: It will be shown next month in 10 cities, including New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Toronto.

What are the details?

Chappelle spoke about the issue during a performance he posted Monday on Instagram:

In summer 2020, when the whole world shut down, I was outside doing shows. My neighbor had a cornfield, and he let me throw shows there. And people came from all over the country; some people came from around the world to see those shows. The best comedians on earth came to my home and broke bread with me, and we lived our lives; we found a way to keep moving forward. I made a whole documentary about it. The first night of those shows was a piece that some of you might have seen; it was called ""8:46,"" and it dealt with the death — the murder — of George Floyd. This film that I made was invited to every film festival in the United States, and some of those invitations I accepted. And when this controversy came out about ""The Closer,"" they began disinviting me from these film festivals. And now, today, not a film company, not a movie studio, not a film festival — nobody will touch his film. Thank God for Ted Sarandos at Netflix; he's the only one that didn't cancel me yet.

Chappelle soon added that he ""desperately"" desires audiences to watch his documentary but ""understands[s] why investors would be nervous, and since nobody will touch it, I'll tell you what I'll do.""

With that Chappelle announced that he'll make it available for screening in 10 cities next month ""and you can see what they're trying to obstruct you from seeing."" The cities and dates are listed at the end of the Instagram video.

""And you can judge for yourself, but you cannot have this conversation and exclude my voice from it,"" he added. ""That is only fair. You have to answer the question: 'Am I canceled or not?' Thank you very much.""

Content warning: rough language

During the same Instagram video, the comedian also said he's ""not bending to anybody's demands"" but that he's ""more than willing"" to give the transgender community ""an audience"" — but it may not ""summon"" him.

Plus, Chappelle threw down three conditions.

""First of all, you cannot come if you have not watched my special from beginning to end,"" he said. ""You must come to a place of my choosing and a time of my choosing. And thirdly, you must admit that Hannah Gadsby is not funny.""

Gadsby is a comedian who lashed out at Netflix over ""The Closer"" controversy.

Anything else?

It turns out that amid all the flaming arrows directed at Chappelle of late, a transgender activist — Ashlee Marie Preston — who helped organize the Netflix walkout over ""The Closer"" reportedly has a history of tweets mocking and insulting Hispanics, Asians, and others.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher on Friday blasted the woke mob angry over Chappelle's special, asking, ""Where does this insanity come from?""

And the person who arguably received the most attention during the Netflix walkout was a Chappelle supporter who humorously stood his ground and exercised his free speech despite protesters destroying his property and trying to intimidate him.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dave-chappelle-film-festivals-untitled-documentary,2021-10-26
DC Democrats propose new sugary drink tax to address 'health inequities',"Lawmakers in the nation's capital are proposing enacting a new tax on sugary drinks, hoping that forcing consumers to pay more for products they want will deter them from consuming sugary beverages.

What are the details?

Democrat Brianne Nadeau, a member of the Washington, D.C., city council, introduced a measure Tuesday that would enact an excise tax of 1.5 cents per ounce on beverages the city government considers ""sugary drinks.""

The legislation would repeal an existing 8% sales tax on sugary drinks, which is 2% higher than the existing sales tax in Washington.

Enacting the sugary drink tax would ""begin rectifying longstanding health inequities made even more apparent by the COVID-19 pandemic.""

""One thing that COVID-19 has made abundantly clear is that we need to get serious about addressing health inequities in the District,"" Nadeau said in a press release.

Mary Cheh, a council member who sponsored the bill, told WTOP-TV, ""This excise tax would go right on the product. Thereby making it apparent to the purchaser that it is more expensive than it was.""

Additionally, the legislation seeks to address ""chronic diseases associated with the consumption of sugary drinks,"" childhood obesity related to the chronic consumption of sugary drinks, and homelessness in Washington.

The press release explains:

The legislation takes important steps toward providing equitable access to nutritious food for District residents experiencing homelessness by requiring that meals served at the District's shelters and transitional housing are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and by applying greater oversight over food service vendors. It also establishes grants to support nutrition education, cooking lessons, and gardens at family shelters and transitional housing to create healthy environments.

District lawmakers first considered the sugary drink tax in 2019, but the proposal ultimately failed.

How have similar taxes faired?

Nadeau claimed similar taxes — such as those enacted in Philadelphia or Berkeley — are evidence of their success.

However, multiple studies discovered that, while sales of sugary drinks decrease in cities that levy the per ounce excise tax, sales in neighboring municipalities simultaneously increase, indicating that residents impacted by sugary drink taxes still buy sugary drinks — they just travel to get a cheaper deal.

Philadelphia, for example, became the second U.S. city to enact a sugary drink tax in 2017. Medical journal JAMA found that sales of sugary drinks tumbled 51% during the first year of the tax, but sales increased in towns and counties adjacent to Philadelphia, at least partially offsetting the decrease in Philadelphia sales.

Research conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research came to the same conclusion.

However, the NBER also concluded that Philadelphia's sugary tax drink did not positively impact the overall health of adults or children.

""The tax did not have a substantial effect on the frequency of adults' consumption of other beverages. We generally do not find detectable effects of the tax on children's consumption of beverages,"" researchers said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-democrats-propose-new-sugary-drink-tax-to-address-health-inequalities,2021-03-31
De Blasio may be planning a congressional bid,"Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio may be planning to jump back into the political fray by mounting a bid for U.S. Congress.

""He's in, he's running – he's calling people,"" state Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein said, according to the New York Post. ""Based on the conversation that I had with him earlier today, he is running for Congress in the new NY-10 congressional district.""

""He called me earlier this afternoon. While I will keep our conversation private, I will confirm that we spoke for over 20 minutes about his decision to run for this district,"" Eichenstein said, according to the outlet.

A congressional map that had been approved by the Democratic-controlled state legislature was slapped down by the state Court of Appeals last month. A new map has been crafted by a court-appointed expert, according to the Washington Post, which indicated that state Judge Patrick F. McAllister is expected to green light district boundaries on Friday.

De Blasio mounted a presidential run in 2019 before dropping out later that same year.

After announcing in January that he would not pursue a gubernatorial bid, de Blasio announced in February that he would not run in the state's 11th Congressional District.

""I've represented the neighborhoods of the 11th CD for years and I love the people who live here. It was gratifying to connect with community and elected leaders while I considered a run. I'm certain a progressive can win this seat and serve us in Washington,"" de Blasio tweeted. ""Back in January, I made a decision to focus on advocating for policies that would continue to drive down income inequality in New York - one of my proudest achievements. I'm going to stick with that decision - it was the right one then and it remains so.""

In a piece published in the Atlantic earlier this month, de Blasio wrote, ""when it comes to being unpopular, I’m unfortunately somewhat of an expert. I made my fair share of mistakes.""

""I failed to give New Yorkers a clear sense of where I was taking them. I lost my connection with the people because I mistook real policy for real popularity. I let a focus on individual initiatives, no matter how noble or substantive, distract me from offering an overarching vision for the future,"" he wrote. ""Voters need to know both what you’re up to and why you’re up to it. You have to help them feel your efforts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/de-blasio-run-for-congress,2022-05-18
Mayor de Blasio calls for higher taxes on the wealthy but refuses to reveal exactly whom he would label as 'rich' — and seems unsure of what 'wealthy' actually means,"Democrats have a reputation for loving the idea of raising taxes — especially taxes on the well-to-do. They promote class-warfare arguments calling for the government to ""tax the rich"" and to make the wealthy ""pay their fair share.""

Naturally, far-left New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio fits into that stereotype.

This is the mayor who reminded his subjects in December that ""our mission is to redistribute wealth,"" adding that ""a lot of people bristle at that phrase, that is, in fact, the phrase we need to use.""

He said something similar in August when he made a plea for ""taxing the rich and redistributing their money even as the Big Apple reels from a coronavirus-induced budget crisis that's already caused well-heeled New Yorkers to head for the hills.""

Hizzoner further urged Gothamites, ""Help me tax the wealthy. Help me redistribute wealth. Help me build affordable housing in white communities if you want desegregation,"" adding, ""What changes things is redistribution of wealth. Tax the wealthy at a much higher level.""

But in all of this, de Blasio has refused to define whom he considers to be ""wealthy"" or who would qualify as ""rich"" under his imagined tax plan.

So it should come as no surprise that while taking part in a New York state Senate budget hearing, the mayor reiterated his plea to ""tax the rich"" but when pressed by a fellow Democrat on who would qualify as ""rich"" under his plan, he failed to offer any specifics.

De Blasio told Democratic state Sen. Jim Gaughran on Thursday, ""What I think, is for millionaires and billionaires, there should be higher taxes, particularly for billionaires,"" the New York Post reported.

Having the same question many people probably have — especially those who might get caught in the mayor's ""tax the rich"" net — Gaughran pressed for clarity, asking, ""One of the questions I have for you, in terms of if you are looking to the suggestion that we raise taxes on the wealthy. Could you further define that? Who do you define as wealthy and what tax rate should we raise, if it was up to you?""

The mayor, saying he wanted to be ""straightforward,"" offered an unclear answer, ""Couple of straightforward points — I think billionaires in particular is where I'd put a lot of the emphasis—""

At that point, the Post said, Sen. Gaughran interrupted to push the mayor to be more clear, asking, ""You said billionaires, a billionaire — somebody who has a billion dollars or somebody that makes a billion dollars? Or are you looking at a certain — What would be the annual figure you would look at that you think somebody should make?""

De Blasio didn't have an answer and said simply, ""Senator, I want to be straightforward. When I can give you a very specific answer, I will.""

He admitted that he didn't really have a plan in mind to back up his left-wing rhetoric.

""I don't have my own independent tax suggestion for the state,"" de Blasio said. ""I just want to tell you directionally.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/de-blasio-taxes-define-rich,2021-02-11
Dean Norris tells capitalists to 'stfu' about high gas prices,"Actor Dean Norris has a message for capitalism supporters who are displeased about the sky-high gas prices they have been facing lately: They can just ""stfu,"" Norris said, using an abbreviation for the profane expression shut the f*** up.

""Youre not getting 'robbed' at the pump. You're paying fair market price for a commodity. If you love Capitalism so much then stfu,"" Norris tweeted on Wednesday.

The actor, who has played roles in television shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" and ""United States of Al,"" made the comment as Americans continue to face soaring gas prices. As of Thursday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $5.009.

""This comment is evidence that Dean knows nothing about fair or free markets or economics,"" RedState managing editor Jennifer Van Laar tweeted in response to the actor's remarks.

""It's not a fair-market price if government purposely creates scarcity to drive up the price,"" tweeted David Harsanyi, a senior editor at the Federalist.

Someone else responded to Norris's post by tweeting, ""yeah those gas prices determined by the market that's totally free and not at all distorted by government.""

""Another dimwit leftist rich actor spouting stupidity,"" someone else declared.

The Biden administration has been largely blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine for high fuel prices. The president recently issued a letter putting pressure on the leaders of major oil companies — according to Axios, the letter was directed to the leaders of ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP America, Shell USA, Phillips 66, Marathon, and Valero.

""Your companies and others have an opportunity to take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel, and other refined product you are producing and supplying to the United States market,"" Biden said in a the letter. ""The lack of refining capacity — and resulting unprecedented refinery profit margins — are blunting the impact of the historic actions my Administration has taken to address Vladimir Putin's Price Hike and are driving up costs for consumers.""

In a statement supplied to TheBlaze, a Chevron spokesperson said that ""what we have seen since January 2021 are policies that send a message that the Administration aims to impose obstacles to our industry delivering energy resources the world needs.""

Exxon issued a statement that noted, ""government can promote investment through clear and consistent policy that supports U.S. resource development, such as regular and predictable lease sales, as well as streamlined regulatory approval and support for infrastructure such as pipelines.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dean-norris-gas-prices-capitalism,2022-06-16
Social media spread a deceptively edited clip of billionaire Leon Cooperman appearing to attack retail investors,"A deceptively edited clip of New York hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman railing against the term ""fair shair"" went viral Thursday, leading many to accuse Cooperman of attacking the retail investors of the Reddit discussion board WallStreetBets.

Cooperman was interviewed on CNBC and spoke about the WallStreetBets day traders who drove up the price of GameStock's stock to squeeze Wall Street hedge funds who wanted to short GameStop. In an edited clip of the interview shared on Twitter by Disclose.tv, Cooperman appears to belittle the WallStreetBets investors as people who are ""sitting at home getting their checks from the government.""

Disclose.tv's tweet frames the clip as ""billionaire Leon Cooperman fumes at retail traders and shouts: 'It's a way of attacking wealthy people.'""





This clip, however, is edited to cut out several of Cooperman's statements that provide needed context for the points he makes.



Cooperman told CNBC that he believes the meteoric rise of GameStop's stock will end poorly for many of the retail traders who are climbing aboard the bandwagon while the stock price is artificially high, but he does not find fault with the initial Reddit investors who decided to put the squeeze on the hedge funds and make some money. Cooperman believes that several factors have contributed to what the market is experiencing, including near-zero interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve and the stimulus checks sent to most Americans by Congress.

""It's all interconnected,"" he explained. ""The reason the market is doing what it's doing is, people are sitting at home, getting their checks from the government, basically trading for no commissions and no interest rates. I'm not saying they're stupid. Show me a guy with a good record consistently, and I'll show you a smart guy.""

""I'm not damning them. I'm just saying from my experience, this will end in tears,"" he added.







He went on to explain that based on what he's seen, GameStop is not worth the extraordinary price the stock is trading at. As of Friday afternoon, the stock was trading at about $330.



""GameStop is not worth $500, not worth $400, not worth $300, not worth $200, not even worth $100, not even worth $50,"" Cooperman explained. ""I don't know what the hell it's worth to be honest with you, I'm not involved with it.""

Later in the interview with CNBC, Cooperman expressed concern that the current conditions of the market are unsustainable in the long term. He said that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is incentivizing investors to make higher risk bets with their money in search of better returns. As people move money out of traditionally safe places like savings accounts because interest rates are too low and put them into risky stocks to make more with their money, the stock market keeps rising and reinforces those investment patterns.

But someday interest rates will have to go up. And Cooperman predicted that taxes will have to be raised so that the federal government will be able to continue making payments on the national debt.

""Everybody is moving out on the risk curve, and one of these days — not today, not tomorrow — but one of these days people are going to come in on the risk curve, and I think we'll have lots of issues to deal with,"" Cooperman said.



It was at this point when Cooperman criticized rhetoric from Democrats about how the wealthy need to pay their ""fair share"" in taxes, even though he voted for President Joe Biden.

""I hate that expression with a passion,"" Cooperman said. He questioned how Democrats define ""fair share.""

""I'm willing to work six months a year for the government and six months for myself, which means a marginal tax rate of 50%,"" he said. ""This fair share is a bulls**t concept. It's just a way of attacking wealthy people, and I think it's inappropriate.

""We've all got to work together and pull together.""

So, his comments about ""It's just a way of attacking wealthy people, and I think it's inappropriate,"" in context, were clearly not about the people who are trading on GameStop, but rather about the tax plans being put forth by Democrats. He clearly did not trash people for using stimulus checks to play the stock market or say that what they were doing was just trying to get back at rich people, as many have interpreted the deceptively edited clip.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/deceptively-edited-clip-of-billionaire-leon-cooperman,2021-01-30
Dem senator exposes his own hypocrisy by knocking Republicans for asking Ketanji Brown Jackson about her judicial philosophy,"Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) chided Republican senators on Wednesday for repeatedly pressing Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson about her judicial philosophy.



But Whitehouse has been guilty of the very act he is railing against now.

What did Whitehouse say?



While speaking during Jackson's third day of Senate confirmation hearings, Whitehouse knocked questions targeting Jackson's judicial philosophy.

""The fact that Judge Jackson has said, 'I don't have a judicial philosophy, I've got a judicial methodology, doesn't bother me a bit,"" Whitehouse said. ""In fact, it kinda bothers me the expectation that a nominee to the Supreme Court should have a judicial philosophy.""

The Rhode Island Democrat explained he opposes judicial philosophies because they can become a ""screen for a predisposition that a judge frankly should not have.""

""One of the problems with 'judicial philosophy' is occasional adherence, selective adherence, which in my mind makes it less of a judicial philosophy and more of a doctrine of convenience to be trotted out when it helps the people you want to help, and originalism strikes me as that kind of doctrine,"" Whitehouse said.

After railing against corporate influence in politics, Whitehouse declared, ""I don't think you have to have a judicial philosophy. I think you have to have integrity, a judicial temperament. But a philosophy? Where does that come from?""

But what has Whitehouse said in the past?

Five years ago, when Neil Gorsuch was undergoing his Senate confirmation process, Whitehouse questioned Gorsuch about his judicial philosophy.

During the hearing, Whitehouse asked Gorsuch, ""How would you describe any differences that you may have in judicial philosophy with [then-Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Merrick] Garland?""

""I would leave that for others to characterize. I do not like it when people characterize me, and I would not prefer to characterize him. He can characterize himself,"" Gorsuch responded.

Meanwhile, Whitehouse also promoted questions about judicial philosophy when Sonia Sotomayor underwent her Senate confirmation process in 2009.

""It is fair to inquire into a nominee's judicial philosophy, and we will here have a serious and fair inquiry,"" Whitehouse said at the time. ""But the pretense that Republican nominees embody modesty and restraint, or that Democratic nominees must be activists, runs starkly counter to recent history.""

Anything else?

While Democratic senators have not asked Jackson many questions about her judicial philosophy, they have indeed asked them.

For example, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-N.Y.) asked Jackson in written questions to ""characterize your judicial philosophy.""

""My judicial philosophy is to approach all cases with professional integrity, meaning strict adherence to the rule of law, keeping an open mind, and deciding each issue in a transparent, straightforward manner, without bias or any preconceived notion of how the matter is going to turn out,"" Jackson responded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dem-senator-hypocrisy-republicans-ketanji-brown-jackson-judicial-philosophy,2022-03-23
Democrats push measure to block Trump from holding office,"A group of House Democrats is backing legislation to prohibit former President Donald Trump from ever holding office again.

The legislation accuses Trump of involvement in ""insurrection"" and points to the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to assert that Trump is not eligible to hold office again.

""No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof,"" a portion of the 14th Amendment states.

Trump, who previously served as president from early 2017 through early 2021, announced last month that he is running for president again.

""Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Donald J. Trump is ineligible to again hold the office of President of the United States, or to hold any office, civil or military, under the United States,"" the measure declares.

Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island is pushing the measure along with more than three dozen original cosponsors.

""Donald Trump very clearly engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 with the intention of overturning the lawful and fair results of the 2020 election. You don't get to lead a government you tried to destroy,"" Cicilline said, according to a press release. ""The 14th Amendment makes clear that based on his past behavior, Donald Trump is disqualified from ever holding federal office again and, under Section 5, Congress has the power to pass legislation to implement this prohibition.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-legislation-block-trump-office,2022-12-16
Democrat Stacey Abrams' group is investigating itself in an attempt to quell questions about payments to director's friends and family,"Fair Fight PAC, a political action group founded by Stacey Abrams, the Democrat running against Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in Georgia's gubernatorial race, has come under intense scrutiny after it was revealed the relatively inexperienced friends and family of its director were getting significant paydays while maintaining other full-time jobs.

On Friday, in response to a critical Fox News Digital report, Fair Fight PAC issued a statement, noting that on October 13, the organization ""became aware that PAC funds may have been incorrectly paid to consultants.""

""Fair Fight strives to serve with the utmost integrity, as is core to our values. We take these matters seriously and have initiated a comprehensive investigation,"" the statement added.

Abrams founded Fair Fight PAC in 2019 after she lost the Georgia gubernatorial election the previous year, the result of which she has repeatedly called into doubt. The PAC is an offshoot of Fair Fight Action. Its stated aim is to promote ""equitable elections"" in the state.

Axios touted it as the ""strongest Democratic lobbying force at the Capitol when it comes to voting policy.""

It's all about who you know

Those close to André Fields, Fair Fight PAC's political director and longtime Abrams aide, have received considerable sums in recent years despite their ostensible inexperience.

Citing Federal Election Commission records, Fox News Digital reported that Fair Fight disbursed over $120,000 to Darius Faulk, Fields' sister, for training services since August 2021. Faulk reportedly has virtually no political experience, having worked as the director of operations and recently as assistant coach for Hofstra University's women's basketball program.

In a December 12, 2019, Voyage Atlanta interview, Fields named a number of close friends, two of whom, namely Asa Fludd and Cruz Alvarado, have both received tens of thousands of dollars from Fair Fight PAC.

Fludd received $29,800 in training consulting payments from the PAC since 2021. Alvarado collected $29,000. Neither have a background in politics. The former has worked in computer systems training and the latter in the event industry.

While Fox News Digital indicated the amount paid by the PAC to these three individuals was over $178,000, CNN's review of the FEC filings from this and the previous election cycles suggest the figure may be closer to $250,000.

According to Open Secrets, in the 2021-2022 election cycle, Fair Fight raised $24.4 million and spent $43.5 million.

Backlash



On October 14, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted: ""Stacey Abrams' group is using hundreds of thousands in political donations to make sure her friends are taken care of while families struggle with 40-year-high inflation.""

Kemp's press secretary Tate Mitchell stated on Friday that ""After facing a resounding defeat in court over false claims of voter suppression that Stacey Abrams used to deny the results of the 2018 election, Abrams' favorite slush fund has been caught red-handed funneling hundreds of thousands in salary to family and friends who have no connection to the organization’s stated purpose.""

Mitchell's mention of Abrams' ""resounding defeat in court"" was a reference to Fair Fight Action's lawsuit, which alleged Georgia had ""grossly mismanaged"" the election. On September 30, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta rejected that lawsuit, stating that ""the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Act of 1965].""

Mitchell added: ""While hardworking Georgians struggle to make ends meet thanks to the Democrat-created economic crisis, Abrams is using her political groups and the millions at their disposal to line the pockets of her pals.""

These questionable payments will likely be raised on Monday, when Kemp and Abrams take the stage for their first televised debate of the election at the Atlanta Press Club.

Mitchell has intimated that among the achievements Kemp may highlight in the debate will be how he ""refunded over $1 billion to Georgia taxpayers, signed the largest state income tax cut in Georgia history, and suspended the state's gas tax to provide economic relief to Georgians facing 40-year-high inflation and skyrocketing gas prices under the Biden administration.""

AZ Central indicated Abrams will likely discuss her plans to address Georgia's housing crisis, her affinity for abortion, and her opposition to constitutional carry.

An October 10/11 poll from the Trafalgar Group puts Kemp 9 points ahead of Abrams. The Hill/Emerson poll has Abrams trailing by 5 points.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-stacey-abrams-group-being-investigated-for-questionable-payments-to-directors-friends-and-family,2022-10-16
Democrat Tim Ryan calls for Americans to 'kill and confront' GOP 'extremist' movement,"Ohio Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan said Tuesday that Americans need to ""kill and confront"" what he asserted is an ""extremist"" movement within the Republican Party.

“The Democrats aren’t right on everything. And I’m willing to sit down and have conversations about how we can move out of this age of stupidity and into an age of reconciliation and reform,” Ryan said during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""Some of those answers will come from Republicans, not the extremists that we are dealing with every single day, we’ve got to kill and confront that movement, but working with normal mainstream Republicans, that’s going to be really, really important,” he said.

His comments echo those of President Joe Biden, who came under fire earlier this month after delivering a speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in which he insisted Donald Trump and ""MAGA Republicans"" are ""a threat to this country.""

""As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise,"" Biden said. ""There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.""

The president's comments were denounced by Republicans, who accused him of demonizing the 70 million Americans who supported former President Trump in the 2020 presidential election. In the days following his address, Biden clarified that he does not believe most Trump voters are extremists, insisting he was only condemning Republican Party office-holders and elected representatives.

Biden said that those who would use violence for ""political purposes"" or those who refuse to accept the outcome of free and fair elections are the ones who threaten the country.



Ryan made his remarks Tuesday after highlighting his record as ""one of the most bipartisan members of Congress."" He has attempted to portray himself as a centrist in the race against Republican candidate J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and best-selling author of ""Hillbilly Elegy."" Vance is endorsed by Trump



Polls show a tight race in Ohio, where Vance has led Ryan by an average of 2.3 percentage points over the last 30 days or so, according to RealClearPolitics. A USA Today Network Ohio and Suffolk University poll released Monday found Ryan leading Vance 46.6% to 45.6%, within the poll's 4.4 percentage point margin for error.

According to the poll, 54% of likely voters disapprove of President Joe Biden's job performance, while just 41.8% approve.



Ryan has distanced himself from the unpopular president, suggesting to a local radio station last week that Biden should not run for president in 2024 and that it is ""time for some generational change.""

"Democratic congressman says US justice system — which 'feasts on black folks' — should treat Trump, Republican lawmakers like 'negroes'","Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said he believes that President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers supporting his bid to dispute the results of the 2020 presidential election should be treated like ""negroes"" have been treated by the criminal justice system in the United States.

Those lawmakers, according to Johnson, include Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Josh Hawley (Mo).

He also said that the Democratic Party ought not turn the other cheek to the perceived misdeeds of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party at large.

What is he talking about?

According to a Tuesday report from Mediaite, Johnson made the inflammatory race-related remarks Monday on SiriusXM's ""The Dean Obeidallah Show.""

Obeidallah told Johnson that he believed it would be ""detrimental to our party"" that for the sake of unity, the Biden administration simply said, ""'Trump did some bad things, but look forward.'""

""It would be so destructive to our party if that is the way we go,"" he added.

Johnson responded, ""You can't let this behavior slide, you can't ignore it and hope that it's not going to happen again. You see what's shaping up for the future with guys like Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz who are looking to turn the Trump Republican Party into the Trump Republican Party on steroids.""

The Georgia Democrat added that conservative Republican lawmakers will be certain to quickly learn that they ""will not be allowed to get away with what Donald Trump did.""

""We have got to make sure that those who come after Donald Trump know that they will not be allowed to get away with what Donald Trump did, that they will be held accountable,"" he insisted. ""They will be treated, yes, like 'negroes' — they will be perp-walked to the jail, handcuffed not in front of them, but behind them. They will be booked, fingerprinted, have to make bond, and have to hire a lawyer just like everyone else and go through the system.""

Johnson explained that the U.S. justice system ""feasts on black folks.""

""[F]or once it needs to turn its attention to what this man has done to turn our country into something that we just don't need to let it get to,"" he explained. ""He can't be allowed to get away with it because if we allow him to get away with it, there will be others who will try to do the same thing, and we don't even want them to think about doing what Trump has done.""

What's a brief history on his remarks?

Johnson's remarks come on the heels of introducing a resolution to censure Trump over his call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

The president in recent days has come under fire for a recently published phone call with Raffensperger.

In a reported hourlong phone call, Trump appeared to repeatedly urge the Georgia secretary of state to ""find"" enough votes to help reverse the state's election results.

In the measure, Johnson has called on Trump to ""retract and disavow this unlawful and unconstitutional behavior"" and to recognize President-elect Joe Biden as winner of the 2020 presidential election.

""President Trump's actions and statements on this call demonstrate an attempt to willfully deprive the citizens of Georgia of a fair and impartial election process in direct contravention of both federal law and the laws of the state of Georgia,"" Johnson's resolution added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-congressman-justice-system-treat-trump-republicans-like-negroes,2021-01-05
Democratic majority leader forced to clean up after suggesting 2022 election would be illegitimate,"Fierce backlash has forced the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives to walk back comments he made appearing cast doubt on the legitimacy of the upcoming 2022 midterm elections in November.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), recently told Politico that he agreed with President Joe Biden's claim that the fairness of the next election depends on whether the Democrats are able to pass federal legislation to undo Republican-backed election security reforms in several states.

""I think it easily could be — be illegitimate,"" Biden told reporters at a rare press conference last week.

""""I'm not going to say it's going to be legit. It's — the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these — these reforms passed,"" Biden said.

Asked about the president's claims, Hoyer said, ""President Biden is correct"" that the election will not be legitimate without passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and other election reforms supported by Democrats.



""This is about our Democracy. This is about an America that really believes in making sure that the people’s voice is heard and reflected in the outcome of the election,"" Hoyer said.

But the Democratic leader faced a flurry of online criticism after Politico reported that Hoyer ""appeared to agree with President JOE BIDEN’s suggestion last week that the 2022 election results may not be valid without the passage of voting rights legislation.""

Hoyer's office gave a statement to Fox News to clean up the mess. Hoyer communications director Margaret Mulkerrin said that Hoyer does not believe the midterm elections will be illegitimate.

""Leader Hoyer shares President Biden’s concern that Republican attempts to methodically exclude millions of voters are deeply alarming, and raise serious questions that people who want to make their voice heard won’t be able to participate,"" Mulkerrin said.

""Leader Hoyer does not believe the 2022 election will be illegitimate, nor would he claim ballots ought to be thrown out if a Democrat loses – simply that millions of Americans have been systematically disenfranchised from our democracy by GOP election suppression legislation, and that we ought to take immediate steps to stop it by passing urgently needed measures to protect the right to vote.""

Various Democrats have claimed that ""democracy"" is at risk should Congress fail to pass election reforms this year. The Freedom to Vote Act would set federal standards for U.S. elections, expand mail-in and absentee voting, loosen voter ID laws, and make Election Day a federal holiday, among other reforms.

"Democratic US rep calls out 'white supremacy' of Capitol siege, says rioters 'would have been shot' if they were black","Brand-new U.S. Rep. Cori Bush — a Black Lives Matter proponent who was part of the mob that confronted Mark and Patricia McCloskey outside their St. Louis home over the summer as the couple armed themselves — said the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday ""would have been shot"" had they been black.

What are the details?

Bush — a Missouri Democrat — told MSNBC ""had it been people who look like me, had it been the same amount of people, but had they been black and brown, we wouldn't have made it up those steps. We wouldn't have made it to be able to get into the door and bust windows and go put our feet up on the desks of Congress members. We wouldn't have made it that far. We would have been shot. We would've been tear gassed ... rubber bullets. That would've happened before we made it there.""

She continued: ""We need to call it what it is. It's white supremacy. It was white privilege, and it was the call of our president, and it was encouraged by our Republican colleagues.""

Several hundred supporters of President Donald Trump — among tens of thousands who gathered Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to protest the results of the 2020 election — breached police lines, broke into the Capitol building, and rioted, forcing a lockdown and evacuation of elected officials and their staff members.

She also wants GOP legislators expelled who wanted to overturn election

Bush also told MSNBC that Republican lawmakers who disputed the election results ""have been the ones trying to steal this election. That's why we are calling for them to be removed. They should not be seated.""

Indeed, the Hill reported that her first legislative act is introducing a resolution to investigate and possibly remove them.

""I believe the Republican members of Congress who have incited this domestic terror attack through their attempts to overturn the election must face consequences,"" Bush said, according to the outlet. ""They have broken their sacred Oath of Office. I will be introducing a resolution calling for their expulsion.""

Questions for law enforcement

Bush in her MSBC interview also questioned the actions of law enforcement during the Capitol rioting.

""It was strange because it was almost like there was this call to not use force,"" she said. ""I'm not used to seeing this where there could be this many people, and there is nothing that looks like it's in place. There are pictures and video of police officers ... walking away. I'm even hearing people talking about ... that they just stood by.""

Bush added that lawmakers at the Capitol have been reassured that ""when we are here on these grounds that we are safe ... but today was not that day.""

Anything else?

During their appearance at the Republican National Convention in August, the McCloskeys called Bush a ""Marxist liberal activist"" who was ""leading the mob through our neighborhood"" and ""stood outside of our home with a bullhorn screaming 'you can't stop the revolution'"" — and ""that Marxist revolutionary is now going to be the congresswoman for the 1st District of Missouri,"" the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said.

Bush responded to the couple's remarks that ""this is their way of just trying to get attention, trying to get some notoriety,"" the paper added.

Last month a judge dismissed the St. Louis prosecutor from the McCloskey case, saying improper fundraising emails by Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's campaign infringed on the couple's right to a fair trial. Gardner filed felony gun charges against the McCloskeys in July.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-us-rep-white-supremacy-capitol-siege,2021-01-07
"Democratic Virginia delegate loses election, admits he tampered with Republican campaign signs at polling place, tells cop it was just 'a little hijinks'","It has not been Chris Hurst's finest week.

First off, the Democrat from the Virginia House of Delegates lost his District 12 re-election bid to Republican Jason Ballard. In fact, Republicans took control of the House by flipping seven seats after Democrats held a 55-45 majority.

But that ain't the half of it.

What else happened?

You see, on the eve of the election, Hurst and his girlfriend were pulled over by Radford City police after a sheriff's deputy allegedly saw them tampering with campaign signs at a polling place, WSLS-TV reported.

Police photos show campaign signs for Republican candidates such as Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin and Hurst's opponent, Delegate-elect Ballard, flipped over and on the ground, the station said.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

'A little hijinks'

The following is a transcript from the police bodycam video showing the conversation between Hurst and the officer who pulled him over, WSLS reported:

Officer: ""I think what you need to do after I deal with you here is go back and fix those signs. What do you think? You try to resort to doing this? Instead of doing a fair election? Chris, quit playing. Quit playing. Y'all are up there turning over signs at the polling area and you're sitting here acting like you don't know what's going on?""



Hurst: ""...Here's what I would say. I would think that something that was a little hijinks and steam blowing off is exactly what everybody over on the other side of the mountain does and people all over this district do.""



Officer: ""So you're going to resort to that and represent us?""



Hurst: ""I need you to just do your job here tonight and I'll do mine. I have nothing more to say to you, officer. I'm sorry for actions that I may have done or my partner may have done, but I think you're getting a little emotional here.""



Officer: ""I'm not getting emotional at all, you're supposed to be representing us. You're supposed to be out here representing us and not out here acting like a school kid. How am I supposed to vote for you if you're out here doing this?""



Hurst: ""Were you planning on voting for me?""



Officer: ""Well, that's all up in the air now.""



Hurst: ""I'm sorry if I lost your support, sir.""

At Tuesday night's watch party, Hurst told media members the campaign sign incident was a prank, the station said.

""We flipped over a couple of yard signs, took them, put 'em upside down and put them right side up,"" Hurst said. ""That's what we did.""

When asked ""whose"" signs he messed with, Hurst replied they were ""Republican signs .. one Jason Ballard sign and one [Glenn] Youngkin sign.""

But WSLS said police photos show more than two signs were tampered with.

Here's a statement from Hurst about the incident via WXFR-TV:

This has been a real drag out race, it's been very competitive, and, in some degree, it's been sometimes nasty. You know, election eve, you've run a really hard race, run a very long campaign, and you just do a prank to be a goof and, you know, it just happens to be done by somebody who is very apologetic for what they've done and realizes that, you know, I have people looking up to me and I have a real responsibility that I need to live up to, and I think in my actions, legislatively and what we've been able to accomplish for this district, I continue to show that we get results for the New River Valley, but again I apologize to people for disappointing them and it's something I'm just looking to move forward from.

Radford police release body cam video of traffic stop involving Chris Hurst youtu.be

Anything else?

Hurst also was cited at the traffic stop for driving with a suspended license and given a ""driving while suspended notification,"" the station said.

But Hurst told WSLS his license was suspended due to an insurance lapse and that he wasn't aware of it until he was pulled over Monday night. Hurst told WXFR he took care of the insurance issue Tuesday morning.

Hurst also was pulled over in 2020 on suspicion of drunk driving, after which his blood alcohol concentration came in above the legal limit at .085 in a portable breath test, WSLS reported in a separate story. The officer released Hurst without charging him because he believed his blood alcohol concentration would drop below the legal limit by the time he brought Hurst in for a formal breathalyzer test, which is the only admissible test in court.

What's more, the station said it would have been unlikely for Hurst to be prosecuted in court since the Constitution of Virginia dictates that legislators are immune to arrest while the General Assembly is in session unless they've committed treason, a felony, or a breach of peace.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-virginia-delegate-loses-election-admits-tampered-with-republican-campaign-signs,2021-11-04
"Democrats accuse DeSantis of 'trafficking' migrants, demand DOJ prosecution — and a US attorney speaks out","Democrats are accusing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) of human trafficking and demanding that the Justice Department take action against him.

The accusations came on the same day that dozens of migrants arrived in Martha's Vineyard. GOP governors have been sending migrants to ""sanctuary"" localities in recent months because President Joe Biden has failed to address the border crisis in which millions of migrants have overwhelmed the southern U.S. border.

What are Democrats saying?

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) wrote the Justice Department demanding that ""kidnapping"" charges be considered against DeSantis.

Without evidence, Newsom claimed migrants were lured onto the plane that eventually went to Martha's Vineyard, thus accusing DeSantis of operating a ""fraudulent scheme.""

Several of the individuals who were transported to Martha’s Vineyard have alleged that a recruiter induced them to accept the offer of travel based on false representations that they would be transported to Boston and would receive expedited access to work authorization. The interstate travel at issue provides a basis for federal jurisdiction over this matter.



Accordingly, I strongly urge the U.S. Department of Justice (US DOJ) to open an investigation into possible criminal or civil violations of federal law based on this alleged fraudulent scheme.

Specifically, Newsom suggested DeSantis is guilty of kidnapping and violating the civil rights of migrants and suggested he violated a law typically reserved for prosecuting organized crime.

Democrat Nikki Fried, who campaigned against DeSantis for governor, also wrote Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting an investigation, claiming that DeSantis is ""trafficking"" migrants.

I am writing to urge your office launch an immediate investigation into the actions of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the transportation of 50 migrants by plane to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The use of human beings to score political points is first and foremost detestable. Additionally, this maneuver raises serious legal questions and will have untold repercussions on the individuals caught up in the Governor’s political stunt. An investigation is necessary to understand who these immigrants are, how they were transported across state lines, and if their rights were violated.

Shockingly, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins said Thursday that she will speak to the Justice Department about ""next steps.""



""We are looking into that case, and we’ll be speaking with members of the Department of Justice. Massachusetts isn’t the only place where this has happened,"" she said, Politico reported. ""We have several other sister communities — whether it’s D.C., New York, California — where we’ve seen things like this, and we’re hoping to get some input from the Department of Justice about what our next steps might be, if any at all.""

What does Biden admin do?

Under Biden's leadership, migrants have been transported to cities all across the U.S. because immigration facilities near the border have been overwhelmed by the number of migrants entering the U.S.

Although left-leaning PolitiFact tried to downplay the truthfulness of this, the outlet clearly explained, ""The federal government flies adult detainees in its custody from one facility to another, or from one U.S. city to another during deportation proceedings. The U.S. government in some cases also flies unaccompanied children who are being released from its custody to a family member or sponsor.""

The Washington Post also explained, ""Both U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) fly undocumented immigrants to different locations in the United States.""

To be fair, the same type of migrant transportation happened in the Trump administration. The pace of transportation, however, has significantly increased because of the border crisis.

NBC News even reported on the Biden administration's plan to send migrants to cities across the U.S. as they await their turn in immigration court.

One thus wonders what the difference is between the federal government transporting migrants via bus or airplane and Republican governors doing it. Apparently nothing, because administration officials referred to their plan as the ""Abbott plan.""

What did DeSantis say?

A spokesman for the governor reiterated that ""sanctuary"" localities are best suited to care for migrants.

""States like Massachusetts, New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as ‘sanctuary states’ and support for the Biden administration’s open border policies,"" said DeSantis communications director Taryn Fenske.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-accuse-desantis-trafficking-migrants,2022-09-16
Democrats want to prevent so-called insurrectionists from holding office — silent on whether BLM rioters will get a pass,"Democrat lawmakers across America appear keen to prevent those they have characterized or will one day characterize as insurrectionists from holding public office.

Whereas before, activists sought only to preclude a handful of individuals such as former President Donald Trump and former Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn (N.C.) from running on the basis of untried accusations, lawmakers in New York, Connecticut, and Virginia are now joining others in baking their Jan. 6 narrative into law, reported the Associated Press.

What are the details?

USA Today noted that the fear of sabotage from within government by Confederate remnants in the aftermath of the Civil War prompted Congress to include a disqualification clause in the Constitution.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment bars rebels or insurrectionists from holding ""any office, civil or military, under the United States."" Congress may, however, per the provision, remove such a prohibition with a two-thirds vote of each House.

Congress did so in 1872, passing the Amnesty Act with more than the two-thirds of the vote, thereby removing ""all political disabilities imposed by the third section of the fourteenth article of amendments ... from all persons whomsoever.""

According to the University of Minnesota Law School's Constitutional Commentary, supermajorities in the Congress removed additional disabilities ""as a gesture of national unity"" in 1898.

Notwithstanding the Reconstruction-era amnesty, Fox 13 reported that Section 3 was invoked in 1919, when Congress barred socialist Victor K. Berger from occupying a seat in the House over his opposition to America's entry into World War 1.

Since this law is already enshrined in the Constitution, New York Republican Assemblyman and minority leader Will Barclay told the AP that Democrats were simply making a ""political statement.""

It is ""more political than it is a concern about public policy,"" Barclay added. The law in place ""should be sufficient.""

Prior to the having their House majority taken away from them by the American people, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and 40 other congressional Democrats introduced a bill in December that would make former President Donald J. Trump ""ineligible to again hold the office of President of the United States or to hold any office, civil or military, under the United States.""



The bill, which cited Section 3, suggested that Trump, who has not been convicted of such a crime, ""did engage in insurrection against the United States by mobilizing, inciting, and aiding those who attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, to disrupt certification of the 2020 Presidential Election.""

Despite a dearth of eligible convicts, Democrats' list of forbidden candidates has outgrown just Trump.



Jordan Boyd, writing in the Federalist, noted, ""If you disagree with Democrats, you're an insurrectionist.""

The Associated Press reported that Republican state Sen. Cris Dush called out his Democratic peer Sen. Amanda Cappelletti for bandying about the accusatory term ""insurrection,"" noting that ""nobody has been charged with that. ... There's not been a single charge against any of those people as insurrectionists. In this committee, we are not using that term.""

Over 840 Jan. 6 protesters were arrested. As of this month, 185 have received their sentences. According to Time magazine, the median sentence has been 45 days. None yet have been charged with insurrection, despite the publication's liberal use of the term. The most serious charge leveled to date has been seditious conspiracy.

Without a conviction in their favor, partisan activists nevertheless attempted to have former Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn (N.C.) disqualified from running for reelection last year. Cawthorn noted in February 2022 that these efforts to chase convictions to further limit voters' choices might have ""major implications down the road.""

Cawthorn told ABC News, ""Running for political office is quintessential First Amendment activity and afforded great protection.""

He added that Section 3 is ""being used as a weapon by liberal Democrats to attempt to defeat our democracy by having state bureaucrats, rather than the People, choose who will represent North Carolina in Congress.""

""If you’ve tried to take down our government through violent means, in no way should you be part of it,"" said New York Sen. Brad Holyman-Sigal, whose state has seen its fair share of BLM and Antifa violence



Holyman-Sigal sponsored state Senate Bill S888, which states, ""No person shall be capable of holding a civil office who shall stand convicted"" of rebellion or insurrection.

The justification for the bill claims that ""at least two new elected representatives have been credibly accused of participating in the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021.""

The bill notes that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment applies to anyone who previously swore an oath to defend the Constitution, ""but it does not address candidates who have not yet taken an oath or affirmation.""

Trump, for instance, had sworn oaths long before telling protesters to ""go home"" and calling for peace, law, and order on Jan. 6. Consequently, he could be prevented from running for office in the state under this bill.

Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff introduced Senate Bill 244 on Jan. 17, which would ""provide that convicts of certain crimes shall permanently (1) forfeit their electoral rights and privileges, and (2) be prohibited from employment by the state or any political subdivision thereof.""



The crimes of concern: ""sedition, insurrection, rebellion or a felony in relation to any such act.""

TheBlaze reached out to state Sens. Holyman-Sigal and Duff inquiring whether, extra to the Jan. 6 protests they reference and have expressed concern about, politically charged BLM and Antifa violence might similarly preclude offenders from serving.

TheBlaze also asked whether the state senators feared their bills could be weaponized by partisan actors on either side of the spectrum to prevent potential political opponents from attaining political office.

Neither provided an answer prior to publication.

Even if such legislation were evenly applied to the Democrats' paramilitary allies as well, prosecutors would first have to be willing to possible convict leftist insurrectionists. If the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office's apparent refusal to try the supermajority of 2020 leftist rioters in Portland is any indication, equitable outcomes may be unlikely.

"Top Biden pollster issues dire warning that 'pissed' Americans 'don't feel Democrats can get their s**t together,' says Dems are facing bloodbath in midterm elections","John Anzalone served as chief pollster for Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign, as well as for the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Anzalone has done polling for numerous other Democrats, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona. However, Anzalone was critical of Democrats in a recent podcast, where he voiced his fears that Democrats could get wiped out in the 2022 midterm elections.

In the recent episode of Politico's ""Playbook Deep Dive"" that was released on Friday, Anzalone warned that Americans are ""pissed."" The political strategist is extremely concerned that Democrats could get obliterated in the midterms – where they'll need to ""compete"" just to not get their ""a**es kicked.""

Host Ryan Lizza asked Anzalone, ""Let's just start off with how bad are things for Democrats this year and what can they do about it?""

Anzalone noted that American voters are always asking politicians, ""What have you done for me lately?” He adds, ""And they don’t feel Democrats can get their s**t together and get things done.""

""No one's going to sit there as a Democratic consultant and try to bulls**t you that this is anything but a really sour environment for Democrats,"" Anzalone admitted. ""So we better look at the strategic ways that we can compete, right? Just compete to not get our asses kicked.""



""Most Americans are pissed at the fact that they pay their fair share in taxes as middle-class people,"" the top Biden pollster expressed. ""They work hard. They want to see the benefits of the economy.""

He said that workers are getting pay increases; however, he acknowledged that the record inflation is ""eating it up.""

Anzalone asserted that voters are also ""pissed"" about ""big companies not paying any taxes."" He then commended President Biden's proposed tax hike on Americans making more than $400,000.

As a solution for Democrats to try to not get totally destroyed in the midterm elections, Anzalone proposed that Democrats should focus on doing something about health insurance costs, prescription drug costs, elderly care, and childcare. He speculates that if Democrats can show that they're helping working families that it will enable them to contend with several issues that are dragging down President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party – such as inflation, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the border crisis, and the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal.

Anzalone recommended that Democrats push a pro-union approach in areas that have a ""union culture.""

He said that the party needs to do better with male voters of all races, as well as college-educated men. The pollster said he is deeply concerned about male Latinos leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Republicans.

He advised Democrats to stop talking to Latinos about immigration, and to focus their message on the economy, inflation, healthcare, or schools. Anzalone suggested that Dems zero in on ""things like housing and crime"" when trying to woo Latino and black voters.

MSNBC opinion columnist Michael Cohen is also warning Democrats that they are facing a ""bloodbath"" in the midterm elections.

Citing record inflation, Cohen stated, ""It's precisely the kind of news that will compound the Democrats' political woes in November, which already looked dire.""

Cohen felt there was little the Democrats could do to prevent a demoralizing defeat in November.

""Rather than fight the prevailing political winds, Democrats would be better off acknowledging the reality that the midterm elections are going to be a bloodbath and focus instead on accomplishing as much as possible before then — the politics be damned,"" Cohen advocated. ""With the political situation looking increasingly bleak, Democrats have only one real option: pass their agenda.""

"Democrats set precedent for opposing Electoral College vote certification following Bush, Trump victories","Democrats are rebuking Republican lawmakers who plan to oppose the Electoral College certification of Joe Biden's election victory on Jan. 6 over concerns that election fraud tainted the outcome of the presidential contest.

But, as it turns out, Democrats, including some of those launching broadsides against their GOP colleagues, have a history of opposing the Electoral College vote certification.

What are Democrats saying?

After Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced this week that he will oppose the certification of the Electoral College results during next week's joint-session of Congress, Democrats blasted him.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said, ""The political equivalent of barking at the moon. This won't be taken seriously, nor should it be. The American people made a decision on November 3rd and that decision must and will be honored and protected by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.""

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said, ""Sen. Hawley's actions are grossly irresponsible. He's attempting to undermine our democratic process, fuel Trump's lies about voter fraud, and delay the certification of Biden's win. In the end, this reckless stunt will fail, and Joe Biden will become President on Jan. 20, 2021.""

What did Democrats do before?

According to Fox News, Democrats have launched objections to Electoral College votes in the last three elections won by Republican presidents: George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 victories and President Donald Trump's 2016 victory.

More from Fox News:

In early 2005 specifically, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) along with Rep. Stephanie Tubbs (D-Ohio) objected to Bush's 2004 electoral votes in Ohio. That forced the chambers to leave their joint session and debate separately for two hours on whether to reject Ohio's electoral votes. Neither did.

At the time, Democratic senators, like Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, and Harry Reid, praised then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) for raising objections. Durbin and Van Hollen were also among those celebrating Boxer.

Durbin said on the Senate floor at the time:

Some may criticize our colleague from California for bringing us here for this brief debate. I thank her for doing that because it gives Members an opportunity once again on a bipartisan basis to look at a challenge that we face not just in the last election in one State but in many States. Because of different electoral practices in States across America, voters who wish to cast a vote for President or Vice President cannot approach the polls with certainty that their vote will be counted or that they can vote in a fair and convenient manner. There are litanies of examples that could be cited. I do not challenge the legitimacy of the 2004 election outcome. I do not believe there is evidence of widespread fraud. I believe Senator Kerry was correct in announcing his concession, but let us concede on a bipartisan basis that we can and should do better.

Meanwhile, Van Hollen said in a press release in 2005:

I believe that Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-OH) have performed a very valuable public service in bringing this debate before the Congress. As Americans, we should all be troubled by reports of voting problems in many parts of the country. I have been particularly concerned about the lack of a verifiable paper record in connection with electronic voting systems. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of legislation to solve that problem.

In the end, Boxer was the only senator who voted against certifying Ohio's electoral votes, while a whopping 31 Democrats in the House voted against certifying 2004 Ohio's electoral votes.

At the time, the mainstream media also promoted stories about Ohio being ""stolen"" or that voting machine ""glitches"" marred election integrity.

Meanwhile, some House Democrats objected to the certification of Trump's Electoral College victory in 2017 over allegations of Trump-Russia collusion.

""I object because people are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our election,"" Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said at the time.

Specifically, objections were raised about the electoral votes belonging to Alabama, Florida, Michigan, Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina, Reuters reported.

Anything else?

Indeed, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who announced Saturday that he and 10 other Republican senators will oppose the certification vote on Jan. 6, explained that Democrats have established the precedent for such action.

""[T]here is long precedent of Democratic Members of Congress raising objections to presidential election results, as they did in 1969, 2001, 2005, and 2017. And, in both 1969 and 2005, a Democratic Senator joined with a Democratic House Member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged,"" Cruz's statement explained.

""The most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877, following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the Hayes-Tilden presidential race. Specifically, the elections in three states-Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina-were alleged to have been conducted illegally,"" the statement continued.

""In 1877, Congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. Instead, Congress appointed an Electoral Commission-consisting of five Senators, five House Members, and five Supreme Court Justices-to consider and resolve the disputed returns,"" the statement explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-set-precedent-for-opposing-electoral-college-certification,2021-01-02
Derek Chauvin claims riots 'poisoned' jury in George Floyd case and that one juror 'lied' about anti-cop 'activism',"Derek Chauvin — the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd in May 2020 — has filed another brief in the appeal process.

The reply brief, filed by his attorneys on Friday, argues that Chauvin never had a chance to receive a fair trial for several reasons, including violent riots before and during the trial, endless negative media coverage, a lack of a ""cooling period,"" and one supposedly activist juror who ""lied"" on his jury form.

According to the brief, the riots that erupted in 2020 after the death of George Floyd ""poisoned the jury against"" Chauvin and that the lingering threat that the rioting would escalate in the event of an acquittal nearly guaranteed Chauvin's conviction. Citing a 1997 case in which another police officer killed a suspect, the brief argues that no circumstance could be ""more prejudicial ... than that of a juror discovering that the City he or she resides in is bracing for a riot ... in the event the defendant on whose jury you sit is acquitted.""

Chauvin's lawyers likewise blame the media and various law enforcement bodies in the state of Minnesota for either wittingly or unwittingly tainting the jury. They wrote that media ""coverage glorified Floyd and demonized Chauvin,"" that various news outlets ""falsely"" reported that Chauvin ""had his knee on Floyd’s neck thereby choking Floyd,"" and that ""pretrial publicity held up Chauvin as the symbol of police brutality.""

The Minneapolis Police Chief and the head of the Department of Public Safety in Minnesota, the lawyers believe, also unnecessarily prejudiced a jury against Chauvin since both referred to the incident as a ""murder"" within weeks of Floyd's death.

The brief also condemns the state's eagerness to expedite the legal process against Derek Chauvin. Rather than permitting a ""cooling period"" to allow emotions to settle, the brief claims that ""the court hastened Chauvin’s trial.""

""It is not mere speculation to anticipate that allowing a longer, reasonable duration of time would allow the community to feel less of the pressure from fallout from the Floyd riots,"" the brief states.

Finally, the brief points out that one juror, Brandon Mitchell, who has since publicly identified himself, ""lied"" on the pre-trial jury questionnaire ""regarding his views of the case and the extent of his activism."" Though Mitchell checked ""No"" when asked whether he had ever advocated for police reform or demonstrated ""about police use of force or police brutality,"" the brief claims that Mitchell actively participated in at least one George Floyd-themed demonstration and can even be seen wearing a t-shirt with the message ""BLM * Get Your Knee Off Our Necks.""

Mitchell claims not to remember wearing the shirt. He also did admit on the jury questionnaire that he held a ""[v]ery favorable opinion"" of Black Lives Matter and wrote: ""Although I do believe officers[’] lives matter, I feel like the concept ‘Blue Lives Matter’ only became a thing to combat Black Lives Matter, whereas it shouldn’t be a competition.""

Chauvin's brief also offers several legal arguments about whether the former police officer could even be charged with felony murder and whether the judge presiding over the case denied the defense an opportunity to submit key evidence.

Chauvin is currently serving a sentence of 22.5 years. The filing asks for three possible outcomes in the appeal: a reversal of Chauvin's convictions, a retrial, or resentencing. Chauvin's lawyers submitted it in response to a filing made by the state early last month, arguing that justice had been served in the case.















Chauvin also pled guilty to other federal charges.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/derek-chauvin-claims-riots-poisoned-jury-in-george-floyd-case-and-that-one-juror-lied-about-anti-cop-activism,2022-10-09
"Derek Chauvin's attorney requests new trial on several grounds, including 'jury misconduct'","The defense attorney for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has filed a motion requesting that the guilty verdicts against his client be thrown out and is asking for a new trial, citing several reasons including ""jury misconduct.""

Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter last month over the death of George Floyd — but new questions were raised in recent days over the impartiality of one of the jurors.

What are the details?

Chauvin lawyer Eric Nelson asserts in the filing that Judge Peter Cahill ""abused"" his discretion in numerous ways, such as denying Chauvin a change of venue, denying an earlier request for a new trial ""on the grounds that 'publicity during the proceedings threaten[ed] the fairness of the trial,'"" and for failing to sequester the jury in the high-profile case.

Nelson also called for ""an order for hearing to impeach the verdict...on the grounds that the jury committed misconduct, felt threatened or intimidated race-based pressure during the proceedings, and/or failed to adhere to instructions during deliberations, in violation of Mr. Chauvin's constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.""

Chauvin's defense was expected to ask for a new trial, particularly after Judge Cahill acknowledged during the trial that incendiary public comments from Rep. Maxine Water (D-Calif.) arguably might have reached the jury and influenced their decision.

""It is so pervasive. I just don't know how this jury can really be said to be that they are free from the taint of this,"" Nelson told the judge before the verdict was reached. ""Now that we have U.S. representatives threatening acts of violence in relation to this specific case, it's mind-boggling to me, judge!""

Cahill responded, ""I will give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.""

In recent days it was also revealed that Brandon Mitchell, one of the jurors who convicted Chauvin, was pictured wearing a BLM shirt last summer that referenced Floyd. The revelation sparked questions over whether Mitchell was forthright during jury selection about being impartial in the case, and legal experts suggested it could be used as another reason for Chauvin's defense to appeal.

Mitchell defended himself to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, saying he does not recall wearing the shirt but did say the photo was taken in August when he went to an event in D.C. commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I Have A Dream"" speech.

The juror told the outlet the event was ""100% not"" a march for Floyd, adding, ""It was directly related to MLK's March on Washington from the '60s...The date of the March on Washington is the date.""

Anything else?

In reaction to Nelson's filing on Tuesday, the deputy chief of staff for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told ABC News, ""The court has already rejected many of these arguments and the State will vigorously oppose them.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/derek-chauvins-attorney-requests-new-trial-on-several-grounds-including-jury-misconduct,2021-05-04
"Dershowitz predicts Derek Chauvin's conviction will be overturned, citing Maxine Waters, Al Sharpton","Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz predicted Monday that Derek Chauvin's conviction would be overturned on appeal because of the unusual number of ""outside influences"" that potentially tainted the jury, which was unsequestered for the majority of the trial.

Chauvin was convicted Tuesday of murdering George Floyd last May. The jury reached a verdict more quickly than expected, declaring Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.

What did Dershowitz say?

Speaking on Newmax TV, Dershowitz declared that Chauvin's actions were ""inexcusable morally,"" but called the verdict ""very questionable,"" citing outside influences.

In fact, Dershowitz said the verdict ""should be"" overturned on appeal.

""The verdict is very questionable because of the outside influences from people like Al Sharpton and Maxine Waters. Their threats and intimidation and hanging the 'Sword of Damocles' over the jury — basically saying that if you don't convict on the murder charge, or all the charges, the cities will burn, the country will be destroyed — seeped into the jury room because the judge made a terrible mistake by not sequestering a jury,"" Dershowitz explained.

""I think it should be reversed on appeal,"" he predicted.

Despite the amount of attention Chauvin's trial received, the jury was only fully sequestered on Monday when closing arguments took place.



Because the jurors were not sequestered for the duration of the trial and were open to outside voices threatening protest violence, Dershowitz said it would be inconceivable to think the jurors were not consciously or subconsciously weighing the impact their decision would have on society.

""That should never, ever be allowed to seep into a jury room,"" Dershowitz said, adding that he has no confidence the verdict was ""produced by due process and the rule of law.""



What about an appeal?

Dershowitz predicted Chauvin's case will ultimately be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which he said would be Chauvin's best hope for a conviction reversal.

Citing Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Al Sharpton, Dershowitz said, ""These folks took what they did right out of the playbook of the Deep South in the 1920s when prominent public officials would whoop up the crowds in front of the courthouse, demanding conviction of black people and acquittal of white people.""

""The Supreme Court and other courts reversed convictions based on that because jurors should not be intimidated or influenced by what goes on outside the courtroom,"" he added.



Specifically, Dershowitz cited the infamous Sam Sheppard murder trial in the 1950s. Sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife, but was exonerated a decade later. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately determined Sheppard was deprived of a fair trial because the jury was tainted by media attention that engulfed the case.

Dershowitz also said Judge Peter Cahill, the judge who presided over Chauvin's trial, supports his hypothesis.

On Monday, Cahill castigated Waters for urging protesters to ""get more confrontational"" if Chauvin was not found guilty. ""You got to make sure that they know we mean business,"" Waters said.

Cahill said Waters' comments could be used by the defense in an appeal to argue for a mistrial.

""I will give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,"" Cahill said after denying the defense's motion for a mistrial over Waters' remarks.

""This goes back to what I've been saying from the beginning. I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law, and to the judicial branch and our function,"" the judge added. ""I think if they want to give their opinions they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the Constitution to respect a coequal branch of government.""

""Their failure to do so is abhorrent!"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dershowitz-predicts-chauvin-conviction-overturned-on-appeal,2021-04-21
Florida Gov. DeSantis says he will sign Fairness in Women's Sports bill banning trans athletes from competing against females,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Thursday pledged to sign his state's version of a bill to protect fairness in women's sports by prohibiting transgender athletes who were born males from competing against females.

In a surprise move this week, Florida Republicans in the state House revived the Fairness in Women's Sports Act after it died in Senate committee by attaching it as an amendment to SB 1028, a charter school bill. The legislation would ban males from competing on women's sports teams at the public secondary and collegiate level.

The House passed the bill Wednesday in a vote of 79-37, mostly along party lines. The state Senate passed the bill 23-16 later that evening. If DeSantis signs the bill into law, Florida would be the seventh state to adopt a form of the Fairness in Women's Sports bill though 30 states are considering similar legislation.

At a Fox News town hall Thursday evening with other Republican governors, Gov. DeSantis said he was eager to sign the bill.

""Oh yeah, we're going to protect our girls. I have a 4-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old daughter and they're both very athletic. And we want to have opportunities for our girls,"" DeSantis told host Laura Ingraham. ""They deserve an even playing field and that's what we're doing with what Mississippi did, with what Florida did, and I know with what other states are going to do.""

""So I look forward to being able to sign that into law,"" he said.

Critics including state Democrats and LGBTQ activists have assailed the bill as ""cruel"" and discriminatory against transgender youth.



""It's horrific,"" Gina Duncan, the director of transgender equality at Equality Florida, said. ""This bill shows not only their lack of humanity but their astounding ignorance about the transgender community, not understanding that trans girls are girls and transgender women are women.

""Despite impassioned pleas by legislators who have gay and transgender kids and grandkids imploring supporters of this bill to understand the harm that it will do, Republicans followed their marching orders to implement this orchestrated culture war and move this bill forward.""

""If they want to play, let them play, there's nothing to stop them,"" said state Sen. Victor Torres (D), who's grandchild is transgender and identifies as female. ""We thought it was dead, but obviously some don't care.""

Republican supporters of the legislation countered that it's unfair that athletes who were born with male DNA, male skeletal structures, and have male muscle development are allowed to compete with girls.

""I thought it was common knowledge that men are stronger than women,"" Sen. Kelli Stargel (R) said. ""We're just trying to protect them.""

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R), who participated in the town hall with DeSantis and was the first Republican governor to sign a fairness in women's sports bill into law this year, said Thursday that biological males should not be able to compete with girls for scholarships and other opportunities.

""This is an issue I'm passionate about and the reason I'm passionate about it is because I have a 16-year-old daughter, a 14-year-old daughter, and a 9-year-old daughter and they play basketball and they play soccer and they play every sport they can possible play,"" Reeves said. ""And the reality is biological males should not be allowed to compete with them for athletic scholarships. They should not be allowed to be able to compete with them for opportunities.""



Adding to the controversy over these bills is the National Collegiate Athletic Association's stated opposition to legislation it claims discriminates against transgender athletes. The NCAA has threatened to pull championship games from states that pass laws barring biological males from playing on girls sports teams, leading some Republican lawmakers and governors to hesitate over enacting laws that apply to collegiate sports.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) outraged social conservatives by vetoing her state's version of the Fairness in Women's Sports bill, saying the portion of the bill that applies to colleges and universities was ""unrealistic in the context of collegiate athletics.""

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) likewise vetoed a similar bill, claiming that there was no evidence that girls sports were in ""immediate danger"" of becoming unfair and deferring to the state athletic association to determine the rules governing high school and collegiate sports.

But social conservative activists are making clear that Republicans who want their support must stand up to protect women's sports.

""Women's sports has been a breakthrough issue showing how to win on cultural issues,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling said.

""This is now the status quo for the Republican Party,"" he added. ""You must support protecting women's sports to be a contender in the party.""

CNN admits Gov. Ron DeSantis succeeded despite refusing to lock down Florida and social media is melting down,"A CNN report admitted that the pandemic plan by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida has been largely a success, and many on social media fired off angry responses at the article and the journalist who authored it.

The article by CNN's chief national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny cautiously admits that DeSantis has been able to save the economy of the state without the massive death toll that many were predicting.

As many parts of the country embark on an uneasy march toward normalcy, Florida is not only back in business -- it's been in business for the better part of the past year. DeSantis' gamble to take a laissez faire approach appears to be paying off -- at least politically, at least for now, as other governors capturing attention in the opening phase of the pandemic now face steeper challenges.

Zeleny goes on to document how Florida is in the middle of the pack when it comes to the coronavirus cases, ranking 23rd worst out of 50 states. But California, which was first to lock down statewide and implemented very stringent lockdown policies, came in at 22nd.

The article also pointed out that Florida is booming compared to other states that locked down their economies.

DeSantis refused to implement a mask mandate in the first place, making him an outlier a year ago. At the time, he was hewing closely to President Donald Trump's playbook, which he argued at the time was good for business.



The unemployment rate in Florida is 4.8 %, according to the latest figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to 6.8% in Texas, 8.8% in New York and 9% in California.

Although Zeleny was cautious in his praise and noted the controversy surrounding accusations of privileged access to vaccinations in Florida, critics of DeSantis were furious at any concession to the Republican governor.

Many of them took to Twitter to express their outrage:

""CNN you're out of your f***ing minds for this headline,"" tweeted DJ Ross One.

""Get the f*** out of here with this s**t,"" replied screenwriter Dan Hernandez.

""CNN pushing this narrative that DeSantis is some kind of hero is f***ing bulls***,"" said David Weiner.

""Like, What The Actual F***, CNN? Don't you have access to the same information *I* have on DeSantis' execrable record on his pandemic response?"" replied another user who identified herself as a mother.

""Who the f**k wrote this nonsense article? Desantis has shunned science and silenced the public health officials in his state. He makes sure upper class, white people get vaccinated over minorities. He's such a leader,"" responded another sore user.

DeSantis came in second in popularity behind former President Donald Trump in the last CPAC straw poll, and is considered by many to be a presidential favorite in 2024.

"Ron DeSantis tells NCAA, 'woke corporations' where they can shove their threats over transgender sports law","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) revealed Tuesday exactly where the NCAA and ""woke corporations"" can shove their money and events if they don't like Florida's effort to protect girl's sports from transgender athletes.

What is the background?

On Tuesday, DeSantis signed into law the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act,"" which prohibits biological males who identify as transgender females from competing on female sports teams, both in high school and at the collegiate level.

The purpose of the law, according to DeSantis, is to protect the integrity of women's sports.

""The bill that we're doing today will ensure fairness for women athletes for years to come in the state of Florida,"" DeSantis said. ""It says that athletic teams or sports that are designated for females are open to females. And we're going to go based off biology.""



How did DeSantis respond to corporate pressure?

Speaking with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, DeSantis said he called the bluff of organizations like the NCAA.

The NCAA, the sanctioning body for most collegiate athletics, threatened to withdraw events from states that pass laws preventing biological males who identify as transgender females from competing in women's organized sports.

Recalling his response to the NCAA's threats, DeSantis made it clear the pressure would not work. ""To hell with these events,"" DeSantis said.

""I remember the NCAA put out a statement saying any state that enacts this, we're not going to hold events there. So I called the speaker of the House in Florida and I said, 'Did you hear what they said?' And he's like, 'Yeah.' I said, 'We definitely got to get this done.' You can't be cowed by these organizations, or particularly by woke corporations, from doing the right thing,"" DeSantis explained.

The Republican governor said protecting women's athletics is worth the cost of losing NCAA events.

""We have to protect our girls. It is discriminatory to force them to compete against biological males,"" DeSantis said. ""If the price of having a tournament is that I have to deny equal opportunity to hundreds of thousands of young girl and women athletes throughout Florida, I am much more willing to stand with the girls. And to hell with these events.""

""If corporations want to come in and try to bully us around, they are going to go nowhere. It's going to be like hitting their head against a brick wall,"" he added.

What has the NCAA said?



The NCAA has not yet responded to Florida's new law or DeSantis' remarks.

However, as the New York Times noted, the NCAA's statement in April failed to explicitly pledge to pull events from states that enact laws not favorable to LGBT activists, suggesting the NCAA's woke appeasement is all bark and no bite.

In fact, the NCAA's failure to act has enraged LGBT advocacy groups, like the Human Rights Campaign.

HRC president Alphonso David said recently:

The NCAA should be ashamed of themselves for violating their own policy by choosing to hold championships in states that are not healthy, safe, or free from discrimination for their athletes. It also undermines their commitment to transgender participation in NCAA events, for which they have had an inclusive policy for years. While we have remained hopeful about the NCAA stepping up to the plate and taking action like they have done in the past, they are willfully ignoring that commitment this time, despite repeated attempts by the Human Rights Campaign and others to communicate the harsh and harmful negative impacts of this legislation, which is not just pending but enacted into law in seven states, with South Dakota also creating two Executive Orders to similar discriminatory affect. Their words will not stop discrimination, only actions to deliver real consequences to states that dare to discriminate. The NCAA must face scrutiny and public pressure to do the right thing.

Indeed, the NCAA even recently selected the University of Florida, located in Gainesville, as host of a regional tournament for NCAA baseball.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-ncaa-threats-transgender-sports-law,2021-06-02
DeSantis press secretary calls out NHL's discrimination,"UPDATE posted at 2:22 a.m. EST:

The NHL's LinkedIn post appears to have been deleted.

Fox News Digital reported that the NHL noted in a statement that the ""original wording of the LinkedIn post associated with the event was not accurate.""

""The Pathway to Hockey Summit is an informational and networking event designed to encourage all individuals to consider a career in our game – and, in particular, alert those who might not be familiar with hockey to the opportunities it offers,"" the spokesperson for the NHL said, according to the outlet, which also reported that the spokesperson indicated that the event is open to people ages 18 and up.

Original story below:

The National Hockey League posted an event advertisement that indicates an event is only open to certain groups of people, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is calling on the NHL to drop and decry the discriminatory eligibility requirements.



The NHL posted about its ""Pathway to Hockey Summit,"" describing it as ""a career event for diverse job seekers"" and noting, ""Participants must be 18 years of age or older, based in the U.S., and identify as female, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, Indigenous, LGBTQIA+, and/or a person with a disability. Veterans are also welcome and encouraged to attend.""

The event is slated to occur in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on February 2.

DeSantis press secretary Bryan Griffin issued a statement calling for the NHL to delete and condemn the discriminatory participation requirements.

""Discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida, and we do not abide by the woke notion that discrimination should be overlooked if applied in a politically popular manner or against a politically unpopular demographic. We are fighting all discrimination in our schools and our workplaces, and we will fight it in publicly accessible places of meeting or activity. We call upon the National Hockey League to immediately remove and denounce the discriminatory prohibitions it has imposed on attendance to the 2023 'Pathway to Hockey' summit,"" Griffin said in the statement.

The NHL displayed its ultra-wokeness last year when it made the absurd claims that ""trans women are women. Trans men are men. Nonbinary identity is real."" In point of fact, transgender women are biological men masquerading as women, while transgender men are biological women masquerading as men.

The NHL made the biology-denying remarks in response to someone who had commented on a post about the NHL's support of a tournament made up of transgender and nonbinary players.

""The NHL is proud to support this past weekend's Team Trans Draft Tournament in Middleton, Wisconsin. This was the first tournament comprised entirely of transgender and nonbinary players, with around 80 folks participating! #HockeyIsForEveryone #NHLPride,"" the NHL had tweeted .

Gov. Ron DeSantis signs bill banning biological males from competing on women's sports teams,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed Tuesday a version of the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act"" into law, prohibiting males who identify as transgender females from competing on female sports teams in high school and college.

""We believe in the state of Florida, of protecting the fairness and the integrity of women's athletics,"" DeSantis said at the signing ceremony, standing onstage with teenage girl athletes from Trinity Christian Academy.

""And I can tell you this in Florida, you know, girls are going to play girls' sports and boys are going play boys' sports, that's what we're doing. We're going to make sure that that's the reality,"" he continued. ""So the bill that we're doing today will ensure fairness for women athletes for years to come in the state of Florida. It says that athletic teams or sports that are designated for females are open to females. And we're going to go based off biology.""

DeSantis signed the bill even though the National Collegiate Athletic Association threatened to pull its championship games out of states that ""discriminate"" against transgender athletes. Other companies warned that they would pull their business out of Florida because of the bill. DeSantis didn't care.

""Some of these organizations say they're not going to hold events if you do this, just let me say very clearly, in Florida, we're going to do what's right, will stand up to corporations, they are not going to dictate the policies in this state,"" the governor said. ""We will stand up to groups like the NCAA, who think that they should be able to dictate the policies in different states.""

Democrats and LGBT activists opposed the legislation as well, characterizing the bill as ""unnecessary"" and accused Florida Republicans of acting hatefully toward transgender persons.

Some critics observed that DeSantis signed the bill on June 1, the first day of National LGBTQ Pride Month, which in their view added insult to injury.

""Appalling,"" tweeted state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-Orlando). ""First day of LGBTQ Pride Month and Gov. Ron DeSantis signs SB 1028 which bans trans kids from school sports. FHSAA has allowed trans kids to participate in FL since 2013 with ZERO problems. This fuels transphobia and puts vulnerable kids at risk for no good reason.""

""By signing a heartless ban on transgender kids in sports, @GovRonDeSantis is marginalizing an entire community,"" Florida agriculture commissioner Niki Fried tweeted. ""Signing it on the first day of #Pride2021 is especially cruel.""

Fried, the only Florida Democrat currently holding statewide elected office, announced a bid for the Democratic nomination to challenge DeSantis for governor Tuesday.

""Florida should stand for inclusivity, equality, and liberty — not peddling hate for political points,"" she said.

A standalone version of the Fairness in Women's Sports Act had previously died in the state legislature, but Republicans revived the bill as an amendment to a larger bill related to charter schools.



The final version of the bill removed some of the most controversial portions in the first draft, including a requirement that student athletes undergo testosterone or genetic testing and have their genitalia examined before joining sports teams.

Almost immediately after DeSantis signed the bill, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, declared it would sue Florida.

""The Human Rights Campaign will always stand up to anti-equality forces on behalf of transgender kids, and that is exactly what we plan to do by legally challenging this ban on the participation of transgender girls and women in sports,"" HRC President Alphonso David said in a statement. ""Gov. DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are legislating based on a false, discriminatory premise that puts the safety and well-being of transgender children on the line. Transgender kids are kids; transgender girls are girls. Like all children, they deserve the opportunity to play sports with their friends and be a part of a team. Transgender youth must not be deprived of the opportunity to learn important skills of sportsmanship, healthy competition, and teamwork. The harmful provisions added to SB 1028 will not just impact transgender people in Florida. All Floridians will have to face the consequences of this anti-transgender legislation — including economic harm, expensive taxpayer-funded legal battles, and a tarnished reputation. In Florida, we are ensuring that there are legal consequences to pay for being on the wrong side of history.""

The bill's supporters say legislation was needed to prevent unfair competition in women's sports.

""This bill is very simply about making sure that women can safely compete, have opportunities and physically be able to excel in a sport that they trained for, prepared for and work for,"" said state Sen. Kelli Stargel, who sponsored the legislation.

""This is nothing about anybody being discriminated against,"" she said. ""It's solely so that women have an opportunity to compete in women's sports.""

Florida joins West Virginia, Montana, and Idaho in banning transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.

"Despite 'lofty goal' for 5,000 attendees, job fair meant to find workers for Denver International Airport concessions only drew about 100 people","A job fair meant to find workers to fill some of the numerous job openings at concessions at the Denver International Airport drew around 100 people, far fewer than had been hoped.

""We've got anything from entry-level positions all the way up to top executive management available out here,"" Denver Concessionaires Association President Dennis Deslongchamp said, according to KMGH-TV. ""We've got a very lofty goal to see about 5,000 people show up today.""

But, according to Deslongchamp, only around 100 individuals showed up at the event.

A news release, which indicated there are hundreds of opportunities up for grabs, declared that more than 160 concessions had joined together to host the event at Empower Field at Mile High in the United Club Level West.

Deslongchamp's team and airport leadership helped organize the event, according to KMGH, which reported that the job fair included representatives from almost 170 concessions and that the aim was to hire around 1,000 people.

""We are at such a staffing deficit that we'd be grateful for just five, but we're looking to hire over 150,"" HR director for Skyport Hospitality Elisa Lalama stated, according to the outlet.



""We were expecting the masses to come knocking on our door,"" Concessions International director of operations Derik Mortenson said, according to KMGH.

The outlet reported that while the company has multiple concessions at Denver International Airport and needs to pick up at least 38 workers, just two individuals applied.



""These are very brick-and-mortar jobs, brick-and-mortar positions, and there's just a change in what's possible now today to earn an income,"" Mortenson noted. ""It's just tough on brick-and-mortar operations to fill the positions that once ... had stacks of applications.""



Last week during an interview on Fox Business, Golden Corral CEO Lance Trenary said that there are thousands of job positions open.

""We currently have over 5,000 open co-worker positions throughout our company.

Disney bucks law dissolving special district by citing 'obscure provision in state law',"The Walt Disney Corporation is quietly refuting Florida's attempt to revoke the special tax district that governs Walt Disney World.

What is the background?

After Disney promised to fight for the repeal of a new Florida law that protects young students K-3 from classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, the Florida Legislature passed a law dissolving the Reedy Creek Improvement District by June 2023.

In 1967, the Florida Legislature passed the Reedy Creek Improvement Act permitting Disney to develop 39 square miles of land in the Orlando-area. The law established the RDIC, a special taxing district that essentially permits Disney to ""act with the same authority and responsibility as a county government.""

However, revoking Disney's special status could leave Florida taxpayers on the hook for more than $1 billion in bond debt, legislators and tax experts warned.

What is Disney saying now?

According to the Miami Herald, Florida Republicans ""failed to notice an obscure provision in state law"" that would make their actions illegal.

The statutory provision asserts that the, ""State of Florida pledges ... it will not limit or alter the rights of the District ... until all such bonds together with interest thereon ... are fully met and discharged.""

Thus Reedy Creek said it will continue normal operations:

In light of the State of Florida’s pledge to the District’s bondholders, Reedy Creek expects to explore its options while continuing its present operations, including levying and collecting its ad valorem taxes and collecting its utility revenues, paying debt service on its ad valorem tax bonds and utility revenue bonds, complying with its bond covenants and operating and maintaining its properties.

Florida attorney Jacob Schumer made the same conclusion. If the dissolution of Reedy Creek somehow moves forward, it ""will have to wait until all of its bonds are paid in full,"" Schumer wrote at Bloomberg Tax.

This means the dissolution cannot go forward unless Florida fulfills the costly bond obligations.

What is DeSantis saying?

DeSantis is not backing down. His office released a statement on Thursday vowing that Disney ""will pay its fair share of taxes.""

""As Governor DeSantis has said, Disney will pay its fair share of taxes, and abolishing the special district will not cause tax increases for the residents of any area of Florida,"" the statement said.

""If it's true that the repeal of the special district would hand Disney a tax break, and the local taxpayers would be on the hook for this bail-out to benefit Disney ... then why would Disney oppose repealing their special district? Indeed, why wouldn't Disney have lobbied to get rid of the special district long ago?"" the statement added.

The statement did not address the obscure Florida statute that could block the dissolution of Reedy Creek.

DOJ to invest $57M in the criminal justice system to support ‘reform and advance racial equity’,"The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that it will invest nearly $57 million in the criminal justice system to support reform efforts and “advance racial equity.” The department hopes the awards will promote fairness in the corrections systems and “align criminal justice practices with the latest science.”



The grants will be distributed by the DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs and are designed to support the state, territory, local, and tribal levels. A portion of the awards will be used to address wrongful convictions and protect the constitutional rights of defendants and incarcerated individuals, the Justice Department noted.

The Office of Justice Programs stated that in compliance with Executive Order 13985, when making award decisions, it will “give priority consideration to applications that include project(s) that will promote racial equity and the removal of barriers to access and opportunity for communities that have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by inequality.”

“Equal justice is not a self-executing proposition — it takes work to make it real — and it will take a collective commitment from all of us at the federal, state and local levels to bring that ideal to life,” said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. “These investments make good on a pledge by the Justice Department to promote public safety and realize the promise of a just society that recognizes the dignity and humanity of everyone.”

The announcement listed a summary of 12 grants that the DOJ hopes will impact reform and equity efforts.

The Justice Counts Implementation Program will receive $9.8 million, the largest award announced by the Justice Department this week. The funds will help “states adopt a core set of criminal justice metrics so that policymakers have access to actionable data to make policy and budgetary decisions.” The program stated that it would enable state governments to improve their goal-setting capacity, measure progress, and make data-driven policy changes.

Eight million will be awarded to the Field Initiated: Encouraging Innovation program to research and implement innovative approaches to reducing crime and building trust between the justice system and the community. The program is also focused on preventing and responding to overdoses.

The Reimagining Justice: Testing a New Model of Community Safety initiative hopes to use its $3 million grant to find innovative solutions to reducing crime in high-crime neighborhoods experiencing low-level offenses.

“Four of this year’s Field Initiated awards are focused on the pretrial phase of case processing, and include innovations like text message reminders for upcoming court dates — we’ve come to expect such things from our doctor’s office, why not the court system?” said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta in Wednesday statement. “These programs — in New York, Texas and New Jersey — will help address underlying conditions and untreated needs of those coming into the system. And they’ll expand deflection and diversion opportunities.”

The Upholding the Rule of Law and Preventing Wrongful Convictions Program will receive $7.6 million to support individuals with post-conviction claims of innocence. Another $6.5 million will be granted to the Postconviction Testing of DNA Evidence program to cover costs associated with post-conviction case reviews that might prove innocence.

Almost $800,000 will be awarded to Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Justice System: A Study of Existing Evidence and Public Policy Implications program to “conduct a comprehensive evidence-based analysis of existing evidence to examine how observed racial and ethnic disparities in the justice system might be reduced through public policy.”

The DOJ announced that approximately $12.2 million would be awarded to four programs focused on aiding victims by increasing access to legal services and providing additional resources to victim-serving organizations.

Gupta stated that “for the first time, our Office for Victims of Crime is issuing a grant award to better understand the service needs of persons harmed by their interactions with the criminal justice system, determine whether existing services can meet the needs of this population and offer recommendations for appropriate service delivery, resources, partnerships and tools.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-to-invest-57m-in-the-criminal-justice-system-to-support-reform-and-advance-racial-equity,2022-09-29
Domestic terrorist group Jane's Revenge threatens escalated violence against pro-life ministries,"A radical pro-abortion group that has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on U.S. pro-life organizations in the past month has declared ""open season"" on pro-life ministries in a letter that makes more terrorist threats.

Days after a man was arrested outside U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home for allegedly planning to kill the justice, the pro-abortion anarchist group Jane's Revenge published a new ""communiqué"" threatening pro-life organizations with a campaign of violence if they do not cease their operations.

""Your thirty days expired yesterday. We offered an honourable way out. You could have walked away. Now the leash is off. And we will make it as hard as possible for your campaign of oppression to continue,"" Jane's Revenge states.

""We have demonstrated in the past month how easy and fun it is to attack. We are versatile, we are mercurial, and we answer to no one but ourselves. We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.""

Jane's Revenge has claimed responsibility for at least 16 acts of vandalism or arson that have targeted pro-life groups in the past month. The violent campaign began on May 8, when Jane's Revenge took credit for a Molotov cocktail attack on Wisconsin Family Action, a pro-life group headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin.

This initial attack and others followed the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that indicated the court has voted to uphold Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban and overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. An official court ruling for Dobbs is expected sometime this month or in early July.



After the attack in Wisconsin, Jane's Revenge demanded ""the disbanding of all anti-choice establishments, fake clinics, and violent anti-choice groups within the next thirty days"" and promised that ""the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive"" if their demands aren't met.



Now, the criminal group has promised to escalate violence against pro-life organizations beyond ""fire and graffiti.""

""From here forward, any anti-choice group who closes their doors, and stops operating will no longer be a target. But until you do, it’s open season, and we know where your operations are. The infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive. We will never stop, back down, slow down, or retreat,"" Jane's Revenge declared.

""Through attacking, we find joy, courage, and strip the veneer of impenetrability held by these violent institutions.""

More than 100 House Republicans have called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate the attacks and vandalism targeting pro-life groups as acts of domestic terrorism.

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) spearheaded a letter signed by at least 124 GOP lawmakers that urged the attorney general to act on the Biden administration's stated objective of combatting domestic extremism and investigate the attacks against pro-life groups.

""As you know, the Department of Homeland Security is anticipating further violence and unrest in the coming months upon the final release of the Dobbs opinion, stating that these threats are 'likely to persist and may increase leading up to and following the issuing of the Court’s official ruling',"" the letter states, referring to a leaked DHS memo warning of anticipated political violence surrounding the Supreme Court's abortion decision.

""With this warning made clear, the Department of Justice must act swiftly to investigate and prosecute recent domestic terrorist attacks against pro-life organizations and dissuade future perpetrators of such violence. These attacks have the intended effect of chilling the free exercise of religion and speech, undermining the constitutional rights of Americans.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) separately sent a letter to Garland demanding an immediate response to the terrorist threats from Jane's Revenge.

“Despite the damage that has already been done and even though these groups have kept their promise to raise the violent stakes, the DOJ has not been faithful to its promise of ensuring the public’s safety against these violent, radical activists,” Rubio wrote. “To date, there has not been a single charge brought against any individual or group despite the countless pro-life centers in America that have been firebombed and vandalized in recent months.”

Rep. Byron Donalds calls for president to resign: 'Biden has lost complete and total confidence of the American people',"Freshman Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida (R) is calling for President Joe Biden to resign from office immediately.

""It has become clear that President Biden has lost complete and total confidence of the American people through this haphazard decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. This botched withdrawal is currently threatening the lives of our servicemen and women, the stability in the region, and our integrity on the global stage,"" the congressman said in a statement.

""As Commander-in-Chief, Biden is directly responsible for commanding our brave troops with a coherent, strategically intelligent, and sound operation that keeps our Armed Services, citizens, and allied partners out of harm's way. He has failed on all fronts,"" the lawmaker declared.

President Biden and his administration have been facing a chorus of criticism for bungling the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Taliban has swiftly seized control in the country and taken the capital city of Kabul. Chaos is unfolding amid efforts to evacuate Americans and others from the country. Weapons supplied to Afghanistan by the U.S. have fallen into the Taliban's hands.

""As an elected member of the United States House of Representatives, I swore an oath to protect our Constitution, and I take that solemn responsibility with utmost seriousness,"" the lawmaker's statement said. ""In good faith, I cannot look my constituents in the eye, many of whom are veterans, and tell them that the President of the United States can perform the duties entrusted to him by the Constitution. Calling on the leader of the free world to resign his office immediately weighs heavy on my heart, but this must happen to restore American's safety both at home and abroad, our honor, and faith in the Chief Executive to faithfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""

While some on Twitter agreed with the lawmaker's statement, others criticized Donalds.

""You are 100% correct on all fronts. I'm a vet and I'm absolutely sick over this,"" a tweet said.

""Thank you for standing up for our troops and our nation!"" another tweet declared.

""If he refuses to resign, impeach him. He is unfit for office,"" another tweet said.

""Lol. You just look foolish. Trying to grasp some headlines?"" someone tweeted.

""Disgusting pandering here. Have you no shame? Never mind. You're a Republican. I answered my own question,"" another tweet said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/donalds-calls-for-president-to-resign-biden-has-lost-complete-and-total-confidence-of-the-american-people,2021-08-24
Fox News reporter uses Biden's own words to expose hypocrisy on decision to approve oil drilling in Venezuela,"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy grilled John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator at the National Security Council, on Monday over the Biden administration's decision to permit Chevron to drill in Venezuela.

What is the background?

Over the holiday weekend, the Biden administration granted California-based Chevron a license to resume drilling operations in Venezuela.

The license is good for six months and requires the Venezuelan regime to continue good-faith negotiations on holding free and fair elections. The development is a partial rollback of Trump-era sanctions. But top American leaders made it clear those sanctions will be implemented again if President Nicolás Maduro’s government reneges on its part of the deal.

What happened?

At the White House press briefing, Doocy asked Kirby about the hypocritical nature of Biden's decision.

On one hand, approving oil drilling in Venezuela seemingly takes away from American oil companies, whose drilling and the revenue it generates would benefit the U.S. On the other hand, if Biden wants to stop oil drilling because of climate change, why is drilling in Venezuela acceptable?

""Why is it that President Biden would rather let U.S. companies drill for oil in Venezuela than here in the U.S.?"" Doocy first asked.

Kirby responded by claiming Doocy's question is ""not an accurate take on the president’s view."" But Doocy used Biden's own words — in which earlier this month he promised ""no more drilling"" — to show that it is, in fact, Biden's view.

But instead of responding to the substance of Doocy's point, Kirby regurgitated a debunked talking point that oil companies are not using thousands of already-approved oil permits.

""The president has issued 9,000 permits for drilling on U.S. federal lands — 9,000 of them are being unused,"" Kirby said.

Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and John Kirby youtu.be

""Does the president think there’s some benefit to the climate to drill oil in Venezuela and not here?"" Doocy followed up.

But again, Kirby did not directly answer, instead claiming the development ""has nothing to do"" with the climate, despite Democrats emphatically claiming that oil drilling impacts the climate.

""Again, there are 9,000 unused permits here in the United States on federal land that oil and gas companies can and should take advantage of — 9,000. And we’re talking about one there in Venezuela,"" Kirby excused.

That many permits? Really?

It is not true that Biden has issued 9,000 permits for oil and gas drilling on federal lands. That number, in fact, comprises permits issued under Biden and former President Donald Trump.

But it is also not true that just because an oil company is not immediately drilling where a permit has been approved that companies are not working to utilize them. A lease approval indeed does not even mean the land for which a lease has been approved will reliably produce oil.

But if the land is suitable for oil production, companies have to find, acquire, and develop that oil — a process that includes more regulatory red tape.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doocy-kirby-chevron-venezuela,2022-11-29
Dozens of New York restaurant owners sue Gov. Cuomo over coronavirus restrictions,"Dozens of restaurant owners in upstate and western New York have joined a lawsuit that has been filed against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D), alleging that state restrictions that are keeping their facilities closed are arbitrary and not based on science.

The lawsuit was originally filed in the week before Christmas, according to WKBW-TV in Buffalo, and by last week had over 40 restaurants named as plaintiffs. The lawsuit alleges that the restaurant owners have been deprived of constitutional rights without a rational, scientific basis.

Specifically, restaurant owners in Erie County complain that the ""orange"" designation applied to the county by the state requires them to remain closed while restaurants that are ""around the corner"" in neighboring ""yellow"" counties remain open. They note that according to the state's own figures, less than 1.5 percent of COVID-19 cases in the state are traceable to restaurants or bars.

According to a Fox News report, restaurant owner Paul Santora, who owns Santora's Pizza Pub and Grill in Erie County, claimed, ""Everywhere else in our district and everywhere around us basically are operating fully and [are] having the best season of their careers, and right around the corner from us it's the same way.""

Santora continued, ""For us, we really need the message to be consistent. One day they're going and they're concentrating on percentage rates of positive cases and shuts us down to orange, and then all of a sudden it changes the hospital beds and it keeps us in orange.""

Santora's attorney, Corey Hogan, told Fox News, ""And we suggested to the judge, forgetting the constitutionality issues, let's just look at the fairness of it. The state itself has admitted that restaurants are not the problem. Gov. Cuomo said that. He also said hair salons are not the problem. They've been closed down. Now they've been allowed to open.""

Cuomo, who has failed to stop New York from being one of the worst states in the country for the coronavirus pandemic and has been widely criticized for a number of public missteps — including forcibly placing infected persons in nursing homes, potentially leading to thousands of deaths — was not impressed with the lawsuit.

A spokesman for Cuomo told WKBW, ""We get sued virtually every day for virtually every action taken during this pandemic, and frankly I've lost track of all the frivolous suits filed against us. We are moving heaven and earth to contain this virus and we know some people are unhappy, but better to be unhappy than sick or worse.""

In spite of strict lockdown measures, some of which have previously been ruled unconstitutional, New York has continued to see worse coronavirus outcomes than other states. By any objective comparison, New York has seen far worse results than Florida, in spite of the fact that Florida has more people and an older population than New York. As Townhall political editor Guy Benson noted, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been widely criticized by media figures for not instituting many of the same policies as Cuomo, even though his state has objectively fared better during the pandemic.

Drag queen RuPaul at Emmys tells 'kids out there watching' that 'you have a tribe that is waiting for you ... come on to Mama Ru!',"Drag queen RuPaul in his Emmy Award acceptance speech Sunday night thanked ""all of our lovely children on our show from all around the world ... they are so gracious to tell their stories of courage and how to navigate this difficult life — even more difficult today.""

The host of ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" — which took home Outstanding Competition Series — then added, ""And for you kids out there watching, you have a tribe that is waiting for you. We are waiting for you, baby. Come on to Mama Ru!""

Competition Program: 73rd Emmys youtu.be

Huh?

RuPaul reportedly has referred to performers on ""Drag Race"" as his children — so doing the same during his acceptance speech Sunday wasn't necessarily out of the ordinary for the host. In addition, ""Drag Race"" competitors all are at least 19 years of age.

In a 2018 interview, RuPaul used similar language in referring to the ""queens"" who try out for ""Drag Race,"" saying that ""they are teaching young people how to ... find their tribe."" He also referred to ""Drag Race"" contestants as ""kids.""

So, in light of all that, it's fair to conclude that RuPaul — who is 60 — very well could have meant adults when he said, ""And for you kids out there watching, you have a tribe that is waiting for you. We are waiting for you, baby. Come on to Mama Ru!""

But RuPaul didn't make that clear to Emmys watchers. Indeed, Deadline reported that the host ""dedicated his [Emmy] win to the LGBTQ community and queer youth.""

In addition — and this should come as no surprise — minors do watch ""RuPaul's Drag Race.""

""I wasn't myself at all. Nobody was gay, and I was an easy target for bullies. I felt abnormal,"" Brandon Austin told Insider earlier this year in regard to his high school struggles. ""Then, at 16, my best friend introduced me to 'RuPaul's Drag Race.'""

Insider's piece — titled ""By championing self-expression, 'RuPaul's Drag Race' has encouraged a generation of young LGBTQ+ fans to come out"" — also said that the TV show has been a fixture in the lives of Gen-Z watchers and ""has been integral to their being out and proud about their identities.""

Austin added to the outlet that ""seeing people being accepted for who they are made me realize that I am normal.""

And RuPaul is no stranger to interacting with underage drag queens — including Desmond Is Amazing, whose rise to fame has been extensively covered by TheBlaze.

Here's the pair at RuPaul's Drag Con NYC in 2017, in which the host tells the ""gorgeous little queen"" that he's ""the future of America"":",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-queen-rupaul-emmys-kids-mama-ru,2021-09-20
"Economists warn Americans should budget an extra $5,200 this year to combat effects of inflation","Bloomberg economists say that Americans should consider budgeting an extra $5,200 this year — or $433 monthly — in order to fight the effects of inflation.

The U.S. Consumer Price Index has indicated that prices across the board have skyrocketed at the fastest pace since 1982.

What are the details?

In a Tuesday report, Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Andrew Husby warned that inflation is set to cost the average U.S. household at least $5,200 more year over year.

Approximately $2,200 of that inflation tax will come as a result of higher food and energy prices, and inflation is only set to get worse over the next several months.

In the report, the economists said, ""Accelerated depletion of savings will increase the urgency for those staying on the sidelines to join the labor force, and the resulting increase in labor supply will likely dampen wage growth.""

On Tuesday night, Bloomberg Markets tweeted a graphic illustrating the rising costs and captioned it, ""Inflation will mean the average U.S. household has to spend an extra $5,200 this year compared to last year for the same consumption basket, according to estimates by Bloomberg Economics[.]""



What else?

A Gallup poll released on Tuesday stated that the share of Americans who rate inflation as the top issue facing the United States is at its highest in nearly 40 years — and has doubled month over month.

Gallup's Lydia Saad wrote, ""Inflation began rising as a public concern last fall, after being a nonissue for Americans throughout 2020. It registered no more than 2% of mentions in 2021 until October, when 5% cited it. But the percentage has increased more in the past month — seven percentage points to 17% — than in any month since the upward trend began. This increase in concern comes as the U.S. inflation rate continues to climb, and is now at its highest point in 40 years.""

The poll also found that a large share of Americans polled were increasingly pessimistic about the state of the economy, with at least 75% of them admitting they believe economic conditions across the country were only getting worse.

""Americans also have a rather bleak view of current economic conditions, with just 22% considering them excellent or good while 35% term them 'only fair' and 44% poor,"" Saad added. ""The combined only fair/poor percentage has been steady near 80% since November.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/economists-warn-americans-should-budget-an-extra-5200-this-year-to-combat-effects-of-inflation,2022-03-30
Biden administration fully cancels some student loan debt after reversing Trump-era policy,"The Department of Education took new steps last week to provide certain federal student loan borrowers complete debt relief.

The announcement came as Democrats explore how to cancel student debt. More than 40 million Americans have federal student loan debt totaling more than $1.7 trillion. Debt payments are currently suspended due to financial hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

What is the DoE's plan?

Perhaps preparing to take even larger steps in the near future, the Education Department said student loan borrowers can apply for full debt cancellation if their college engaged in fraud or other financial misconduct.

The government estimates that $1 billion in student loans will receive ""cancellation"" as a result, which will benefit 72,000 borrowers.

""Borrowers deserve a simplified and fair path to relief when they have been harmed by their institution's misconduct,"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said. ""A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt.""

More from the Department of Education:

Current provisions in federal law called ""borrower defense to repayment"" or ""borrower defense"" allow federal borrowers to seek cancellation of their William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans if their institution engaged in certain misconduct. Beginning today, the Department will ensure that borrowers with approved borrower defense claims to date will have a streamlined path to receiving full loan discharges. This includes borrowers with previously approved claims that received less than a full loan discharge.

The new guidance defines ""full relief"" as cancellation of 100% of the borrower's debt, ""reimbursement of any amounts paid on the loans, where appropriate under the regulations,"" ""requests to credit bureaus to remove any related negative credit reporting,"" and ""reinstatement of federal student aid eligibility.""

What is the background?

According to the Washington Post, the new policy reverses one implemented under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and revives another implemented during the Obama administration.

Students are entitled to a discharge of their debt when their college uses illegal and deceptive tactics to persuade them to borrow, but the Trump administration tried to limit that relief. DeVos created a methodology for processing claims that compared median earnings of graduates who have made debt relief claims with those of graduates from comparable programs. The bigger the difference, the more relief an applicant will receive.



Critics of the policy said graduate earnings were a faulty measure as many applicants never completed their degree and the formula created impossible standards for many to get full relief. The policy was a stark contrast from the Obama administration's practice of granting full cancellation when it determined a college committed fraud.

About 200,000 student loan borrowers have filed for relief under the ""borrower defense to repayment"" statue, the Post reported. The Department of Education is working to find a solution for those borrowers whose debt will not be cancelled under the new guidelines.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/education-department-cancels-1-billion-student-loans,2021-03-21
Truck driver who beat powerful Democrat leaves Tucker Carlson in stitches over what he told defeated opponent,"Edward Durr, the truck driver who dethroned one of New Jersey's most powerful Democratic politicians, left Fox News host Tucker Carlson in stitches Thursday after revealing what he told his political opponent.

What is the background?

New Jersey state State President Steve Sweeney (D) initially refused to concede to Durr after the Associated Press declared Durr the winner of their election contest.

But on Wednesday, six days after the AP called the race, Sweeney, the second most-powerful politician in New Jersey behind the governor, finally conceded defeat to Durr. Sweeney attributed his loss to ""a red wave,"" and vowed to continue working in politics.

What are the details?

During an interview with Carlson, Durr revealed what Sweeney told him during a congratulatory call.

""Have you talked to Sweeney since you dethroned him? I mean, how baffled is he?"" Carlson asked.

""Yes, yes, we had a phone conversation yesterday after he had given his press conference to the media and he congratulated me and just wished me luck to do well for South Jersey,"" Durr explained.

Carlson then asked, ""So he was a gentleman about it?""

After confirming Sweeney had been a ""gentleman,"" Durr told Carlson that he offered to help Sweeney with anything he needs because he is now Sweeney's representative. The remark caused Carlson to laugh out loud.

""And like I told him, I says (sic), you know, if he ever needed anything just give me a call you know, because I'm his representative now,"" Durr said.

""That's so great,"" Carlson responded after belly-laughing.

Inflation crisis is starting to feel intentional: Durr youtu.be

Sweeney reportedly claimed last week that he would not concede to Durr because officials had discovered 12,000 ballots after the election. Sweeney's campaign never said who reported the existence of the allegedly missing ballots or why they were ""recently found"" days after the election.

However, during his concession speech on Wednesday, Sweeney affirmed the fairness of the election.

Electoral College objection divides Senate GOP: Here's where everyone stands,"As Congress prepares to certify the results of the Electoral College on Wednesday, a group of Republican senators have declared their intention to object to accepting President-elect Joe Biden as the winner.

Their objection, while unlikely to prevent Congress from accepting Biden as the victor and the next president of the United States, will trigger hours of debate in Congress about the merits of allegations of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election and will culminate in a vote that will divide the Republican Conference.

So far, 38 of 51 Republican senators who will have a vote on Wednesday have gone on the record about where they stand. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) will not participate in the Electoral College certification Wednesday because his term ended Sunday. If he wins re-election, the results of his election will not be certified before Congress votes. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, (R-Ga.) on the other hand is running in a special election to complete the term of retired Sen. Jonny Isakson (R-Ga.), so she will have a vote even though her election is on the same day as Perdue's.

Those in favor of objecting

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was the first to declare his intention to object to the Electoral College vote, calling out the state of Pennsylvania for, in his words, failing to ""follow their own state election laws"" and accusing ""mega corporations"" including Facebook and Twitter of interfering in the election.

Later, a group of 11 Republican senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced they would object as well. They issued a joint statement on Saturday citing widespread allegations of voter fraud as reason to appoint an Electoral Commission to investigate the 2020 election and conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the returns.

""A fair and credible audit-conducted expeditiously and completed well before January 20-would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next President. We owe that to the People,"" the senators said.

""These are matters worthy of the Congress, and entrusted to us to defend. We do not take this action lightly. We are acting not to thwart the democratic process, but rather to protect it. And every one of us should act together to ensure that the election was lawfully conducted under the Constitution and to do everything we can to restore faith in our Democracy.""

The senators who joined this statement include Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.).

Also, Loeffler, who is running for re-election in a run-off against Democratic candidate, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, that will be decided Tuesday, released a statement Monday lending her support to the objection effort.

""The American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed,"" Loeffler said. ""That's why, on January 6th, I will vote to give President Trump and the American people the fair hearing they deserve and support the objection to the Electoral College certification process.""

That makes 13 Republican senators so far who will object to the Electoral College results from battleground states disputed by President Donald Trump's campaign.

Those opposed to objecting

They are met with opposition from at least 25 of their colleagues, several of which have raised constitutional concerns about whether lawmakers have the ability to disregard election results certified by the states at all.



Four Republican senators including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) joined Democrats in a statement calling for Congress to certify Biden as the winner of the election.

""The voters have spoken, and Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results,"" the senators said collectively.

Romney issued an additional statement on Jan. 3 condemning Cruz and the co-signers of his statement for their ""egregious ploy to reject electors,"" accusing them of dangerously threatening the republic.

""President Trump's lawyers made their case before scores of courts; in every instance, they failed. The Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. The Presidential Voter Fraud Commission disbanded without finding such evidence,"" Romney said.

My fellow Senator Ted Cruz and the co-signers of his statement argue that rejection of electors or an election audit directed by Congress would restore trust in the election. Nonsense. This argument ignores the widely perceived reality that Congress is an overwhelmingly partisan body; the American people wisely place greater trust in the federal courts where judges serve for life. Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgement for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it.



Were Congress to actually reject state electors, partisans would inevitably demand the same any time their candidate had lost. Congress, not voters in the respective states, would choose our presidents.



Adding to this ill-conceived endeavor by some in Congress is the President's call for his supporters to come to the Capitol on the day when this matter is to be debated and decided. This has the predictable potential to lead to disruption, and worse.



I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?

The following are statements from other GOP senators who will oppose the effort to object to the Electoral College vote, as collected by the Washington Post:

Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.): ""Not one of the lawsuits filed found evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities that would have changed the outcome of the election. Similarly, not a single state's outcome changed as a result of requested recounts. Objecting to certified electoral votes submitted by the states will have no impact on the result of the election either. We cannot erode the ideals that generations of Americans have fought to protect simply because we do not like the outcome of the election.""

Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.): ""I am a conservative Republican. Therefore, I must strictly adhere to the United States Constitution. The Constitution clearly limits the role of Congress with respect to presidential elections to the counting of electoral votes that have been certified by the states. The states, consistent with the principles of federalism and a limited national government, possess the sole authority to determine and submit their electors. To vote to reject these state-certified electoral votes would be to act outside the bounds of the Constitution, which I will not do.""

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.): ""As I read the Constitution, there is no constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election wherein the states have certified and sent their Electors. Some of my colleagues believe they have found a path, and while our opinions differ, I do not doubt their good intentions to take steps towards stamping out voter fraud. Importantly, I disagree with their method both in principle and in practice. For their theory to work, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats would have to elect Donald Trump president rather than Joe Biden. That it is not going to happen, not today or any other day.""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska): ""I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and that is what I will do January 6 — just as I strive to do every day as I serve the people of Alaska. I will vote to affirm the 2020 presidential election. The courts and state legislatures have all honored their duty to hear legal allegations and have found nothing to warrant overturning the results. I urge my colleagues from both parties to recognize this and to join me in maintaining confidence in the Electoral College and our elections so that we ensure we have the continues trust of the American people.""

Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.): ""At the end of the day, it's time to move on. We need the electoral college to do its work. It's an integral part of our constitution.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.): Cotton said that he shares ""the concerns of many Arkansans about irregularities in the presidential election"" and will therefore support ""a commission to study the last election and propose reforms to protect the integrity of our elections."" However, he opposes an effort by Congress to overturn the results of the election.

""... the Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states—not Congress. They entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the Electoral College—not Congress. And they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts—not Congress. Under the Constitution and federal law, Congress's power is limited to counting electoral votes submitted by the states.



""If Congress purported to overturn the results of the Electoral College, it would not only exceed that power, but also establish unwise precedents. ...

""Thus, I will not oppose the counting of certified electoral votes on January 6.""

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): ""Many of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result, but our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20. The electoral college has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. The president-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many years.""

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine): ""It's not an effort that I'm going to support. And right now, I'm going to go get sworn in to my fifth term, making history as the first Republican woman senator ever to be elected to a fifth term, and making Maine history by being the first Maine senator since popular election to be elected to a fifth term. So I'm gonna enjoy that for a bit first.""

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.): ""We've now gone through the constitutional process and the electors have voted, so there's a president-elect.""

Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.): ""I think the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that Joe Biden defeated my candidate, Donald Trump, and I have to live with it.""

Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): Responding to a question on whether he would join Hawley's effort to object, Burr said, ""no.""

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.): ""While I share the concerns of those who plan to object, the Founding Fathers did not design a system where the federal legislative branch could reject a state's certified choice for President in favor of their own ... I do not have the authority to overturn the will of other states on behalf of North Dakota, nor do other members have the ability to overturn the will of my state. ...

""In light of these concerns, I will not object to the Electoral College votes when they are counted, and — unless overwhelmingly persuasive evidence is presented before the Senate when we debate the objections – I will not vote to reject the results.""

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.): ""The people of North Dakota do not want Congress to determine their vote, and we should not set the precedent by doing it for other states. Therefore, I do not plan to object.""

Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.): ""I look forward to working with President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to keep our nation safe, update our infrastructure, and provide opportunities to families,"" she said in a letter to a constituent.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.): ""We have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage. But they're wrong – and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.""

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): ""The orderly transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy, and although I supported President Trump, the Electoral College vote today makes clear that Joe Biden is now President-Elect.""

Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.): ""My job on Wednesday is clear, and there are only two things I am permitted to do under the Constitution: ensure the electors are properly certified and count the electoral votes, even when I disagree with the outcome. To challenge a state's certification, given how specific the Constitution is, would be a violation of my oath of office -- that is not something I am willing to do and is not something Oklahomans would want me to do.""

Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.): ""I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.): ""Vice President Biden is the president-elect based on the electoral count.""

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.): On how the vote on the objection will turn out: ""It's going down like a shot dog.""

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas): ""There's good constitutional and other legal grounds to say: You had your day in court, 60 different lawsuits in state courts, you had a chance to appeal those to the Supreme Court, and as I read the law once a state certifies its electoral vote it's conclusive.""

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah): ""... with respect to presidential elections, there is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state's election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented.""

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.): ""Several of my congressional colleagues have made clear their plans to object to counting certified electoral votes from certain states. I will oppose their effort because the will of voters in each state—not political considerations or the individual preferences of senators and representatives—must determine the winner of the presidential election.""

And the rest



There are 13 Republican senators who have not definitively stated their position ahead of Wednesday

Eli Manning defends NY Giants against discrimination claim from Brian Flores: 'I don’t think there was any wrongdoing there',"Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning defended the team against accusations of racial bias by Brian Flores, the former Miami Dolphins head coach who is suing the NFL for discrimination.

The lawsuit from Flores alleges that the Giants management team had already chosen another coach for the job opening, but they went on to interview him. Flores discovered the futility of his interview when New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick accidentally texted him a congratulations, believing he was texting Brian Daboll who later got the job.

Manning said on Wednesday that the Giants did nothing wrong in his opinion.

“I know the Giants organization. I know they do everything possible to give everybody a fair chance,"" said Manning to the New York Post.

""They don’t care, minority or not, they are looking for the best possible candidate,"" he added. ""They are going to do everything properly to look for that perfect candidate. So, I don’t think there was any wrongdoing there.”

Manning clarified that he was not involved in the process of the team finding a new head coach and didn't know the details outside of the lawsuit accusations.

Flores made other bombshell accusations in the lawsuit, including the claim that the owner of the Miami Dolphins offered him $100,000 per lost game in order to improve their draft status. He also said that in a meeting with the Denver Broncos, then-manager John Elway and others arrived an hour late, disheveled, and looked like they had been drinking too hard the night before.

The Giants, the Dolphins, and the Broncos all released statements denying the accusations by Flores.

Manning led the Giants to two Super Bowl championship victories, both against the New England Patriots headed by iconic quarterback Tom Brady.

Elizabeth Warren: I'll fight to break up Big Tech to stop companies from... 'heckl[ing] senators with snotty tweets'?,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) vowed on Thursday to fight to ""break up Big Tech"" companies so they are not powerful enough to ""heckle senators with snotty tweets.""

Warren advanced this anti-free speech argument after the Twitter account for Amazon News challenged the progressive senator when she falsely asserted that Amazon paid ""close to nothing"" in federal taxes.

""Giant corporations like Amazon report huge profits to their shareholders – but they exploit loopholes and tax havens to pay close to nothing in taxes,"" Warren tweeted Wednesday, sharing a clip from a Senate Finance Committee hearing in which she argued for legislation to increase the tax burden on corporations.

Warren claimed that between 2018 and 2020, when the corporate tax rate was 21 percent, Amazon only paid an effective tax rate of 4.3% by exploiting various loopholes, deductions, and profit-shifting provisions of the tax code.

Amazon News responded to Warren's tweet telling her, ""You make the tax laws @SenWarren; we just follow them. If you don't like the laws you've created, by all means, change them.""

Amazon went on to say that the company paid $1.7 billion in federal taxes in 2020, excluding the additional $18 billion revenues generated for state governments through various sales taxes nationwide. The account noted Amazon made $350 billion in investments since 2010 and created 400,000 new jobs last year.

In a parting shot, Amazon told Warren, ""While you're working on changing the tax code, can we please raise the federal minimum wage to $15?""

The senator from Massachusetts responded to the criticism with a threat to break up Big Tech companies like Amazon so they can't tweet disagreements at her.

""I didn't write the loopholes you exploit, @amazon — your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did,"" she claimed. ""But you bet I'll fight to make you pay your fair share. And fight your union-busting. And fight to break up Big Tech so you're not powerful enough to heckle senators with snotty tweets.""

Warren has previously proposed a plan to increase regulation on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter to ""fight disinformation."" Her proposal calls for reforms to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — a law that grants liability protections to social media platforms so they can't be sued for content posted on their websites by third parties.

Warren wants Big Tech companies to share data with the federal government, moderate even more content with warning labels about disinformation, and otherwise increase censorship to combat so-called ""false information"" — and apparently to stop ""snotty tweets.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-ill-fight-to-break-up-big-tech-to-stop-snotty-tweets,2021-03-26
Republican stumps Elizabeth Warren over single question about fairness of student loan cancellation: 'Where do I sign up for reimbursement?',"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stole a play from ""Dodgeball"" on Friday — dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge — when a Republican guest co-host on ""The View"" confronted her about student loan cancellation.

What happened?

Because Warren advocates for mass student loan cancellation, Republican Lindsey Granger asked Warren how she plans to reimburse Americans who paid off their student loans.

The question exposed what critics of student loan forgiveness say is the innate unfairness of canceling student loans.

""What do you say to someone like me who worked two jobs for a decade to pay all their student loans — just finished. Where do I sign up for reimbursement?"" Granger asked.

Elizabeth Warren Explains Why She's Calling on Biden to Cancel Student Loan Debt | The View youtu.be

Warren, however, completely deflected from answering the question, and instead presented her talking points for why she believes student loan cancellation is necessary.

""So let's start out with who has student loans today. About 40% of folks with student loans don't have a college diploma,"" Warren began. ""They're folks who tried and life happened ... and now they earn what a high school grad earns, and they're trying to pay off college-level debt, and it is crushing their bones.



""Keep in mind that of those that have student loan debt more than half have negative wealth— they don't have any wealth. You know that right now there are tens of thousands of people who are living on Social Security, who are having their Social Security checks garnished to pay student loans,"" she continued. ""And so this for me is a question of fairness.""

Warren then repeated her misleading claim that she only spent $50 per semester going to the University of Houston (The school's newspaper notes that Warren probably paid at least double what she claims).

""There was a time in America when we invested in our public colleges and universities, that's how I could go to a college that cost $50 a semester paid for on two part-time jobs. But today that option is not out there for our young people,"" Warren said. ""So this is about saying: Look, it's tough, we understand that. We want to invest in you. We want to invest in your getting an education.""

At no point did Warren answer Granger's question. After her response ended, the panel immediately shifted the topic to the fallout over the potential overturn of Roe v. Wade.

Anything else?



""The View"" later went off the rails Friday when liberal co-host Sunny Hostin racially insulted Granger.

""I feel like it's an oxymoron, a black Republican,"" Hostin said after Granger identified as a Republican.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-lindsey-granger-student-loans,2022-05-06
"Elizabeth Warren slams McConnell over cost of college tuition, but quickly trips over her past job","Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to slam Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for opposing President Joe Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan.

But she quickly tripped over her own contributions to the student loan debt crisis.

What did McConnell say?

On Wednesday, McConnell released a terse statement condemning Biden's plan.

The statement said, in part:

Washington Democrats have found yet another way to make inflation even worse, reward far-left activists, and achieve nothing for millions of working American families who can barely tread water. President Biden’s student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt. This policy is astonishingly unfair.

How did Warren respond?

Warren deployed her trite narrative about the exploding cost of college.

""Senator McConnell graduated from a school that cost $330 a year. Today it costs over $12,000,"" Warren responded, referring to the University of Kentucky.

""McConnell has done nothing to fix it — and is irate that the President is stepping up to help millions of working Americans drowning in debt. He can spare us the lectures on fairness,"" she added.

Warren loves to talk about the skyrocketing cost of college tuition to argue for student loan debt forgiveness.

Rarely, however, does Warren address why college tuition has skyrocketed and how the federal student loan system incentivizes college administrators to increase tuition prices.

Thus, in response to Warren's attack, it was widely noted that Warren has negatively contributed to the crisis.

As PolitiFact explained, Warren was paid more than $400,000 for teaching two classes at Harvard Law School in 2010 and 2011. One wonders why Warren accepted such a large salary to teach students who most likely received student loans to attend her class if she believes there is something deeply amiss with the system.

Anything else?

Americans hold $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. That is a problem worth addressing, but simply forgiving debt without fixing the underlying problems will erase any progress Biden's plan will make toward reducing student loan debt.

As the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found in 2017 study, ""The average tuition increase associated with expansion of student loans is as much as 60 cents per dollar. That is, more federal aid to students enables colleges to raise tuition more,"" the Cato Institute explained.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in fact, estimates it will take just five years for outstanding student loan debt to return to its current level if Biden's plan is fully implemented.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-mcconnell-student-loans-college-tuition,2022-08-26
Elizabeth Warren continues spreading rumors that Elon Musk doesn't pay taxes — and he hits back with entertaining tweet,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) blasted billionaire Elon Musk once again for reportedly not paying taxes.



Despite Musk continuously showing otherwise, Warren persists in repeating the claims.

What are the details?

During a weekend interview with CNN's Brianna Keilar, Warren complained that the world's sometimes-richest man has not paid taxes.

""Elon Musk in 2018, we've actually seen his tax returns,"" Warren said during the Sunday interview. ""You know how much he paid in taxes, one of the richest people in the world? Zero. And he’s not the only one. [Amazon founder] Jeff Bezos, right, another one of the richest people in the world, he pays less in taxes than a public schoolteacher or a firefighter. And they do this because they’re only being taxed on income. They very cleverly make sure they have no official income. They just have all this stock that keeps building in value, building in value. They borrow against it. It’s just not right.”

She continued, ""We need a system in America where everybody gets the benefits of being an American, but that means everyone pays a fair share to keep this country running.""



According to a June ProPublica report, Musk paid zero federal income taxes in 2018. Musk said that he paid no federal income taxes the filing year due to the fact that he inadvertently overpaid in 2017. Musk in December announced that he was poised to pay more than $11 billion in the upcoming tax year.

Musk fired back at Warren's remarks on Twitter, writing, ""Will visit IRS next time I’m in DC just to say hi, since I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year. Maybe I can have a cookie or something[.]”

You can watch the exchange in the video below.

What else?

Warren and Musk in December sparred online after she previously accused him of not paying taxes, calling him a ""freeloader.""

Musk in response branded Warren an ""angry mom"" and ""Senator Karen.""

He added, ""If you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. Don’t spend it all at once ... oh wait you did already.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-spreading-rumors-elon-musk-taxes-he-hits-back,2022-02-21
"'I dare you to run the same poll with your followers': Elon Musk polls people about whether they trust politicians or billionaires less, then challenges AOC to do the same","Business magnate Elon Musk is running a Twitter poll that asks people whether they have less trust in politicians or billionaires, and he has challenged Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to run an identical poll on her account.

""Who do you trust less? Real question,"" Musk wrote when posting the poll. In another tweet he added, ""@aoc I dare you to run the same poll with your followers.""

Musk, a wealthy business tycoon who plans to purchase Twitter, has been critical of the Democratic Party and said that he plans to vote Republican.

""In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold …"" Musk tweeted last week.



Bloomberg reported that when Ocasio-Cortez was questioned about Musk's support of the GOP she said, ""He's a billionaire. I could care less what he thinks.""



Musk is the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, a company the produces popular electric vehicles.

Ocasio-Cortez purchased a Tesla in 2020, but wants to shift to an electric vehicle manufactured by workers who are unionized, according to the outlet. ""At the time, it was the only EV that could get me from New York to Washington on like one, or one-and-a-half charges,"" the lawmaker said. ""I would love to switch.""

Musk tweeted on Thursday that using ""the word 'billionaire' as a pejorative is morally wrong & dumb."" In a follow-up tweet he added, ""If the reason for it is building products that make millions of people happy.""

""The degree to which the unions control the Dems is insane. It’s like watching a sock puppet 'talk', but the hand inside the sock is way too obvious!"" Musk declared in another post.

In response to Musk's poll about whether people trust politicians or billionaires less, Jenna Ellis replied, ""Billionaires spend their own money. Politicians spend mine.""

Someone else replied, ""I trust people on a personal to person level, not by blanket statements about a big group.""

""Fair,"" Musk responded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-aoc-billionaires-politicians,2022-05-27
"Liberals are having complete meltdowns over Elon Musk possibly buying Twitter, comparing him to Adolf Hitler and comic book supervillains: 'It could result in World War 3'","Elon Musk made a proposal to acquire Twitter – which made many blue-check liberals suffer complete meltdowns. Liberals shrieked that the potential purchase would end democracy and start World War III. Some leftists compared Musk's actions with the rise of Adolf Hitler and comic book supervillains.

Musk – who is already the largest shareholder of the social media platform – announced on Thursday that he made an offer to purchase Twitter for nearly $42 billion.

There was a flood of Twitter reactions from liberals freaking out that Musk could own the platform.

The Kings College professor and Acton Institute Research Fellow Dr. Anthony Bradley shared a graphic of rich people buying media outlets.

As hyperbolic as the Twitter reactions were, billionaire Mark Cuban cautioned it could possibly get worse for left-leaning individuals if Musk teamed up with Republican venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Cuban tweeted, ""Want to see the whole world lose their sh*t? Get Peter Thiel to partner with Elon and raise the bid for Twitter.""

There were people who supported Musk in his quest to purchase Twitter.

Liberal commentator Jimmy Dore mocked, ""'I’m leaving Twitter cuz I’m scared that if Elon Musk buys Twitter he will protect free speech rights of people I don’t like & won’t censor enough, censorship is what everyone wants….I mean, it’s what every tweet that I’m allowed to see wants.'""

Congressional candidate Dr. Willie J. Montague tweeted, ""A man willing to spend $41,000,000,000 for free speech is a good man that I can admire.""

Author Frank Fleming joked, ""Elon Musk has also offered to buy CNN+ for twenty-eight bucks.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-buy-twitter-reactions,2022-04-14
"Elon Musk gets political on podcast, reveals thoughts on Biden and who he'll vote for","Elon Musk revealed Monday that he is a moderate who's voted almost ""exclusively"" for Democrats in the past but plans to vote Republican in the next election cycle.

The billionaire and would-be Twitter owner briefly described his politics while speaking at a tech conference in Miami. Musk phoned in via video as hosts Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg recorded an episode of their ""All-In"" podcast. He discussed the future of Twitter, his views on free speech, and his efforts to determine how many fake accounts are on the platform.



""I think there's a need for a public town square, a digital town square where people can debate issues of all kinds including the most substantive issues. And in order for that to be the case, you have to have something that's as broadly inclusive as possible,"" Musk said.

He explained that Twitter needs to be ""balanced from a political standpoint"" and also ""transparent,"" suggesting that the algorithms that create news feeds should be made public and be open to critique and improvement.

""The reality is that Twitter at this point, you know, has a very far-left bias,"" Musk said. ""I would classify myself as a moderate, neither Republican nor Democrat.""

""I have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats, historically. Overwhelmingly. Like, I'm not sure, I might never have voted for a Republican, just to be clear. Now this election I will,"" he added, to cheers from the audience.

Continuing, he emphasized that his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter was not politically motivated, but rather was an attempt to protect free speech on one of the most popular digital platforms available.

""The point I'm trying to make is that this is not some sort of attempt to — it's not some right-wing takeover, as people on the left may fear, but rather a moderate-wing takeover. And an attempt to ensure that people of all political beliefs feel welcome on a digital town square and they can express their beliefs without fear of being banned or shadow-banned,"" Musk said.

But when asked for his thoughts on the current administration and President Joe Biden, Musk tore into the Democratic Party, accusing it of being held captive by ""unions"" and ""trial lawyers.""

""Generally, if you'll see something that is not in the interests of the people, on the Democrat side it's going to come because of the unions — which is just another form of monopoly — and the trial lawyers,"" Musk said.

""To be fair, on the Republican side, if you say where is something not ideal happening? It's because of corporate evil and religious zealotry. That's generally where the bad things will be coming from on the Republican side that are not representative of the people,"" he added.

Later he drilled in on the president, saying, ""It's hard to tell what Biden's doing, to be frank. The real president is whoever controls the teleprompter.""

Musk also discussed the importance of eliminating ""bot armies"" that can ""unduly influence public,"" estimating at one point that as many as 20% of Twitter's users are fake accounts.

A debate over how many bots are on Twitter has become a sticking point in Musk's deal to buy the company. Musk said last Friday that the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" after Twitter released an estimate that fewer than 5% of users were spam or fake accounts.

Elon Musk says he'd support DeSantis in 2024,"Elon Musk has indicated that he would support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president in 2024.

""My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far,"" Musk noted in a tweet on Friday.

When someone asked Musk if he would support DeSantis, Musk replied, ""Yes."" He then added, ""But Twitter as a platform must be fair to all.""

DeSantis, who just won reelection during Florida's 2022 gubernatorial contest, has not announced plans for a 2024 White House bid, but is widely viewed as someone who could potentially run for president.

Musk indicated on Friday that if Apple and Google were to ban Twitter from their app stores, he would develop ""an alternative phone."" He made the comment when responding to a post in which conservative commentator Liz Wheeler had floated the idea.

""If Apple & Google boot Twitter from their app stores, @elonmusk should produce his own smartphone. Half the country would happily ditch the biased, snooping iPhone & Android. The man builds rockets to Mars, a silly little smartphone should be easy, right?"" Wheeler tweeted.

""I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,"" Musk replied.

Musk, who has already reinstated some accounts since taking over the social media company, has announced plans for a mass reinstatement of suspended Twitter accounts. The idea was supported by a majority of votes in a poll that Musk posted proposing ""general amnesty"" for suspended accounts that had not violated the law or perpetrated ""egregious spam.""

The Washington Post quoted Harvard Law Cyberlaw Clinic clinical instructor Alejandra Caraballo warning that Apple and Google should consider banning Twitter from their app stores.

""Apple and Google need to seriously start exploring booting Twitter off the app store,"" Caraballo, said, according to a piece by Post columnist Taylor Lorenz. ""What Musk is doing is existentially dangerous for various marginalized communities. It's like opening the gates of hell in terms of the havoc it will cause. People who engaged in direct targeted harassment can come back and engage in doxing, targeted harassment, vicious bullying, calls for violence, celebration of violence. I can't even begin to state how dangerous this will be.""

Caraballo tweeted, ""'Trans people deserve to die' is a legal statement and any account suspended for saying that could be brought back under the 'general amnesty.' This is like opening the gates to hell in terms of hate speech.""



Musk responded, ""Incitement to violence will result in account suspension. Currently suspended accounts will be enabled slowly next week after manual review to determine whether they have potentially broken the law or engaged in spam. Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-phone-desantis-president,2022-11-26
"Eminem’s daughter comes out as non-binary, asks to be called ‘Stevie’","Rapper Eminem's adopted daughter, formerly known as Whitney, has come out as non-binary and wants to be called Stevie.

The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, adopted the 19-year-old when he briefly reunited with the child's mother, Kim Scott.

Mathers and Scott first married in 1999 and divorced two years later in 2001. They briefly remarried in 2006.

Scott and the rapper have one biological child together, 25-year-old Hailie.

What are the details?

The video features a photo montage of the teen throughout stages of her childhood up until present day and begins with Stevie crying.

In a TikTok video, Stevie writes, ""Watch me become more comfortable with myself.""

By the end of the montage, the video is captioned, ""[S]tevie all pronouns.""

The 19-year-old debuted the brand-new name in July, contained in the obituary of her late maternal grandmother, Kathleen Sluck, Meaww reports.

A portion of the tribute read, ""Kathleen was a exceptional mom to her two daughters; Kim and Dawn; and was overjoyed to become a grandmother to her grandchildren; Alaina, Adam, Hailie, Stevie, P.J., and Parker.""

What else?

Scott, Stevie's mother, was reportedly hospitalized on July 30 following a purported suicide attempt that was said to have taken place just a week after Sluck died.

Scott, 46, has battled drug addiction since the '90s.

According to a TMZ report, first responders rushed to Scott's Michigan home for reports of a suicidal person.

When law enforcement arrived at her home, Scott was reportedly so combative that she had to be restrained.

Page Six reported that Scott purportedly cut herself and a ""fair amount of blood has spilled on to the floor.""

""Authorities reportedly rushed her to the hospital for medical and psychological evaluation, but she has since returned home to recover,"" the outlet added.

Scott also lost her twin sister in 2016 following a suspected heroin overdose.

At the time, Scott said she would ""never feel whole again.""

""Dawn was my sweet, beautiful sister who lost her way,"" Scott wrote in an online condolences book according to the New York Post. ""I kept a light lit for her hoping she'd find her way back to me. I miss her and love her more than anything I could ever say. I wish she was here so I could hug her and tell her I love her.""

""Half of me is gone and I will never feel whole again,"" Scott continued. ""She made me laugh and kept me on my toes. She was the best sister and friend in the world and I will miss her until we are together again.""

A-list actress blasts Hollywood for trying to turn women into men: 'If they're feminine in the way that they used to be ... they're not welcome',"Famed British actress Emma Thompson says that far too many Hollywood filmmakers encourage women to cast their femininity aside and behave more like men.

What are the details?

In a recent interview with the CultureBlast podcast on Spotify, Thompson — an Academy Award winner — said that filmmakers are far too focused on portraying a woman as masculine and instead, should focus on highlighting a woman's femininity as a source of strength.

Thompson, 61, said that even female screenwriters are guilty of perpetuating the new stereotype.

""So all the women screenwriters I talk to, I say, 'Well, what's the story?' Because it's not good enough to simply give the women the guns, and then make the women badass as well. Now women have to be badass — if they're feminine in the way that they used to be, and they're not badass, then they're not welcome. Also, they're not allowed to cry, apparently anymore, because we've just got to be like the men.""

She later added, ""Why are there no films about giving birth, for crying out loud? Does anyone even know about that? No. No, It's all hidden. All our heroism is hidden, because what we've done is we've just given women the same parts as men, and that's not the point. How do we turn into our own lives and make those stories heroic?""

Thompson said that she also attempted to gather her female peers to brainstorm what female heroism and empowerment meant in Hollywood more than three decades ago.

""When I got a group of women together in my thirties, and I said, 'OK, what's the female heroine? Who is that? What does she do?' Because she hasn't got the wherewithal to do the Superman, to do the Godfather, that's not the point. That's not where our heroism lies. So how do we make it heroic?""

Entire Portland Rapid Response Team resigns after fellow officer is criminally indicted for using force against rioter last summer,"Members of the Portland Police Bureau's Rapid Response Team resigned en masse from their voluntary positions on Wednesday in response to a fellow ""riot squad"" officer being criminally indicted for an action he took during a violent uprising in the city last August.

According to reports from the Post Millennial and local radio station KXL-FM, the Rapid Response team voted unanimously to disband during a meeting with the Portland police union. The cohort consisted of about 50 officers, and included detectives and sergeants.

Team members, which have been deployed to respond to recurrent uprisings that have taken place in the city since last summer, were reportedly disaffected by a lack of support from City Hall and from the district attorney.

On Wednesday, police union director Daryl Turner told the ""Lars Larson Show"" he feared the final straw for officers would be what he called the ""witch hunt"" prosecution of Officer Corey Budworth.

Budworth, accused of using unnecessary force against photojournalist and provocateur, Teri Jacobs, during a declared riot on Aug. 18, had initially been cleared after an internal investigation by the police department. On that night, the team was deployed to contain an uprising after protesters threw a Molotov cocktail into a county building, setting it on fire.

But on Tuesday, Multnomah District Attorney Mike Schmidt announced a criminal indictment against Budworth, charging him with fourth-degree assault.

""In this case, we allege that no legal justification existed for Officer Budworth's deployment of force, and that the deployment of force was legally excessive under the circumstances,"" Schmidt said in a statement. ""My office will continue to do everything we can to ensure justice is done without error or delay and that we make sure our work and practices are rooted in fairness and equity.""

PPB officer charged over incident during August 2020 riot www.youtube.com

In response, the police union fired back, calling the indictment a ""politically driven charging decision.""

""It is important to remember that our officer has not been found guilty of any crime. Like every citizen, our officer is innocent until proven guilty,"" the union said in a news release. ""He faced a violent and chaotic, rapidly evolving situation"" involving ""a group of 200 demonstrators, many equipped with tactical helmets, faces covered, and armed with a variety of weapons.""

The union added that Budworth ""used the lowest level of baton force — a push; not a strike or a jab — to remove Ms. Jacobs from the area.""

In a news release, the Portland Police Bureau described the team as ""an all-hazard incident response team that has received advanced specialized training to respond to incidents requiring higher levels of technical expertise including public order policing, natural or man-made disasters.""

""The primary role has been to provide public safety at crowd events when there was a threat of harm to the community,"" the bureau added.

Now with the entire rapid response team disbanded, it is not clear how the city will manage demonstrations planned for the coming weekend.

""Now that the riot team is no more, we have no clue what's going to happen. We don't have enough patrol officers to be pulled from the road to handle huge crowds,"" a Portland police officer told the Post Millennial. ""We are only backups with no gear like the riot team has.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/entire-portland-rapid-response-team-resigns,2021-06-17
Unsealed court documents lurid details of young girls with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,"Accused madam Ghislaine Maxwell directed a room full of young girls to ""kiss, dance and touch one another in a sexual way"" for Jeffrey Epstein's gratification, according to newly unsealed court documents. The alleged orgy-like performance by underage girls was detailed by an unidentified witness and alleged in 112 court documents that were released late Wednesday.

Shocking new court documents also expose explicit details about the madam and convicted pedophile by Anthony Figueroa, the ex-boyfriend of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, the longtime accuser of Epstein and Maxwell.

Giuffre, who has since settled a lawsuit against Maxwell, was allegedly forced into a threesome after ""Jeffrey wanted Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell,"" the Daily Mail reported. The pair allegedly used sex toys during the romp, court documents say.

""Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey would obviously be doing stuff, all three of them together,"" Figueroa said, according to court documents. ""Like I said, that they would all go out to clubs to pick up girls and try and find them to bring back for Jeffrey. And then she told me about how, like I said, her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey were all intimate together on multiple occasions.""

When Figueroa was asked by authorities about the claim that Giuffre was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times at the behest the Maxwell and Epstein, he admitted that he could not ""recall,"" but added it ""could be possible."" He said that he only remembers Giuffre mentioning being forced to have sex with ""just Ms. Maxwell and all the other girls.""

Prince Andrew denies that he had sex with Giuffre.



Epstein's housekeeper of his mansion in Florida alleges that over the course of a decade, there were 100 girls who came to the home to give the disgraced financier ""sexual massages,"" and the girls were purportedly paid $200.

In the newly unsealed court filings, Florida detective Joseph Recarey gave an interview to federal prosecutors in 2016 about Epstein's alleged behavior.



""Epstein would either attempt to fondle the girls or touch the girls inappropriately, and at which point he would masturbate,"" Recarey said, according to Vanity Fair. ""And when he was done, he would get up and go wash off while the girls would get dressed and go back downstairs and get paid.""

Court documents read, ""One witness (redacted) was in tears, as he recounted (Maxwell) bringing a 15-year-old girl into his employer's home who, in utmost distress, told him that (Maxwell) stole the young girl's passport and tried to make her have sex with Epstein and then threatened her.""



A witness testified that Maxwell ""recruited her from her school campus to have sex with Epstein with lies about being her personal assistant,"" as reported by Fox News.

One court document is a handwritten note from July 2004 where the British socialite informed Epstein that a 14-year-old girl was ""available"" and that he had ""no one for tomorrow.""

Lawyers for Giuffre argue that the unsealed testimony is a smoking gun that Maxwell played a major role in recruiting girls for Epstein.

""It is not just the flight logs showing Defendant flying with Epstein and Ms. Giuffre over twenty times when she was a minor; it is not just the message pads from law enforcement's trash pulls that show Defendant arranging to have an underage girl come over to Epstein's house for 'training,' it is not just the police report; it is not just the photographs of [Maxwell] and other men with Ms. Giuffre when she was a minor,"" Giuffre's legal team wrote, the Daily Beast reported. ""Now, there is actual, live testimonial evidence that [Maxwell] was a procurer of young girls for sex with Jeffrey Epstein, with whom she shared a home and a life, thus validating Ms. Giuffre's claims.""

Maxwell denies helping Epstein recruit and groom girls for sex. Maxwell was arrested in July 2020. She has been held without bail since pleading not guilty to six charges, including two counts of conspiracy, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, transporting minors for illegal sex acts, and two counts of perjury.

Epstein, 66, committed suicide in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correction Center in August 2019 as he was awaiting trial for sex trafficking of minors.

"House passes the Equality Act, sweeping anti-discrimination legislation that threatens religious liberty","The House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly passed the Equality Act, sweeping legislation that would expand U.S. anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual preference or self-proclaimed gender identity. Supporters say the bill will establish basic legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer Americans nationwide that will establish equal justice and fairness for all Americans. Opponents warn that the language of the bill would make mainstream traditional beliefs about marriage, biological facts about sex differences, and religious convictions on these issues punishable under the law.

The Equality Act passed on a nearly party-line vote, 224 to 206, with every Democrat and three Republicans voting in favor of the bill. A previous version of the bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in 2019 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws to add explicit language including sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under federal law.

""In most states, L.G.B.T.Q. people can be discriminated against because of who they are, or who they love,"" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the bill's sponsor in the House, who is gay, said, according to the New York Times. ""It is past time for that to change.""

The bill is a priority for President Joe Biden, who promised to champion the legislation during the first 100 days of his presidency. This version that passed the House Thursday is not expected to win enough support in the Senate to pass and be signed into law by President Biden unless Democrats take the drastic measure of eliminating the filibuster to bypass Republican opposition and pass the bill with a simple majority.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the only Senate Republican who expressed support for the 2019 bill, but she told the Washington Blade on Feb. 23 that she does not support the current version because it lacks certain revisions she requested. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has also expressed opposition to the bill, citing the need for ""strong religious liberty protections.""

While the bill is supported by constituencies including civil rights groups, pro-LGBT organizations, and multiple corporations and the U.S. Chamber of Congress, it faces opposition from religious groups and conservative activists who agree that LGBT people should be protected from discrimination, but think the Equality Act goes too far by actively discriminating against traditional beliefs on marriage, human sexuality, and the differences between men and women.

What's in the bill?



The Equality Act is broad in scope and according to the Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBT activist organization, would add anti-discrimination provisions for sexual orientation and gender identity to areas of federal law including employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, federally funded programs, and jury service.

Last June, the landmark Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which protects against discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin also includes protections for lesbian, gay, and transgender Americans. The logic of the court was that if a man who married his same-sex partner were fired from his job for doing so, but a woman who married a man were not fired, the homosexual man was discriminated against on the basis of his sex. Likewise, if a woman who identifies as transgender and presents as a man were fired for how she dressed, but biological men at the same place of employment were not fired for how they dressed, then that transgender individual was discriminated against based on sex.

While the court's ruling was expansive and fundamentally transformed labor law, LGBT activists contend that the court's ruling did not go far enough and say the Equality Act is needed to codify the court's decision not only in employment law, but in other areas as well. President Biden signed an executive order to that effect, directing federal agencies to apply Bostock to all areas of law that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. But progressives fear that a future conservative presidential administration would simply reverse Biden's executive order, so they want LGBT people protected by explicit statute.

The Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Jury Selection and Services Act, and other laws to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. It would expand the scope of federal civil rights law to make public spaces and services like a ""store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services"" places that could be liable to a discrimination claim.

Additionally, the Equality Act would override the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that affords exemptions in anti-discrimination law to religious people and organizations who argue such laws infringe on their religious liberty. For example, a Christian charity accused of discriminating against a transgender person in a hiring decision might claim protections under RFRA, citing religious beliefs on the nature of human sexuality, males and females, and their proper roles in a godly marriage.

The Equality Act would specifically prevent an entity from using RFRA to challenge its anti-discrimination provisions or defend itself in a claim made under the law.

Controversies

Advocates for the Equality Act say the bill is needed to extend popular protections from discriminations enjoyed by most Americans to LGBT people.

""Just as [a business] would not be able to turn away somebody for any other prohibited reason in the law, they would not be able to do that for LGBTQ people either. And we think that's a really important principle to maintain,"" Ian Thompson, senior legislative representative at the ACLU told NPR.

But critics counter that the way the bill is written would proactively discriminate against views that do not conform to the federal government's definition of human sexuality and gender identity. The also say that because an individual's conception of gender identity and sexual orientation are said to be fluid, lawful protections for those classes of people would necessarily be vague, unclear, and even contradictory.

""Rather than finding common-sense, narrowly tailored ways to shield LGBT-identifying Americans from truly unjust discrimination, the bill would act as a sword — to persecute those who don't embrace newfangled gender ideologies,"" Ryan T. Anderson, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post opposing the bill. Anderson is the author of ""When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,"" a book that evaluates the current science on transgender issues and the proposed public policy responses. He has written extensively on sexual orientation and gender identity laws and opposes the Equality Act on grounds it would be harmful to women.

""It would vitiate a sex binary that is quite literally written into our genetic code and is fundamental to many of our laws, not least laws protecting the equality, safety and privacy of women,"" Anderson argued.

He pointed to legislative text that states, for example: ""An individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.""

While public spaces can have separate rooms for men and women, the definition of who is a man and who is a woman is in flux. A male who identifies as a woman must be granted permission to use women's bathrooms, locker rooms, or dressing rooms, or else the entity that hosts that public space, be it a business or even a church, may be liable to a discrimination lawsuit.

As explained by the Heritage Foundation, ""Employers, medical professionals, educators, and religious organizations"" would be forced ""to allow men into women's shelters, pay for or perform sex-change operations, and engage in speech that violates their consciences. Faith-based adoption and foster care agencies would be forced to violate their belief that every child deserves a mother and a father."" The Equality Act labels belief in traditional marriage as a ""sex stereotype,"" statutorily stigmatizing the convictions of hundreds of millions of Americans including Christians, Jews, Mormons, and Muslims.

Anderson also noted that the Equality Act treats refusal to perform an abortion as ""pregnancy"" discrimination, and because the RFRA is overridden, Christian doctors and nurses with pro-life convictions would be forced to perform abortion procedures or risk being sued without any claim to First Amendment protections as a defense.

Other medical and legal experts have raised concerns over women's athletics and parental rights. At a virtual event hosted by the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday, Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-Mo.), a former teacher and track coach, said that if the Equality Act becomes law ""we won't have women's sports that are fair,"" referring to recent controversies over boys who identify as transgender and competing against and defeating girls in school sports.

Hartzler also warned that passage of the Equality Act could lead some parents to lose custody of their children if a child identifies as transgender but parents do not consent to ""gender-affirming"" treatments, which can include cross-sex hormone prescriptions or even mutilating breast or genital surgeries.

Hartzler was one of several speakers at the Heritage event, which included doctors, lawyers, and policy experts who spoke out against the Equality Act.

These points were fiercely debated in the House of Representatives before the Equality Act was passed, with Democrats accusing Republicans of making ""ridiculous"" claims to hide their supposed bigotry against gay and transgender Americans.

As reported by the Christian Post:

During the 90-minute House debate over the bill on Thursday, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., claimed the Equality Act posed no threat to religious freedom and that such concerns being raised by Republicans were ""ridiculous.""



Maloney then accused the bill's opponents of using religious freedom as a ruse to conceal their ""pro-discrimination against gay people.""



In response to Maloney's accusations, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, declared: ""Here it is, on page 25. It says specifically, 'The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a legal basis for a claim' [against a religious discrimination charge].



""The founders said in the first right, in the First Amendment to the Constitution, you can practice your religion as you see fit. But right here in their bill today, the Democrats say 'No you can't,'"" Jordan asserted.

The Equality Act now heads to the U.S. Senate, where Democrats would need Republican support to overcome a filibuster. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the bill's sponsor in the Senate, has signaled support for changing the Senate rules to end the legislative filibuster and pass the bill, but Democrats would need a majority of senators to vote to do so, and Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) are opposed to the idea.

"Eric Bolling storms off heated interview after guest accuses him of faking concern for black communities: 'Because I'm white, you think I'm racist? That's BS!'","Media broadcaster Eric Bolling shut down an interview with the BBC when a fellow guest accused him of faking his concern for black communities.

What are the details?

Former BlazeTV host Bolling abruptly left an interview with BBC's ""Newsnight"" on Wednesday after his fellow guest, political commentator Aisha Mills, said that his concern for black communities was not authentic.

The two were discussing Georgia's new voting law as well as Major League Baseball, which announced the relocation of its All-Star Game in response to the law.

In remarks, Bolling said that the decision by the MLB to move the game out of Atlanta hurt minorities and their businesses.

During the exchange, Mills said, ""I think it's really rich for any Republican — especially a white man — to run around and claim they care about the economic condition of black communities and black businesses when that's all a lie.""

Bolling responded, ""That is not fair! You don't know me. You don't know who I am.""

Mills insisted that Bolling's remarks during the exchange served as nothing more than a wedge.

""I am ... a black person in America,"" Mills said. ""Everything that these voting laws stand for ... is all about racial discrimination. How dare you try to act like you are somehow a proponent of black people and businesses just to make a point and try to create a wedge? It's ignorant, and it's disrespectful.""

He fired back, ""That's disgusting. I'm done. Put me off. That's disgusting. I am nowhere near anything you are painting me to be, and the problem with American politics is exactly that. Because I'm white, you think I'm racist? That's BS! I'm done.""

As Bolling moved to leave the interview, ""Newsnight"" host Emily Maitlis asked if he would remain for a question.

""I don't know why I'm staying here,"" he responded. ""I need an apology.""

Mills fired back, ""I'm not going to apologize for being offended.""

Making good on his intent to withdraw from the conversation, Bolling concluded, ""I'm done"" and signed off.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-bolling-walks-off-bbc-interview-after-fellow-guest-accuses-him-a-white-republican-male-of-lying-about-his-concern-for-black-communities,2021-04-08
Erik Wemple slams CNN for Cuomo brothers love-a-thon,"Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple went scorched earth during an appearance on CNN. While appearing on CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" Wemple bashed the liberal cable TV news network for allowing CNN host Chris Cuomo to have ""love-a-thons"" with his brother Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

Chris Cuomo is the anchor of CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" which is self-described as a ""news program where Cuomo tests power with newsmakers and politicians from both sides of the aisle."" However during the coronavirus pandemic, Cuomo welcomed his New York governor brother on the show to deliver an unchallenged and glowing narrative of his leadership.

Many times the interviews were completely unprofessional and chummy. There were jokes that the governor only appeared on the show because their mom made him and then there was a strange segment that involved a gigantic Q-tip. All this positive coverage despite New York having the second-most coronavirus deaths per million and there being bombshell reports that New York's nursing home deaths were far higher than Cuomo's administration admitted.

Cuomo has not appeared on his brother's CNN show since the flurry of sexual harassment allegations against the governor started to storm in.

Flash forward to Sunday, Wemple was a guest on ""Reliable Sources"" to discuss the media coverage of Andrew Cuomo and his scandals. Wemple did not hold back at pointing out the bias of a news network previously handing out flattering publicity to a political figure by his own brother.

""I would be remiss, Brian, if I didn't mention CNN's own huge media story here with Chris Cuomo, the anchor at the nine o'clock hour, who covered Andrew Cuomo and had all these wonderful love-a-thon interviews with him, more than ten of them,"" Wemple told CNN host Brian Stelter.

""And they suspended the conflict of interest rule for Chris Cuomo for those interviews, yet all of the sudden they've enforced it again now that Andrew Cuomo is in the midst of a historic scandal in the Albany State House,"" Wemple continued.

""So, I think that is a major black eye for CNN,"" Wemple proclaimed. ""I will say that you and other people have covered the Cuomo story very aggressively, so I do want to be fair about this, but it is a major black eye for this network.""

Stelter looked stone-faced as Wemple ripped his network during an interview on CNN.

To his credit, this isn't the first time that Wemple has called out a left-leaning cable TV news host. In 2019, Wemple bashed MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow for her partisanship and ""rooting"" for the Steele dossier to be true instead of being more concerned with the truth.

When small bits of news arose in favor of the dossier, the franchise MSNBC host pumped air into them. At least some of her many fans surely came away from her broadcasts thinking the dossier was a serious piece of investigative research, not the flimflam, quick-twitch game of telephone outlined in the Horowitz report. She seemed to be rooting for the document.



And when large bits of news arose against the dossier, Maddow found other topics more compelling.



She was there for the bunkings, absent for the debunkings — a pattern of misleading and dishonest asymmetry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/erik-wemple-cnn-cuomo-stetler,2021-03-14
Ex-top California Democrat says 'wokeism run amok' is why Biden is hemorrhaging Latino support,"The Democratic Party is losing touch with Hispanic voters because President Joe Biden's policies are too ""woke,"" says a former California Democratic leader.

Gloria Romero, a former state senator who served as Democratic majority leader from 2001 until 2008, told ""Fox & Friends First"" that Biden is losing Latino support because his party has left behind values shared by those voters.

""My message is of extreme disappointment. I represented one of the most Democratic Latino districts in California, East L.A., and whether we are Cuban-American in Florida or Mexican-American in South Texas, Nevada, or here in California, we are sending a very powerful message to the Democratic Party that enough is enough,"" Romero said in an interview on Friday.

""We have choices and we are looking beyond the Democratic Party,"" she said, adding that Democrats no longer resemble the party of JFK or even of former President Barack Obama when he was elected in 2008.

""Today's party is complete wokeism run amok,"" Romero said. She criticized the Biden administration's use of terms like ""birthing people"" in place of ""mothers"" or ""women"" as an example of how Democrats are moving too far away from traditional values shared by Hispanics and Latinos.

Her comments come as recent polling has shown a precipitous drop in Biden's approval rating among those voters.

Only 26% of Hispanic voters approve of Biden's job performance, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. The president is disfavored by 54% of Hispanics, with an eye-popping 41% saying they ""strongly disapprove"" of the job he's doing.

Biden's overall approval rating was at 35% among registered voters surveyed, the lowest level of support recorded by Quinnipiac since Jan. 12, 2022. A 55% majority of voters disapprove of the president's job performance.

Romero said traditional Latino Democrats want the president to take action on the issues they care about.



""We're looking at the economy, we're looking at approaches to immigration. We're looking at language, my God. Here in California, amongst the Latino community, we not only celebrate Mother's Day, we celebrate two Mother's Days. So the birthing people lingo doesn't cut it for us,"" Romero said.

""We're a very entrepreneurial people. We are interested in prosperity. We value citizenship, we are a patriotic people. We are very much interested in ensuring that the Democratic Party, or any party, stands for opportunity, liberty, freedom, and the ability to achieve the American dream. Not to be given a handout, but to have an opportunity, a fair opportunity to achieve that dream if we hustle and work hard.""

The challenge for Republicans who want to earn Latino support, Romero said, is to show the party believes ""brown lives matter.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ex-top-california-democrat-says-wokeism-run-amok-is-why-biden-is-hemorrhaging-latino-support,2022-04-22
'Experts' warn against calling California crime spree 'looting' because of racial connotations,"Amid a spree of smash-and-grab robberies terrorizing businesses and shoppers in California's Bay Area, ""experts"" are warning against using the term ""looting"" to describe the crimes.

Dozens of storefronts and businesses in California were ransacked over the weekend in what local police are calling organized burglaries. In Walnut Creek, just 25 miles outside San Francisco, police said a ""criminal mob"" of 80 masked and armed robbers raided a Nordstrom department store, assaulting three employees and stealing thousands of dollars in expensive goods. Three suspects were arrested, but dozens more escaped with the merchandise.

San Jose police said thieves made off with an estimated $40,000 worth of merchandise stolen from a Lululemon store Sunday night. At the same time, a bigger attempted robbery took place at the Westfield Valley Fair Mall.

Another smash-and-grab robbery was caught on video at a jewelry store at Southland Mall in Hayward, California. Hayward police said no arrests were made and the suspects fled in several vehicles, making off with an unknown amount of loot.

And a San Francisco Louis Vuitton store was ransacked by robbers on Saturday.

Police have characterized these crimes as looting.

""The Louis Vuitton store was burglarized and looted. The Burberry in Westfield Mall was burglarized and looted,"" San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott told reporters on Saturday.

But others have shied away from using that term to describe the robberies, including experts who say ""looting"" is a term with racial connotations.

""We are talking about two incidents, we're not going to call this looting. This is organized robbery. That's what it is,"" said Sergeant Christian Camarillo with the San Jose police department, referring to the robbery at Lululemon.

KGO-TV reported Tuesday that under California Penal Code, the crimes committed do not meet the technical definition of ""looting.""

California law defines looting as ""theft or burglary ... during a 'state of emergency', 'local emergency', or 'evacuation order' resulting from an earthquake, fire, flood, riot or other natural or manmade disaster.""



A criminal justice professor at the University of New Haven said that the words police and journalists use to describe the crime matter.

""Looting is a term that we typically use when people of color or urban dwellers are doing something. We tend not to use that term for other people when they do the exact same thing,"" said Lorenzo Boyd, Ph.D., Professor of Criminal Justice & Community Policing.

KGO-TV observed that while there was no local emergency declared in the Bay Area cities where smash-and-grab crimes were committed this weekend, the identities and races of the majority of the suspects remain unknown.

Still, another expert who spoke to the local news station suggested the term ""looting"" has racial undertones.

Martin Reynolds, the co-executive director of the Robert C. Maynard Institute of Journalism Education, observed that after Hurricane Katrina, a large number of black New Orleans residents were labeled looters for ""crimes of survival"" — stealing water, food, and supplies before federal government aide arrived.

""This seems like it's an organized smash and grab robbery. This doesn't seem like looting. We're thinking of scenarios where first responders are completely overwhelmed. And folks often may be on their own,"" Reynolds told the local news station.

""People draw their own conclusions, if the terminologies that you use are tethered to people's understanding of how they have been used in the past,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/experts-warn-against-calling-california-crime-spree-looting-because-of-racial-connotations,2021-11-23
Explosive report provides new details on Fauci's lab-leak cover-up,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top expert on COVID-19, was privately urged by former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield to vigorously investigate both the lab-leak and natural origins theories of virus in early 2020, only to then exclude Redfield from discussions with world-renowned virologists and wage a PR campaign denouncing the lab-leak theory as a conspiracy theory, according to an investigative report.



The explosive report from Vanity Fair reveals new details of how Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins strongly pushed back against scientists who raised legitimate questions about the origins of the virus — questions that could implicate the NIH's financial support for the non-governmental group EcoHealth Alliance and risky bat virus research in China.

By analyzing more than 100,000 internal EcoHealth documents, interviewing five former staff members, and speaking with 33 other sources, Vanity Fair's Katherine Eban uncovered how EcoHealth Alliance operated in a world of ""murky grant agreements, flimsy oversight, and the pursuit of government funds for scientific advancement, in part by pitching research of steeply escalating risk.""

Her report delves deep inside EcoHealth Alliance, showing how the group's president, Peter Daszak, spent years wooing Fauci — at times literally at D.C. cocktail parties — to win federal support for gain-of-function studies at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab central to the lab-leak hypothesis of COVID-19's origins. Fauci, in turn, worked with Daszak, Collins, and other top virologists to lead a well-documented campaign discrediting the lab-leak theory, all the while never being completely transparent about their potential conflicts of interest should the theory prove true.



Under Fauci's tenure at NIAID, EcoHealth Alliance received a $3.7 million federal grant in 2014 to study the potential for a deadly new coronavirus to emerge from wild bats in China. The group partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, sub-awarding the lab $600,000 in federal funds, to collect virus samples from bats and analyze them.



In early 2020, the deadly COVID-19 pandemic would be traced back to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, near where the lab is located. Early analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was 96.2% similar to a previously discovered bat coronavirus, which led many scientists to believe the most likely origin for COVID-19 was that it hopped from bats to humans, possibly through an intermediary animal. However, an animal host for SARS-CoV-2 was never discovered. And unique features of the virus led some of the world's top virologists, including those associated with Fauci, to raise the possibility that it was laboratory-engineered.

The fundamental questions concerning COVID-19 are whether EcoHealth Alliance paid for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab — experiments that make viruses deadlier and more infectious to humans — and whether Chinese scientists, either with federal funding from EcoHealth Alliance or on their own, engineered the SARS-CoV-2 virus before it somehow escaped the laboratory and caused a global pandemic, killing more than six million people.

After the pandemic began, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield asked those questions.



“I personally felt it wasn’t biologically plausible that [SARS CoV-2] went from bats to humans through an [intermediate] animal and became one of the most infectious viruses to humans,” he told Vanity Fair.

As the Chinese government worked to cover up the spread of COVID-19 in late 2019 and through the new year, Trump administration officials desperately sought to learn how the pandemic started. Redfield was aware of a 2015 gain-of-function study funded by EcoHealth Alliance and published by Wuhan lab scientist Dr. Zhengli Shi with University of North Carolina virus expert Dr. Ralph Baric. The study had shown it was possible to manipulate a SARS-like bat coronavirus in a laboratory setting so that it would infect human cells, which researchers believed showed the danger that such a virus could naturally evolve to threaten humans.

The gain-of-function experiments were carried out in Baric's laboratory in North Carolina, but the Chinese scientists had learned his techniques. Redfield questioned whether scientists in Wuhan had gone on to carry out gain-of-function experiments on their own, at a laboratory with insufficient security and little international oversight. Could that be where COVID-19 came from?

According to Vanity Fair, Redfield brought his concerns to Fauci in mid-January 2020. He also shared them with Jeremy Farrar, the director of the U.K. mega-charity Wellcome Trust, and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO). His message was: “We had to take the lab-leak hypothesis with extreme seriousness.”



What happened next is scandalous. A Freedom of Information Act request by BuzzFeed News revealed that on February 1, 2020, at 12:30 a.m., Fauci emailed NIAID principal deputy director Hugh Auchincloss a copy of the 2015 gain-of-function study and wrote, ""Hugh: It is essential that we speak this AM. Keep your cell phone on."" He told Auchincloss to read the paper and wrote, ""You will have tasks today that must be done.""



Later that day, Farrar organized a conference call with 11 top international virologists including Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins to discuss what was known about the virus. Astonishingly, Redfield was excluded from the call. According to Vanity Fair, he was not even told it was happening. The person in charge of the agency leading the U.S. government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was kept out of discussions about the origins of the virus after asking Fauci and Farrar to seriously investigate all the possibilities.

The conference call was held ""in total confidence,"" and the details of the discussion remain shrouded in secrecy. What is known is that before the call, some of the participants, such as Dr. Kristian Andersen, a virologist at Scripps Research, had noted that some features of SARS-CoV-2 ""(potentially) look engineered."" Andersen told Fauci in an email that several experts who had analyzed the virus ""find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.""

But after the call, those involved would condemn the lab-leak hypothesis and those advancing it. Within three days, four of the scientists who raised the possibility of a laboratory origin for COVID-19 signed on to a draft letter declaring that “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.” That letter, titled, ""The Proximal Origins of SARS-CoV-2,"" was published in the journal Nature Medicine on March 17. National media outlets seized on the statement, inaccurately referring to it as a ""study"" that purportedly debunked the lab-leak theory.

Redfield, meanwhile, says he realized Fauci, Farrar, and the others had gone behind his back and launched a concerted effort to present the appearance of a scientific consensus that would shut down discussion of the lab-leak theory.

""They made a decision, almost a P.R. decision, that they were going to push one point of view only” he told Vanity Fair. “They argued they did it in defense of science, but it was antithetical to science.”

A spokesperson for the Wellcome Trust disputed that characterization. ""The letter was a simple statement of solidarity with highly reputable researchers based in China and against non-evidence-based theories. Dr. Farrar does not believe the letter was covertly organized. He had no conflict of interest to declare,"" the spokesperson told Vanity Fair.



Vanity Fair's report recounts several details that have been previously reported by TheBlaze and others, such as Peter Daszak's own campaign to organize scientists to denounce the lab-leak theory as a ""conspiracy"" and his effusive praise for Fauci's public comments asserting the same. It paints a picture of Daszak as egotistical, gluttonous for federal funds to keep EcoHealth Alliance afloat, and naively trusting of his partners in communist China. He sought to ""present the lab-leak hypothesis as a groundless and destructive conspiracy theory,"" all the while never disclosing that were it true, his own organization would come under intense scrutiny for funding related, risky research at the Wuhan lab.

Yet even after unanswered questions and unlikely coincidences propelled the lab-leak theory into the mainstream, Fauci and Collins continued to play defense for Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance, in public and in private.



Vanity Fair describes in a revealing incident how the NIH officials were hostile to any suggestion by scientists that contradicted the natural origins narrative or placed suspicion on China.

In June 2021, an American scientist named Dr. Jesse Bloom discovered that Chinese researchers appeared to have deleted important data from an NIH database that collects virus samples. He wrote a paper detailing how early genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had ""somehow vanished without a trace,"" suggesting that this data may provide a clue regarding the origins of COVID-19.

Bloom told Vanity Fair that he took his preprint paper to Fauci for review because it contained sensitive revelations about the NIH, given that the agency ran the database from which the viral sequences went missing. Bloom realized that the NIH itself had deleted the data, at the request of Chinese researchers at the Wuhan institute, and he wanted Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins to help him find other missing data that could shine a light on the origins of COVID-19.

Collins reportedly organized a Zoom meeting to discuss the paper on June 20. He invited outside experts, including Kristian Andersen — who had previously voiced suspicions that the virus looked potentially engineered, only to reverse those suspicions after the call with Fauci — and virologist Robert Garry, to participate on the call. Both of these scientists were also on the secretive conference call put together by Jeremy Farrar more than a year earlier. Bloom was permitted to bring his own support, and he invited evolutionary biologist Sergei Pond and genetic biologist Rasmus Nielsen.

Bloom had sought advice and support for his investigation of COVID-19's origins. Instead, the meeting was reportedly ""extremely contentious."" Andersen reportedly told Bloom his paper was ""deeply troubling"" and said it would be unethical to analyze the deleted viral sequences, since the Chinese scientists had wanted them deleted and that was their right.

Andersen — who had himself once declared that ""some of the features [of the virus] (potentially) look engineered"" — allegedly asserted there was nothing unusual about those early genomic sequences from Wuhan.

According to Bloom's account, a shouting match erupted between Nielsen and Andersen after Nielsen insisted the Wuhan sequences were ""extremely puzzling and unusual.""

But Andersen made another objection, according to Bloom, stating that he ""needed security outside his house, and my preprint would fuel conspiratorial notions that China was hiding data and thereby lead to more criticism of scientists such as himself.” This, of course, is not an objection to the scientific points Bloom raised at all.

When Fauci weighed in, he objected to the preprint paper's description of the Chinese scientists ""surreptitiously"" deleting the data, telling Bloom his choice of words was loaded and that the reason for the deletion was unknown.

Andersen reportedly made an offer to Bloom: He said he was a screener at the preprint server, which gave him access to Bloom's work before it went public. He offered to either delete the preprint or revise it ""in a way that would leave no record that this had been done,"" Bloom recounted to Vanity Fair. The offer was rejected, said Bloom, who reportedly told Andersen that it would not be appropriate to secretly edit or delete the paper ""given the contentious nature of the meeting.""

Vanity Fair reports that both Fauci and Collins thought Andersen had gone too far and distanced themselves from his offer. ""Just for the record, I want to be clear that I never suggested you delete or revise the preprint,” Fauci said, according to Bloom.

Reached for comment by Vanity Fair, Andersen called Bloom's account ""false,"" and Garry said it was ""nonsense."" Sergei Pond, however, confirmed Bloom's story as accurate after having it read aloud to him. “I don’t remember the exact phrasing—I didn’t take any notes—but from what you described, that sounds accurate. I definitely felt bad for poor Jesse."" He told Vanity Fair that the ""charged-up"" atmosphere struck him as ""inappropriate for a scientific meeting."" A spokesperson for Fauci did not comment.

This account is disturbing. At the very least, it shows how Fauci, Collins, and the others strongly pushed back against any criticism of their preferred COVID-19 origins narrative, even dismissing legitimate questions raised by scientists earnestly seeking the truth. There is no scientific reason for silencing that debate. But as the NIH's ties to EcoHealth Alliance and the potential conflicts of interest therein demonstrate, there were plenty of political reasons for doing so.

Facebook AI mislabeled a video of black men as primates,"Facebook apologized for a ""clearly unacceptable error"" after the artificial intelligence on the social media network mislabeled a video of black men as ""primates.""

The Daily Mail originally posted a video to Facebook in June 2020 titled: ""White man calls cops on black men at marina."" The video has nearly 10 million views on Facebook.

Facebook users who viewed the video were shown an auto-generated prompt asking if they would like to ""keep seeing videos about Primates,"" the New York Times reported.

While humans are indeed primates, most people would associate the word ""primates"" with animals such as monkeys, lemurs, and apes, and not people.

Former Facebook content design manager Darci Groves noticed the prompt, and voiced her concerns on Twitter.

""Um. This 'keep seeing' prompt is unacceptable, @Facebook,"" Groves wrote in a tweet, which included a screenshot of the prompt. ""And despite the video being more than a year old, a friend got this prompt yesterday. Friends at FB, please escalate. This is egregious.""

Facebook apologized for the prompt, and disabled its topic recommendation feature.

""This was clearly an unacceptable error and we disabled the entire topic recommendation feature as soon as we realized this was happening so we could investigate the cause and prevent this from happening again,"" Facebook spokesperson Dani Lever said in a statement.



""As we have said, while we have made improvements to our AI we know it's not perfect and we have more progress to make,"" Lever continued. ""We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.""

In July 2020, Facebook announced that it had launched new equity teams to study if the company's algorithms are racially biased.

This isn't the first time that the use of AI has resulted in questionable results. In 2015, Google's Photo app tagged photos of black people as ""gorillas."" The search engine giant apologized for the error.

In 2016, Google came under fire again for image search results. At the time, a Google image search for ""three black teenagers"" resulted in photos of mugshots, but a search of ""three white teenagers"" resulted in groups of smiling young people.

In April, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission warned that artificial intelligence technology ""can produce troubling outcomes – including discrimination by race or other legally protected classes."" The FTC threatened companies, ""Hold yourself accountable— or be ready for the FTC to do it for you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-ai-primates-black-video,2021-09-04
Facebook blocks users from sharing NY Post story about BLM co-founder's pricey home-buying spree,"Facebook is censoring the New York Post — again.

Users on the platform reported Thursday that they weren't able to share the link to a story, published by the Post, that detailed Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors' recent multimillion-dollar ""real estate buying binge.""

In the story, the Post reported that as protests and riots were carried out last year in the name of Black Lives Matter — and as money poured into the organization's coffers — the group's co-founder snagged four high-end homes worth a total of $3.2 million. The Post article highlighted the irony of a self-proclaimed Marxist like Khan-Cullors cashing in on a grassroots movement.

But when users went to share the story, they were blocked from doing so. TheBlaze can confirm that as of Friday afternoon the article was still restricted from being shared on a personal Facebook page or through the platform's Messenger app.

When attempting to share the link, an alert pops up on screen, saying, ""Your post couldn't be shared, because this link goes against our Community Standards.""

Shortly after, the Daily Mail reported that itscoverage of news was also being censored.

In an explanation provided to the Post, Facebook stated, ""This content was removed for violating our privacy and personal information policy.""

Facebook evidently gave a lengthier explanation to the Daily Mail, saying, ""As per our Community Standards: We do not allow people to post personal or confidential information about yourself or of others. We remove content that shares, offers or solicits personally identifiable information or other private information that could lead to physical or financial harm, including financial, residential, and medical information, as well as private information obtained from illegal sources.""

In a response to the most recent censorship, the New York Post editorial board wrote: ""This decision is so arbitrary as to be laughable. Does Facebook know how many newspapers, magazine and websites highlight the real estate purchases of the rich and famous? The next time People magazine covers Kim Kardashian's latest mansion purchase, will it violate any community standards? How about running a picture of the resort Ted Cruz is staying at?""

""No, this rule has not been and will not be applied in any fair manner,"" the board added.

But the Post and the Daily Mail were not the only ones penalized by the social media overlords for their coverage of the news. Conservative journalist and sports commentator Jason Whitlock was suspended by Twitter after speaking out in criticism of Khan-Cullors' pricey home-buying spree.

""Black Lives Matter founder buys $1.4 million home in Topanga, which has a black population of 1.4 percent ... She's with her people!"" he tweeted on Friday only hours before being suspended from the platform.

Details about Khan-Cullors' purchase of the estate in Topanga Canyon was first reported by Dirt.com.

In their response article, the Post's editorial board noted that its original story didn't include addresses for any of the BLM co-founder's homes, and that all of the information was compiled from public records.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-censors-ny-post-blm-founder-story,2021-04-16
Facebook keeps a secret list of VIPs who are allowed to break the rules without consequences: Report,"Facebook has a secret internal system that exempts high-profile celebrities, athletes, politicians, and journalists from its content moderation standards, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

The program is called ""cross check"" or ""XCheck,"" and it was initially developed as ""a quality-control measure for actions taken against high-profile accounts,"" the Journal reported. It is intended to prevent ""PR fires,"" or the bad press that comes from an erroneous enforcement action taken against people considered VIPs.

The effect of this program is that there are ""invisible elite tiers"" within Facebook that determine who must follow the rules and who gets a special exemption that allows them to break the rules without fear of consequences. Approximately 5.8 million high-profile Facebook users were protected from enforcement action as of 2020, and only 10% of the posts protected by XCheck are actually reviewed, according to documents obtained by the Journal.

""At times, the documents show, XCheck has protected public figures whose posts contain harassment or incitement to violence, violations that would typically lead to sanctions for regular users,"" the Journal reported. ""In 2019, it allowed international soccer star Neymar to show nude photos of a woman, who had accused him of rape, to tens of millions of his fans before the content was removed by Facebook. Whitelisted accounts shared inflammatory claims that Facebook's fact checkers deemed false, including that vaccines are deadly, that Hillary Clinton had covered up ""pedophile rings,"" and that then-President Donald Trump had called all refugees seeking asylum 'animals.'""

""We are not actually doing what we say we do publicly,"" an internal company review obtained by the paper said. The review said the program is ""a breach of trust"" and reinforced the point that ""unlike the rest of our community, these people can violate our standards without any consequences.""

A spokesman for Facebook told the Journal that criticism of XCheck is fair, but that the system ""was designed for an important reason: to create an additional step so we can accurately enforce policies on content that could require more understanding.""

He said that Facebook is reviewing its policies to address criticisms that the company lacks the will or ability to enforce its content moderation standards fairly.

""A lot of this internal material is outdated information stitched together to create a narrative that glosses over the most important point: Facebook itself identified the issues with cross check and has been working to address them,"" the spokesman said.

But according to the Journal, when it comes to the XCheck program, Facebook has misled the reviewers it put in place for oversight and accountability.

After the independent Oversight Board Facebook established to review its content moderation decisions upheld the suspension of former President Donald Trump, the board requested that Facebook ""report on the relative error rates and thematic consistency of determinations made through the cross check process compared with ordinary enforcement procedures.""

Facebook declined to do so, telling the board ""it's not feasible to track this information"" and referring the board to a 2018 blog post that stated, ""We remove content from Facebook, no matter who posts it, when it breaks our standards.""

But the XCheck documents reported by the Journal indicate that claim is not true.

The Oversight Board told the Journal in a statement that it ""has expressed on multiple occasions its concern about the lack of transparency in Facebook's content moderation processes, especially relating to the company's inconsistent management of high-profile accounts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-secret-list-vips-break-rules,2021-09-13
Facebook will pay more than $14 million in settlement with DOJ for discriminating against US workers,"Facebook will pay more than $14 million in penalties in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice after the federal government accused the Big Tech company of discriminating against U.S. workers in favor of foreigners, the agency said Tuesday.

In a separate settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor, the company promised to do more to recruit Americans and agreed to submit to ongoing audits to ensure compliance with federal regulations.

These settlements come after the DOJ filed a lawsuit against Facebook in December 2020 alleging that the company ""engaged in intentional and widespread violations of the law, by setting aside positions for temporary visa holders instead of considering interested and qualified U.S. workers."" The government said Facebook had failed to properly advertise at least 2,600 open jobs and did not consider applications from U.S. citizens before offering those positions to foreign workers whom the company had sponsored for green cards between 2018 and 2019.

Federal law prohibits employers from discriminating against workers based on their citizenship or immigration status. And under DOL regulations, would-be employers must demonstrate that there are no qualified U.S. workers available before they offer jobs to foreign workers they sponsor for temporary visa applications.

After an investigation found that Facebook's hiring practices violated the law, the company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $4.75 million to the U.S. government and up to $9.5 million to eligible victims of its alleged discrimination. Officials said the civil penalty and back pay fund ""represent the largest fine and monetary award that the Division ever has recovered in the 35-year history of the [Immigration and Naturalization Act]'s anti-discrimination provision.""

""Facebook is not above the law, and must comply with our nation's federal civil rights laws, which prohibit discriminatory recruitment and hiring practices,"" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said. ""Companies cannot set aside certain positions for temporary visa holders because of their citizenship or immigration status. This settlement reflects the Civil Rights Division's commitment to holding employers accountable and eradicating discriminatory employment practices.""



Officials said Facebook will also train staff on federal anti-discrimination requirements. Over the next three years, the company's applications for temporary visa holders will be regularly audited by the Labor Department to check for compliance with the federal government's permanent labor certification program.

""This settlement is an important step forward and means that U.S. workers will have a fair chance to learn about and apply for Facebook's job opportunities,"" added Department of Labor Solicitor Seema Nanda. ""No matter an employer's size or reach, the Department of Labor is committed to vigorously enforcing the law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-settlement-doj-discriminating-against-us-workers,2021-10-19
Purportedly fake high school football team allegedly lied to ESPN to get on national television: 'How was ESPN scammed this badly??',"A purportedly illegitimate high school football team reportedly lied about its football team in order to play on national television via ESPN.

What are the details?

On Sunday, Complex reported that it appeared ESPN was duped by a fake high school football team with a coach who reportedly has an active arrest warrant for fraud.

That day, the sports network aired a high school football game between Florida's IMG Academy, defending national champions, and Ohio's largely unknown Bishop Sycamore.

Of the face-off, Complex's Daniel Barna wrote, ""While we've seen mismatched opponents square off in nationally televised games before, this was something different entirely. IMG are defending national champs and consistently one of the best teams in the country. Apparently ESPN was under the impression that Bishop's program was also stacked with top recruits.""

""That clearly wasn't the case,"" Barna added, pointing out that the Florida team took home an easy 58-0 win.

The game's announcers apparently realized in real time that they'd been had, Barna noted, and ended up expressing concerns for the players' safety.

""They also admitted live on the air that they had been misled by Bishop, and didn't do due diligence to verity that what they had been told about the calibre of the players was true,"" Barna added.

According to the Awful Announcing, ESPN broadcaster Anif Shroff during the game raised eyebrows for saying, ""Bishop Sycamore told us they had a number of Division I prospects on their roster. To be frank, a lot of that we could not verify. They did not show up in our database, they did not show up in the databases of other recruiting services. So, OK, that's what you're telling us, fine, that's how we take it in. From what we've seen so far, this is not a fair fight, and there's got to be a point where you're worried about health and safety.""

Shroff later took to Twitter where he added, ""Sorry. They had no business being in that game today. None. I feel bad for the kids. Player health and safety was at risk today. It was uncomfortable for anyone who watched.""



A fake team with a coach wanted on suspicion of fraud?

Coach Roy Johnson, who led the Bishop team to their devastating defeat, reportedly has an active arrest warrant out for fraud.

Football Scoop notes that Bishop Sycamore may not even be a legitimate high school, and appears to be an online-only charter school with a ""football team"" who reportedly went 0-6 last season.

According to the outlet, many of the team's players are said to have already graduated from high school.

""With all this information readily available online, it's unclear why or how ESPN agreed to air the game in the first place,"" Barna concluded.

On Monday, new details about the school emerged noting the Ohio High School Athletic Association doesn't recognize Bishop Sycamore as a legitimate high school, and their 'physical location, practice facilities, and roster eligibility could not be verified.'""



The team also played a game on Friday — making Sunday's game its second game in two days.

""According to Awful Announcing, the game was scheduled by Paragon Marketing Group, whose president, Rashid Ghazi, denied having knowledge of Bishop Sycamore's Friday game,"" Barna added. ""Ghazi also said the company did not do due diligence in researching the team.""



A spokesperson for ESPN announced that they discussed the snafu with Paragon Marketing Group, which it said ""secured the matchup and handles the majority of our high school event scheduling.""

“They have ensured us that they will take steps to prevent this kind of situation from happening moving forward,"" the spokesperson added.

Social media user Dawson Boyd summed up the bewildering event in a succinct and now-viral tweet.

He wrote, ""From this story that keeps getting wilder: There has never been a Bishop Sycamore[.] They played two games in three days[.] Their head coach currently has an ACTIVE arrest warrant[.] Most of the players are JUCO dropouts who are nowhere near HS age[.] How was ESPN scammed this badly??""

Family of burglary suspect who was fatally shot while breaking into officer's home says shooting is unjustified,"The family of a burglary suspect who was fatally shot while breaking into a Fulton County, Georgia, home says that the officer's shooting was unjustified — and now they're looking for donations.



What are the details?

The incident took place on Saturday when the unnamed deputy received a notification on his phone that someone was trying to enter his home.

The suspect, identified as 59-year-old Bobby Lee Sutton, was said to be breaking into the deputy's home after having reportedly kicked in the door.

The deputy, who was on his way home after his shift, received the notification from his doorbell camera that a man was breaking into his home.

When he arrived at home — still wearing his uniform and equipment — he reportedly discovered the suspect leaving the premises with a load of tools and other household items, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement on the incident.

The deputy — who was driving his personal vehicle, according to reports — began following the suspect down a gravel road.

The suspect was said to have rushed off into the woods as the deputy approached him, and so the deputy followed.

Investigators said that a confrontation ensued while the two were in the woods, and the deputy ended up discharging his duty pistol, striking the suspect.

Atlanta police were dispatched to the scene and found the deputy performing CPR on the suspect.

The suspect was taken to a nearby hospital, but died from his wounds.

According to reports, authorities discovered the deputy's personal property in the woods.

Sutton's family now says that the officer was not justified in shooting their loved one.

“You get out of your car, you follow him in a wooded area, and you shoot him down like he’s nobody – like he has no family or nothing,” Sutton's niece, Montanique Sutton, said. “That’s not fair! That’s not justice.”

She added that Sutton was an ""all-around good person.""

“To know him is to love him. He was no stranger to anybody,” she said.

At the time of this reporting, a GoFundMe page to benefit the family has received just $5 in donations.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is handling the investigation.

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether the officer will face criminal charges in connection with the fatal shooting.

"Family of slain 'Rust' cinematographer sues Alec Baldwin, other producers for 'reckless conduct'","The family of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer shot and killed during production of the movie ""Rust"" last year, filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Tuesday against Alec Baldwin and other producers for their involvement in the fatal shooting.

Hutchins, 42, died on Oct. 21 while preparing to film a scene at the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The crew was reportedly lining up camera angles when an old-fashioned revolver held by Baldwin went off, sending a bullet through Hutchins's torso. The bullet would go on to strike the film's director, Joel Souza, as well, before lodging in his shoulder.

Hutchins is survived by her husband, Matthew Hutchins, and the couple's 9-year-old son, Andros.



In the lawsuit, the family accused Baldwin and others of reckless conduct and aggressive cost-cutting measures that endangered the crew and ultimately led to Hutchins' death.

""Halyna Hutchins deserved to live, and the Defendants had the power to prevent her death if they had only held sacrosanct their duty to protect the safety of every individual on a set where firearms were present, instead of cutting corners on safety procedures where human lives were at stake, rushing to stay on schedule, and ignoring numerous complaints of safety violations,"" the lawsuit states, according to the New York Times.



In a news conference held in Los Angeles, California, after filing the suit, attorney Brian Parish said the family is seeking ""substantial"" and ""fair"" compensation, noting Matthew ""lost his long-term wife who was the love of his life, and his son has lost a mother.""

""It is a young boy who will never have a mother,"" Panish said, according to Yahoo News. ""We need to hold the people responsible that engaged in this cost-cutting and reckless behavior causing this senseless death... it never should have happened.""

Panish would go on to say that many people are culpable in Hutchins's death, though he singled out Baldwin.

""Mr. Baldwin was the person holding the weapon that, but for him shooting it, she would not have died. So clearly, he has significant portion of liability but there are others and that's what this case is gonna be about,"" Panish said.

""Alec had the gun in his hand, he shot it, Halyna was killed,"" Panish said. ""The gun cannot fire unless the trigger is engaged and the hammer is back.""

In the months following the tragic incident, Baldwin has expressed remorse but maintained that he was pointing the gun at Hutchins at her request and did not pull the trigger, a claim that has been backed up by ""Rust"" assistant director, Dave Halls. Baldwin has also maintained that the gun was declared ""cold"" moments before he took hold of it.

""Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property,"" Baldwin said in December. ""Someone is responsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me.""

Critics, however, have suggested that guns don't just go off and that Baldwin and others on set appeared to have been breaking the most basic standards of gun safety. Reports surfaced claiming the crew had used firearms used in the movie for live-ammo target practices.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office continues to investigate the incident, with a focus on determining how a live round made it onto the set and inside a gun that would be used in the movie.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/family-of-rust-cinematographer-sues-alec-baldwin,2022-02-15
"Fauci: Risk of catching COVID-19 outdoors is 'extremely low,' expect new mask guidance soon","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon issue new guidance on wearing masks outdoors, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who also said the risk of contracting COVID-19 while outdoors is ""extremely low.""

Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, told CNN's Jim Acosta on Sunday to expect new recommendations soon, noting that all along, health experts have been saying the risk of contracting the virus outdoors is minimal.

""The risk when you're outdoors – which we have been saying all along – is extremely low. And if you are vaccinated, it's even lower. So you're going to be hearing about those kinds of recommendations soon,"" he said.

Fauci's comments echo what he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos earlier that day, when he said ""it's pretty common sense"" that the risk of catching COVID-19 outdoors is low.

""I think it's pretty common sense now that outdoor risk is really, really quite low, particularly — I mean, if you are a vaccinated person, wearing a mask outdoors, I mean, obviously, the risk is minuscule,"" Fauci said.

He went on to say that new guidance from the CDC is forthcoming.

""What I believe you're going to be hearing, what the country is going to be hearing soon is updated guidelines from the CDC. The CDC is a science-based organization. They don't want to make any guidelines unless they look at the data, and the data backs it up,"" he said.

""But when you look around at the commonsense situation, obviously, the risk is really very low, particularly if you are vaccinated,"" he added.

The CDC's current guidance advises Americans, even those who have been fully vaccinated, to continue wearing masks and social distancing six feet apart from other people to mitigate spread of the virus. The CDC also says that ""masks may not be necessary when you are outside by yourself away from others, or with people who live in your household,"" but advises Americans to obey local mask mandates in places that have them.

Fauci's latest comments on the risk of contracting COVID-19 outdoors appear to be another flip-flop.

At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Dr. Fauci said, ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" adding that while mask-wearing may ""make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet ... it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."" But as time went on and medical researchers learned more about the virus, Fauci changed his position and became a strong proponent of wearing masks at all times, even outdoors.

During a Facebook live chat with Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) last August, Fauci advised people to ""get as much outdoors as you possibly can,"" noting that ""superspreader"" events almost always happen indoors in places like ""nursing homes, meat-packing, prisons, choirs in churches, congregations of weddings and other social events where people get together.""

""Nothing's 100%, but it's almost invariable that it's indoors. So when you are indoors, make sure you have a mask. When you're outdoors, keep the mask on,"" Fauci said.

On Oct. 7, Fauci reiterated that being outside is ""much less of a risk, but it is a risk."" He advised people who want to gather outdoors at places like the beach to gather with people they know have tested negative for the virus and to socially distance and wear masks when appropriate.

""If you separate into almost like pods of people that you know are being careful — maybe people who have been tested, you know they're negative, you know they're not being reckless — and stay with them, but not all over them,"" Fauci said. ""You could be separated by a fair amount. Obviously, you're not want to be wearing a mask when you jump in the water. Swim around, have fun. But when you come out, when you're congregating, put a mask on.""

President Joe Biden will give an address on the state of the pandemic Tuesday. During his remarks, the president will reportedly announce the new CDC guidance, though exactly what the new guidelines will be remains unclear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-covid-outdoors-risk-new-mask-guidance,2021-04-26
Fauci refuses to budge when confronted about damning NIH letter seemingly admitting risky research funding,"Dr. Anthony Fauci refused to budge on his narrative Sunday when confronted about a new letter from the National Institutes of Health, which seemingly admitted the agency engaged in gain-of-function research at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology.

What is the background?

Throughout the pandemic — and in several notable exchanges with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) — Fauci has denied the NIH funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan bio laboratory.

In one definitive instance, Fauci told Paul at a congressional hearing in May:

I do not have any accounting of what the Chinese may have done, and I'm fully in favor of any further investigation of what went on in China. However, I will repeat again, the NIH and NIAID categorically has not funded gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

However a top NIH official — principal deputy director Dr. Lawrence Tabak — released a letter last week that seemingly admitting to funding risky gain-of-function research.

Vanity Fair underscored the significance of the NIH letter. ""But the NIH letter—coming after months of congressional demands for more information—seemed to underscore that America's premier science institute has been less than forthcoming about risky research it has funded and failed to properly monitor. Instead of helping to lead a search for COVID-19's origins, with the pandemic now firmly in its 19th month, the NIH has circled the wagons, defending its grant system and scientific judgment against a rising tide of questions.""

What is Fauci saying now?

During an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" Fauci refused to admit that he has been less than forthcoming about the NIH funding risky research.

In response to Paul taking a victory lap after the release of the NIH letter, Fauci said Paul is still wrong.

""Well, I obviously totally disagree with Sen. Paul. He's absolutely incorrect. Neither I nor Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, lied or misled about what we've done,"" Fauci said.

Fauci continued:

The framework under which we have guidance about the conduct of research that we fund, the funding at the Wuhan Institute was to be able to determine what is out there in the environment, in bat viruses in China. And the research was very strictly under what we call a framework of oversight of the type of research. And under those conditions which we have explained very, very clearly, does not constitute research of gain-of-function of concern.

When asked by host George Stephanopoulos whether the NIH letter proves what Vanity Fair explained — that the NIH engaged in riskier research than what agency officials have admitted — Fauci held his position.

""No, it isn't. We knew what the risk was, and what the oversight is,"" he said.

Fauci, in fact, said the real problem is that people don't know the definition of gain-of-function research.

""When people talk about gain-of-function, they make that implication which I think is unconscionable to do, to say, well, maybe that research led to SARS-CoV-2,"" Fauci said. ""You can ask any person of good faith who's a virologist, and they will tell you, absolutely clearly, that that would be molecularly impossible.""

""So, things are getting conflated, George, that should not be conflated,"" Fauci claimed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-does-not-budge-risky-research-nih-letter,2021-10-24
Timeline: How top health experts colluded to bury the COVID-19 lab-leak theory,"In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and his colleagues both within the federal government and in the broader scientific community appear to have coordinated their response to public reporting of the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not originate naturally, discrediting the suggestion that it was engineered in a laboratory and accidentally leaked.

An examination of over 3,200 pages of Dr. Fauci's emails, made public by a Freedom of Information Act request from BuzzFeed News, shows how on the weekend of Jan. 31, 2020, Fauci and his associates engaged in discussions on the scientific evidence related to the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and on reports that the virus was possibly leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China.

In the months following these discussions, Fauci, other public officials, members of the scientific community, and their media echo chamber would strongly push back against the lab-leak hypothesis, and would successfully prevail upon major media outlets and social media companies to silence anyone who asked questions about the hypothesis.

Perhaps most troubling about this episode is that there is no obvious, science-based reason for any of the people involved in the coordinated messaging effort to shut down public discussion of the lab leak theory. Public discussion of the lab leak theory, after all, would have had no scientific bearing on how the pandemic should be treated or managed from a public health perspective. Even if the lab leak theory was completely wrong or contrary to the best scientific evidence, what scientific, non-nefarious reason could there possibly have been to prevent public discussion of the theory? None springs readily to mind.

The consensus narrative that emerged was that scientific evidence supported an alternative theory — that the virus began in bats and evolved naturally to be transmissible among humans. Researchers traced the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic to a so-called ""wet market"" in Wuhan, China, where live wild animals were sold for human consumption. From there, they said, the virus spread globally, infecting more than 172,903,158 people and leading to as many as 3,717,197 deaths worldwide.

There were those who questioned the prevailing narrative, who wondered if it was more than coincidence this novel coronavirus emerged in a city located near the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That premier research institution is one of only three laboratories in the world that performs ""gain-of-function"" research — altering virus strains to be more transmissible to humans in order to study how they may evolve naturally and create more effective vaccines — on bat-related coronaviruses.

Many virologists, including Dr. Fauci and several of his colleagues, believe such research is necessary to understand how viral pandemics could strike and needed to develop preventative countermeasures to mitigate the loss of human life. Others say the work to make viruses deadlier is dangerous and, if an accident happens, could cause a pandemic not unlike the ongoing one.

What if, some wondered, Chinese scientists in a lab known to have security issues had fiddled with a bat coronavirus, made it transmissible to humans, and accidentally released it upon an unsuspecting world?

But the people asking such questions were viciously attacked. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), for instance, was denigrated as a conspiracy theorist. As were countless others. For more than a year, the mainstream media left the authoritative consensus view unchallenged, defending it against all dissent. The expert opinions of Fauci, WIV lead researcher and ""bat woman"" Shi Zhengli, zoologist and EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak, and others in government and respected positions of academia were accepted as scientific law by social media companies, which proceeded to deplatform dissenting voices in the name of combatting ""misinformation.""

But now the ""fringe"" lab-leak theory is getting a second look. Those that insist SARS-CoV-2 is a naturally occurring virus have failed to produce a bat or other animal that carries a virus with a matching genetic signature. Fauci and others involved in last year's discussions are walking back their assurances that SARS-CoV-2 was not engineered in a lab and somehow released. The White House's top health adviser now says he's keeping an ""open mind"" about the lab-leak theory and that a ""fair, open investigation"" is needed to determine the source of the pandemic.

In the interest of a ""fair, open"" inquiry, it is worth reviewing media reports, public statements by prominent scientists, and private email communications disclosed by records requests made in the course of the last year that raise questions about the campaign against the lab-leak hypothesis and the possible motivations interested parties had in protecting ""gain-of-function"" research from public outrage by stamping out discussions linking it to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key figures

Dr. Anthony Fauci: a NIAID bureaucrat approaching 40 years of service who was the federal government's most visible spokesman for all things coronavirus-related throughout last year. His agency is responsible for approving research grants to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit research organization, as well as virtually every similar organization in the United States.

Peter Daszak: a fierce opponent of the lab-leak theory and president of EcoHealth Alliance. Between 2014 and 2019, his organization funneled $3.4 million in National Institutes of Health grants provided by Fauci's subagency to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study bat coronaviruses. He was also the only American on a 10-member team that the World Health Organization sent to China last winter to investigate the origins of the virus. At least one major virologist has claimed that Daszack's nonprofit helped fund risky ""gain-of-function"" research.

Dr. Ralph S. Baric: the William R. Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North Carolina. He is a world leader in the study of the coronaviruses. He has conducted gain-of-function research at his institution and in 2015 he began collaborating with Shi Zhengli, the lead Chinese researcher at WIV, nicknamed China's ""bat woman."" Shi is a virologist who has identified dozens of deadly coronaviruses by exploring bat caves and collecting samples. Her coronavirus research is funded in part by the NIH grants provided by EcoHealth Alliance.

Timeline of events

November 2011: Dutch scientist Ron Fouchier publishes a controversial gain-of-function study showing how an H5N1 avian influenza virus could be genetically altered in a lab to be transmissible between ferrets, animals that closely mimic the human response to flu. The study ignites heated debate over gain-of-function research and support begins building to ban federal funding for such research in the United States. Dr. Fauci, his colleague National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, and NIAID director of vaccine research Gary Nabel write an op-ed in the Washington Post defending Fouchier's gain-of-function study.

June 2012: Three men working in a copper mine in southwestern China fall ill with pneumonia-like symptoms and die. Six months later, Chinese researchers led by Shi Zhengli investigate the mine shaft, collecting samples from bat guano and discovering a diverse group of coronaviruses in six bat species. Among the samples collected is a virus called RaTG13, which scientists believe is the closest known relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.



May 2014: Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance receives a $3.4 million grant from Fauci's NIAID to study bat coronaviruses in China. Over the next four years, it provides $133,000 annually to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and $66,000 in the fifth year.

October 2014: After high profile lab accidents involving anthrax and smallpox, and media attention surrounding the Ebola outbreak, Fauci reconsiders his position and the Obama administration announces a moratorium on funding for gain-of-function research for influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses. At the time, Dr. Ralph Baric, described by a colleague as the ""foremost coronavirus biologist in the United States,"" was conducting several gain-of-function experiments in his North Carolina laboratory. He would tell NPR, ""It took me 10 seconds to realize that most of them were going to be affected"" after he learned of the moratorium.

November 2015: Dr. Baric publishes a collaborative study with Shi Zhengli that showed how the spike protein of a novel coronavirus could infect human cells. The researchers used mice as test subjects and ""generated and characterized a chimeric virus"" by inserting the protein from a Chinese rufous horseshoe bat into the molecular structure of the 2002 SARS virus, engineering a new pathogen. The acknowledgements of the study note it was funded by grants from Fauci's NIAID. ""Experiments with the full-length and chimeric SHC014 recombinant viruses were initiated and performed before the [gain-of-function] research funding pause and have since been reviewed and approved for continued study by the NIH,"" the authors note.

December 2017: ""The National Institutes of Health will again fund research that makes viruses more dangerous,"" read an article from Nature after the Trump administration lifted the moratorium on gain-of-function research. The Department of Health and Human Services was instructed to create a framework to review proposed gain-of-function research before approving funding for these projects. It creates the Potential Pandemic Pathogens Control and Oversight (P3CO) Framework.

January 2018: U.S. Embassy officials visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology and reportedly become very concerned about a shortage of appropriately trained technicians at the lab, which is storing dangerous virus samples. They reviewed Shi Zhengli's research and concluded ""continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention."" Because they deemed the research so important, they requested that the U.S. government provide additional resources to the Wuhan lab to address safety concerns.

December 2019: Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China, reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. On Dec. 31, 2019, at 8:16 a.m., Dr. Baric emails EcoHealth President Peter Daszak with the subject line, ""RE: have you heard any news on this? maybe as many as 27 cases with 7 severe in wuhan---ards like pneumonia."" Daszak responds a half an hour later informing Baric that his EcoHealth colleague Hongying Li is feeding him information on the pneumonia cases in what appears to be real time. Daszak's emails were obtained as part of a public records request issued by U.S. Right to Know.

Jan. 6, 2020: Erik Stemmy, the program officer for the Respiratory Diseases Branch Division of Microbiology and Infections Diseases at NIAID, emails Daszak asking if he had any new information on the viral outbreak in China. Daszak replies that he has some off-the-record information and in follow-up emails discusses receiving emerging data on from his Chinese contacts.

Jan. 12, 2020: China publishes what it claimed was the genetic sequence of a new coronavirus believed to be responsible for the pneumonia cases emerging in Wuhan. EcoHealth Alliance analyzes the Chinese data and determines the virus is related to SARS. Daszak writes in an email to Stemmy that the virus is ""close to SARr-CoV Rp3 that we published from our past NIAID work. This came from a Rhinolophus bat in S. China."" He notes that Dr. Baric was ""already working to reconstruct and rescue the virus in the lab from the sequence, so he can do further work on it.""

Jan. 22, 2020: A World Health Organization delegation to China announces there is evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Wuhan. A day earlier, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control confirmed the first U.S. COVID-19 case.

Jan. 23, 2020: Shi Zhengli's research team reports the novel coronavirus' genetic sequence is 96.2% similar to a previously identified bat coronavirus named RaTG13, information Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance appeared to have access to before it was published.

Jan. 30, 2020: U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) suggests that China is lying about the role of the Wuhan seafood market in the origins of the coronavirus. He refers to an article in the Lancet that found of the 40 original COVID-19 cases, 14 of them had no contact with the market, including the person believed to be Patient Zero.

Jan. 31, 2020: Reporter Jon Cohen publishes an article in Science discussing efforts by researchers to investigate the origins of the virus. The article covers Zhengli's work and leans into the emerging hypothesis that the virus occurred naturally in bats and evolved to be transmissible to humans. Cohen also discusses ""conspiracy theories"" linking China's coronavirus research to weapons research. Molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University is quoted raising concerns over gain-of-function research and expressing his opinion that what became to be known as the SARS-CoV-2 virus is ""consistent with entry into the human population as either a natural accident or a laboratory accident."" Daszak is also quoted blasting the suggestion the virus was engineered.

Jan. 31, 2020 8:43 PM: The article is forwarded in an email to Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci in turn forward the article to several of his NIH colleagues and to Jeremy Farrar, the head of a British non-profit organization and Kristian Andersen, a professor at Scripps Research, writing ""This just came out today. You may have seen it. If not, it is of interest to the current discussion."" Both of these individuals would go on to strongly denounce the lab-leak hypothesis in the coming weeks.

Jan. 31, 2020 10:32 PM: Andersen replies to Fauci, praising the article but noting difficulties in tracing the origins of the virus. ""The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" Andersen would later say that while he and other scientists strongly considered the lab leak a possibility, further research led him to the conclusion that the virus was not engineered.

Feb. 1, 2020 7:29 AM: Fauci sent an email to NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss, writing ""It is essential that we speak this AM. Keep your cell phone on ... read this paper as well as the e-mail that I will forward to you now. You will have tasks today that must be done."" Attached to the email was a copy of the 2015 gain-of-function study authored by Baric and Zheng-Li that was funded by NIAID. Fauci soon after forwarded Cohen's Science magazine article to Auchincloss.

Feb. 1, 2020 8:19 AM: Fauci emailed the 2015 study to NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence Tabak with the subject line ""IMPORTANT."" ""Here it is,"" Fauci wrote.

Feb. 1, 2020 10:34 AM: Farrar sent an email blast announcing a 2 p.m. conference call. In bold lettering, his email declared ""information and discussion is shared in total confidence and not to be shared until agreement on next steps."" The email also included an agenda for the call, with Farrar presenting ""Introduction, focus and desired outcomes"", Andersen giving a ""summary,"" ""comments"" from Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist and virologist at the University of Sydney, a ""Q&A"" session for everyone, and ""summary and next steps"" presented by Farrar again to conclude the call. There were 13 people, including Fauci and Andersen, listed on the agenda.

Feb. 1, 2020 10:34 AM: Auchincloss responds to Fauci's email, writing ""The paper you sent me says the experiments were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by NIH. Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Coronavirus work has gone through the P3 framework. She will try to determine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.""



The Washington Examiner notes ""Emily"" likely refers to Emily Erbelding, the director of NIH's division of microbiology and infectious diseases. The ""P3 framework"" refers to the P3CO framework HHS set up in 2017 to review gain of function research proposals before issuing grants. Since the paper in question was published in 2015, before the P3CO framework was created, it wouldn't have been reviewed by that body, raising questions about how NIH reviewed and approved Baric's gain of function research in 2015 while the Obama moratorium was still in place.



Fauci told Auchincloss, ""OK. Stay tuned.""

Feb. 1, 2020 2:00 PM: The conference call organized by Farrar is presumably held on time. Emails recapping what was discussed are redacted, including notes from Ron Fouchier, the Dutch scientist who in 2011 authored the controversial gain-of-function study that inspired a campaign to ban that research. But following this discussion, the public campaign against the lab-leak theory intensified.

Feb. 2, 2020: NIH Director Francis Collins emails Farrar to tell him he is available to call WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""Let me know if I can help get through his thicket of protectors,"" he wrote, copying Fauci and Tabak. About two hours later, Collins emails Farrar again, with Fauci copied, writing ""Really appreciate us thinking through the options ..."" before a redacted line.



At 11:28 a.m., Farrar emails Fauci and Collins, writing: ""Tedros and [WHO representative in China Dr. Bernhard Schwartländer] have apparently gone into conclave … they need to decide today in my view. If they do prevaricate, I would appreciate a call with you later tonight or tomorrow to think how we might take forward."" At the end of the email, Farrar wrote ""meanwhile"" and linked to a ZeroHedge article published that day that reported on claims that COVID-19 was engineered in the Wuhan-based lab.

Feb. 3, 2020: ZeroHedge is banned from Twitter for publishing a ""coronavirus conspiracy theory."" On the same day, Tedros delivers a speech to the WHO executive board that mentions, among other priorities for the organization, the need to ""combat the spread of rumors and misinformation."" Twitter did not respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze about whether Fauci or anyone else from the NIAID contacted them about the ZeroHedge article to flag it for ""disinformation.""



""We have worked with Google to make sure people searching for information about coronavirus see WHO information at the top of their search results,"" Tedros said. ""Social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Tencent, and TikTok have also taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation.""



Also on this day, Business Insider publishes an article juxtaposing Sen. Cotton's remarks from several days ago with ""conspiracy theories"" alleging that the virus originated in a Chinese lab linked to a biowarfare program. Cotton made no such allegations, but his sensible concerns that China lied were tied to the conspiracy theory.

Feb. 4, 2020: Four days after writing to Fauci about the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 virus looks ""engineered,"" Kristian Andersen provides input on a statement EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak is drafting to strongly condemn the lab-leak hypothesis. Andersen advises the authors of the statement to ""be more firm on the question of engineering."" ""The main crackpot theories going around at the moment relate to the virus being somehow engineered with intent and that is demonstrably not the case,"" Andersen wrote. He argues that data conclusively shows the virus causing COVID-19 was not engineered.

Feb. 6, 2020: Daszak continues to organize colleagues and associates to sign ""a statement in support of the scientists, public health and medical professionals of China."" The statement is intended to authoritatively discredit the lab-leak hypothesis. In emails, Daszak writes that he intends the statement ""not be identifiable as coming from any one organization or person"" but rather to be seen as ""simply a letter from leading scientists"". Daszak also writes that he wants ""to avoid the appearance of a political statement.""



In an email to Dr. Baric with the subject line, ""No need for you to sign the 'Statement' Ralph!!"" Daszak suggests it would be best if he and Baric refrain from signing the statement ""so it has some distance from us and therefore doesn't work in a counterproductive way."" Baric agrees in reply, writing ""otherwise it looks self-serving and we lose impact.""

Feb. 9, 2020: Margaret Brennan falsely claims Cotton ""suggested that the virus may have come from China's biological warfare program"" on ""Face the Nation."" A tweet from ""Face the Nation"" summarizing the TV segment accuses Cotton of latching on to a ""conspiracy theory"" and Cotton's account fires back. But the horse is out of the barn and for the next year or so the media denigrated Cotton as a conspiracy theorist. In May 2021, with the benefit of hindsight, Matthew Yglesias would finally clear up the truth about what Cotton said for his progressive audience.

Feb. 19, 2020: The completed statement is published in The Lancet with 27 prominent public health scientists signing on to condemn ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" Notably, Andersen is not among the signatories even though he helped draft the statement. A year later when his emails were made public, Andersen claimed, ""I did not sign the Lancet letter because I (+ coauthors) found it premature to conclude there was no lab leak without carefully analyzing available data first."" It is not clear why, if it was premature for Andersen to sign the statement, it was NOT premature for him to help write it. It is difficult to overstate the importance of the publication of this statement. As noted in a Vanity Fair article probing the investigation of the virus's origins, when this statement was issued, it ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

March 5, 2020: Science Feedback, one of Facebook's fact-checking platforms, releases a ""fact check"" of a New York Post article that cited Daszak as an expert source to rule there was ""no evidence"" supporting the lab-leak hypothesis.

He encourages Fauci and the others to provide comments or suggestions about the paper or its press release if they have them. Two days later, Fauci replies, ""Nice job on the paper."" March 15, 2020: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, reaches out to Fauci about the possibility of collaborating with Fauci regarding what constitutes ""authoritative information"" about COVID-19. Part of this communication remains redacted.

March 17, 2020: Andersen's paper, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2"" is published and becomes the most influential study on the origins of the virus. ""We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the authors wrote. National media outlets seized on the study as the definitive final word on the matter. The lab-leak hypothesis was put to death and those repeating President Donald Trump's claims to the contrary were just as ignorant, anti-Science, conspiracy-minded, and racist as the president, as far as the media was concerned.

March 21, 2020: Daszak champions Andersen's study on social media. In the following months, he would continue to use his Twitter account to forcefully attack the ""conspiracy theorists"" contradicting Andersen's study.

April 16, 2020 5:02 PM: NIH Director Collins emails Fauci with the subject line ""conspiracy gains momentum. The text is redacted, but there is a link to a Mediate story covering Fox News host Brett Baier reporting that ""multiple sources"" believe COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab before escaping and infecting the population. Fauci's response is redacted.

April 18, 2020: Dr. Fauci, in his capacity as the chief spokesman for the White House at the daily coronavirus response briefings, endorses Andersen's study and rejects the lab-leak hypothesis. The narrative that ""science"" says the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not engineered in a lab prevails.



Later that day, Daszak emails Fauci: ""I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus's origins.""

April 20, 2020: Fauci shares three articles with Washington Times reporter Bill Gertz arguing in favor of a natural origin for COVID-19 and pushing back against the lab-leak theory.

April 30, 2020: The U.S. Intelligence Community releases a statement endorsing the ""scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified."" Later that day, President Donald Trump claims to have seen evidence that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, contradicting his administration's official position. He tells the media he is ""not allowed"" to share the evidence with them. Trump's contradiction of the ""scientific consensus"" ignites a media firestorm and any public questioning of Fauci's determination on the origins of the coronavirus became taboo.

May 4, 2020: Fauci dismisses the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from a lab during an interview with National Geographic, likening it to a ""pie in the sky"" theory.

May 5, 2020: Fauci receives a forwarded email from Ian W. Lipkin, a virologist at Columbia University and one of the five co-authors of Andersen's ""proximal origin"" paper. Lipkin shared an email communication he had with former Chinese minister of health Chen Zhu about COVID-19's origins. The redacted message reads in part, ""Uncertainty about the origin of COVID-19 pandemic is causing friction worldwide, particularly between China and the United States. There is agreement that the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 originated in a bat. There is also a high level of confidence that the virus was not deliberately modified in any laboratory.""



Lipkin tells Fauci, ""We deeply appreciate your efforts in steering and messaging.""

Aug. 27, 2020: Under Fauci's leadership, NIAID awarded 11 new grants with a total first-year value of $17 million to establish the Centers for Research in Emerging Infectious Diseases (CREID). CREID will be a global network that will investigate how and where viruses and other deadly pathogens emerge in the wild and cause people to get sick. Over the next five years, NIAID will provide $82 million to support this network. Kristian Andersen and Peter Daszak, who worked with Fauci on messaging about the origins of the coronavirus, are among the recipients of this funding.

Dec. 9, 2020: Months later, State Department officials reportedly gathered to discuss an upcoming fact-finding mission to Wuhan organized in part by the World Health Organization. The State Department had classified intelligence that three Wuhan Institute of Virology researchers were conducting gain-of-function experiments in autumn 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak happened. Christopher Park, the director of the State Department's Biological Policy Staff in the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, allegedly warned the officials not to say anything that would draw attention to the U.S. government's role in gain-of-function research.



Four former State Department officials interviewed by Vanity Fair claim they were told not to open a ""Pandora's box"" by investigating the lab-leak theory. The warnings ""smelled like a cover-up,"" said Thomas DiNanno, who wrote a memo obtained by Vanity Fair accusing the State Department of warning his staff not to pursue an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

There are severalfascinatingarticles detailing how after America's top health experts spent the last year discrediting the lab-leak hypothesis, their failure to produce a sufficient explanation for COVID-19's natural origins has brought alternative views back into the mainstream. But what is astounding is that after repeated assurances that there was nothing worth investigating, after a year of messaging to the contrary, Fauci and other proponents of the natural-origin theory are now hedging their bets.

The question should be asked, were those discrediting the lab-leak hypothesis working to find the truth about COVID-19's origins in order to best inform and protect the public? Or were they defending millions of dollars of funding for experimental research, lifetimes of work, their jobs, and their credibility against a hypothesis that put it all at risk?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-messaging-timeline,2021-06-04
"Hawley calls on Fauci to resign, demands covid origins investigation","Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci to resign from his post following the controversy ignited by the release of emails from the nation's top epidemiologist regarding the coronavirus pandemic. Hawley is also demanding an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

""Anthony Fauci's recently released emails and investigative reporting about #COVID19 origins are shocking,"" Hawley stated on Friday, and called for him to step down as the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""The time has come for Fauci to resign and for a full congressional investigation into the origins of #COVID19 - and into any and all efforts to prevent a full accounting.""

""The public deserves to know if persons within the US govt tried to stop a full investigation into #COVID origins, as recently reported,"" the Republican Senator of Missouri said. ""And Congress must also find out to what extent Fauci's NIAID was involved in financing research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.""

More than 3,200 pages of Fauci's emails were made public via a Freedom of Information Act request from BuzzFeed News and the Washington Post. There are numerous concerns regarding Fauci's emails, including his opposition to wearing face masks at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also questions whether Fauci colluded with other top health officials to bury the theory that coronavirus was created in a lab and escaped.



Hawley is demanding a full congressional investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Fauci had been saying that the coronavirus naturally evolved, and dismissed the lab leak theory. But then in late May, Fauci reversed course and called for an investigation into COVID-19's origins and acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Fauci was asked if he still believed that coronavirus developed naturally, to which he responded, ""No, I'm not convinced about that. I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened.""

Others have called for an investigation into the origins of coronavirus, including 18 high-profile scientists who published a letter calling for an inquiry to ""determine the origin of the pandemic,"" noting that ""theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.""

""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks,"" the scientists proclaimed.

There are also 209 House Republicans demanding a congressional investigation into the origin of coronavirus, and to see if the Chinese Communist Party attempted to cover it up. Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.), the top Republican on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) demanding a probe.

""We request that you instruct the appropriate Democrat committee chairs to immediately join Republican calls to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its role in causing the global COVID-19 pandemic,"" the letter reads. ""There is mounting evidence the pandemic started in a Chinese lab, and the CCP covered it up. If that is the case, the CCP is responsible for the deaths of almost 600,000 Americans and millions more worldwide.""

Vanity Fair published a bombshell report this week following months of investigating, which found ""conflicts of interest"" including large U.S. government grants ""supporting controversial virology research, known as 'gain-of-function.'"" Vanity Fair investigative reporter Katherine Eban claimed the conflicts of interest ""hampered"" the investigation into the coronavirus origins by the United States government.



As far as Fauci being fired, the White House said he's going nowhere and called him ""a renowned public servant.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki declared there was no circumstance under which President Joe Biden would fire Fauci, who is the president's chief medical adviser.

""He's overseen the management of multiple global health crises and attacks launched on him are certainly something we wouldn't stand by,"" Psaki said on Friday. ""I understand there's interest in the emails. He's answered a lot of questions on the emails, I don't think I'm gonna have much more to add on them from here.""



""The President and the administration feel that Dr. Fauci has played an incredible role in getting the pandemic under control, being a voice to the public throughout the course of this pandemic,"" Psaki said during Thursday's White House press briefing. ""And, again, I would reiterate a lot of these emails are from 17 months ago or more, certainly predating this administration, but some time ago in — as we look to history.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-resign-emails-hawley-covid-origins,2021-06-05
Federal court: Constitution protects beauty pageant's right to exclude transsexual whose presence undercuts expression of real womanhood,"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled on Wednesday that a national beauty pageant doesn't have to include a transsexual claiming to be a woman.

A 2-1 majority on a three-judge panel determined that the Nevada-based Miss United States of America pageant's message about womanhood cannot be divorced from its selection of participants. Forcing the pageant to accept the transsexual plaintiff would ""fundamentally alter"" the pageant's ""expressive message in direct violation of the First Amendment.""

The lawsuit

""Anita"" Green is a transsexual Democrat from Oregon who claims to be a woman. Green started taking hormone replacement therapy at the age of 18. Green claimed in a 2017 opinion piece that he ""started living full time"" as a ""woman"" at the age of 19.

Green has been permitted to compete against real women in a number of pageants including Miss Montana USA, Miss Earth, and Ms. World Universal. Although Green missed the Miss Montana top ten by a long way, Green was the titleholder for Miss Elite Earth Oregon in 2019.

In 2019, Green was barred from Miss United States of America's 2019 Oregon pageant on the basis that Green is not a woman. The rules for the United States of America Pageants (Teen, Miss, and Ms.) all require that entrants are ""natural born female[s]"".

Green told Willamette Week, ""I felt as though I was being invalidated ... I felt as though the organization was saying I am not woman and I'm not woman enough.""

Green, precluded from edging out biological women in Oregon to compete with 49 real women nationwide, sued the pageant in December 2019.

The Oregonian reported that the suit Green filed in a U.S. District Court in Portland contended that while the Nevada-based pageant corporation is a private business, the way it operates requires that it follow Oregon public accommodation law.

Green's lawyer said the ""Defendant's 'natural born female' policy is not only unlawful, but it sends a hurtful and false message to transgender women that they are not women. Pageants that operate in Oregon must comply with Oregon law and may not discriminate on the basis of gender-identity.""

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reckoned otherwise.

The federal appellate court's decision

The federal appellate court voted 2-1 in favor of the Miss United States of America pageant, ruling none of Green's arguments were persuasive.

Judge Lawrence VanDyke, who sided with the pageant, wrote for the majority: ""As with theater, cinema, or the Super Bowl halftime show, beauty pageants combine speech with live performances such as music and dancing to express a message. ... And while the content of that message varies from pageant to pageant, it is commonly understood that beauty pageants are generally designed to express the ‘ideal vision of American womanhood.'""

VanDyke noted that the pageant's constitutionally protected message concerning what constitutes womanhood and what female qualities ought to be extolled ""cannot be divorced from the Pageant's selection and evaluation of contestants.""



Type, quality, and group selective casting is neither unprecedented nor always controversial.

The court referenced the Broadway musical ""Hamilton,"" noting that the ""expressive decision"" to cast nonwhite actors to play white Founding Fathers was ""applauded,"" but also believed to be ""central to the message of the musical itself. ... And this message could be delivered only by excluding certain people from performing.""

Similarly, in a production such as a women's pageant, the decision to have particular kinds of participants (women) is central to the message, in this case, about womanhood.

VanDyke wrote that the Miss United States of America pageant ""would not be able to communicate 'the celebration of biological women' if it were forced to allow Green to participate.""

The First Amendment protects the pageant's right to voice this message and ""mandates that we presume that speakers, not the government, know best both what they want to say and how to say it.""

VanDyke quoted another judgment, writing, ""'There can be no clearer example of an intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association than a regulation that forces the group to accept members it does not desire.'""

The AP reported that John Kaempf, the attorney representing the pageant, recognized the court's dismissal of Green's lawsuit as ""simple fairness.""

Kaempf said, ""The Ninth Circuit's conclusion says it all: 'Green asks to use the power of the state to force Miss United States of America to express a message contrary to what it desires to express. The First Amendment says no.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-court-constitution-protects-beauty-pageants-right-to-exclude-transsexual-whose-presence-undercuts-expression-of-real-womanhood,2022-11-04
Federal court orders release of imprisoned True the Vote leaders who claimed China-linked Konnech committed the crimes for which it has now been charged,"On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordered the emergency release of the two leaders of the election integrity group True the Vote who were thrown in jail last month for refusing to give up the name of one of their confidential sources. Their source allegedly provided them with proof that the scandal-plagued election software company Konnech had compromised and stored American data in China.

The newly liberated duo indicated that they will ""continue to protect and defend those who do the vital work of election integrity, and ... will make sure that their findings become a matter of public record.""

Sued

Konnech is an election software company based in Michigan. It licenses election software still utilized by various municipalities and counties across America.

Catherine Engelbrecht, the founder of True the Vote, and Gregg Phillips, a board member, claimed that Konnech was ""owned by the Chinese Communist Party"" and involved in the ""subversion of our elections.""

Eugene Yu, the founder and CEO of Konnech, was arrested on Oct. 4 and charged on suspicion of data theft, having allegedly stored ""critical information that [US election] workers provided on servers in China.""

Yu was also charged with grand theft by embezzlement of funds exceeding $2.6 million.

According to prosecutor Eric Neff, the crimes allegedly committed by Konnech amount to the ""largest data breach in United States history.""

In response to Engelbrecht and Phillips' claims that Konnech had done what it has now been charged with doing, the Michigan-based company filed a defamation lawsuit against True the Vote on Sept. 12, suggesting that the duo's accusations of wrongdoing were damaging.

In the subsequent proceedings, Konnech demanded that the True the Vote leaders provide the names of anyone who may have been involved in their efforts to expose the company for its alleged malfeasance.

Konnech successfully obtained a restraining order to that effect, which Judge Hoyt found the duo in contempt of on Oct. 27.

After being found in contempt, Phillips wrote on Truth Social, ""Doing the right thing isn't always easy but it's always right. We were held in contempt of court because we refused to burn a confidential informant or our researchers. We go to jail on Monday unless we comply.""

In an Oct. 28 post, Phillips complimented Engelbrecht, writing that despite being ridiculed by Konnech's lawyers, ""She answered with confidence and pride in her Country. She didn't buckle. She stood against the abuse and the oppressors. I'm so proud to be her friend, her colleague, and her brother in Christ.""

The True the Vote account posted on the eve of the duo's arrest that if Engelbrecht and Phillips were ultimately arrested, ""We won't be gone forever.""

Imprisoned

Federal Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt had Engelbrecht and Phillips imprisoned on Oct. 31 after both election integrity activists followed through on their refusal the previous week to give up the name of an individual they allege is a confidential FBI informant.

The duo was marched out of court by U.S. Marshals.

Engelbrecht and Phillips were to remain in jail until they ""fully compl[ied],"" providing the court with the identities of their contacts.



On Nov. 3, the duo filed an application for mandamus seeking relief from the order of detention, in which they contended ""the district court's order represents a clear abuse of discretion and a manifest miscarriage of justice.""



The motion characterized Hoyt's order as ""draconian"" and noted that the duo's ""continued detention has caused them personal and professional harm. Continued detention by its very nature is irreparable.""

Liberated

According to court documents obtained by Just the News, a panel of three Republican-appointed Fifth Circuit judges (i.e., Judges Catharina Haynes, Kurt Engelhardt, and Andrew Oldham) ordered Engelbrecht and Phillips to be released.



On Sunday, Engelbrecht issued a statement about her then-forthcoming release from prison: ""Those who thought that imprisoning Gregg and I would weaken our resolve have gravely miscalculated. It is stronger than ever.""

""The right to free and fair elections without interference is more important than our own discomforts and even this detention, now reversed by a higher court,"" wrote Engelbrecht.

Engelbrecht wrote on Truth Social Monday afternoon, ""We're out. Gregg and I are incredibly grateful for everyone’s prayers and support. I’ll say this, what is publicly known is just the tip of the iceberg. Please stay connected. We’re all in this together. Hold the line. Keep the faith. God is good.""

After being sprung from jail, Phillips wrote, ""These are the days of the patriot games.""

Phillips had previously suggested that ""it's 1984 in America.""

The duo is now free, but their fates remain uncertain. Konnech, on the other hand, will have its Chinese links further explored and its CEO appear in court on Nov. 17.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-court-orders-release-of-imprisoned-true-the-vote-leaders-who-claimed-china-linked-konnech-committed-the-crimes-for-which-it-has-now-been-charged,2022-11-07
"In incredible dissent, federal judge launches broadside attack on SCOTUS precedent protecting left-wing press","A federal judge called for a landmark Supreme Court decision on freedom of the press and libel laws to be overturned in a fiery dissent decrying ""bias against the Republican Party,"" blasting the near ""one-party control"" of legacy news media, slamming Silicon Valley's censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story, and warning that the current state of American media is ""a threat to a viable democracy.""

U.S. Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman, a Reagan appointee, launched a broad attack on the Supreme Court's unwillingness to revisit precedent and the news media in a dissent in Tah v. Global Witness — a defamation case. After arguing against the court majority's ruling on the merits of the case, Silberman was ""prompted to urge the overruling of New York Times v. Sullivan"" — a landmark ruling that established what a plaintiff must show to prove a claim of defamation or libel made against a publisher.

Silberman described that ruling, which has made it extraordinarily difficult for an individual to successfully sue the press for false reporting, as a ""policy-driven decision masquerading as constitutional law"" that ""badly constitutionalized an area of law refined over centuries of common law adjudication.""

Acknowledging that the Supreme Court is unlikely to reverse its opinion, he nevertheless said ""new considerations have arisen over the last 50 years that make the New York Times decision a threat to American Democracy. It must go.""

New York Times v. Sullivan is a Civil Rights-era decision that established additional First Amendment protections for the press against lawsuits for defamation or libel.



In the 1960s, the New York Times published a full-page advertisement soliciting donations for the legal defense of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had been charged with perjury. The ad contained several factual inaccuracies and claims that police in Montgomery, Alabama, had locked civil rights demonstrators in a college campus dining room ""in an attempt to starve [the students] into submission,"" among other threats of violence. Montgomery Public Safety Commissioner L.B. Sullivan — who was not named in the advertisement but was in charge of the police force — sued the Times for defamation in a case that was litigated up to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously for the New York Times in a decision that was influenced in part by the practice of southern officials threatening northern newspapers reporting on civil rights abuses with lawsuits to silence them.

The court established a test for defamation or libel claims, ruling that the First Amendment requires a plaintiff to show that the defendant had acted with ""actual malice,"" that he knew that a published statement was false or was reckless in deciding to publish that information without investigating whether it was accurate.

""One can understand, if not approve, the Supreme Court's policy-driven decision. There can be no doubt that the New York Times case has increased the power of the media,"" Silberman wrote. ""Although the institutional press, it could be argued, needed that protection to cover the civil rights movement, that power is now abused.""

""As the case has subsequently been interpreted, it allows the press to cast false aspersions on public figures with near impunity. It would be one thing if this were a two-sided phenomenon,"" the judge continued, observing that the press ""more often manufactures scandals involving political conservatives.""

""The increased power of the press is so dangerous today because we are very close to one-party control of these institutions,"" he warned.

Silberman goes on to state that ""bias against the Republican Party"" is long-standing, blasting the New York Times and the Washington Post as ""virtually Democratic Party broadsheets."" He calls other news outlets including the Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, and Boston Globe, along with ""nearly all television — network and cable"" ""a Democratic Party trumpet.""

He further decried the ""enormous influence"" that Silicon Valley exerts over the distribution of the news, saying ""it similarly filters news delivery in ways favorable to the Democratic Party."" He cited Facebook and Twitter's censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story as proof of ""viewpoint discrimination.""

""Ideological homogeneity in the media — or in the channels of information distribution — risks repressing certain ideas from the public consciousness just as surely as if access were restricted by the government,"" Silberman wrote.

He concluded: ""It should be borne in mind that the first step taken by any potential authoritarian or dictatorial regime is to gain control of communications, particularly the delivery of news. It is fair to conclude, therefore, that one-party control of the press and media is a threat to a viable democracy. It may even give rise to countervailing extremism. The First Amendment guarantees a free press to foster a vibrant trade in ideas. But a biased press can distort the marketplace. And when the media has proven its willingness—if not eagerness—to so distort, it is a profound mistake to stand by unjustified legal rules that serve only to enhance the press' power.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-attacks-scotus-precedent-protecting-left-wing-press,2021-03-19
Federal judge blisters New York Democrats over illegal congressional district map: 'This is a Hail Mary pass',"A federal judge slammed New York Democrats on Wednesday after they sought an emergency injunction requesting the state's primary election next month use a congressional district map that was illegally gerrymandered.

What is the background?

Last month, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled that New York Democrats violated the state constitution by drawing a gerrymandered congressional district map ""with impermissible partisan purpose.""

Because of the ruling and to allot enough time to redraw the map, congressional and state Senate primary elections were moved from June 28 to Aug. 23.

The map, proposed earlier this year, was described as ""brutal"" for Republicans because it essentially guaranteed Democrats would win 22 of the state's 26 congressional districts.

What happened now?

New York Democrats sought relief in federal court this week. They argued the state's June primary should be allowed to move forward using the illegal map because there is not enough time to draw ""new district lines and still comply with a longstanding federal court order meant to protect the rights of Americans casting ballots from overseas,"" according to the New York Times.

But federal District Judge Lewis Kaplan, a Democrat, vehemently disagreed.



Kaplan mocked New York Democrats for treating the June 28 date as if it ""came down on a stone tablet in the middle of the Negev or wherever Moses brought the tablet down from on high,"" Politico reported.

""This is a Hail Mary pass, the object of which is to take a long shot try at having the New York primaries conducted on district lines that the state says are unconstitutional,"" the judge chided.

In fact, Kaplan suggested Democrats' request demonstrated a lack of respect for fair elections and the judicial system.

""In the 102 years since my father, then a Ukrainian refugee, came into this country, if there were two things that he drilled into my head, they were … free, open, rational elections [and] respect for the courts,"" Kaplan said, Politico reported. ""The relief that I’m being asked to give today impinges, to some degree, on the public perception of both. And I’m not going to do that.""

What happens now?

In the coming days, a panel of judges, including Kaplan and two others, will hear Democrats' arguments in full. If they reject Democrats' arguments, then Democrats can appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Otherwise, New York's primaries will proceed with newly drawn maps.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-blisters-new-york-democrats-congressional-district-map,2022-05-05
Federal judge rules university ‘room scans’ unconstitutional,"A federal judge ruled this week that it was unconstitutional for a university in Ohio to require a “room scan” from a chemistry student before he took a remote test.

Room scans are a common requirement in proctored exams “where students are forced to use their device’s camera to give a 360-degree view of everything around the area in which they’re taking a test,” explains the pro-privacy organization Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF).

The decision could significantly affect how schools use monitoring software that has grown increasingly popular since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2021, Cleveland State University student Aaron Ogletree was preparing to take a remote test. Before starting the exam, Ogletree was asked to show the virtual proctor his bedroom, where he was taking the test.

Reason reports that Ogletree expressed reservations about allowing the scan. Ogletree sent an email to Cleveland State Testing Services to note that he ""currently [had] confidential settlement documents in the form of late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to secure them."" However, Ogletree ultimately complied with the scan. The scan lasted between 10 seconds and one minute.

Ogletree then sued the university, alleging that the room scan violated his Fourth Amendment rights protecting U.S. citizens against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" Cleveland State — a public university — responded that room scans are not ""searches,"" because they are limited in scope, conducted to ensure academic fairness and exam integrity, and not coerced, reports NPR.

The school also argued, according to court documents, that the scan was ""brief, only revealed items in plain view, and the student controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the house to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera.""

U.S. district court Judge J. Philip Calabrese ultimately decided in Ogletree's favor. ""Mr. Ogletree's privacy interest in his home outweighs Cleveland State's interests in scanning his room. Accordingly, the Court determines that Cleveland State's practice of conducting room scans is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,"" Judge Calabrese stated.

""We hope more schools will recognize that just because an invasive surveillance tool exists, it isn't necessarily helpful to education,"" Jason Kelley, the Associate Director of Digital Strategy at EFF, told Reason. ""And as this ruling illustrates, it may in fact be a violation of students' rights.""

The school’s legal representative, Dave Yost, who is also Ohio’s attorney general, is “reviewing the decision and consulting with the university on possible next steps,” according to the New York Times.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-rules-university-room-scans-unconstitutional,2022-08-27
Feds reject Florida surgeon general's warnings about dangers of mRNA vaccinations,"On October 7, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued guidance for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, stating that with ""a high level of global immunity to COVID-19, the benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by this abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men"" in the 18-39 age group. The guidance cited analysis that showed an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related deaths in this demographic within 28 days following mRNA vaccination.

On Monday, elements of the federal health establishment responded, rejecting Ladapo's guidance and restating their advocacy for Americans of all ages to get vaccinated.

Ladapo's censored guidance

The guidance issued last week by the Florida surgeon general referred to a self-controlled case series wherein ""only individuals who have experienced an event are included and all time invariant confounding is eliminated.""

The analysis found a significant increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination. Men over 60 were reportedly found to have a 10% increased risk of cardiac-related death within the same time frame.

The guidance also noted that non-mRNA vaccines ""were not found to have these increased risks among any population.""

Ladapo, who previously suggested that healthy young children should not receive the experimental COVID-19 vaccine, recommended that those with preexisting heart conditions, such as myocarditis and pericarditis ""should take particular caution when considering vaccination.""

On Friday, Ladapo tweeted these findings along with his recommendation. Twitter, however, promptly blocked the post.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' (R) press secretary, Bryan Griffin, called the censorship ""an unacceptable and Orwellian move for narrative over fact.""

After receiving significant backlash for taking down the surgeon general's post, Twitter restored it on Sunday morning.

Ladapo told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on October 10 that had it been known ""two years ago or so that this vaccine would increase cardiac deaths in young men by 84%,"" there is no way it would have been approved.



Federal backlash

The Orlando Sentinel reported that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Sarah Lovenheim characterized Ladapo's guidance as ""flawed and a far cry from the science,"" suggesting that the mRNA vaccines ""have been proven safe and effective.""



Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, stated, ""We've continued to do these benefit-risk assessments, and they continue to be highly favorable, again, across all of the different age ranges ... including males 18-39.""

Marks suggested that the analysis cited by Ladapo shouldn't dissuade Americans from getting a vaccine ""despite the fact that yes, it is true that there could be some side effects.""

Jason Salemi, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, reportedly suggested that ""better-designed studies that are comprehensive and actually seek better data"" should be conducted before potentially lifesaving recommendations are made.

Extra to elements of the federal and medical establishment, others without scientific bona fides have castigated Ladapo.

Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist called Dr. Ladapo a ""quack"" on Twitter.

DeSantis' rapid response director answered back forcefully, suggesting Crist may be out of his depth.

This is not the first time that Ladapo has been met with criticism.

Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said earlier this year that to ""say he's out of the mainstream would be an understatement."" Jha and others have characterized Ladapo's recommendations as ""unorthodox,"" particularly when it came to his 2020 claim that lockdowns ""won't stop the spread.""

Though allegedly ""out of the mainstream,"" Ladapo was ultimately vindicated about lockdowns. A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation found that lockdowns were unlikely to have provided significantly more benefits to slowing the spread of the disease than alternative voluntary measures.

Other studies

In terms of the disproportionate danger posed to young men by the mRNA vaccines, Ladapo's guidance is bolstered by findings from other studies.

An FDA-funded study published in June concluded that an ""increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis was observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and was highest in men aged 18-25 years after a second dose of the vaccine.""



A June 24 Canadian study supported by Public Health Ontario and the Public Health Agency of Canada found ""increased rates of myocarditis or pericarditis following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines,"" with particularly higher incidences ""among male individuals aged 18 to 24 years.""

Another study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association reached the same conclusion, but suggested that the ""risk should be considered in the context of the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccination.""

Some experts are now reevaluating the benefits and deciding against giving mRNA vaccines to different demographics.

For instance, earlier this year, Sweden decided against recommending the vaccines to children ages 5-11.

Britta Bjorkholm of country's Health Agency stated, ""With the knowledge we have today, with a low risk for serious disease for kids, we don't see any clear benefit with vaccinating them.""

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 15.6 million American children ages 6 months to 4 years old have not been given a single COVID-19 vaccine dose; 17.8 million kids 5-11 have not received a dose; and 8.5 million kids ages 12-17 have not received a dose.

Last month, Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of National Institutes of Health (NIH) working group on vaccines, told CNN that he feared government health agencies might ""say everybody should get it when in fact, the healthy young person is unlikely to benefit from the booster dose, and so I hope they targeted more specifically, to those really who are most likely to benefit.""

Last year, two top FDA vaccine regulators, Marion Gruber and Philip Krause, resigned ahead of the agency's agreement to recommend mRNA boosters. One month later, an FDA advisory panel voted 16-2 against recommending the booster shots for Americans ages 16 years and up.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feds-reject-florida-surgeon-generals-warnings-about-dangers-of-mrna-vaccinations,2022-10-11
"Woman with concealed carry license shoots at crooks who pointed gun at her, tried to steal her car in Chicago — and 13-year-old male with crooks is shot","A woman with a concealed carry license shot at a group of males who pointed a gun at her as they attempted to steal her car in Chicago last week — and a 13-year-old male who was with the would-be thieves was shot, police told WBBM-TV.

What are the details?

Four to five males were trying to break into a parked car in the 1100 block of East 52nd Street in Hyde Park at 7:58 p.m. Friday, police told the station.

The 34-year-old woman who owns the car confronted the group, after which one of them pulled a gun and pointed it at her, police told WBBM.

With that, the woman fired her own gun at the group and hit one of the would-be thieves — a 13-year-old male, police told the station.

The boy was struck in the neck and taken to the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital in fair condition, police added to WBBM.

The rest of the would-be thieves? Police said they all ran off, and no weapon was recovered, and no one else was injured, the station reported.

Crime victims in Chicago fighting back

The incident is the latest example in recent days of crime victims in Chicago fighting back.

Last Monday, a robbery victim stabbed to death a 15-year-old male who pulled a gun on him aboard a Chicago train.

A man was on a Red Line train near 63rd Street just after 3 a.m. when a group of seven approached him, and one member of the group — the 15-year-old male — pulled out a gun in an apparent attempt to rob the man, WBBM-TV reported in a separate story, citing Chicago police chief of detectives Brendan Deenihan.

Deenihan told the station the man pulled out a knife and stabbed the gun-wielding 15-year-old male, who fled the scene with everyone else and later died at a hospital.

In addition, six people with weapons attacked and tried to rob a train passenger early in the morning of July 22, but the victim pulled a knife and fought back. Three of the suspects were wounded and hospitalized, all six were arrested, but the victim also was wounded and hospitalized.

The 42-year-old victim got on a train at Addison Street on the North Side around 2 a.m., when three people tried to take his cellphone and began attacking him, police Superintendent David Brown said, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

During the struggle, the victim took out a small knife and stabbed one of his attackers in the back, the paper said.

At the North/Clybourn stop, the three robbers left the train as a fourth person entered it and began attacking the victim, Brown added to the Sun-Times, after which the victim stabbed that attacker in the neck, and the attacker stabbed the victim in the collarbone.

With that, six suspects began chasing the victim around the train platform and train cars, Brown said, according to the paper. In addition, two of the suspects hit the victim in the head with a glass bottle and other objects, Brown added, the Sun-Times said.

Three of the six robbers were hospitalized, the paper said, adding that the victim was hospitalized in serious condition. He suffered stab wounds and cuts, Patch said.

Shawn Gullens, 20, Latoya Thomas, 22, Martinez Owens, 24, and Larone Williams, 36, were charged with one felony count of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon and one felony count of aggravated battery to a transit employee, WBBM said. Vernon Holman, 52, was charged with one felony count of armed robbery and one felony count of battery with the use of a deadly weapon, the station added. It isn't clear what happened to the sixth arrested person.

'Do not fight back. Be compliant'

In response to the most recent stabbing, Chicago Transit Authority vice president of security Kevin Ryan told WBBM that victims fighting back isn't wise: ""What the Chicago police will tell you to do — do not fight back. Be compliant. Do not put yourself in harm's way further.""

Ryan told WBBM up to 250 unarmed security guards are patrolling the CTA system daily; the station said the stated goal is to have 300.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/female-concealed-carrier-foils-theft,2022-08-01
'It tells me that I’m not good enough': Female HS track star recalls 'devastating' impact of losing to transgender athletes,"A former female high school track star recently slammed the progressive push to allow transgender athletes to compete in women's sports, noting that her personal experience of competing against biological males had a ""devastating"" effect on both her confidence and collegiate opportunities.

Chelsea Mitchell, once heralded the ""fastest girl in Connecticut,"" explained in an opinion piece published by USA Today why her and three other female athletes — who were forced to compete against transgender athletes for most of their high school careers — decided to sue the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference last year.

In the column, Mitchell recalled the thoughts that ran through her head prior to a race she competed in last February. Though she should have been feeling ""confident"" and ""excited,"" she remembered only thinking about how all her training and exercise ""might not be enough, simply because there's a transgender runner on the line with an enormous physical advantage.""

Amazingly, despite her obvious disadvantages, Mitchell would go on to win that race. But unfortunately that victory was an outlier for her due to the CIAC's decision to define sex by gender identity, and not biology.

""I've lost four women's state championship titles, two all-New England awards, and numerous other spots on the podium to transgender runners. I was bumped to third place in the 55-meter dash in 2019 behind two transgender runners,"" Mitchell recalled. ""With every loss, it gets harder and harder to try again.""

""That's a devastating experience,"" she added. ""It tells me that I'm not good enough; that my body isn't good enough; and that no matter how hard I work, I am unlikely to succeed, because I'm a woman.""

Later in the column, Mitchell pointed out that over and above the psychological toll that losing repeatedly to transgender athletes can have on women, CIAC's and similar policies can inflict several other ""tangible harms,"" as well — including robbing them of the chance to compete for scholarships or race in front of scouts at high-profile meets.

""I'll never know how my own college recruitment was impacted by losing those four state championship titles,"" she explained. ""When colleges looked at my record, they didn't see the fastest girl in Connecticut. They saw a second- or third-place runner.""

Mitchell, along with Alanna Smith, Selina Soule, and Ashley Nicoletti, sued the CIAC in February 2020 for depriving them of fair competition by allowing transgender athletes to compete alongside women. Since 2017, when the organization changed its rules, two biological male athletes, Andraya Yearwood and Terry Miller, have dominated high school female track in the state.

The legal firm representing the female athletes in court, Alliance Defending Freedom, noted in a news release that Yearwood and Terry collectively ""have taken 15 women's state championship titles (titles held in 2016 by nine different Connecticut girls) and have taken more than 85 opportunities to participate in higher level competitions from female track athletes in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons alone.""

Nonetheless, a federal district court recently dismissed the female athletes' lawsuit. In her USA Today column, Mitchell vowed to appeal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/female-track-star-says-competing-against-transgender-athletes-is-devastating,2021-05-25
Female weightlifters allegedly told to 'be quiet' when they complain about transgender woman Laurel Hubbard competing against them,"On the heels of the news that New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard — a biological male who identifies and competes as a female — is set to become the first-ever transgender athlete to compete in the Olympics, it appears some biological female athletes are none too pleased.

And their concerns apparently don't just fall on deaf ears; allegedly they're told to shut up about the unfairness of it all.

What are the details?

Former Olympic weightlifter Tracey Lambrechs said in regard to Hubbard, ""We're all about equality for women in sport, but right now that equality is being taken away from us. I've had female weightlifters come up to me and say, 'What do we do? This isn't fair, what do we do?' Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do because every time we voice it, we get told to be quiet,"" Australia's 7 News reported.

Lambrechs — who won a bronze medal for New Zealand at the 2014 Commonwealth Games — added that she's ""quite disappointed, quite disappointed for the female athlete who will lose out on that spot,"" the station reported, citing TVNZ.

The New Zealand Olympic Committee isn't expected to name its weightlifting team until June, but 7 News reported that the country's Olympic weightlifting coach Simon Kent said the 43-year-old Hubbard has met the current criteria.

""The rules are in place, that's the playing field we're playing in, so that's how we're going to move forward,"" Kent said, according to the outlet, which cited TVNZ.

What's the background?

Hubbard — who lived as a male for 35 years — transitioned to female in 2012 and began winning competitions several years later.

Hubbard made a splash in 2017 after winning two silver medals in a women's world championship — and then in 2019 took home two gold medals and a silver medal in the women's competition at the Pacific Games in Samoa.

In 2015, IOC guidelines ruled that transgender athletes can compete as women if their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before their first competition, Reuters reported.

But numerous scientists have criticized these guidelines, saying they do little to mitigate the biological advantages of those who have gone through puberty as males, including bone and muscle density, 7 News reported.

Here's Hubbard in action in early 2020:

Anything else?

Australia's weightlifting federation tried blocking Hubbard from the 2018 Commonwealth Games, 7 News added, but organizers rejected the move. The outlet added that rival weightlifters and coaches at the Commonwealth Games also complained.

Hubbard suffered a ruptured elbow ligament while attempting a 291-pound lift at the 2018 event while Lambrechs finished fifth.

Feminist author suggests stay-at-home moms are unambitious and set a bad example for kids,"Feminist author Jill Filipovic suggested on Twitter this week that stay-at-home moms set a bad example for their children because their decision ""not to work"" sends the message that they are not ambitious.

After sparking fury with her comments, she followed up with an apology for her ""tone.""

What are the details?

The Daily Wire reported that ""Filipovic was reacting to a post from Slate concerning a man who was upset that his wife wanted to be a stay-at-home mother,"" and that ""Slate's advice was to be more understanding with his wife.""

""This is good advice, but man I feel for this letter-writer, because it's exactly how I would feel if my spouse decided they wanted to be a stay-at-home parent,"" Filipovic wrote in the launch of her lengthy thread. ""Also... is it really ONLY her decision whether to quit working when she's then going to be entirely dependent on him?""

""I realize this is like the third rail of the Mommy Wars, but yeah, lots of super-ambitious people marry other super-ambitious people because they're attracted to ambition,"" she continued. ""I would have a really, really hard time being married to a spouse who chose not to work.""

Filipovic did not stop there, adding, ""And now I am really going to get myself yelled at, but I also think the issue of example-setting for a kid is a totally fair one. What example are you setting when dad works for pay and mom does the care work at home? Lots of reasons not to want to set that example for a child.""

That comment was met with fierce backlash. A wave of stay-at-home mothers pushed back against Filipovic's assertions, along with people who expressed how grateful they were to be raised by stay-at-home moms. Husbands had choice words for the feminist, too.

Attorney Matthew Kolken told Filipovic, ""My late wife was a stay at home mom. She lived for and ultimately died loving our children. It was her full time job. I can write so much more on this subject, but suffice it to say that belittling her decision to prioritize our children over 'work' f***ing pisses me off.""



One person called Filipov's comments ""unnecessarily condescending and dismissive,"" and another argued, ""I mean, if she genuinely wants to stay at home and raise her kid, I guess she's setting the example that feminism should be about choice and that caregiving takes intelligence, hard work, and yes, ambition?""

On Thursday, Filipov tweeted, ""Just want to take a sec to very sincerely apologize for the tone of this thread, which came across as far more flippant and judgmental than I intended. I maintain that it's good and important to defend all the good that comes from mothers working. But my phrasing was beyond bad.""

She explained herself further before adding, ""I could have approached this with more nuance and generosity, and for failing to do that, I am sorry.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feminist-author-suggests-stay-at-home-moms-are-unambitious-and-set-a-bad-example-for-kids,2021-03-12
Left-wing feminist website applauds bullies who followed female senator into bathroom to harass her,"By now, nearly everybody who has been paying at least a modicum of attention to the news is aware of what happened to Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema over the weekend on the campus at Arizona State University.

For those who may have missed it, the social justice group Living United for Change in Arizona uploaded a video of activists harassing the lawmaker at an ASU classroom where she is a lecturer. After accosting Sinema in the classroom, where tuition-paying students were attending class, the activists — including apparently one man — followed Sinema down the hall and into the bathroom — and continued to harass her while she was in a stall doing her business.

In the video, other women were seen trying to use the restroom as the left-wing bullies kept up their antics.

The activists were demanding that Sinema, who has stood opposed to President Joe Biden's and congressional Democrats' massive $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, support her party's legislation to give amnesty to illegal aliens. However, they were seemingly unaware that the Senate parliamentarian already ruled twice that the immigration legislation could not be added to the reconciliation bill.

Americans on the right and the left condemned the tactics of the activists who bullied the senator in the bathroom and quite possibly violated the personal privacy legal protections afforded the senator and the other women in the restroom.

But the left-wing feminist website, Jezebel, was not one of those who criticized the social justice warriors' boorish behavior. Instead, the far-left group ran a piece applauding the bullies who went after the female lawmaker.

Rather than defend Sinema and call out the harassers, Ashley Reese, who wrote the piece, ""Absolutely Bully Kyrsten Sinema Outside Of Her Bathroom Stall,"" attacked those on the right and the left who actually did stand up for decency and sided with the bullies who were ""piping mad"" because they ""don't understand what the f*** she's doing any better than the rest of us."" From Jezebel:

Fox News, predictably, published a headline asserting that Sinema was being “stalked."" Right-wing goons Jack Posobiec responded to LUCHA's video by tagging the FBI. NBC's Senior Capitol Hill Correspondent Garret Haake tweeted, “If you think this will be effective in moving Sinema, ask yourself when the last time was that you took unsolicited advice from a stranger in a bathroom."" It's clear he's never been in a woman's club bathroom. And even The Nation's justice correspondent, Elie Mystal, insisted, “There is absolutely no upside to protesting people while they're in the bathroom.""



Then there's Sinema's take: In a statement, she described the incident as “not a legitimate protest.""



“It is unacceptable for activist organizations to instruct their members to jeopardize themselves by engaging in unlawful activities such as gaining entry to closed university buildings...and filming students in a restroom,"" Sinema said.



Given these reactions, one would think that an angry activist kicked open the bathroom door while Sinema was taking a massive dump. Instead, they just sort of stood around in a public space, politely but firmly demanding that Sinema to do the job they elected her to do.

The author continued to justify attacks on Sinema for her opposition to the reconciliation bill by noting the activists were right to fight for the amnesty plan. But the writer never acknowledged that the parliamentarian had already ruled, more than once, that the amnesty plan was out-of-bounds for the yet-to-be-written reconciliation package.

But no matter. Social justice warriors are not to be questioned.

Plus, what else were they supposed to do? Reese wondered.

""And for all the pearl-clutching, few are providing a more effective and safe alternative to what these activists did,"" Reese wrote. ""They told Sinema, to her face — and through a door — that she was failing them and why.""

It was perfectly fine to reportedly violate Arizona law about filming people in the bathroom, you see, because ""[t]here was no violence, no rude language, nothing. Just a few constituents following their representative into a large bathroom to air their grievances.""

""What should they have done instead?"" Reese wondered.

Suddenly, for the likes of Jezebel, bathroom attacks are totally fair game.

""But maybe it's easier to act like a public bathroom is a sacred place than criticize the fact that Sinema decided to hide from her voters like a coward,"" Reese concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feminist-website-jezebel-bullies-sinema,2021-10-05
Fictional movie murderer Michael Myers accused of being homophobic in new 'Halloween' movie,"Michael Myers, the central fictional figure of the ""Halloween"" movie franchise, is homophobic, according to certain corners of social media.

What are the details?

Myers, or ""The Shape,"" has been accused of homophobia after killing a same-sex couple in the newest ""Halloween"" installment, 2021's ""Halloween Kills.""

TMZ on Wednesday reported, ""This is actually a thing ... the latest iteration of the masked madman is being accused by some Twitter truthers of being homophobic for offing a same-sex couple in the new 'Halloween Kills' movie ... which just came out about a week or so ago.""

In the film, Myers executes a gay couple inside their home — which used to belong to Myers' family — and eventually lays their bodies next to one another on the ground. One of the men is sitting upright against a bookshelf while another lies on his back, one knee raised, with his hands folded over his stomach and his head on his dead partner's knee.

As TMZ pointed out, ""Dude literally kills everyone in his path — black people, gay people, young and old ... and any gender.""

What has been the response?

One clearly ruffled social user tweeted, ""Michael Myers is homophobic[.]""

TMZ reported that another user wrote, ""HALLOWEEN KILLS WAS SO GOOD BUT WHY DID MICHAEL HAVE TO KILL THE ONE GAY COUPLE... MICHAEL MYERS IS HOMOPHOBIC CONFIRMED.""

WeGotThisCovered reported that another user quipped, ""[A]ll i got from the new halloween movie is that michael myers is homophobic[.]""

Another added, ""Can't believe Michael Myers is homophobic #cancelled.""

""Watched Halloween Kills last night and y'all horror gays lied to me I didn't know Michael Myers was homophobic,"" another user noted, according to the outlet.

""Michael Myers is a racist homophobic murderer. No respect for him now,"" another user complained.

Another user marveled, ""[T]he juxtaposition of michael myers killing a gay couple and chucky [the evil doll] talking about his genderfluid child in the same week is just insane[.]""

The TMZ report added, ""While many appreciated the representation, others appear to have been offended by these two guys being among the body count. There've also been a few articles and op-eds written on the matter — and despite most who acknowledge it as silly ... some are pointing out 'The Shape' may, in fact, not be as progressive as some of his counterparts.""



What else?

It seems fair to point out that social media wasn't paying much attention to what was happening in the film before circulating reports that the Myers character is gay — considering the fact that if you look closely at the photo behind the slain gay couple, it is a decidedly benign mirror image to the grisly scene taking place on the floor immediately below it.

Anything else to know?

""Halloween"" star Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in both the 1978 original film and some of its successive films, recently spoke out about the gory horror flick and said that portions of the film mirror Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.

She explained that the new film is ""about rage, about a mob of angry people who don't trust the government, who don't trust the police, who don't trust the authorities to get the job done.""

""They're going to do the job themselves,"" she added.

"(Updated) Film crew union accused  of 'mob type tactics' after strike disrupts production of Steve Deace book adaptation, 'Nefarious'","A film crew in Oklahoma City on the set of a movie adaptation of BlazeTV host Steve Deace's book, "" A Nefarious Plot,"" has gone on strike, demanding that the production company recognize union representation for its crew members. The moviemakers have accused the involved out-of-state union of making false claims about their conduct, and of using ""mob type tactics"" against non-union workers.

About 40 workers walked off the set and stopped production on ""Nefarious"" Monday, forming a picket line to get the California-based production company, Nefarious Film LLC, to recognize the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as a collective bargaining agent for the crew. The workers are also demanding health and retirement benefits in their contracts. The strike has continued into Thursday.

Additionally, IATSE on Monday filed an unfair labor practice claim with the National Labor Relations Board against the production company, alleging that multiple employees were fired for supporting unionization and that others were ""interrogated,"" ""surveilled,"" or otherwise coerced once word of unionization spread.

Union representatives said on social media that the workers want a ""fair contract"" that provides ""industry-standard working conditions and benefits.""

""Right now, they just want to be recognized as union members,"" said IATSE Central Region Business representative Winona Wacker, in an interview with KWTV-DT.

""We are super invested in making this movie. A lot of these people are super invested in making this movie but there's been ... no progress,"" said Wacker.

In an interview, ""Nefarious"" co-screenwriter and co-director Chuck Konzelman categorically denied the accusations made in the labor complaint.

""No one has been fired. No one has been interrogated,"" said Konzelman, who is best known for co-writing the faith-based mega-hit ""God's Not Dead.""

When asked about the allegations of other ""coercive actions,"" he told TheBlaze that the union would likely consider flying in replacements to take over for the striking workers as coercive, but objected to that characterization.

Federal law guarantees that employees have ""the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,"" as well as the right ""to refrain from any or all such activities.""

The National Labor Relations Board website lists various examples of what may constitute an illegal attempt to ""to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights"" to unionize. Those actions include threatening employees with adverse consequences for forming a union; promising benefits if they reject unionization; coercively questioning employees about their own or coworker's union activities or sympathies; spying on employee's union activities; and more.



Konzelman said the film's production has been troubled from the start. ""Nefarious"" is a low-budget project, with just under $2 million approved for the film. It's also a short-term production — filming is supposed to take roughly two and a half weeks.

When the crew arrived in Oklahoma last July to begin shooting, an outbreak of COVID-19 swept through core personnel management and production was forced to shut down for several months. The production company had already paid for a set to be built, and rather than have it torn down, Konzelman said the company continued to rent the soundstage for five months ""at great expense,"" even though nothing was filmed.



The crew returned to start up preproduction again in late October, with the first three days of shooting happening just last week. Then on Friday, Konzelman's unit production manager informed him there were ""rumblings"" of a strike being called.

""We were surprised because our crew seemed very happy,"" Konzelman said.



The first official threat of a strike was made on Sunday, Dec. 6, in an email from an IATSE attorney to Nefarious Film LLC's attorney announcing the demand for union contracts.

The email, which was shared with TheBlaze, states that IATSE will not provide the production company with signed authorization for representation cards, which would indicate the number of workers who legally asked IATSE to represent them. The union also said they would not agree to hold a vote before calling a strike, ""due to the brevity of this production.""

""If your client chooses not to voluntarily recognize the I.A.T.S.E. as the collective bargaining agent, we are within our legal right to strike for recognition. I would say your clients know the strength of the crew’s support for organizing given their unlawful questioning of them yesterday but a strike for recognition would also legally demonstrate our majority status,"" the lawyer wrote.

When asked what IATSE's lawyer was referring to by ""unlawful questioning,"" Konzelman said one of Nefarious Film LLC's production staff informally polled department heads on Friday, asking if they were aware of a possible strike and whether their departments as a whole were inclined to walk out.

""Since the questions were asked outside, in the open air, one or more union people heard the question and were offended, saying words to the effect of 'you can't do that'. To which the production person responded that they weren't part of the conversation, and the question hadn't been asked of them,"" Konzelman told TheBlaze.

Federal law prohibits employers from polling employees to determine the extent of their support for a union unless they comply with certain safeguards.



On Monday, when the production team arrived for work, they were greeted by a picket line.

""The strike was called without a strike vote and there was no negotiation, really. They just said send us your budget and we'll tell you what you owe us, which we weren't prepared to do,"" Konzelman said.

IATSE representatives say this dispute is about negotiating for a fair union contract with standard fringe benefits, similar to dozens of union contracts for ultra-low budget films each year. Konzelman disputes this claim, noting that this is a ""lousy two million dollar film"" and that the production company was upfront that they would not provide health and retirement benefits for a film with such an ""abbreviated schedule.""

""We made the rates as high as we could on an individual basis early, which by the way, was still not very impressive because we were a very low-budget film. But everybody shook hands and said, 'yeah, we'll do it for that.' And then three days into shooting, suddenly, they couldn't do it for that anymore and we had to become a union shoot,"" said Konzelman.

Konzelman suggested there were political motivations behind the strike and IATSE's involvement.

""This is partly about suppression of conservative and faith-based media,"" said Konzelman, noting that the last film he made in Oklahoma, ""Unplanned,"" received ""such resistance nationally"" that he was invited by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to testify in the Senate on big tech censorship of conservatives.

He also said that the state of Oklahoma and its Right to Work law were targets for the union. He explained that Nefarious Film LLC is one of several film production companies pre-qualified for incentives under the state's Filmed in Oklahoma Act of 2021 — an incentive program that provides a rebate of up to 20% for qualified film and television productions if they are made in Oklahoma. The state wants to attract major motion picture companies to make movies there, and the Right to Work law means that film producers do not have to hire union workers to get their films made.

As a condition of qualifying for this incentive program, a film production company must meet certain criteria as laid out by law. If at any time a project fails to meet the criteria for a certain rebate that it was initially pre-qualified to receive, the state may reduce the size of the incentive offered or cancel it. One of those criteria is the number of ""apprentices"" claimed — an apprentice is an Oklahoma resident that is supervised by an experienced ""Master Tradesperson"" and is working on the project.

Konzelman says that IATSE is ""terrorizing down into the college level"" by threatening the apprentices hired to work on the film that ""if you cross that picket line, you're dead to the unions forever."" He said the point of keeping the apprentices from working was to make Nefarious Film LLC lose the incentives it was pre-qualified for. He characterized the union's alleged actions as ""mob type tactics"" and said the production company has approached the Oklahoma State Attorney General's office for relief.

Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor's office said it was contacted by one of the film's producers about potential concerns by employees.

""We offered and stand ready to investigate any complaints filed with our office by their employees who feel their rights as employees under state law are violated,"" Press Secretary Madelyn Sheriff said.

""We have not received any complaints from employees at this time,"" Sheriff added. ""Oklahoma is a right to work state and this office will vigorously investigate and enforce those laws for employees who file complaints.""

Steve Deace, the author of the book ""Nefarious"" is based on and one of the producers of the film, said in a statement that: ""Out of state unions are attempting to violate Oklahoma’s right to work law, as well as hijack the state’s film incentive program.""

""I think they chose our movie to make an example out of because they thought we would be easy prey since we’re an independent film,"" said Deace. ""They thought wrong.”

A spokesman for IATSE denied that the workers had political motivations behind demanding a union contract.



""It is profoundly disappointing to see this employer and state politicians turn this into a nonsensical political conspiracy theory when it’s not,"" said IATSE Director of Communications Jonas Loeb. ""Our people have been hired to build stages for Trump rallies, set up Republican National Conventions, and they do so flawlessly when asked. The content itself is irrelevant. Workers who asked for our help in forming a union even protested Michelle Obama’s book tour in 2019 in a remarkably similar situation.

""At the end of the day, the workers want to finish this movie, they just want a union contract while doing it,"" he said.

While the strike is ongoing, and Oklahoma's government has yet to act, Konzelman said ""Nefarious"" will resume shooting at the end of this week with replacement workers. He emphasized that none of the striking workers have been fired, and that the union's claims of wrongful terminations are ""deliberately false and malicious.""

""Since we have returned here in October there have been no terminations of any kind. No terminations of any kind for any reason,"" said Konzelman. ""Even the strikers, if they walked on set today, would still have a job.""

He offered an apology to the employees whose jobs have been disrupted by the strike.

""I just want to apologize to all the innocent people who've gotten caught up in this mess, which is not of our making and not of their making either. There are a lot of people who would like to work on this production. We want to be able to be working on the production and this union action is preventing us from doing so.""

""Nefarious"" is written and directed by Konzelman and Cary Solomon. It stars Sean Patrick Flanery as a convicted serial killer slated for execution who claims to be a demon. On the day he is to be put to death, he undergoes a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he's mentally fit to receive his sentence.

Solomon and Konzelman are producing ""Nefarious"" with Chris Jones and Sheila Hart.

FINA bans transgender swimmers like Lia Thomas from competing against women in elite events: 'Biological sex is a key determinant of athletic performance',"FINA – the international governing body for swimming competitions – approved new policies for transgender swimmers on Sunday. The new restrictions bar transgender athletes from competing against women in elite events, except under one condition.

FINA voted to prohibit transgender athletes from competing in elite women's swimming competitions. The new rule goes into effect on Monday. However, FINA will allow transgender swimmers to compete if they have completed their transition by the age of 12.

""This is not saying that people are encouraged to transition by the age of 12. It's what the scientists are saying, that if you transition after the start of puberty, you have an advantage, which is unfair,"" James Pearce – the spokesperson for FINA president Husain Al-Musallam – told the Associated Press. ""They're not saying everyone should transition by age 11; that's ridiculous. You can't transition by that age in most countries, and hopefully you wouldn't be encouraged to. Basically, what they're saying is that it is not feasible for people who have transitioned to compete without having an advantage.""

FINA also proposed a new ""open competition policy"" that would allow transgender athletes to compete in another category. The organization stated that ""a new working group that will spend the next six months looking at the most effective ways to set up this new category.""

""We have to protect the rights of our athletes to compete, but we also have to protect competitive fairness at our events, especially the women’s category at FINA competitions,"" Al-Musallam said in a statement.



""FINA will always welcome every athlete. The creation of an open category will mean that everybody has the opportunity to compete at an elite level,"" Al-Musallam continued. ""This has not been done before, so FINA will need to lead the way. I want all athletes to feel included in being able to develop ideas during this process.""

Brent Nowicki – the governing body's executive director – said, ""FINA's approach in drafting this policy was comprehensive, science-based and inclusive, and, importantly, FINA's approach emphasized competitive fairness.""

FINA released a 24-page explanation of its policy change. To arrive at its decision, FINA consulted three groups of experts in the fields of athletics, law, human rights, and science.

The science group advised:

Biological sex is a key determinant of athletic performance, with males outperforming females in sports (including Aquatics sports) that are primarily determined by neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and respiratory function, and anthropometrics including body and limb size. The extent of the male/female performance gap varies by sport and competition, but the gap universally emerges starting from the onset of puberty. The group reported that there are sex-linked biological differences in Aquatics, especially among elite athletes, that are largely the result of the substantially higher levels of testosterone to which males are exposed from puberty onwards.

The science group noted that testosterone, body structure, and muscle function provide transgender athletes with benefits that a ""biological female athlete cannot overcome that advantage through training or nutrition.""

The new regulations would bar transgender swimmer Lia Thomas from competing against women in elite events.

Earlier this year, Thomas became the first openly transgender woman to win an NCAA Division I women's swimming title as a University of Pennsylvania student.

Thomas told Sports Illustrated in March that swimming at the 2024 Olympic trials is a goal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fina-bans-transgender-athletes,2022-06-19
Florida physician announces plans to stop seeing unvaccinated individuals in person,"Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a Florida physician is planning to stop seeing unvaccinated people in-person, according to WTVJ.

The outlet reported that Dr. Linda Marraccini, whose practice is located in South Miami, sent out a letter notifying patients about the move. Part of the letter declares:

In our practice we find almost no one that cannot take one of the vaccines for medical reasons.



Therefore, it is our decision to no longer continue services for those patients who will not have a vaccine by September 15. We will no longer subject our patients and staff to unnecessary risk.



This is a public health emergency -- the health of the public takes priority over the rights of any given individual in this situation. It appears that there is a lack of selflessness and concern for the burden on the health and well-being of our society from our encounters. If any of our patients have a valid medical reason for not having the vaccine or have their first shot by September 15, please let us know.



Patients no longer in our practice will be given one month to find another health care provider. During that timeframe we will provide encounters by televist only.

Marraccini maintains that her letter does not breach the Hippocratic oath as she is providing the option for telemedicine or referral to other physicians, according to WTVJ. The outlet also reported that the physician said she will allow exceptions for individuals unable to get vaccinated due to health reasons.



""It's not fair for people who are unvaccinated to harm other people,"" Marraccini said, according to Newsweek.



While Sunshine State will soon begin slapping businesses, schools, and government agencies with $5,000 fines if they mandate that people furnish proof of COVID-19 vaccination, DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw told The Washington Post that a subsection of the statute makes those in health care, such as Marraccini, exempt from facing such a fine.

""Although it is a type of discrimination we don't endorse or agree with, she is not breaking that law,"" Pushaw said, according to the Post.



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 62.3% of the U.S. population ages 12 and older has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, while 73.1% has received at least one dose.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-physician-will-stop-seeing-unvaccinated-people-in-her-office,2021-09-08
Florida Republicans urge FCC to reject Democrats' attempts to silence Hispanic conservatives,"Florida's two United States senators and the U.S. House congressman representing much of Miami-Dade County are urging the Federal Communications Commission to resist pressure from Democrats to block the sale of a local Spanish-language radio station to a conservative ownership group.

Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) along with Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Fla.) on Wednesday published a letter to FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging the FCC to reject ""politicization"" of the agency by Democrats.

""We write to express our profound concern that highly partisan political operatives, many with no ties to South Florida, are attempting to pressure the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reject the pending application of WSUA Broadcasting Corporation to assign the license of WSUA (AM) (known as Radio Caracol 1260) and FM translator W232DX (which rebroadcasts WSUA) to ATV Holdings, Inc,"" the lawmakers wrote.

""The opponents of the proposed sale have expressed concerns about the potential content of WSUA's programming, claiming it would be overly conservative.""

Last month, the Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus demanded that the FCC ""scrutinize"" the sale of popular Miami radio station Caracol 1260 AM to America-CV Network LLC, a broadcasting company that owns the Spanish-language TV station América TeVé in Hialeah, Florida.



Democrats cried foul after America-CV fired the station's most popular on-air personality, former Hialeah Democratic Mayor Raul Martinez, who hosted a four-hour daily talk show. They are upset that conservative voices will have an opportunity to spread so-called ""Spanish-language misinformation"" on the airwaves in Miami County, which former President Donald Trump won in 2020 with support from Hispanic voters.

At the time, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr blasted Democrats for attempting to punish conservative points of view by interfering in the sale.

""This attempt by Democrats in Congress to pressure the FCC into blocking the sale of a Spanish-language radio station based on the political viewpoints that it would broadcast to South Florida's Hispanic community crosses a line drawn by the First Amendment,"" Carr said. ""The FCC has no business doing the Democrats' bidding or using our regulatory process to censor political opinions that Democrats do not like. What's worse, the Democrats appear to be treating the FCC as merely an arm of the DNC—expressly pressuring the agency to take action that they believe will increase their electoral odds in Florida in 2022.""

Rubio, Scott, and Díaz-Balart cited Carr in their letter, joining him in criticizing the Democrats' demands.

""We are concerned by these attempts to impose on the FCC's independence and politicize its decisions by encouraging content-based censorship,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Preventing the assignment of the radio station licenses based on its anticipated programming would set a dangerous precedent, and likely would violate the First Amendment's protections of free expression and a free, independent media. Instead, as you consider the application, we respectfully request that you reject any politicization of the FCC, and engage the application on its merits alone.""



The Republicans went on to mock Democrats for complaining about one right-leaning radio station given ""the overwhelming predominance of left-leaning bias in print, cable, and broadcast media.""

""It is similarly telling that simply because the purchaser is expected to have an anti-Castro, anti-Communist, anti-Socialist viewpoint, it has been deemed 'too conservative,'"" the lawmakers wrote.

""Constituents of our state and districts do not appreciate the brazen attempt by partisans, many from outside the state, to impose their media choices on South Floridians,"" the lawmakers said in the letter. ""Comments indicating that our constituents will be duped by 'disinformation' is insulting and tinged with racism. South Florida has a wide array of media sources, and our constituents are exceedingly capable of determining which of them are worthy of their trust and time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-republicans-urge-fcc-to-reject-democrats-attempts-to-silence-hispanic-conservatives,2021-05-05
Florida warns illegal immigrants not to come to the state,"The state of Florida is warning illegal immigrants not to migrate to the Sunshine State.

The ongoing influx of migrants along America's southern border is expected to worsen next month after the termination of a Title 42 order goes into effect.

Texas is shipping some migrants out of the Lone Star State to Washington D.C.

""I hereby direct the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) to begin coordinating the voluntary transportation, to Washington, D.C. and other locations outside the State of Texas, of migrants released from federal custody,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, instructed last week.

Fox News reported that migrants who arrived in Washington D.C. from Texas told the outlet that they plan to go to Miami, Florida.

The executive office of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis provided Fox News with a statement advising people who have entered the U.S. illegally not to head to the Sunshine State.

""To those who have entered the country illegally, fair warning: do not come to Florida. Life will not be easy for you, because we are obligated to uphold the immigration laws of this country, even if our federal government and other states won’t,"" the office told Fox News in the statement. ""Florida is not a sanctuary state, and our social programs are designed to serve the citizens of our state. The governor will protect the sovereignty of the state of Florida.""

""If you have come here illegally, you have been done a great disservice by the Biden Administration. They have encouraged you to make dangerous treks, oftentimes at great physical distress to you and your family. Sometimes, this has even meant putting your fate into the hands of dangerous coyotes and human traffickers,"" the statement said. ""There is a legal process to obtain full American citizenship, which is an essential part of the promise of America. In Florida, we will uphold the law.""

Even some Democrats have expressed opposition to the Biden administration's plan to nix the Title 42 order.

""Title 42 has been an essential tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19 and controlling the influx of migrants at our southern border,"" Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said in a statement earlier this month. ""We are already facing an unprecedented increase in migrants this year, and that will only get worse if the Administration ends the Title 42 policy. We are nowhere near prepared to deal with that influx. Until we have comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform that commits to securing our borders and providing a pathway to citizenship for qualified immigrants, Title 42 must stay in place.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-warns-illegal-immigrants-not-to-come-to-the-state,2022-04-14
Disney star gives bizarre take on Florida's parental rights bill: 'Should be a Don't Say Straight bill',"Disney star Raven-Symone says that Florida should enact a bill similar to House Bill 1557 — the Parental Rights in Education bill — and call it the ""Don't Say Straight"" bill.



The newly signed law prohibits school staff from discussing sexuality with children third-grade age and under and restricts related topics with older children to age-appropriate instruction. The law also encourages school staff to tell students' parents about their sexual orientation or identity, specifically if there is any detectable change in the student's ""mental, emotional, or physical health or wellbeing."" The law has been falsely called the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by Democrats and many in the media, but it does not mention the word ""gay"" or prevent anyone from saying it.

What are the details?

Symone — a child actress who also spent time acting on ""The Cosby Show"" — on Wednesday appeared on ""Today,"" where she issued the head-scratching remarks.

She said, ""I’m gonna say this, and this is my thing: If there’s a ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, there should be a ‘Don’t Say Straight’ bill, because it’s not fair.”

“There are multiple kinds of humans in this world, and you are ruining the psyche, the confidence of so many young children because you are discrediting their parents, the people they love, the people that raised them, the people that teach them the manners when they walk into that schoolroom,” she complained. “So if you’re not gonna honor their family, your family shouldn’t be honored either.”

She concluded, ""Let's just make it even-slash-equal, maybe.""

Symone — who stars in Disney's ""Raven's Home"" — recently took part in a walkout over the bill after Disney CEO Bob Chapek initially refused to speak out against the bill before it was passed into law.

On Monday, however, a statement from Disney principals stated that the company is committed to supporting a repeal of the new law.

“Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,” the statement noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-disney-star-gives-bizarre-take-on-florida-s-parental-rights-bill-should-be-a-don-t-say-straight-bill,2022-03-31
Former President Donald Trump announces first post-presidency rally: ‘First of many appearances’,"Former President Donald Trump has announced that his first post-White House rally will be held later this month in Wellington, Ohio.

The former president says that the appearance will be the ""first of many.""

What are the details?

Trump is set to appear for a rally at the Lorain County Fairgrounds on June 26 at 7 p.m. local time. Doors will open at 2 p.m., and while tickets are free, they are limited to two per request.

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether there will be any guest speakers at the event. Those interested in attending the event can register here for tickets.

A statement from Trump's Save America PAC noted that the rally would mark ""President Trump's first of many appearances in support of candidates and causes that further the MAGA agenda and accomplishments of President Trump's administration.""

What else do we know about this?

According to a report from the Cincinnati Enquirer, the former president is expected to stump for endorsed candidates including former White House aide Max Miller. Miller is challenging sitting Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, who voted to impeach Trump in the House. Following his vote, the Ohio Republican Party voted to censure Gonzalez, who is facing mounting calls for his resignation.

In February, Trump lauded Miller's performance as a White House aide and said that he would be a ""fantastic"" addition to Congress.

""Max Miller is a wonderful person who did a great job at the White House and will be a fantastic Congressman,"" said Trump at the time according to CNN. ""He is a Marine veteran, a son of Ohio, and a true PATRIOT.""

Trump won Ohio in the 2020 presidential election by 8 percentage points over then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden.

The June 26 rally will mark the first of its kind since Trump left office on Jan. 20.

Anything else of note?

USA Today reports that the former president is planning to host a rally in Tampa, Florida, on July 3.

The former president has hinted at another presidential campaign for the 2024 election cycle.

In late April, Trump confirmed that he was considering another run and said that if he did, he would consider Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as a potential running mate.

""He is a friend of mine. Certainly, Ron would be considered,"" Trump said at the time. ""I endorsed Ron, and after I endorsed him, he took off like a rocket ship. He's done a great job as governor. They like that. I'm just saying what I read and you read.

"Trump encourages conservatives, Republicans to boycott 'woke' companies that oppose Ga. voting law: 'We will not become a socialist nation!'","Former President Donald Trump is urging people to boycott ""woke"" companies amid changes that were made to early voting in Georgia.

New state law requires a voter provide a drivers' license or state identification number when voting via absentee ballots, expanded early voting for both primary and general elections, and put in place additional security measures for ballot drop boxes.

Democrats have claimed, without evidence, that the new law restricts voting rights.

What are the details?

On Saturday night, Trump encouraged people to boycott companies and organizations that are kowtowing to what he suggests are liberal agendas. His remarks also came after the MLB announced it was moving its 2021 all-star game out of Georgia in response to the new law.

""For years the Radical Left Democrats have played dirty by boycotting products when anything from that company is done or stated in any way that offends them,"" the former president said in a statement. ""Now they are going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred elections. It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back — we have more people than they do — by far!""

He continued, ""Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS, and Merck. Don't go back to their products until they relent. We can play the game better than them.""

He concluded, ""Never submit, never give up! The Radical Left will destroy our Country if we let them. We will not become a Socialist Nation. Happy Easter!""

On Saturday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) said that the state was a victim of ""cancel culture"" following the law and ensuing backlash from the MLB and other companies like Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola.

In a news conference, Kemp said, ""Yesterday, Major League Baseball caved to fear and lies from liberal activists. In the middle of a pandemic, Major League Baseball put the wishes of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden ahead of the economic well-being of hard-working Georgians who were counting on the All-Star game for a paycheck.""

Trump on Saturday also called for people to boycott the MLB, and in a statement said, ""Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans, and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the Radical Left Democrats who do not want voter I.D., which is desperately needed, to have anything to do with our elections. Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!""

Former sprinter demands female silver medalist prove she 'definitely is a woman',"A former sprinter is requesting that Tokyo Olympics silver medalist Christine Mboma prove that she is really a biological woman.

Marcin Urbaś, a former Polish track star who now coaches the sport in his home country, raised concerns regarding Mboma's biological sex last week, calling on the athlete to undergo a sex-affirming test to prove her womanhood.

Mboma, an 18-year-old athlete from Namibia, won silver in the women's 200-meter sprint last week, running the race in 21.81 seconds — the fourth-fastest pace ever recorded. She was bested only by Jamaica's Elaine Thompson-Herah, who set a new world record of 21.53 seconds during the race.

She also — along with 18-year-old Namibian teammate Beatrice Masilingiis — reportedly has hyperandrogenism, a condition that produces abnormal amounts of testosterone in the body.

Because of their condition, both Mboma and Masilingiis were barred from competing in races with distances between 400 meters and a mile, in accordance with Olympic rules. The two, however, were allowed to compete in the 200-meter race at the Tokyo Games.

But their participation has been a source of controversy, especially as questions surrounding gender identity and biological sex have become a flashpoint in the sporting world as of late.

""I would like to request a thorough test on Mboma to find out if she definitely is a woman,"" Urbaś told Spanish news outlet Marca following the race.

""The testosterone advantage of Mboma over other participants is seen with the naked eye,"" he argued. ""In construction, movement, technique, at the same time as speed and endurance.""

To bolster his claims, Urbaś compared Mboma's times to his own. The Polish athlete competed on the world stage in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when he set the Polish record for the 200-meter sprint, running the race in 19.98 seconds.

He said that in only a few years' time, Mboma will improve significantly and her advantage will become obvious.

""She has the parameters of an 18-year-old boy. At that age, my [personal best] was 22.01, and she has done it in [21.81] in Tokyo. With progression and improvement in her technique, she will soon drop to 21.00 seconds in 200-meter and 47.00 seconds in the 400-meter,"" he claimed.

""We will continue to think that she is fair and equal, and it is a clear and insolent injustice against women who are definitely women,"" Urbaś stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-sprinter-demands-mboma-prove-womanhood,2021-08-09
Fox News panel explodes when guest defends Hillary Clinton mishandling classified info: 'She cooperated like a normal human being',"A Fox News segment exploded Thursday when network contributor Jessica Tarlov defended Hillary Clinton and suggested that former President Donald Trump's alleged mishandling of classified information is worse than Clinton's.

Trump is alleged to have stored classified documents at Mar-a-Lago — even nuclear documents — though authorities have not alleged that Trump has committed any wrongdoing.

On the other hand, Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state involved sending, receiving, and storing classified information in and through improper channels. Clinton was never prosecuted for her mishandling of classified information.

What happened?

During a discussion between Tarlov and Sean Duffy on Fox News, Tarlov, a Democratic strategist, said the knee-jerk response from Republicans to defend Trump after the FBI raid demonstrates why they are ""unfit"" to lead America and control the government.

After Duffy responded that Trump is not being treated ""fair,"" Tarlov zeroed in on Duffy's acknowledgment that the government is ""now going after [Trump for] classified documents.""

""Yes, sir, it is about classified information,"" Tarlov shot back. ""It is breaking the law — it matters.""

When Duffy then turned the conversation to Clinton and her mishandling of classified information, the conservation went completely off the rails.

""Jessica, hold on a second. He has documents, papers in boxes. The Chinese and the Russians can’t access those boxes of information. But Hillary Clinton’s server is public to the world,"" Duffy said.

""Guess what: She was punished!"" Tarlov interjected. ""She lost the election!""

""No, she wasn’t punished,"" Duffy fired back. ""Did they raid her home? Did they come with machine guns to her home?""

""They didn’t need to because she cooperated like a normal human being,"" Tarlov responded.

""No, she did not cooperate,"" Duffy corrected.

Anything else?

To a point that Tarlov made, Trump signed a law as president to toughen the penalty against former government officials who retain or remove classified information.

The crime is now a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

However, apart from conjecture from government sources, law enforcement officials have not confirmed that Trump retained classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-panel-trump-classified-documents,2022-08-12
"FTC files lawsuit against data broker for allegedly selling sensitive location-tracking information, including church and health clinic visits","On Monday, the United States Fair Trade Commission announced a lawsuit against mobile data broker Kochava Inc. for allegedly selling location information that can be used to track an individual's visits to medical care facilities, mental health clinics, places of worship, homeless and domestic violence shelters, and addiction recovery centers.



The FTC reported that the broker sold geolocation data for millions of mobile devices. The lawsuit accuses Kochava of exposing people to threats of stigma, stalking, discrimination, job loss, and physical violence.

According to Kochava's marketplace, its services provide ""rich geo data spanning billions of devices globally."" The broker claims that the location information ""delivers raw latitude/longitude data with volumes around 94B+ geo transactions per month, 125 million monthly active users, and 35 million daily active users, on average observing more than 90 daily transactions per device.""

In the lawsuit, the FTC alleged that Kochava provided a free trial of its location data services with minimal safeguards. To access the data of 61,803,400 mobile devices, an individual interested in using the broker's geolocation services would only need to make a free trial account. As a result, the FTC accused Kochava of failing to provide ""any meaningful controls over who accesses its location data feed.""

The case alleged that Kochava's precise geolocation data could provide enough details to identify people and expose sensitive information, ""including places of religious worship, places that may be used to infer an LGBTQ+ identification, domestic abuse shelters, medical facilities, and welfare and homeless shelters.""

The FTC accused the data broker of providing detailed sensitive information that could ""injure consumers through exposure to stigma, discrimination, physical violence, emotional distress, and other harms.""

Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, stated, ""Where consumers seek out health care, receive counseling, or celebrate their faith is private information that shouldn't be sold to the highest bidder.""

Levine said that by taking Kochava to court, the FTC hopes to stop the company from selling sensitive data. The lawsuit also seeks to require Kochava to delete existing sensitive geolocation information.

Reuters reported that the FTC is considering creating rules that would restrict businesses from collecting sensitive location data information without consumer consent.

In July, Google announced that it would begin purging user geolocation information for visits to ""counseling centers, domestic violence shelters, abortion clinics, fertility centers, addiction treatment facilities, weight loss clinics, cosmetic surgery clinics, and other"" locations that it considered personal.

Kochava could not be reached for comment, Reuters reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ftc-sues-kochava-location-data,2022-08-29
Attorney General Garland appoints special counsel to investigate Biden's potential mishandling of top-secret documents,"The White House was not raided over President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents, which have turned up in at least two unauthorized stashes in recent days. Nevertheless, Biden may soon have to answer to the special counsel appointed Thursday by Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Garland has tasked former Department of Justice official Robert K. Hur with investigating Biden for potential impropriety over his admitted transport and possession of classified documents.

One batch of classified documents that Biden reportedly retained from his tenure as vice president was discovered at the president's private office in a China-linked think tank in Washington, D.C.. Another batch was discovered at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.

CNN noted that some of the documents were marked top secret.

Biden told reporters that he stored some of the classified documents in his garage beside his Corvette.

Hur, a Republican, served as the 48th U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland from 2018 to 2021. He was nominated for the role by former President Donald Trump.

Hur previously served as principal associate deputy attorney general with the U.S. Department of Justice, working with FBI Director Christopher Wray.

""In 2003, [Hur] joined the department's criminal division, where he worked on counterterrorism, corporate fraud and appellate matters. From 2007 until 2014, Mr. Hur served as an assistant US attorney for the district of Maryland, where he prosecuted matters ranging from violent crime to financial fraud,"" said Garland.

Axios indicated that Hur's appointment, which Garland said was in the ""public interest,"" is intended to ""avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.""

Garland may also want to avoid the appearance of inconsistency, granted that in November, he appointed Jack Smith special counsel for the criminal probe into whether former President Donald Trump, who had the power to declassify documents, mishandled sensitive documents.

In his announcement, Garland provided an outline for the investigation into Biden's potential malfeasance regarding the classified documents so far:



Nov. 4 — The National Archives Office of Inspector General contacted a DOJ prosecutor, informing him that the White House had notified the Archives that classified documents were found in Biden's Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement office. The office was not authorized to store classified documents.

Garland announced the special counsel on Jan. 12, just hours after news began circulating that another set of classified documents had been found.

""This appointment underscores for the public the department’s commitment to independence and accountability, and particularly sensitive matters and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law,"" said Garland.

Gavin Newsom fighting to save California's ultra-rich from tax hike intended to subsidize transition to EVs,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) claimed earlier this year that the ""future is electric."" In 2020, he signed an executive order to phase out the sale of all new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Now, he's aligned himself with California Republicans to fight a new tax hike. However, unlike the various other tax increases opposed by the state's Republicans that adversely impact the middle class, the tax hike Newsom has elected to fight would be one specifically imposed on the ultra-rich.

The tax hike

Proposition 30 calls for a 1.75% tax hike on those earning over $2 million annually. It has been touted as a means to help subsidize the statewide adoption of so-called ""zero-emission"" vehicles and the development of EV charging infrastructure.

According to the California Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), the tax hike would go into effect January 2023 and last until California ""is able to drop its statewide greenhouse gas emissions below certain levels,"" or, failing that, until January 2043.



About 45% of the revenue from the new tax would go toward payments to help buy new electric vehicles (e.g., cars, vans, and pick-up trucks). In addition to helping households and businesses ""pay for part of the cost of new passenger ZEVs,"" money confiscated from high-income taxpayers would also be allotted to the government's acquisition of large EVs such as trucks and buses.



Another 35% would subsidize the installation and operation of EV charging stations, which will be located in both private and public locations, and 20% would go toward wildfire response and prevention. Priority would be given to expenditures on hiring, training, and retaining state firefighters.

The money will not be disbursed on a consistent basis. Instead, ""at least half of the money must be spent on projects that benefit people who live in or near heavily polluted and/or low-income communities."" The affluent areas home to some of those who will be taxed under the initiative will have to compete with rural areas for the remainder of the funds.

The LAO claimed that the tax would raise between $3.5 billion and $5 billion annually, ""growing over time.""

The LAO noted that, in light of recent efforts to increase the number of EVs sold and on the roads, ""the additional funding from the proposition to help buy new ZEVs would not have much effect on the total number of ZEVs driven in California."" It would, however, ""shift who pays for the ZEVs. That is, more costs would be covered by revenue from the new tax on high-income taxpayers instead of by vehicle sellers and/or buyers.""

The tax's supporters include the CA Association of Electrical Workers, Cal Fire Local 2881, the California Democratic Party, the American Lung Association, Lyft, and a host of municipal authorities across the state.

Neel Sannappa, a Democratic political analyst, claimed the tax would ""help middle-class families transition to zero-emission vehicles,"" as well as strengthen the electric grid, which is already under immense strain.

The multimillionaire's Robin Hood

In a television ad attacking the proposition, Newsom suggested that the proposed tax hike was ""devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company. Put simply, Prop. 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.""



The corporation Newsom referenced in the attack ad was Lyft. Newsom and other critics have suggested that Lyft, which has allegedly donated over $35 million in cash and in-kind contributions to support the measure, would directly benefit from it.

The Guardian reported that the perceived benefit to Lyft is that its drivers, who are responsible for their own vehicles, would be better able — as a result of the multimillionaire-sourced subsidy — to acquire an EV by the state's 2030 regulatory deadline.

Denny Zane, founder of Move LA, a public transit lobby group, said the accusations were ""just false,"" noting that Lyft had offered its support only after environmental groups and policymakers had drafted the idea.

Bill Magavern, one of the authors of the bill and the policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air, told KUSI that the ""initiative was devised by an environmental-labor-business alliance, and it provides absolutely no special benefits to any company or any special interest.""

Magavern characterized Newsom's opposition as giving in to the wishes of the wealthy: ""You've got billionaires and their allies who don't want to pay their fair share of taxes.""

The attack ad featuring Newsom was paid for in part by a California-based billionaire, Michael Moritz, a repeat Lincoln Project donor who has reportedly spent $1 million to fight Proposition 30.

Bob Emery, a wealthy San Francisco real estate investor, donated nearly $500,000 to the opposition campaign. Former Apple board member and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Arthur Rock donated $499,000. Gap Inc. director William Fisher donated $980,000 to the ""No on 30"" campaign in September.

In addition to the support from the ultra-rich, ""No on 30"" also garnered support from the California Teachers Association, which was antipathetic because 40% of the state's budget, as mandated in 1998, must go to public education, but as this would be a special fund, revenue might be withheld from education coffers.

Republican political analyst Cathy Abernathy told Fox40 that part of the reason Newsom and the California Teachers Union don't like the proposition is because it ""is a special fund, permanently separate and apart from the General Fund or any other state fund or account. And in Section (c), moneys deposited into the fund and any interest earned shall not be permanently or temporarily borrowed, loaned or otherwise transferred to the General Fund or other fund in the state treasury.""



In other words, the Newsom administration wouldn't be able to use it as a slush fund.

Proposition 30 will be on the ballot in California in the upcoming November election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gavin-newsom-fighting-to-save-californias-ultra-rich-from-tax-hike-intended-to-subsidize-transition-to-evs,2022-10-17
Gavin Newsom helped spare California's ultra-rich from tax that would have raised money for low-income residents' adoption of EVs — money the teachers' unions couldn't touch,"Around 43,000 of California's ultra-rich won't have to pay a nominal tax hike to help facilitate the state's radical adoption of electric vehicles, thanks in large part to an energetic opposition campaign mounted by Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom. Some critics reckon that Newsom's efforts to quash this measure reveal he is eco-friendly in rhetoric, but billionaire-friendly in action.



Prop flop

Proposition 30 was on the ballot this week. It called for a 1.75% tax hike on those earning over $2 million annually and was touted as a means to help subsidize the statewide adoption of so-called ""zero-emission"" vehicles and the development of EV charging infrastructure.

Approximately 45% of the revenue from the defeated tax would have gone toward payments to help buy new electric vehicles (e.g., cars, vans, and pickup trucks); 35% would have gone to subsidize the installation and operation of EV charging stations in both private and public locations; and 20% would have gone toward wildfire response and prevention. Priority would be given to expenditures on hiring, training, and retaining state firefighters.

According to Democratic political analyst Neel Sannappa, the tax would have ""help[ed] middle-class families transition to zero-emission vehicles,"" as well as strengthened the electric grid, which is already under immense strain.

The California Legislative Analyst's Office claimed that the tax would raise between $3.5 billion and $5 billion annually, ""growing over time.""

Although an annual drop in the bucket when considering that California's transition to a 100% renewable-powered electric system may end up costing anywhere from $4.5 trillion to $5.7 trillion by 2030, the additional revenue certainly wouldn't hurt.

Ultimately, 59% of California voters rejected the proposition.

Alpine, Humbolt, Mendocino, Monterey, and San Francisco Counties voted in support, and the remainder of the state voted against the measure.

Having successfully protected nearly two points on each California multimillionaire's income, the No on 30 campaign said in a statement, ""California voters decisively rejected this poorly crafted and unnecessary tax hike. ... The fact is Proposition 30 was a solution to an issue the state is already addressing.""

Eco-friendly rhetoric aside

Mary Creasman, CEO of California Environmental Voters and a supporter of the proposition, told CalMatters that Newsom, the face of the No on 30 campaign, was largely responsible for the measure's demise.

The proposition ""had a record number of billionaires against it, it had complete falsehoods thrown at it, and it had the most popular Democratic leader in the state against it,"" said Creasman.

Matt Rodriguez, campaign manager for No on 30, said, ""You can't remove the governor from it ... [Newsom is] a credible messenger on the opposition side, simply because I think of a lot of people and a lot of Democrats take their cues from him.""

Newsom campaigned against the proposition, appearing in a television advertisement where he claimed it was ""a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.""

Newsom and other critics suggested that Lyft, which had allegedly donated over $35 million in cash and in-kind contributions to support the measure, would directly benefit from it.



Bill Magavern, one of the authors of the bill and the policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air, criticized Newsom for his characterization of the measure, suggesting that what was really at issue was ""billionaires and their allies who don't want to pay their fair share of taxes.""

The opposition campaign for which Newsom was the very recognizable face had some deep-pocketed backers.

Bob Emery, a wealthy San Francisco real estate investor, donated nearly $500,000 to the opposition campaign. Former Apple board member and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Arthur Rock donated $499,000. Gap Inc. director William Fisher donated $980,000 to the No on 30 campaign in September.

The attack ad wherein Newsom suggested Lyft would be the primary beneficiary was paid for in part by a California-based billionaire, Michael Moritz, a repeat Lincoln Project donor who had reportedly also spent $1 million to fight Proposition 30.

Creasman suggested that the failure of the proposition puts more pressure on the governor to find revenue streams to pay for his radical phase-out of gas-powered cars by 2035 and transition to so-called ""zero-emission"" programs.

""Where's the money going to come from?"" asked Creasman. ""If the governor has some exciting, innovative new stuff that he can pull out of his pocket and say, 'Here's how we're going to pay for it,' we are all in.""

Teachers' unions wanted their cut

When Newsom opposed the proposition, he did so not just with billionaires averse to paying down their champion's promises, but with the state's two largest teachers' unions. Crossing the latter would have been politically inexpedient.



The California Teachers Association, which fought the Newsom recall in 2021, opposed the tax because it would have been a special fund (i.e., the ""Clean Cars and Clean Air Trust Fund""). Accordingly, money might have been withheld from education coffers in a state that otherwise sees 40% of its budget siphoned into public education, per a 1998 mandate.

In October, Republican political analyst Cathy Abernathy explained why Newsom and the California Teachers Union fought against the eco-tax: it ""is a special fund, permanently separate and apart from the General Fund or any other state fund or account. And in Section (c), moneys deposited into the fund and any interest earned shall not be permanently or temporarily borrowed, loaned or otherwise transferred to the General Fund or other fund in the state treasury.""

Just as the teachers' unions would not have been able to get their hands on the tax revenue, neither would Newsom's administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gavin-newsom-ultra-rich-tax-electric-vehicles,2022-11-11
Report: California Gov. Gavin Newsom's wife making millions charging public schools to screen her leftist propaganda,"California's public schools aren't just run by some of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's staunchest allies and beneficiaries, but also serve as theaters for his wife's leftist propaganda, allegedly paid for in part at taxpayer expense.

A new report from the Illinois-based transparency watchdog OpenTheBooks.com has revealed that Jennifer Siebel Newsom's nonprofit, the Representation Project, has garnered nearly $1.5 million screening four films she is credited for having either written or directed. American public schools are believed to have coughed up the majority of the funds to screen these films, two of which feature Mrs. Newsom and her husband.

Adam Andrzejewski, founder and CEO of OpenTheBooks.com, remarked on these and the related findings, ""The Representation Project not only solicits donors from big-money political supporters of Gavin Newsom, but also receives public tax dollars through schools to create a new generation of supporters and activists in the state’s—and country’s—schoolchildren.""

Newsom's agitprop outfit

The Representation Project is a nonprofit that claims to ""fight sexism through films, education, research, and activism."" It was founded by Mrs. Newsom in 2011 after the debut of her premier agitprop piece ""Miss Representation,"" which enjoyed moderate success.

In addition to attempting to use media to manufacture or augment public opinion, the group admits to utilizing ""the collective pressure of social activism"" to make content creators conform to their thinking on sex, race, and on other issues. Mrs. Newsom and her acolytes have previously sought to financially ruin those who haven't ideologically conformed, going after publications' advertisers when they wouldn't play ball.

""Miss Representation"" is one of the four propaganda pieces Newsom's nonprofit has licensed out to schools across California and throughout the United States.

The film presumes at the outset that ""boys learn that their success is tired to dominance, power, and aggression,"" whereas girls are led to believe that their ""value lies in their youth, beauty, and sexuality and not in their capacity as leaders.""

According to IMDB, ""The Great American Lie,"" also written and directed by Mrs. Newsom, ""examines how a US value system built on the extreme masculine ideals of money, power and control has glorified individualism, institutionalized inequality, and undermined the ability of most Americans to achieve the American Dream."" It appears to neglect recognition that the director's husband is a state governor in and amongst said value system.

Newsom's ""The Mask You Live In"" suggests that masculinity has been too narrowly defined in America and maintains that this has had a negative impact on the nation and its boys.

This film not only contains website addresses of porn sites with images tagged with descriptions like ""face f***"" and ""kinky couples,"" but also includes partially blurred images of sexual violence against women from pornographic videos, which Andrzejewski stressed were ""graphic even when blurred.""

The Representation Project framed the fourth film, ""Fair Play,"" as an attempt to press the issue of ""gender inequality at home.""

Newsom co-wrote this film with Eve Rodsky, who has intimated that a mother who says at home to raise her children is ""doing unpaid labor, staying quiet and small.""

According to a 2011-2021 impact report issued by Newsom's nonprofit, these four propaganda films — designed in part by those with an apparent disdain for stay-at-home mothers — have been played in over 5,000 schools before over 2.6 million children in the United States.

OpenTheBooks.com indicated that schools must pay between $49 and $599 to expose kids to these films, and have done so willingly.

Since 2012, the Representation Project has reportedly taken in $1,483,001 in screening revenue. It is unclear how much of this was generated in California alone.

Shaping prospective Newsom voters, activists

The films are not the only thing Newsom's nonprofit is trafficking in. Accompanying each piece of agitprop is curricula students must engage with.



For instance, after subjecting students to ""Miss Representation,"" Newsom's curricula has kids: ""understand how gender representations influence the ways that we see each other and ourselves""; ""critique media images as they begin to recognize the qualities that make for good leadership and uncover ways that they can act as allies for each other to support an end to stereotyping""; and ""create their own media images to respond to the dearth of positive representations of women and girls.""



After watching Newsom's ""The Great American Lie,"" students are reportedly prompted to do a so-called privilege walk, whereby classrooms temporarily segregate more and more on the basis of immutable characteristics, socioeconomic status, and deeply personal information.

According the Representation Project's impact report, its efforts have been consequential. Students who endure their curricula report a significant increase in knowledge of feminism, racial justice, and a desire to engage in activism.

After pushing similar messaging at its youth media summit, the Representation Project claimed that afterward, 33.3% of enrollees indicated they planned to organize ""a protest for social change"" and 60% planned to ""use social media for social change.""

The benefit may not only be monetary but electoral.

Gov. Newsom appears in two of his wife's films, the purpose of which Andrzejewski suggested is clear: ""Jennifer Siebel Newsom makes a movie portraying Gavin Newsom as a politician that supports certain policies, and then in the movie’s curriculum advises students to vote and campaign for politicians that support those policies.""

The schools receive taxpayer money and effectively use those funds or the resources those funds secure (e.g., class time) to foist the Newsoms' messaging on American youths.

While Mrs. Newsom's Representation Project may be a nonprofit, she has a for-profit company that appears to have done well as a result of at least one of her films.

Newsom's Girls Club Entertainment has taken in over $1.6 million from her nonprofit since 2012.

Mrs. Newsom has also reportedly collected $1,501,727 in salary from her nonprofit since its founding.

What's a nonprofit amongst friends?

The Free Beacon reported that extra to promoting her husband's policies and building her brand with taxpayer-funded school resources, Newsom's nonprofit may have yet more uses, which may ultimately trip up Gov. Newsom should he run for president.

Between 2011 and 2018, the Representation Project took $358,000 from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company — the same utility linked by state investigations to fires that claimed at least 85 lives and destroyed hundreds of acres of land. The utility's philanthropic arm also cut a sizable check to Newsom's sister Hilary.

This utility was also reportedly listed as an associate producer on two of Mrs. Newsom's pieces of agitprop, going so far as to host the screening of ""Miss Representation"" in 2011.

When the state House came down on DNA-sampling firms, Newsom reportedly found his way to veto the legislation in 2020. It turns out, Anne Wojcicki, founder of one such firm called 23andMe, was another donor to Mrs. Newsom's Representation Project.

Jeff Hauser of the government watchdog Revolving Door Project told the Free Beacon, ""We're going to need a rethink of ethics laws that allow people to work without making political officeholders easy to bribe via their partners.""

"George W. Bush: Today's Republicans are 'isolationist, protectionist, and ... nativist'","Former President George W. Bush on Tuesday characterized the Republican Party of 2021 as a ""nativist"" party, saying that's not his ""vision"" for what Republicans should stand for.

""I would describe it as isolationist, protectionist, and to a certain extent nativist,"" Bush said during an interview with Hoda Kotb on NBC's ""Today"" in response to a question about today's GOP.

""That's not exactly my vision, but you know what, I'm just an old guy they put out to pasture,"" he added. ""Just a simple painter.""

The former president is currently on tour promoting his new book, ""Out of Many, One,"" a collection of paintings by him that feature immigrants to the United States with text sharing their stories. In a Washington Post op-ed published Friday, Bush wrote that the purpose of his book is ""to share some portraits of immigrants, each with a remarkable story I try to tell, and to humanize the debate on immigration and reform.""



""The system really needs to be reformed and fixed,"" Bush told Kotb after explaining how migrants are coming to the U.S. border in search of a better life away from natural disasters, poverty, violence, and criminal tyranny in Central America.

""Two things I think will help alleviate that: One is an asylum process that is more robust — in other words, the border is being overwhelmed right now and there needs to be more judges and more courts so people can have a fair hearing,"" he said. ""Secondly, we need to change the work visas. There's a lot of jobs that are empty and there's a lot of jobs that need to be filled and yet there are people willing to work hard to do so.""

Bush lamented that both Republicans and Democrats think they can score political points against the other side on the immigration issue, which prevents actual reforms from becoming law.

""It's an easy issue to frighten some of the electorate and I'm trying to have a different kind of voice,"" Bush said.

Asked by Kotb if a ""hypothetical"" candidate who is ""pro-immigration,"" supports amnesty with citizenship for illegal aliens, supports DACA, ""reasonable"" gun control, and increased funding for public schools could win the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, Bush said, ""Sure, yeah.""



""I think if the emphasis is integrity, and decency, and trying to work to get problems solved, I think that person has a shot,"" he said.

""By the way, 'pro-immigration' isn't the right way to put it,"" Bush added. ""I think border enforcement with a compassionate touch is how I would put it. 'Pro-immigration' basically means let's just open up the borders, and nobody's really for that. And you can't have a country that has open borders.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/george-w-bush-gop-isolationist-protectionist-nativist,2021-04-20
George W. Bush pushes 'gradual' pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants,"Former President George W. Bush is advocating for a ""gradual"" path to citizenship for immigrants living in the United States illegally.

What are the details?

Ahead of his forthcoming book — ""Out of Many, One: Portraits of America's Immigrants"" — Bush published an op-ed in the Washington Post that explained the principles of reform he believes are necessary to restore ""people's confidence in an immigration system that serves both our values and our interests.""

That reform process, Bush said, should include a solution ""for the millions of undocumented men and women currently living in the United States.""



Outright amnesty ""would be fundamentally unfair to those who came legally or are still waiting their turn to become citizens,"" according to Bush. However, the former president said the U.S. should employ a ""gradual process"" that results in legal status and citizenship.

Bush explained:

[U]ndocumented immigrants should be brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which legal residency and citizenship must be earned, as for anyone else applying for the privilege. Requirements should include proof of work history, payment of a fine and back taxes, English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and civics, and a clean background check We should never forget that the desire to live in the United States — a worldwide and as powerful an aspiration as ever — is an affirmation of our country and what we stand for. Over the years, our instincts have always tended toward fairness and generosity. The reward has been generations of grateful, hard-working, self-reliant, patriotic Americans who came here by choice.

Meanwhile, Bush said that immigration reform must address the so-called ""dreamers,"" or immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as minors.

""Americans who favor a path to citizenship for those brought here as children, known as 'dreamers,' are not advocating open borders,"" Bush wrote. ""They just recognize that young men and women who grew up in the United States, and who never knew any other place as home, are fundamentally American. And they ought not be punished for choices made by their parents.""

Regarding asylum-seekers, Bush said, ""We also need a modernized asylum system that provides humanitarian support and appropriate legal channels for refugees to pursue their cases in a timely manner. The rules for asylum should be reformed by Congress to guard against unmerited entry and reserve that vital status for its intended recipients.""

Bush also reiterated the necessity of secure borders.

""We need a secure and efficient border, and we should apply all the necessary resources — manpower, physical barriers, advanced technology, streamlined and efficient ports of entry, and a robust legal immigration system — to assure it,"" he wrote.

""I have long said that we can be both a lawful and a welcoming nation at the same time,"" Bush added.

Anything else?

Bush told CBS News in an interview that will air on Sunday that not passing comprehensive immigration reform is one of his biggest presidential regrets.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/george-w-bush-pushes-gradual-pathway-to-citizenship-for-illegal-immigrants,2021-04-17
Georgetown Law puts libertarian scholar Ilya Shapiro on administrative leave after cancel-culture mob attacks Supreme Court tweets,"A libertarian legal scholar who was set to join the faculty at Georgetown Law has been placed on administrative leave by the school because of a controversy surrounding several now-deleted tweets he posted about President Joe Biden's pledge to nominate a black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Ilya Shapiro, vice president and director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, was supposed to assume a new position at Georgetown as a lecturer and as the executive director of the law school's Center for the Constitution on Tuesday. But the dean of the law school said Monday that Shapiro was placed on administrative leave ""pending an investigation into whether he violated our policies and expectations on professional conduct, non-discrimination, and anti-harassment.""

""Over the past several days, I have heard the pain and outrage of so many at Georgetown Law, and particularly from our Black female students, staff, alumni, and faculty. Ilya Shapiro’s tweets are antithetical to the work that we do here every day to build inclusion, belonging, and respect for diversity,"" Dean William Treanor wrote to the Georgetown Law Community.

""Pending the outcome of the investigation, he will remain on leave and not be on campus. This investigation will follow the procedures established by Georgetown University,"" he said.

Shapiro's hire by Georgetown Law was announced two weeks ago in a press release that celebrated him as a ""highly influential brief writer, an expert on the history of Supreme Court nominations, and one of the premier public commentators on constitutional law."" Shapiro, a first-generation American son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, is a celebrated writer and friend of many influential people in the conservative legal movement.

Following news reports that Associate Justice Stephen Breyer will retire this year, Shapiro took to Twitter to comment on Biden's campaign promise to exclusively nominate a black woman to fill a Supreme Court vacancy if one became available during his term.

""Objectively best pick for Biden is Sri Srinivasan, who is solid prog & v smart,"" Shapiro tweeted, referring to the Chief United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

""Even has identity politics benefit of being first Asian (Indian) American. But alas doesn't fit into latest intersectionality hierarchy so we'll get lesser black woman. Thank heaven for small favors,"" he said.

""Because Biden said he's only consider black women for SCOTUS, his nominee will always have an asterisk attached. Fitting that the Court takes up affirmative action next term,"" he said in a follow-up tweet. Then he posted a poll asking whether Biden was racist, sexist, or both for promising to only nominate a black woman.

His tweets sparked intense backlash on social media, with many progressives accusing Shapiro of harboring racist views that should disqualify him from holding a position at Georgetown Law. The mob was led by Slate writer Mark Joseph Stern.

Responding to the controversy, Shapiro deleted his tweets and apologized for his ""poor choice of words, which undermined my message that nobody should be discriminated against for his or her skin color.""

After being placed on administrative leave by Georgetown, Shapiro issued another statement expressing hope that an investigation will find he did not violate the school's policies with his tweets.

""I'm optimistic that Georgetown's investigation will be fair, impartial, and professional, though there's really not much to investigate. And I'm confident that it will reach the only reasonable conclusion: my Tweet didn't violate any university rule or policy, and indeed is protected by Georgetown policies on free expression,"" Shapiro said.

""Accordingly, I expect to be vindicated and look forward to joining my new colleagues in short order,"" he said.

A Georgia auto shop that paid a former employee in tens of thousands of pennies gets sued by US Labor Department,"A Georgia auto repair shop owner who paid a former employee in pennies faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor for what the government says was an illegal act of spite.

Andreas Flaten of Fayetteville, Georgia, left his job at A OK Walker Autoworks in November 2020 but had a dispute with his former employer, owner Miles Walker, over his final paycheck. It wasn't until mid-March that Flaten received the $915 he was owed — in the form of more than 91,000 oil-covered pennies dropped off on his driveway.

Flaten told WAGA-TV last March that the pennies came with a note that said ""f*** you"" and contained his last pay stub.

According to the Labor Department, that act constituted illegal retaliation. Further, a complaint filed in federal court accuses Walker of ""repeatedly and willfully"" failing to give workers overtime pay when they worked more than 40 hours per week. The complaint was reported by Business Insider.



The complaint says that in January 2021, Flaten contacted the government and reported that his ex-boss had not paid him $915 he was owed. A representative from the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division then contacted Walker on Jan. 27, 2021, and asked about the missing paycheck. The government alleges that Flaten's former employers initially refused to pay him what he was owed — not a single penny.



But hours after the Labor Department got in touch with the auto shop, Walker, the owner, decided Flaten would be paid every red cent, literally.

""How can you make this guy realize what a disgusting example of a human being he is? ... You know what? I've got plenty of pennies; I'll use them,"" Walker stated, according to the lawsuit.

The complaint said that Walker left approximately 91,500 pennies on Flaten's driveway and that ""on top of the pile of pennies, Defendants left a copy of Mr. Flaten's last paycheck with an expletive written on the outside.""

Flaten claims that the pennies were covered in some sort of grease, telling media outlets that he had to spend hours cleaning the tens of thousands of coins before being able to spend them. The auto shop owners deny doing anything other than paying Flaten what he was owed in legal U.S. currency.

But the Labor Department says the employer's actions were illegal.

""An employee has a right to understand what their rights are and to ensure they are being paid properly. Any time they inquire the employer, whether it be verbally or in writing or even contacting our office, that employee has a right to not be retaliated against or discriminated against,"" Steven Salazar, the district director with the U.S. DOL Wage and Hour Division, said.



Salazar also told WAGA that Walker owes an estimated $37,000 in back wages and liquidated damages. He said Walker has failed to keep records required under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

""Record keeping, which means they're tracking the actual hours employees are working and making sure they're paying them in compliance with the minimum wage which is $7.25 an hour under federal law for all hours worked. Then overtime, premium pay for hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek. So without maintaining proper records, how is the employee expected to be paid properly?"" Salazar said.

The Labor Department's investigation into Walker's books appears to have been prompted by Flaten's initial complaint last January.

""I honestly didn't think anything would be done,"" Flaten told Business Insider in an interview. He said he had no expectations that the government would do anything and has been pleasantly surprised that laws designed to protect workers from abuse are being enforced. Flaten said other workers dealing with unfair bosses shouldn't hesitate to file complaints when appropriate.

""They definitely should not be scared to reach out,"" he said. ""Speak up. Don't be quiet about it. Because if you're quiet about it, it's just going to continue to happen to you and everybody else.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgia-auto-shop-paid-former-employee-91000-pennies-sued-by-labor-department,2022-01-07
Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler plans to object to Electoral College certification,"Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler announced Monday that she would be among several congressional Republicans objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's Electoral College victory when it is brought up in a joint session on Wednesday.

Loeffler issued a statement explaining her decision:

The American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed. That's why, on January 6th, I will vote to give President [Donald] Trump and the American people the fair hearing they deserve and support the objection to the Electoral College certification process. I have also already introduced legislation to establish a commission to investigate election irregularities and recommend election integrity measures, which I will be working to get passed in the Senate. We must restore trust, confidence, and integrity in our election system.""

The senator's office noted that she ""will object on her own,"" not as part of Senator [Ted] Cruz's Electoral Commission.""

Cruz, a Republican from Texas, announced over the weekend that he and 10 other GOP senators had joined forces and would object to the certification of the Electoral College votes, while calling for the appointment of a commission to conduct a ""10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states.""

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was the first senator last week to announce that he would object to the Electoral College certification.

The same day Loeffler announced her position, fellow Georgia GOP Sen. David Perdue also voiced his support for objecting to the Electoral College certification. But as The Hill noted, ""unlike Loeffler, [Perdue] will forfeit his seat until the Georgia races are certified, meaning he will not be in Congress on Wednesday.""

Sens. Loeffler and Perdue declared their positions the day before each of them face Senate runoff elections in Georgia against Democratic challengers, the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.

Anything else?

While there is a growing number of Republicans publicly expressing their plans to contest the Electoral College results, there is also a growing number of Republicans voicing their opposition to the efforts.

GOP Sens. Mitt Romney (Utah) and Pat Toomey (Pa.) on Sunday denounced the decision of Hawley, Cruz and other Republicans in seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Since then, several additional high-profile Republicans in the House and Senate have voiced their opposition to objecting to the Electoral College challenge in Congress, including Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgia-sen-kelly-loeffler-to-object-to-electoral-college-certification,2021-01-05
Georgia secretary of state announces results of election signature match audit,"Georgia's secretary of state announced the results of the signature match audit of ballots in Cobb County in order to quell fears of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had been excoriated by many in the media and on social media for dismissing claims of voter fraud. On Dec. 14, he announced a signature match audit in order to reestablish Georgians' faith in the state's balloting system.

Two weeks later, that audit in Cobb County was completed.

Raffensperger said only two mismatched signatures were found among the more than 15,000 signatures audited. He said the inaccuracy came from a wife who signed the ballots for herself and her husband.

""It really shows you and should give voters confidence that there's accuracy and integrity, and security, in the absentee ballot process so we're really grateful for GBI's support,"" Raffensperger said to WSB-TV.

The signature match audit was the first of its kind in Georgia.

The audit involved state election investigators examining thousands of ballot envelopes and matching the signatures with those in public state records.

While Raffensperger defended the state's ability to conduct the 2020 election in a fair and secure manner, he has advocated against Georgia's no excuse absentee voting and wants restrictions on who can vote by absentee ballot.

""It's a huge burden for the counties. In effect, what we are asking the counties to do is run three elections, one with absentee voting early voting and then Election Day,"" Raffensperger explained.

In November, he defended the signature match system during an interview on MSNBC.

""Many people don't realize that it requires you to do your signature twice, once for the application, we signature match then, and a second time when your ballot comes back in, then we'll signature match that,"" he explained.

President-elect Joe Biden won Georgia by roughly 12,000 votes.

President Donald Trump and his legal team continue to challenge the election results in court, with the latest one challenging the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision.

Babies in utero now qualify as dependents on tax returns in Georgia,"On August 1, the Georgia Department of Revenue (DOR) issued guidance pertaining to House Bill 481, the Living Infants and Fairness Equality (LIFE) Act. The objective of this document was to clarify Georgian tax law after the Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Sistersong v. Kemp.

After having delayed its deliberations on the state’s pro-life law in 2021 to await the Supreme Court’s conclusions, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on July 20 that — in the words of Chief Judge William Pryor — the Dobbs ruling “makes clear that no right to abortion exists under the Constitution, so Georgia may prohibit them.”

Consequently, Georgia's law now recognizes the unborn child as a ""natural person."" This, of course, has wide-ranging implications, one of them pertaining to taxation.

According to the Georgia DOR's guidance, the “Department will recognize any unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat ... as eligible for the Georgia individual tax dependent exemption.” Taxpayers can now claim an exemption in the amount of $3,000 per unborn child.

As reported in The Hill, a child qualifies for this tax exemption as soon as their heartbeat can be detected. An Oxford study published in the journal eLife suggests that this can be as early as 16 days after conception. Under Section 8 of House Bill 481 and in the DOR’s guidance document, it is suggested that a human fetal heartbeat “may occur as early as six weeks’ gestation.” Early detection often depends upon the ultrasound method and technology used.

The deduction will require claimants to provide the Department with “relevant medical records or other supporting documentation” upon request.

One liberal law professor from Georgetown suggested that this may benefit married parents but exclude absentee fathers, men uncertain about their genetic involvement in the pregnancy, and those relying upon surrogates.

Vanity Fair's Bess Levin called the announcement ""terrifying,"" though conceded the tax exemptions ""could be helpful to low-income people who want to be pregnant.""

Suggesting that a blastocyst would qualify despite not having a heartbeat, Kansas Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate cited Georgia's new tax exemption as cause to vote against Kansas' proposed Amendment 2, which would ban abortion in the state.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgians-can-claim-unborn-babies-as-dependents,2022-08-02
"Get ready for rise of 'neopronouns.' They can include 'fantasy characters' such as 'vamp/vampself,' 'prin/cess/princesself,' 'fae/faer/faeself.'","TheBlaze has reported frequently on the increasing use of alternate pronouns over recent years. Just in December, in fact, news hit that the admission application for a business school offered a whopping 27 alternate pronouns that prospective students could choose from — you know, inventions such as ""ey,"" ""xie,"" ""hir,"" ""vis,"" and ""eirs"" in case the apparently outdated ""she"" and ""he"" don't suffice.

Well, the New York Times calls such newly created terms ""neopronouns"" — and according to the paper, we ain't seen a thing yet.

Now what?

The Times on Thursday published a nearly 2,000-word article on the topic, revealing for starters that the phenomenon of using ""they"" and ""them"" to describe a single person is becoming normal.

But that's old hat. Turns out that neopronouns — created terms like ""ze"" and ""zir"" that gloss over gender — are expanding to include ""noun-self"" pronouns, which can refer to animals or ""fantasy characters,"" the paper said.

Therefore, the Times reported, one's pronouns can be ""bun/bunself"" and ""kitten/kittenself"" — or even ""vamp/vampself,"" ""prin/cess/princesself,"" ""fae/faer/faeself."" The paper also said ""common slang"" (""Innit/Innits/Innitself"") is fair game, too.

""Many neopronoun users are dead serious, and are also part of online communities that are quick to react swiftly to offenses,"" the paper explained. ""They are deeply versed in the style and mores of contemporary identity politics conversations.""

More from the Times:

A popular Twitch streamer who goes by AndiVMG recently apologized after jokingly tweeting that her pronouns were ""bad/af,"" which led many neopronoun users to accuse her of transphobic invalidation of their identities.



AndiVMG did not respond to a request for comment for this article but wrote on Twitter: ""It wasn't meant to mock people who use neopronouns. However I have since educated myself on the matter and spoken to people who use neopronouns and I see why what I said was hurtful.""

How are folks reacting?

There's plenty more conjugating of the issue within the lengthy Times' treatise, but what seems more entertaining is how observers are reacting to the story.

TheBlaze's Dave Rubin cut right to the chase:

Conservative scholar and author Christian Sommers wondered, ""Is this all real?""

Others expressed similar sentiments:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/get-ready-for-rise-of-neopronouns-they-can-include-fantasy-characters-such-as-vamp-vampself-prin-cess-princesself-fae-faer-faeself,2021-04-09
"Federal judge orders documents about Ghislaine Maxwell's financial affairs to be unsealed, including any ties to the Clintons","A federal judge in New York ruled Thursday to unseal court documents in relation to accused sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered a trove of secret files to be made public this month, some of which could reveal financial ties to the Clintons.

Judge Preska ruled to unseal the court documents that are from a defamation lawsuit brought against Maxwell by alleged Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre that was initiated in 2015. Giuffre brought the lawsuit after Maxwell accused her of lying about being exploited and abused by Maxwell and Epstein.

Giuffre alleges that Maxwell recruited her to train as a masseuse when she was 16 years old, and was later turned into Epstein's ""sex slave"" from about 1999 to 2002, which included having sex with acquaintances of the convicted pedophile. Giuffre's defamation case against the former British socialite was settled in May 2017.

""Having taken a particularized view of the documents, the court concludes that each document reasonably had a tendency to effect the court's ruling and is thus a judicial document,"" Preska said during a telephone conference Thursday.

Among the documents to be unsealed from the defamation case is information about Maxwell's finances. During the case, the Daily Mail reported, ""Giuffre's lawyers demanded a vast array of documents from Maxwell including 'funding received from the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation,' according to court filings.""

One section of the ruling reads:



From January 2012 to the present, produce all documents concerning any source of funding for the TarraMar Project (Maxwell's nonprofit) or any other not-for-profit entities with which you are associated, including but not limited to, funding received from the Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Foundation (a/k/a William J. Clinton Foundation, a/k/a/ the Bill, Hilary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation), and the Clinton Foundation Climate Change Initiative.

A 2013 press release from the Clinton Foundation declared: ""President Bill Clinton, Former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton announced new Commitments to Action that will address pressing global challenges."" The TerraMar Project was included in the commitments.

The Clinton Foundation said of Maxwell's organization, ""In 2013, the TerraMar Project committed to launch the Sustainable Oceans Alliance (SOA) to mobilize the international community and the public at large on the importance of the Oceans and the Seas and to ensure that the 193 UN Member States recognize and incorporate oceans in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be adopted in 2015.""

The New York Post reported in 2019 that Maxwell's TerraMar organization was being investigated by the FBI for possible links to Epstein:



The TerraMar Project was incorporated in London and Delaware in 2012, purportedly to raise awareness of environmental and other issues facing the oceans, and exclusively funded by hundreds of thousands in loans by heiress Ghislaine Maxwell, public filings show. Maxwell was listed as president of TerraMar, and her Upper East Side home was its official office. She pumped $283,429 into it between 2012 and 2017. In that time, the so-called charity gave out a total of $874 in grants.

Maxwell's legal team doesn't want the documents unsealed, arguing that the released files could impact their client's right to a fair trial in November because the media would sensationalize the details, which could taint the jury.



However, Judge Preska rebuffed the assertion.

""It is not the job of the Court to police press coverage,"" Preska responded. ""Tabloid fodder doesn't diminish the importance of materials that could reasonably affect the court's decision on a motion.""

The parties are required to submit unsealed documents to the court in two weeks, but there will be redactions to conceal the identities of all non-party Does. Judge Preska said the previously unreleased documents would be shared with the public in mid-July.

Preska is the same judge who ordered a previous tranche of ""extremely personal"" documents from Giuffre's civil suit against Maxwell could be released last July. The documents include a seven-hour, 418-page deposition that Maxwell provided in 2016.

The batch of previously unseen files, which included 47 documents and more than 600 pages from the now-settled defamation case, were unsealed on July 30, 2020. The documents contain allegations that former President Bill Clinton visited Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.

Giuffre told her lawyers that Clinton visited Epstein's island, Little Saint James, a private 70-acre Caribbean island off the coast of St. Thomas.

""You know, I remember asking Jeffrey what's Bill Clinton doing here [on Epstein's island] kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said well he owes me favors,"" Giuffre told lawyer Jack Scarola in 2015.

""He never told me what favors they were,"" Giuffre added. ""I never knew. I didn't know if he was serious. It was just a joke. ... He told me a long time ago that everyone owes him favors. They're all in each other's pockets.""



Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private Epstein's Boeing 727 jet, nicknamed the ""Lolita Express,"" at least 26 times, according to a 2016 Fox News report.

In April, the Sun published photos said to be dated September 1993, when then-President Bill Clinton welcomed Epstein and Maxwell as ""VIP guests"" to the White House. ""They toured Clinton's residence and the East Room during a reception after Epstein gave £7,280 to the refurbishment of the Oval Office,"" The Sun reported.

After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction earlier this week and released the comedian from prison, Maxwell's legal team is arguing that their client should also be released from prison. Maxwell's appellate lawyer, David Oscar Markus, wrote an op-ed in the New York Daily News on Wednesday arguing for Maxwell to be released from Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, where she has been in confinement since her arrest last July over charges of running a sex trafficking network.



""The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did the right thing when it threw out Bill Cosby's convictions because prosecutors cheated: They promised Cosby that they would not prosecute him if he would testify in the civil cases against him; based on that promise, Cosby testified and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,"" Markus wrote in the op-ed. ""Prosecutors then broke their promise and used Cosby's statements in those depositions to win a conviction against him. The state Supreme Court not only acquitted him but barred the prosecutors from retrying him.""

Maxwell's criminal sex-trafficking trial is slated for November. Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty. Epstein's alleged madam has appealed five times to be freed from jail on bail, but has been rejected every time, the latest rejection arrived in June.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-unsealed-documents-judge-clinton,2021-07-02
Attorneys worry Ghislaine Maxwell guilty verdict could be thrown out after jurors’ post-trial comments,"Attorneys for recently convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell have asked the court for a new trial following comments to the media from two members of the jury acknowledging they shared their own experiences of sexual abuse during deliberations.

Maxwell, a British socialite and longtime companion of deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was found guilty on Dec. 29 on five counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking of an individual under 18 years old.

But post-trial comments made by two jurors have raised eyebrows in legal circles and have given Maxwell, who faces up to 65 years in prison for her crimes, renewed hope.

What happened?

One of the jurors, referred to by only his first and middle name, Scotty David, recounted in media interviews this week that he was able to assuage some of the other jurors' concerns over the credibility of key witnesses by sharing his own experiences.

The man reportedly told his fellow jurors that he was able to recall the most important elements of what happened to him but not every single detail. That testimony, he said, swayed some of the other jurors.

“I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,” he told the Independent, adding, ""But I can’t remember all the details, there are some things that run together.”

""When I shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse,"" the 35-year-old Manhattan resident said in conversation with Reuters.

Another juror, who requested anonymity, told the New York Times of abuse experienced as a child and discussed that experience with fellow jurors during deliberations. That juror also suggested that those experiences appeared to shape the jury's discussions.

What else?

The separate admissions have raised concerns over the court's jury selection process and sparked calls for a retrial.

According to CNN, in a letter sent Wednesday, Maxwell's defense attorneys wrote that Scotty David's statements ""merit attention by the court"" and requested that a juror investigation be conducted ""exclusively under the supervision of the Court.""

“The Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary hearing,” Maxwell’s attorneys added in the letter, according to the Washington Post.

Court documents reportedly show that jury candidates were asked during the selection process if they or any family members had been victims of sexual abuse. But Scotty David told Reuters that he ""flew through"" the questionnaire and did not remember the question, though he said he would have answered honestly if he had been asked.

Legal analysts, however, say it's unlikely that he would have been selected if he had answered affirmatively to the question.

Matthew Barhoma, a criminal appeals lawyer in Los Angeles, told Insider that ""if the defense knew about it, they would've dismissed him.""

He added, ""Jurors will lie to get on a jury for two reasons: if the case is notorious, and if they have been victims of the same allegations and they want to convict.""

Barhoma told the Washington Post, “If I was her legal team, I would pounce. I would be all over this issue because it is a major loophole in her conviction.”

Anything else?

""This is the absolute last thing you want when you get a guilty verdict,"" former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani added in conversation with Insider. ""You don't want the jurors talking to the media. You don't want them saying something that will result in a mistrial.""

""It's an absolute disaster,"" he continued. ""This entire conviction may get tossed, and we may have to retry the case.""

Though not every expert believes the admission will automatically spell doom for the prosecution.

Bennett Gershman, a former prosecutor and Pace Law School professor, told the Post that “it probably won’t result in the verdict being vacated because the evidence is very, very strong and this information does not seem to me to be central to the ability of the jurors to make an informed and impartial fair verdict.""

It remains to be seen what lies ahead for Maxwell. U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan has reportedly asked Maxwell's defense team for a motion for a new trial by Jan. 19. The government’s response will then be due Feb. 2 and the defense's susbequent response one week later.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-verdict-questioned-after-juror-comments,2022-01-06
Gina Carano wonders why there's no backlash to Susan Sarandon's Holocaust post that is nearly identical to the one she shared that got her fired from Disney,"Avowed leftist Susan Sarandon posted a message on social media that compared the current political climate to Nazi Germany. Conservative-leaning Gina Carano shared an image similar to the one Sarandon posted. However, only Carano suffered so much backlash that she lost a major Hollywood.

In February 2021, Carano posted a message on her Instagram with a photo of people living in terror during the Lviv pogroms of 1941.

The post read: “Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors…even by children.”

“Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews,” the post said. “How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?”

The post warning about dehumanizing other human beings because of their political leanings drew outrage.

The next day, Lucasfilm issued a statement that said, “Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future. Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.”

The same day, the influential United Talent Agency (UTA) dropped Carano as a client.

At the time, Carano was a star on the massively popular Disney series ""The Mandalorian."" Being fired from the Disney+ ""Star Wars"" TV series was a major blow for the MMA fighter turned actress.

Carano believed the message ""would bring people together.""

""But now after hearing so much, I actually have grown through the experience of [realizing] it’s not fair to the Jewish community to just throw this out here so much,"" Carano said. ""When you say the word ‘Nazi’ and when you call someone a ‘Nazi,’ you need to have a little bit more respect on it. So, I understand that. But it was in no way my intention.""

This week, Susan Sarandon posted a similar post on social media that read:

It didn’t start with gas chambers. It started with one party controlling the media. One party controlling the message. One party deciding what is truth. One party censoring speech and silencing opposition. One party dividing citizens into ‘us’ and ‘them’ and calling on their supporters to harass ‘them.’ It started when good people turned a blind eye and let it happen.



Sarandon's tweet racked up nearly 200,000 likes.

Carano reacted to Sarandon's post with a snarky GIF questioning the apparent double standard.

Sarandon currently stars in the TV series ""Monarch"" that airs on Fox and Hulu – which Disney both owns. Since posting the Holocaust meme on Monday, Sarandon has yet to face any real backlash or cancel culture pressure.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gina-carano-susan-sarandon-holocaust,2022-10-30
Golden Globes ratings crash 64% despite folks being stuck at home,"The ratings are in for the 2021 Golden Globes, and it is not a pretty picture.

What are the details?

According to the Associated Press, Sunday night's awards ceremony on NBC drew in 6.9 million viewers — an eye-popping 64% less than 2020's Golden Globes, which pulled in 18.4 million people before the U.S. entered widespread lockdowns due to the coronavirus.

The revelation led Vanity Fair to ask, ""How will the Golden Globes recover from 2021?"" with Yohana Desta writing, ""the hybrid event turned out to be too tough a sell for viewers.""

This year's show was hosted by ""Saturday Night Live"" alums Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, and included several signature ""woke"" lectures from actors, which audiences have come to expect. However, many artists delivered their acceptance speeches virtually, as pandemic measures kept them from attending in person.

One grievance mentioned more than once from the stage — including by the hosts — was against the organization itself that runs the Golden Globes, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, after the Los Angeles Times revealed that the group does not have any black voting members.

Last year, the pre-lockdown event was brimming full with Hollywood and corporate elites in the audience, when British comedian Ricky Gervais famously delivered a scolding of his own to the liberal crowd, telling them:

""So, if you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So, if you win, come up, accept your little award. Thank your agent and your god, and f*** off!""

Anything else?

Axios reported Tuesday that former President Donald Trump's speech Sunday night at the Conservative Political Action Conference came close to matching the Golden Globes in viewers, with Trump pulling in 6.7 million people.

The AP reported that Fox News' coverage of the former president's speech, the first he has made since leaving office, was ""by far the most-watched cable program last week.""

In his speech, Trump lambasted Republican lawmakers who voted for conviction during his second impeachment trial, telling the crowd in Florida, ""Instead of attacking me and more importantly the voters of our movement, top establishment Republicans in Washington should be spending their energy in opposing [Joe] Biden, [Nancy] Pelosi, [Chuck] Schumer, and the Democrats.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/golden-globes-ratings-crash-64-despite-folks-being-stuck-at-home,2021-03-03
"Google PhD fellowship discriminates against white and Asian students, but many elite universities still comply","Since at least 2009, Google has offered generous fellowships to up and coming computer science scholars seeking financial support during their final years of study. A new report from the Washington Free Beacon now reveals that Google has long included a racist criterium to prevent colleges and universities from nominating too many qualified white and Asian students for the fellowship.

Google claims that it offers the fellowship ""to recognize outstanding graduate students doing exceptional and innovative research in areas relevant to computer science and related fields."" And though it likewise purports that fellowships are available to ""promising PhD candidates of all backgrounds,"" the nomination process Google has established directly limits the number of male, white, and Asian students who can be considered.

Under the fellowship FAQ section, Google states that applicants — except those from Africa, India, or southeast Asia — must be nominated by their school. It also states that American and Canadian universities may nominate up to four students total, only two of whom may be able-bodied white or Asian males.

""If a university chooses to nominate more than two students,"" Google states, ""then in order to increase opportunities for students who are underrepresented in the field of computing the third and fourth nominees must self-identify as a woman, Black / African descent, Hispanic / Latino / Latinx, Indigenous, and/or a person with a disability.""

It is unclear whether Google means to imply that applicants may ""self-identify"" as black, Hispanic, indigenous, or disabled.

As the Washington Free Beacon notes, many of the schools which have submitted nominees for the fellowship also have anti-discrimination policies which would prohibit them from selecting nominees based on race and gender. These include elite Ivy League schools like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, as well as notable state schools like the University of North Carolina, the University of Michigan, and the University of California, Berkeley. MIT, NYU, Duke, Johns Hopkins, and others have also submitted nominations.

And by complying with the race and gender parameters for the fellowship, these same schools may also be violating federal law.

""The Google Fellowship program is a blatantly unlawful and immoral quota plan that pits students against one another by skin color and ethnic heritage,"" said Edward Blum, the founder of Students for Fair Admissions. ""Our nation’s enduring civil rights laws were passed to specifically forbid this type of racial discrimination.""

Despite the accusations of racial and gender discrimination, Google stands by its policy.

""Like many companies, we actively encourage a broad range of individuals to apply to our PhD Fellowship program in order to attract the widest and most representative pool of applicants possible—this follows all relevant laws and is extremely common to do,"" a Google spokesperson said.

Google further stated that the selection process to determine the final awardees ""is not based on demographics in any way.""

It is unclear how many white and Asian males have ever received a Google fellowship.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/google-phd-fellowship-discriminates-against-white-and-asian-students-but-many-elite-universities-still-comply,2022-08-23
GOP congressman asks if VP Kamala Harris is joking with her border crisis plan,"A Republican congressman from Louisiana questioned if Vice President Kamala Harris was joking by revealing a plan to solve the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border through engagement with Central American countries instead of border security.

Harris' plan, revealed Thursday, laid out a five-point general strategy to address the ""root causes"" of illegal immigration. The plan does not have a timeline and does not include specific policies. Instead, it calls for using ""diplomacy, foreign assistance, public diplomacy, and sanctions"" to ""establish a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system.""

Reacting on Fox News on Friday, Rep. Mike Johnson (R-L.A.) criticized Harris for trying to meet these lofty goals without securing the U.S. border.

""We're scratching our heads here on Capitol Hill,"" Johnson said. ""It's hard to believe that she wants to focus on things that she said on her list, you know, economic issues and 'advance the rule of law' she says; she wants to combat violent crime in Central American countries? I mean, is this some sort of a joke?""

""Of course, those are noble goals, but this administration has created those very crises here in the United States,"" he added.

Since assuming office, President Joe Biden has prioritized undoing as many of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies as possible. Biden has canceled border wall construction, ended Trump's remain-in-Mexico policy for asylum-seekers, and reinstated the catch-and-release policies of the Obama administration.

The Biden administration has sought to portray the illegal immigration crisis as a humanitarian and global issue, rather than one of crime at the border. Harris' strategy document emphasizes the ""push"" factors of migration, including natural disasters in Central America, poverty, hunger, and gang violence, each of which contributes to people leaving their homes in search of a better life in America.

""In Central America, the root causes of migration run deep — and migration from the region has a direct impact on the United States,"" the vice president said. ""For that reason, our nation must consistently engage with the region to address the hardships that cause people to leave Central America and come to our border.""

Republicans tend to talk about the ""pull"" factors — U.S. policies that incentivize illegal immigration by offering amnesty, protection from deportation, job opportunities, entitlement benefits, and other U.S. government programs Democrats want to make accessible to illegal immigrants.

""It seems very much to us like this administration cares more about people who are not Americans than those who are,"" Johnson said, echoing comments from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on the Biden administration's focus.

The combination of push and pull factors has led to record surges of illegal immigration since Biden took office. This last fiscal year, more than 1 million illegal aliens have been apprehended by border agents. The sheer number of migrants arriving creates problems for immigration enforcement agencies, which have to find somewhere for all of these people to stay, and the problem is complicated by COVID-19 spreading, gang activity and violent crimes, children who appear without parents or guardians, and American communities that feel overrun.

Tens of thousands of these migrants have been released after apprehension without being given a date to appear in court to have their asylum claims processed. Many of these people disappear into the U.S. without reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or showing up for those court dates as they were told. Some are just trying to make a better life for themselves. Others go on to commit crimes in the U.S. that would have been prevented if the border were secured.

""We have an unprecedented, unmitigated disaster at the border,"" Johnson said. ""It's beyond a crisis now. It's a humanitarian, health, national security issue that we are going to be hard-pressed to get our arms around if the administration does not step up immediately and help us fix this problem.""

The Republican lawmaker squarely blamed Biden for contributing to the border crisis by reversing many of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies.

""Yes, there are problems in Central America, all around the world,"" he said. ""And we're the most benevolent nation in the world, by far it's not even close. But we'll never be able to do that unless we can maintain first our own security and sovereignty and that's what securing the border is about.

""This administration is ignoring it and focusing on problems elsewhere in the world, it makes no sense.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-congressman-kamala-harris-joking-border-crisis-plan,2021-07-30
'Asking them to pay a fair share': GOP lawmakers reportedly toying with new tax on Big Tech,"Republicans have long claimed to hate raising or creating new taxes.

Lately, the party has also highlighted its apparent hatred — or at least extreme dislike — for Big Tech, believing (with reason) that tech companies are showing an anti-Republican bias by censoring, silencing, and banning stories that could hurt the left's chosen narratives.

Now the party has apparently found itself in a bit of a quandary: Whether or not to push a new tax on Big Tech.

What's happening?

Axios reported Monday that ""key Republicans"" are ""warming"" to the idea of leveling new taxes on major U.S. companies to subsidize a program to provide ""broadband in rural areas, schools, libraries and hospitals.""

According to the outlet, the idea came from Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who has suggested instituting a new tax on Big Tech companies to fund a pool of funds for internet access.

Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) appears to be open to the idea, Axios said.

""Any conversation about building out broadband for unserved Americans should include a Big Tech user fee that corresponds to their use of that infrastructure,"" a McCarthy spokesperson told the outlet. ""Funding for the Universal Service Fund — which is increasingly at odds with the principle of user pays — needs to be updated and reimagined.""

The FCC's Universal Service Fund is currently covered largely by fees American users pay on their phone bills.

Senate Commerce Committee ranking member Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) wants to explore the issue, his staff told Axios. And Washington GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said ""all options should be on the table,"" the outlet said.

The GOP lawmakers' willingness to consider the new tax lines up with Republicans' reported backing for Big Tech antitrust bills.

Axios said Carr wants big companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook that benefit from internet networks to pay into the Universal Service Fund.

The FCC commissioner claims the new tax idea is ""simply asking them to pay a fair share and start contributing on an equitable basis for these networks that they benefit from so tremendously.""

For example, Carr said, Apple would pay for the App Store, Amazon for cloud and streaming services, and Facebook and Google for online advertising.

What is Big Tech's reaction?

Naturally, Big Tech isn't a fan of the idea.

The Internet Association trade group, which includes the aforementioned companies, believes the tax idea is nothing more than an attempt to punish Big Tech members.

Internet Association President K. Dane Snowden told Axios, ""We hope the FCC will take a common sense approach and not punish innovative, high-quality streaming services that are fulfilling consumer demand.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-lawmakers-new-tax-big-tech,2021-06-28
"Lawyer for Reagan, Bush argues that Barack Obama should be attorney general in Biden administration","Should President-elect Joe Biden appoint former President Barack Obama to be his attorney general? That's what a former attorney for two former Republican presidents is advocating.

Douglas Kmiec, professor emeritus of constitutional law at Pepperdine University School of Law who served in the Office of Legal Counsel for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W Bush, claimed in an essay for The Hill that appointing Obama as head of the Justice Department would ""re-establish the rule of law.""

According to Kmiec, Biden, as president, ""will need to be highly capable at reassuring estranged voters — Democrat, Republican or independent — that he is governing in the national interest"" — and appointing Obama as attorney general accomplishes such a monumental task.

Kmiec explained:

Biden's almost-plagiarized overuse of the red state/blue state metaphor from the 2008 election needs a definite boost of authenticity and actual demonstration of applied fairness. Instead of continuing to borrow Barack Obama's trade line, he needs Obama himself. The fastest way to re-establish the rule of law is for Biden to nominate Obama as attorney general. If Biden simultaneously kept Christopher Wray as head of the FBI and made Justice's current inspector general, Michael Horowitz, head of its Office of Legal Counsel, he would remove much division, doubt and uncertainty.

Still, Kmiec, who served as ambassador to Malta in the Obama administration, admitted such an appointment would be ""unprecedented"" — but called it ""necessary.""

Surprisingly, Kmiec suggested that Obama serving as attorney general would serve as the perfect springboard for Obama to later serve on the Supreme Court.

""We have never had a former president take on the leadership of an executive department for a successor president, but nothing precludes it, save, possibly, Michelle Obama. We must leave those domestic relations to the former president — but [Obama] has the intelligence, youth and character to do the job,"" Kmiec wrote.

""Besides, it's perfect preparation for subsequent additional public service on the Supreme Court,"" he added.

Who is Biden considering for AG?

According to CNN, the top contenders for the job are outgoing-Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is reportedly also under consideration for the job, although he has indicated that he is not interested in working for the Biden administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-lawyer-argues-barack-obama-should-be-biden-attorney-general,2021-01-03
"GOP senator introduces 'FAUCI Act' to ban US funding for gain-of-function research in China, hold NIH officials accountable for misleading Congress","Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst introduced a bill this week to force more accountability for the National Institutes of Health and its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — both on gain-of-function research in Chinese labs and honesty from its employees.

The lawmaker's legislation, called the Fairness and Accountability in Underwriting Chinese Institutions Act, or the FAUCI Act, would put a complete ban on U.S. funding for any gain-of-function research, as a statement from Ernst's office said. The bill would also require what Ernst's office called ""a full accounting of U.S. involvement in 'gain-of-function' research, particularly in China.""

And, perhaps most notably to presidential adviser and NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and retiring NIH Director Francis Collins, the bill would make sure that any NIH employee or grantee who ""intentionally misleads Congress, or the Inspector General, will be ineligible for current or future federal grants and employment.""

Fauci and Collins both recently came under fire following newly surfaced evidence that EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit that does research on infectious diseases, and its partners at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology partnered on risky virus experiments that violated the terms of their NIH grant, which included prohibitions on gain-of-function research.

Both Fauci and Collins have repeatedly denied that the NIH ever funded gain-of-function research experiments to make deadly pathogens more transmissible among humans — including Fauci's controversial testimony to Congress over the summer, during which he went toe-to-toe with Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul and vociferously denied any gain-of-function research being done with NIH dollars at the WIV. Fauci has continued to deny any wrongdoing even after the damning evidence about EcoHealth and the WIV surfaced. And Collins continued to mislead the public when confronted by CNN about the evidence.

Ernst's office said her bill came in response to Fauci's alleged lies to Congress:

With revelations continuing to surface about the U.S. government's involvement in and support for dangerous scientific experiments overseas under Dr. Anthony Fauci—including “gain of function"" research in China—U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is calling for a full accounting of how and where U.S. tax dollars are being spent, a complete ban on funding of “gain-of-function"" research in Communist China, and restrictions on government officials who intentionally mislead Congress.



Ernst is introducing the FAUCI Act – or the Fairness and Accountability in Underwriting Chinese Institutions Act – which, in addition to banning U.S. funding for “gain-of-function"" research in China, ensures that any National Institutes of Health (NIH) employee, official, or grantee that intentionally misleads Congress, or the Inspector General, will be ineligible for current or future federal grants and employment. The bill also calls for a full accounting of U.S. involvement in “gain-of-function"" research, particularly in China.

""For years, American tax dollars were funneled into Communist China, funding dangerous experiments on coronaviruses at the Wuhan Lab, while the head of the division funding those activities, Dr. Fauci, failed to tell the truth to Congress,"" Ernst said. ""We need a full accounting of how and where our tax dollars are being spent—enough is enough. The FAUCI Act will put an end to U.S. funding of gain-of-function research in Communist China, go after government officials who intentionally mislead Congress, and bring about badly needed transparency and accountability.""

Government watchdog outfit White Coat Waste Project applauded Ernst's efforts to hold Fauci and his cohort accountable for their actions.

""Shipping U.S. tax dollars to a notorious Chinese Communist Party-run bioagent lab in Wuhan for treacherous gain-of-function animal experiments was a recipe for disaster,"" White Coat Waste Project vice president Justin Goodman said. ""We applaud Senator Ernst for introducing the FAUCI Act to protect taxpayers and public health from dangerous and wasteful spending in China and to hold NIH officials and grantees accountable for not being forthright with Congress.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-senator-introduces-fauci-act-ban-funding-gain-of-function-research-hold-nih-officials-accountable,2021-11-03
"Gov. Greg Abbott says Texas will not seek to host MLB All-Star game, blasts 'false political narratives' around Georgia election law","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday declined an invitation to throw out the first pitch at the Texas Rangers' home opening game, announcing that Texas will not seek to host the All-Star Game or any other Major League Baseball special events following MLB's decision to remove the All-Star Game out of Atlanta due to criticism of a Georgia election law.

In a letter addressed to Neil Leibman, the president of Business Operations and Chief Operating Officer for the Texas Rangers baseball team, Abbott accused the MLB of ""perpetuating false political narratives"" surrounding Georgia's new sweeping election reform law.

""Thank you for the invitation to throw the first pitch at the Texas Rangers' home opening game. I was looking forward to it — until Major League Baseball adopted what has turned out to be a false narrative about election reforms in Georgia, and, based on that false narrative, moved the MLB All-Star Game from Atlanta,"" Abbott wrote.

""It is shameful that America's pastime is not only being influenced by partisan politics, but also perpetuating false political narratives,"" the governor added.

Last Friday, Major League Baseball announced its decision to pull the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta because of the state's sweeping new election reform laws. MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said in a statement that ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft.""

He went on to criticize the new Georgia law — which requires absentee ballots to be verified with voter ID, expands early voting for primary and general elections, and codifies the use of ballot drop boxes, among other measures — as ""restrictions to the ballot box.""

In response, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp blasted the MLB's ""knee-jerk decision"" as ""cancel culture.""

""This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections. I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections,"" the governor said Sunday.

Texas Gov. Abbott is the first GOP governor to rally against the MLB in defense of Georgia's law.

""The State of Texas was proud to help MLB host last season's National League playoff games and the World Series in Arlington. However, I will not participate in an event held by MLB, and the State will not seek to host the All-Star Game or any other MLB special events,"" he wrote.

Abbott closed by stating his ""deep respect"" for the Texas Rangers baseball team, wishing them success in the upcoming season.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gov-greg-abbott-says-texas-will-not-host-mlb-all-star-game-blasts-false-political-narratives-around-georgia-election-law,2021-04-05
Gov. Sarah Sanders bans critical race theory and leftist indoctrination in Arkansas schools,"Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has beaten one form of cancer. In her new role as Arkansas governor, she plans to tackle another.

Sanders issued an executive order on Tuesday designed to prevent leftist doctrinaires from peddling racial identity politics and leftist activism in schools.

Less Marx, better marks

Within hours of being sworn in to office on Tuesday, Sanders issued multiple executive orders countering leftist speech codes and conventions in the state, including one removing the use of the controversial term ""Latinx"" in government documents.



In another order ""to prohibit indoctrination and critical race theory in schools,"" Sanders emphasized that the role of schools is to educate, not indoctrinate students. Similarly, teachers are tasked with teaching students how to think, not what to think.

Accordingly, schools' and teachers' days of peddling critical race theory are over.

Christopher Rufo noted in the New York Post that critical race theory was ""formulated in the 1990s and built on the intellectual framework of identity-based Marxism.""



""Identity is the means; Marxism is the end,"" wrote Rufo. ""Critical race theory prescribes a revolutionary program that would overturn the principles of the Declaration and destroy the remaining structure of the Constitution.""

Sanders, who secured over 63% of the vote in the November gubernatorial election, will not allow Arkansas schools to be further weaponized against America.

She noted in her executive order, ""Critical Race Theory (CRT) is antithetical to the traditional American values of neutrality, equality, and fairness. It emphasizes skin color as a person’s primary characteristic, thereby resurrecting segregationist values, which America has fought so hard to reject.""

Critical race theory has no place in Arkansas schools, she suggested; particularly not when ""the Constitution of the State of Arkansas and the Constitution of the United States of America recognize the equal value of every individual, and provide equal protection under the law, regardless of color, creed, race, ethnicity, sex, age, marital status, familial status, disability, religion, and national origin.""



The governor's executive order requires that Arkansas' education secretary, Jacob Oliva, ensure that the his department and its employees, contractors, guest speakers, and lecturers are in compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Furthermore, any and all department rules, regulations, policies, materials, and communications must be reviewed to ensure that leftist discriminatory practices and critical race theory are expurgated.

Sanders' executive order echoes Florida's Individual Freedom Act, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on April 22. The act prohibits ""training or instruction that espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels"" students or employees to believe the core tenets of critical race theory and comparable identitarian theories.

Sanders tweeted Thursday, ""Under my leadership, schools will teach reading, writing, math, and science—and our children will learn that the identity that truly matters is the one we all share: our identity as children of God and citizens of the United States of America.""

In her inaugural address, Sanders stated, ""As long as I am governor, our schools will focus on the skills our children need to get ahead in the modern world, not brainwashing our children with a left-wing political agenda.""

"Group may monitor ballot drop boxes in Arizona, federal judge rules","A federal judge in Arizona has denied a request for an injunction and temporary restraining order against a group which has been monitoring ballot drop boxes to prevent voter fraud supposedly committed by so-called ""mules.""

Attorneys representing the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino had filed a lawsuit against Melody Jennings and her group, Clean Elections USA, for monitoring two ballot drop boxes in Maricopa County. The lawsuit claimed that such behavior amounted to voter intimidation and threatened the exercise of free and fair elections. However, on Friday, Judge Michael T. Liburdi of the U.S. District Court of the District of Arizona ruled that the lawsuit failed to demonstrate ""any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat.""

Attorneys for AARA and VL had told the court that members of Clean Elections USA — some of whom have allegedly been armed and wearing masks and tactical gear — have been monitoring and filming persons who utilized the drop boxes to cast their own vote or to assist others to cast theirs. Plaintiff attorneys had argued that the presence of such ballot box monitors violated the Voting Rights Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, both of which prohibit voter intimidation.

Liburdi disagreed.

""On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. There is no evidence that Defendants have publicly posted any voter’s names, home addresses, occupations, or other personal information,"" he wrote.

At the hearing on Wednesday, defendants' attorney Veronica Lucero noted that there is not direct evidence that any instances of reported voter intimidation were even perpetrated by Clean Elections USA or Jennings. Even Jennings' social media posts, which plaintiffs presented as evidence of a coordinated attempt to hinder legitimate voting, always instructed drop box monitors to obey the law.

In addition to dismissing accusations of active voter intimidation, Liburdi also ruled that defendants' actions fall under First Amendment protections. ""It is well-established that there is a 'First Amendment right to film matters of public interest,'"" Liburdi stated. He elsewhere added that the ""Court has struggled to craft a meaningful form of injunctive relief that does not violate Defendants’ First Amendment rights and those of the drop box observers.""

Liburdi admitted that AARA did have standing in the case and that ""the irreparable harm factor tips in favor of Plaintiffs."" However, he determined that VL did not have standing, stating that ""Voto Latino has not shown any other concrete or particularized injury,"" aside from ""speculative"" concerns that the group may have to divert financial resources ""to develop an educational campaign on how to respond to voter intimidation.""

Liburdi, appointed by former President Donald Trump and a former counsel of Republican Governor Doug Ducey, left the case open, in the event that plaintiffs collect ""new evidence that Defendants have engaged in unlawful voter intimidation.""

Plaintiff attorneys have already issued notice that they intend to appeal the decision. The Arizona nonprofit Activate 48 likewise sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, asking for a federal assistance with allegations of voter intimidation.

"US special envoy to Haiti resigns over 'inhumane' deportations, accuses Biden admin of ignoring his suggestions","The U.S. special envoy to Haiti resigned over what he called ""inhumane"" deportations of Haitian migrants and accused the Biden administration of ignoring his suggestions.

Daniel Foote blasted the administration in his resignation letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which was first obtained by PBS Newshour.

""I will not be associated with the United States' inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs in control of daily life,"" Foote wrote. ""Our policy approach to Haïti remains deeply flawed, and my recommendations have been ignored and dismissed, when not edited to project a narrative different from my own.""

President Joe Biden has faced scathing criticism from both the left and the right over an encampment of illegal aliens in Del Rio, Texas, many of whom were originally from Haiti. The squalid encampment quickly grew to over 10,000 migrants but the numbers have eased thanks to an effort to fly many migrants back to Haiti, while others were allowed into the U.S. while their refugee applications were processed.

Biden administration officials denied the accusations made by Foote.

""There have been multiple senior-level policy conversations on Haiti where all proposals, including those led by former Special Envoy Foote, were fully considered in a rigorous and transparent policy process,"" said Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to PBS.

""Quite frankly, some of those proposals were harmful to our commitment to the promotion of democracy in Haiti and to free and fair elections in Haiti so the Haitian people can choose their own future,"" she added. ""For him to say that the proposals were ignored is, I'm sad to say, simply false.""

White House press secretary Jen Paski addressed the resignation at Thursday's media briefing.

""His positions were and his views were put forward,"" Psaki said. ""They were valued. They were heard. Different policy decisions were made in some circumstances.""

On Thursday the migrant camp was reportedly being dismantled with bulldozers and cleared out. About 3,000 migrants were still waiting for officials to decide their fate.

Haitian President Jovenel Moïse assassinated in his home late Tuesday night; wife shot during 'inhuman and barbaric' attack,"Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, 53, was assassinated in his home late Tuesday night, according to variousreports, and his wife suffered bullet wounds during the attack.

She remains hospitalized at the time of this reporting.

His murder takes place against a backdrop of horrific, ongoing violence in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, perpetuated by at least 95 armed gangs carrying out acts of arson, assault, murder, and shootings.

What are the details?

A statement from interim Prime Minster Claude Joseph revealed that an unidentified group stormed Moïse's home and killed him.

Joseph condemned the attack, saying it was an ""odious, inhuman, and barbaric act.""

According to reports, some of the attackers were described as Spanish-speaking.

""A group of individuals who have not been identified, some of whom were speaking Spanish, attacked the private residence of the President of the Republic and fatally injured the Head of State,"" Joseph said in a statement. ""All measures have been taken to ensure the continuity of the State and to protect the Nation. Democracy and the Republic will win out.""

In February, large protests took place in the country questioning the legitimacy of Moïse's presidency. The nation missed its 2018 election, as Moïse said the country was too unstable to hold free and fair elections, and he continued serving as president.

That same month, Moïse said that his security detail foiled an assassination attempt against him.

""I thank my head of security at the palace,"" he said at the time. ""The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. ... That plan was aborted.""

This is a breaking story and will be updated as events warrant.

"VP Harris contradicts Dr. Fauci, claims Biden admin had to start from 'scratch' for vaccine distribution. Axios deletes own tweet pointing out that inconvenient fact.","On Jan. 21, his first full day in office, President Joe Biden declared to the country that he was implementing a national plan to take on the coronavirus pandemic. His plan included an emphasis on listening to the experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert and Biden's chief medical adviser.

""Above all, our plan is to restore public trust,"" Biden said that day, USA Today reported. ""That's why you're going to be hearing a lot more from Dr. Fauci, not from the president, but from the real genuine experts and scientists.""

Based on her statements in a recent interview with Axios in which she directly contradicted a point Dr. Fauci made about vaccine distribution, it appears that Vice President Kamala Harris did not get the memo.

And that inconvenient fact did not appear to sit well with the powers that be at Axios, as evidenced by the outlet's decision to delete a tweet that pointed out the contradiction.

What did Fauci and Harris say?

The same day Biden declared he was going to trust the experts, his administration was also claiming the Trump administration had a ""nonexistent"" vaccine distribution plan. One anonymous source told CNN that the new administration was ""going to have to build everything from scratch.""

But it turned out that claim wasn't true — a fact Fauci notedthat very day.

Pointing out that the government was already distributing vaccines and that about 1 million shots were already being given daily, Dr. Fauci told reporters, ""We're certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution.""

""I mean we're coming in with fresh ideas, but also some ideas with ... the previous administration. You can't say it was absolutely not usable at all,"" Fauci said.

Fast forward to last Sunday when Vice President Harris was on ""Axios on HBO"" repeating the Fauci-debunked claim that the administration was starting from scratch with vaccine distribution.

""There was no national strategy or plan for vaccinations,"" she claimed. ""We were leaving it to the states and local leaders to try and figure it out.""



And then, she repeated the lie that Fauci had shot down weeks earlier.

""In many ways, we are starting from scratch on something that's been raging for almost an entire year,"" Harris alleged.

Even left-leaning PolitiFact called out Harris' fib, tweeting, ""@VP told @mikeallen that 'there was no national strategy or plan for vaccinations' and that Biden admin was 'starting from scratch.' That's wrong. The Trump admin had a plan to distribute to locations chosen by states and let them take it from there.""

What did Axios do?



When Axios first posted the relevant clip from the interview on Twitter, the outlet pointed out that Harris contradicted Fauci.

The original tweet said, ""@VP Harris to @mikeallen: 'There was no national strategy or plan for [COVID-19] vaccinations. ... We're starting from scratch.' At a press conference last month, Fauci said 'we certainly are not starting from scratch' on vaccine distribution.""

Image source: Twitter/@axios screenshot via web.archive.org

Axios deleted that tweet and replaced it with the tweet with the video clip embedded above that included no allusion at all to the Fauci contradiction.



Both Fox News and National Review reported that Axios did not return requests for comment on why the tweet was deleted.

This move by Axios to delete a tweet unfavorable to the vice president came on the heels of a previously unreported romantic relationship between now-former Biden deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo and Axios reporter Alexi McCammond, who covered Biden and was reassigned to cover Harris when the relationship was exposed.

Ducklo was shamed into resigning from the White House after Vanity Fair reported that he had threatened a Politico reporter who was digging into the then-secret relationship.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harris-contradicts-fauci-axios-deletes-inconvenient-tweet,2021-02-16
Harry Styles being accused of 'queerbaiting' means gender ambiguity is no longer enough for the LGBT movement. People must pick sides and be 'loud and proud.',"In a strange departure from the left's typical support for gender ambiguity, flamboyant pop star Harry Styles is reportedly under fire from some progressive critics for refusing to say publicly whether or not he is bisexual.

The backlash apparently stems from a recent interview he conducted with Better Homes & Garden, published on Tuesday, in which the former boy band singer turned solo act offered a controversially dodgy answer on the subject.

Citing his desire for personal privacy, Styles rebutted the media's frequent attempts to find clarity regarding his sexual orientation, calling the concept ""outdated,"" anyways.

""I've been really open with it with my friends, but that's my personal experience; it's mine,"" he told the magazine. ""The whole point of where we should be heading, which is toward accepting everybody and being more open, is that it doesn't matter, and it's about not having to label everything, not having to clarify what boxes you're checking.""

Some evidently found his reasons for not disclosing who he's slept with to be fair enough. But according to EuroNews, others were left dissatisfied.

The outlet reported that some critics on social media ""critiqued his privilege as an ostensibly straight man to be able to remove himself from discussions while still embracing a queer aesthetic.""

The concept is reportedly known as ""queerbaiting,"" and it loosely describes a scenario in which someone adopts the aesthetics of queer culture without committing to identifying with LGBT culture at large.

""To critics, queerbaiting allows people a free ride on the aesthetic without the personal difficulties associated with openly identifying as queer in a heteronormative world,"" EuroNews reported.

In Styles' case, queer critics charge that he is benefitting from LGBTQ+ support without publicly coming out as bisexual.

One might think that Styles' increasingly outward embrace of the LGBTQ+ movement would be celebrated by those in the camp.

But it seems the pop star's Pride flag-waving and extravagant dress-wearing are not enough in the new transgender-crazed world. He needs to reject the heteronormative lifestyle in full or go back to being a normal masculine male.

""Translation: I’m a straight man that wants to keep my queerbait marketing strategy,"" one critic charged.

They added: ""If he is actually queer it would be more important for him to voice that than keep it ambiguous. People in our community (especially black people) are constantly at risk for showing who they are and doing it flamboyantly, and that’s the reason we’re at the place we are now.""

""Ding ding ding!!!"" one person replied in approval of the message.

Another critic wrote: ""That would be nice if that was the case, but queerness is under attack constantly. Especially in some states where u can't even say gay. We can't all live in 2050 where ambiguous sexuality is the norm. We are living in 2022 and we need allies who will be loud and stand with us.""

""No hate but it seems more like a marketing strategy than anything else, he is benefiting from the sexual ambiguity around him, if he comes out as gay or bi....he'll be less relevant cuz there is nothing new about a queer person wearing a dress or painting his nails,"" added another.

Still another commenter voiced a similar rebuke, saying, ""I respect that he wants to preserve his own experiences, but then, he shouldn't sell it like it doesn't matter, especially when people die in the middle of these speeches, I believe we need and must talk it out loud and proud, today more than ever.""

And the list went on. It's a strange new world.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harry-styles-accused-of-queerbaiting,2022-04-28
Herschel Walker calls out race-baiting Democrats in ad calling America a 'great country full of generous people',"Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker released an ad Wednesday accusing the Democratic Party of using racial issues to divide Americans.

The 30-second ad quotes Democratic politicians including President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, and incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), contrasting their statements that America is racist with Walker's belief that America is a ""great country full of generous people.""

""Democrats use race to divide us,"" the ad begins. It then shows a highlight reel of Democratic Party figures making various comments about race in America.

Abrams is quoted criticizing the Georgia election reforms supported by Republicans as ""racist"" legislation that is ""a redux of Jim Crow in a suit and tie.""

Harris is quoted saying, ""America has a long history of systemic racism."" The quote is taken from remarks she gave after police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the murder of George Floyd.

It also refers to Joe Biden's widely criticized comment from 2020 in which he told Charlamagne tha God, ""if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.""

Finally, it quote's Walker's opponent Raphael Warnock saying, ""America has a preexisting condition. It's called racism.""

Then Walker addresses viewers directly with a simple message: ""Senator Warnock believes America is a bad country, full of racist people. I believe we're a great country, full of generous people.""

""Warnock wants to divide us. I want to bring us together,"" Walker says.

The ad comes as horse race polls show a tight contest between Walker and Warnock, who won a Senate seat in a special election in 2020. A recent poll from Emerson College has the Republican candidate leading the Democratic Senator 46%-44%, a much closer race than in April when Warnock led Walker 49%-45%. The Senate election is rated a ""toss-up"" by the Cook Political Report.

With the midterm election just two months away, Warnock has attacked Walker for appearing hesitant to debate him. The Democrat released an ad earlier this week calling for Walker to ""quit the games"" and ""agree to debates.""

There's A Catch - Warnock for Georgia youtu.be

Walker responded on Wednesday, offering to have a ""fair debate"" in Savannah on Oct. 14.

"" I don’t care what the topics are. It’s a fair debate. Open to the public. Televised statewide. And it’s not run by your donors. You in? Let’s do this for the people,"" Walker tweeted.



But the Warnock campaign has said Walker must agree to a second debate next month before Warnock will meet Walker in Savannah, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

“It’s time for Herschel Walker to stop playing games,” Warnock campaign manager Quentin Fulks said. “The job of a U.S. senator isn’t one where you know the topics ahead of time or get a cheat sheet, and Herschel Walker shouldn’t need one to find the courage to walk on a debate stage.”

A sticking point in the debate negotiations has been whether the candidates will receive the topics in advance and whether there will be a live audience. Walker prefers to have the topics in advance and doesn't want an audience.

Both candidates have been invited to participate in at least three debates hosted by WTOC in Savannah, Mercer University in Macon and the Atlanta Press Club. Warnock has agreed to appear in all three but Walker only accepted an invitation to a fourth debate hosted by WSAV in Savannah on Oct. 14.

Warnock will face Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver at the Mercer University debate on Oct. 13 and the Atlanta Press Club debate on Oct. 16. Both events will move forward with or without Walker.



Walker, a former University of Georgia running back and NFL star, skipped the GOP debates in the primary campaign, saying at the time he wanted to focus on defeating Warnock in the general.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/herschel-walker-ad-calls-out-democrats-race,2022-09-07
"Hillary Clinton says Americans do not appreciate what Biden has done for them, blames social media","Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tried to explain away President Joe Biden's poor polling by accusing Americans of not appreciating what Biden has done for them, and blamed social media.

Clinton made the comments while a guest on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC show Tuesday evening.

""You know, democracy is messy. You know, a lot of people got, oh I think, kind of frustrated looking at the messy process of legislation,"" said Clinton.

""And they didn't really appreciate that, within a year, the Biden administration has passed two major pieces of legislation through both the House and the Senate, they passed another major piece through the House that will be soon be in the Senate,"" she continued.

""By any measure those are extraordinary accomplishments and they really will help many millions of Americans with healthcare and prescription drug prices, as well as climate change and so much else,"" said Clinton.

""But because of the way we are getting our information today,"" she concluded, ""and because of the lack of gatekeepers and people who have a historic perspective who can help us understand what we are seeing, there is a real vulnerability in the electorate to the kind of demagoguery and disinformation that, unfortunately, the other side is really good at exploiting.""

Both Maddow and Clinton accused Republicans of undermining the results of fair elections and calling for violence as a political solution in the interview.

Biden's poll numbers have suffered greatly after a cascade of damaging incidents plaguing his administration. Among the worst were the disastrous retreat from Afghanistan, the painful cost of high inflation, and the crisis of illegal immigration at the border.

One poll from October found that only 38% of Americans thought Biden deserved a positive job rating.

"Hillary Clinton pivots from denying past elections to rejecting future results, claiming Republicans plan to 'steal the next presidential election'","Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has preemptively accused Republicans of stealing the 2024 presidential election. By once again sowing doubt about the legitimacy of American democracy, Clinton hopes to raise money and help Democrats take over strategic state legislatures.

Preemptive election denial

For years, Democrats have expressed concerns about how ""planting seeds of doubt"" undermines democracy. In fact, Democrats continue to denounce some Republicans as ""election deniers"" for questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election, which Clinton had told then-candidate Joe Biden not to concede ""under any circumstances.""

Notwithstanding the left's apparent sensitivity to so-called election denial, Clinton — who has repeatedly suggested the 2016 election was ""stolen"" from her despite having lost to former President Donald Trump by 77 electoral votes (304-227) — alleged last week that a ""coup"" was imminent.

In a video posted to Twitter on Oct. 21 by the radical leftist organization Indivisible, Clinton claimed that ""right-wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election. And they're not making a secret of it.""

In her fundraising video for Indivisible, an activist group started by former Democrat staffers, Clinton said the ""steal"" would be achieved by Republican-led state legislatures.

Clinton explained how the alleged steal would be achieved: ""The right-wing-controlled Supreme Court may be poised to rule on giving state legislatures, yes, you heard me that correctly, state legislatures the power to overturn presidential elections,""

""Just think: If that happens, the 2024 presidential election could be decided, not by the popular vote or even by the anachronistic Electoral College, but by state legislatures, many of them Republican-controlled,"" she added.



After calling into question the legitimacy of American elections, Clinton revealed the true purpose of her wild claims: ""Indivisible has launched Crush the Coup to make sure we're ready to defend democracy in 2024. They have put together a list of critical races in six key states and how you can get involved."" Clinton then suggested viewers donate.

Moore v. Harper

Indivisible's Crush the Coup identified ""the 29 most critical races in 6 states that we need to win to defeat the MAGA coup."" The six battleground states are allegedly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

CTC named a number of Democrats the group wants bankrolled and elected to power this November. Extra to providing the Democrats with leverage over strategic legislatures, CTC intends for these candidates to mitigate what it perceives would be the fallout of Moore v. Harper, an election redistricting case that will be heard this fall by the Supreme Court.

The case concerns whether ""a State's judicial branch may nullify the regulations governing the 'Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives ... prescribed ... by the Legislature thereof,' ... and replace them with regulations of the state courts' own devising.""

CTC has restated the claim made by others on the left that by adopting ""an extremist and fringe legal doctrine,"" the court will give states the power to overturn elections.

""The nightmare scenario,"" according to CTC, ""is that a legislature, displeased with how an election official on the ground has interpreted her state's election laws, would invoke the [independent state legislature doctrine] as a pretext to refuse to certify the results of a presidential election and instead select its own slate of electors.""

Carrie Campbell Severino, head of the Judicial Crisis Network, recently indicated in National Review that the ""alarmism around Moore v. Harper comes from liberals who cherry-pick their grievances in states whose constituents favor Republicans and selectively use liberal activist state courts to give Democrats advantages they cannot democratically.""

Whereas Clinton and CTC allege they are fighting to protect democracy, they are, according to Severino, hoping to help Democrats keep undermining it.

""Their rhetoric about democracy is part of a con job, and the Left's disinformation campaign serves as a subterfuge to distract from the reality that their true grievance is not on behalf of the people,"" wrote Severino. ""It is that their strategy of jerry-rigging otherwise lost elections through renegade courts might soon come to an end.""

Clinton v. the democratic will of the people

Like Georgia's gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D), Clinton routinely warns of threats to democracy.

In June, Clinton said that ""Donald Trump, his allies, and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy."" She also tweeted, ""The people involved in the criminal conspiracy to overturn the will of America's voters ... must be held accountable.""

Despite speaking highly of democracy and the need to defend it, Clinton has repeatedly rejected the results of democratically decided elections.

In 2019, Clinton called Trump an ""illegitimate president"" and suggested ""he knows"" he stole the 2016 election.

Hillary Clinton: ""Trump knows he's an illegitimate president"" youtu.be

In 2020, Clinton said on the Atlantic's ""The Ticket"" podcast that ""There was a widespread understanding that this election [in 2016] was not on the level. ... We still don't know what really happened.""

Clinton has not only contested the results of the 2016 election. She claimed that Stacey Abrams would have beaten Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2018 ""if she'd had a fair election.""

In 2002, Clinton publicly claimed former President George W. Bush had been ""selected"" president, not elected.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-claims-republicans-plan-steal-election,2022-10-25
"Hillary Clinton compares Trump to Hitler, MAGA fans to Nazis","Hillary Clinton recently likened former President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. She also compared MAGA supporters at Friday's Trump rally to Nazis.

Earlier this month, Trump held a rally in Youngstown, Ohio. Near the conclusion of the rally, some Trump supporters made a one-finger gesture that was likely an endorsement of the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Trump held his latest rally in Wilmington, North Carolina. During Friday's event, a handful of attendees made the pointing finger gesture. However, security at the Trump event are seen on video asking people to stop making the hand motion.

PBS ""NewsHour"" correspondent Lisa Desjardins was at Friday night's rally, and said, ""Confirmed with people at Trump rally who held 1 finger up that they meant it as a symbol of QAnon’s 'Where We Go One We Go All' and further… Security staff here fanned out and told people to take down their fingers. That is a reason why – maybe main reason - we saw fewer"" finger gestures than in the previous rally.

""The man in this photo held up 1 finger and told me he meant it as a WWG1WGA sign – and then the security guard in the next photo told him to take it down. He was furious 'that's my Constitutional right!' The man in the crowd told me after I saw that interaction happen,"" Desjardins wrote on Twitter.

Desjardins said the security staff ""clearly had been directed to watch for this kind of gesture and to shut it down.""

Hillary Clinton said the MAGA supporters making the finger gesture were like Adolf Hitler supporters doing the Sieg Heil salute of the Nazis.

On Friday, Clinton spoke at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.

Clinton said, ""I remember as a young student, you know, trying to figure out, how people get basically brought in by Hitler. How did that happen? I'd watch newsreels and I'd see this guy standing up there ranting and raving, and people shouting and raising their arms. I thought, 'What's happened to these people? Why do they believe that?'""

She continued, ""You saw the rally in Ohio the other night, Trump is there ranting and raving for more than an hour, and you have these rows of young men with their arms raised. I thought, 'What is going on?'""

Clinton theorized, ""So there is a real pressure – and I think it is fair to say we're in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.""

Taylor Budowich – a spokesman for Trump – blasted Clinton for ""using some of the most disgusting smears imaginable.""

""It seems like perpetual-failed-candidate Hillary Clinton’s basket of deplorables has run stale, not unlike herself,"" Budowich told Fox News. ""It's pathetic, it’s divisive, and it is further cementing her legacy of cringe.""

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Hillary Clinton denigrated half of Trump's supporters as a ""basket of deplorables.""

""You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said in September 2016. ""The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.""

Earlier this month, President Joe Biden proclaimed that Trump and MAGA Republicans ""represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-trump-hitler-supporters-nazis,2022-09-24
Homeless encampment returns to affluent LA neighborhood after Hunter Biden moves out: 'Venice became a tent city',"Hunter Biden's former neighbors along the Venice Canals in Los Angeles, California, have noticed the return of a sizeable homeless encampment along their street since Biden moved away.

According to an exclusive report from the Daily Mail, people living in residences along the Venice Canals where Biden recently lived now report that the homeless ""tent city"" that lined their street before Biden's arrival has returned again now that Secret Service personnel no longer remove the homeless from the area.

Local resident Ann McElhinney and her husband Phelim McAleer have made careful note of the changes in the homeless population before, during, and after Biden's temporary stay.

""When Hunter moved into the neighborhood, his street was immediately cleared of the homeless,"" McElhinney said. ""The minute he moved up to Malibu, his old street in Venice became a tent city. How is this fair to Venice homeowners?

""It just shows how the Bidens truly live a different life from the rest of us,"" she added.

Indeed, he does. The Daily Mail reports that Hunter rented the Venice Canals home for himself, his wife Melissa, and their son Beau for $25,000 a month. While the home is 3,700 square feet in size, it has just two bedrooms, both master suites. It also offers several private balconies overlooking the historic canal.

The arrival of Hunter and his family also meant a steady stream of Secret Service members into the area — as well as a mass exodus of homeless residents out of it. It is thought that the Secret Service either may have actively removed the homeless population from the street or deterred the homeless by their presence.

""It could be a coincidence or the city had them removed because of Hunter,"" longtime resident Rocky Otterstrom speculated to the Daily Mail last year.

To make their jobs in the area easier, the Secret Service were eventually given their own rental along the canal. Though that rental cost taxpayers $30,000 a month, it did spare agents from spending long days in what Otterstrom described as ""huge blacked-out GMCs"" and relieving themselves in a port-a-potty placed on the street for their use.

That rental expense was short lived, however. Hunter and his family relocated to Malibu after just a few months along the canal, and they took their security detail with them. They remained in Malibu for only a year before moving on to the Hollywood Hills. Meanwhile, the homeless returned to the Venice area almost as soon as the Bidens and the Secret Service left.

McElhinney and McAleer are now producing a movie entitled ""My Son Hunter,"" which chronicles the many scandals with which Hunter has been associated. There is currently no word on when the movie will be released.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeless-return-after-hunter-biden-leaves,2022-07-13
House Republicans vote in secret to bring back pork-barrel spending,"House Republicans voted Wednesday to end their conference-wide ban on earmarks, restoring GOP support for pork-barrel spending that directs money to pet projects in home districts.

The resolution was passed during the GOP's weekly conference meeting. The vote was 102-84 in favor of restoring earmarks and was conducted by secret ballot, so voters will not know which Republicans voted to bring back pork spending.

In 2010, House Republicans passed a moratorium on earmarks in their conference by voice vote, to show they were serious about cutting spending ahead of the midterm elections that year. Controversies like the wasteful $400 million ""bridge to nowhere"" in Alaska fueled Republican campaign promises decrying federal spending and promising reform.

After the 2010 Tea Party wave election handed the GOP control of the House and made Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) House speaker, Republicans pledged to hold a vote banning earmarks.

""Earmarks have become a symbol of a dysfunctional Congress and serve as a fuel line for the culture of spending that has dominated Washington for too long,"" GOP leaders said at the time.

But in recent years, earmark proponents have argued that the ban was a mistake and that the ability of legislators to trade their support for certain bills in exchange for earmarks in those bills is needed to move legislation through Congress.

With President Joe Biden advocating for big-budget items like a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, Republicans say they want more control over how that money is spent.

""""There's a real concern about the administration directing where money goes. This doesn't add one more dollar. I think members here know ... about what should go in their district, not Biden,"" Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters ahead of the conference vote.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) offered the resolution to end the GOP's self-imposed earmark ban. His proposal included several rules to increase transparency, including requirements for GOP lawmakers to publicly disclose the earmark, provide written justification for any project, and verify that they have no financial stake in it.

""I'm a yes,"" Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said. ""With the changes with transparency — it's not the Upton Road to the Upton House, you have support in writing from local units of government — I think that's a fair approach.""

Members of the House Freedom Caucus blasted their colleagues for supporting the return of pork spending, equating it to ""legislative bribery.""

""I think we've got $30 trillion in debt and people are tired of the swamp, and the GOP should be ashamed of itself, if it jumps headfirst right back into the swamp,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said.

Senate Republicans are considering a similar measure to restore earmarks, which is supported by retiring Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.)",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-bring-back-pork,2021-03-17
Your tax dollars at hard work: Report says House will give staffers free Peloton memberships,"The U.S. House of Representatives will soon offer staffers in Washington D.C. and in district offices free Peloton memberships at taxpayer expense, according to a report.

Fox Business reported Friday that a draft email from the office of the chief administrative officer says that the new ""premier employee benefit"" will be made available to all Capitol Police officers, as well as congressional staffers, who each will get both Peloton All-Access and a Peloton App membership for free.



The government reportedly has a contract with the company — known for its stationary exercise bikes and online fitness class subscriptions — to offer the free membership benefits to an estimated 10,000 House staffers and 2,300 Capitol Police officers.

According to Fox Business, the contract requires a $10,000 upfront payment to Peloton, as well as an additional $10 per month charge for each staffer or officer who uses their membership. Those rates are slightly discounted from what other Americans pay; a Peloton All-Access Membership costs $39 per month and a Peloton App Membership costs $12.99 per month. If everyone eligible for the benefit takes advantage of it, it could cost taxpayers as much as $120,000 per month, $1.4 million annually, and $14.4 million over the next ten years.

The draft email from the office of the CAO reportedly told staffers and officers they would ""have access to thousands of live and on-demand classes, across multiple disciplines, that are available for streaming across multiple devices and require no purchase of Peloton equipment.""

Peloton confirmed that it has a contract with the House in a statement to Fox Business.

The report comes one week after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) raised the minimum salary for House staffers to $45,000. Previously, there was no salary floor for congressional staff, and some staffers were paid as low as $30,000 while being required to live in one of the most expensive cities in America. The House on Tuesday also voted to recognize the right of its staffers to unionize in a party-line vote of 217-202, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.

A recent report by Issue One, a campaign finance reform group that describes itself as ""crosspartisan,"" found that one in eight congressional staff members are not paid a minimum subsistence wage to meet the basic needs of living in D.C. Congressional staff often work long hours as well and make far less money than those who hold similar jobs in the private sector.



But at least now they have taxpayer-funded exercise bike memberships.

Howard Stern calls Clarence Thomas 'Darth Vader' and says he'll run for president to add Supreme Court justices and restore Roe v. Wade,"Radio talk show host Howard Stern referred to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as ""Darth Vader"" and said he would run for president in order to add more justices to the highest court and restore Roe v. Wade.

Stern made the comments on his SiriusXM show Monday after the Supreme Court reversed the pivotal Roe v. Wade decision from 1973.

“I’m actually going to probably have to run for president now,” said Stern, who is 68 years old.

He said that he would abolish the Electoral College for the sake of equal representation.

“I am going to do the very simple thing that’ll set the country straight: one vote, one person. No more of this Electoral College. I’m getting rid of it,"" he explained. “The problem with most presidents is they have too big of an agenda. The only agenda I would have is to make the country fair again.""

Stern went on to disparage Justice Thomas, saying he was “sitting there like Darth Vader, dormant, waiting for other kooks to join the Supreme Court.”

He also promised that if he were elected he'd reinstate Roe v. Wade by choosing his own five justices for the Supreme Court.

“The other thing is, if I do run for president — and I’m not f***ing around, I’m really thinking about it — because the only other thing I’m going to do is appoint five more Supreme Court justices,” Stern continued.

When challenged by co-host Robin Quivers about the feasibility of his plan, Stern admitted he had no idea what he was talking about.

“I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing exactly,"" he chuckled.



The next president would only have the opportunity to choose Supreme Court justices when one passes away or resigns from the office. Some Democrats have pressed for President Joe Biden to ""pack the court"" by expanding the number of justices in order to gain an upper hand for the liberal wing of the court.

'That's why people don't trust the media': Bill Maher accuses left-wing media of burying Hunter Biden laptop story because it didn't fit their narrative,"Liberal talk show Bill Maher host accused left-wing media outlets of burying the Hunter Biden laptop story.

Maher addressed how liberal media outlets are finally acknowledging the Hunter Biden laptop story that was first reported in October 2020 by the New York Post.

""I remember reading about this a couple of years ago, the New York Post came across… Hunter Biden's computer, which he apparently left at a computer repair store,"" Maher recalled.

Maher advised that Hunter Biden should never leave his computer with other people ""just for the personal stuff"" that was allegedly found on the laptop.

""But it also had stuff about how, you know, c'mon, he's a ne'er-do-well. I'm sorry, Hunter Biden, but you are,"" Maher remarked. ""You made a living being ne'er-do-well who was taking money just because you were the vice president's son and you had influence.""

""He got, I think $4.8, yes, million from Chinese energy companies to sit on the board and consult,"" Maher stated.



After reviewing government records, court documents, bank statements, and emails from Biden's laptop, the Washington Post confirmed this week that the Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC China Energy paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden. The Chinese energy conglomerate paid a $1 million legal retainer and $3.8 million in consulting fees.

Maher joked, ""Yeah, that was his passion in life: energy exploration. Hooker exploration was his passion.""

Maher acknowledged, ""So the New York Post got a hold of what was in the computer. And, you know, because the New York Post is a Republican paper, and the New York Times and the Washington Post are the Democratic paper[s].""

""And the Republican paper, Twitter… canceled their account! They can't even report on this story,"" Maher said in regards to the New York Post – a newspaper that was founded by Alexander Hamilton more than 220 years ago – being locked out of its official Twitter account for 16 days for sharing the Hunter Biden scandal accusations on social media.

He added, ""And now two years later, the New York Times and the Washington Post have come around and say, ‘Okay, there was something there.'""



The New York Times finally authenticated key details in the Hunter Biden story last month.

Maher conceded that the Hunter Biden laptop story should have been taken with a ""giant thing of salt"" since the New York Post received the information from hardcore Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon.

Maher also noted that it shouldn't have taken ""two years"" to verify the accusations.

""It looks like the left-wing media just buried the story because it wasn't part of their narrative and that's why people don't trust the media,"" Maher said of the story that was censored and dismissed in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang was a guest on Friday night's ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" where he pointed out that trust in media ""falls very sharply along party lines.""

A Gallup poll from October found that 68% of Democrats had a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust in the media, but that number plunges to 31% when it comes to independents, and only 11% of Republicans believe the media. Overall, 7% of Americans have ""a great deal"" and 29% ""a fair amount"" of trust and confidence in newspapers, television and radio news reporting. This is the lowest since the record low in 2016.

Yang stated, ""This is part of the erosion of institutional trust, where one side feels like the media is on their side.""

""And it does seem like this Hunter Biden laptop story did get buried because of the timing,"" he added. ""I mean, it was coming out during the height of the election in 2020. And they did not want that out in the mainstream.""



CNN legal analyst Laura Coates attempted to defend corporate media for ignoring the Hunter Biden scandal.

""I think it can also be about the idea of you know, one, the priorities that the media has about what stories to put forward. And sometimes it's tied to obviously what is in the national zeitgeist,"" Coates said. ""Other times, it's according to what actually is there to report on? What is the new information that's going to better inform the population?""

""And of course, here we are in the world, as you well know, where not only do we have different slants for different media they are suggesting, but also you've got people who want these silos,"" Coates continued. ""They just want echo chambers. We used to say things like… 'You're preaching to the choir.' Well, now it's, 'Why aren't you preaching to the choir? It's all I'm here for.' So you preach to as a member of the choir.""

On Wednesday, CNN finally admitted that Hunter Biden's laptop is authentic – 532 days after the initial story broke. CNN was one of numerous legacy media outlets that dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal as ""Russian disinformation.""

At the time of the New York Post story went viral, Maher dismissed the allegations and passed off the accusations as something Donald Trump Jr. would do.

"Tucker Carlson reveals email sent to ICE officers after Biden's deportation order: 'Release them all, immediately'","Fox News host Tucker Carlson revealed Friday that his team exclusively obtained an email showing how Immigration and Customs Enforcement was directed to carry out one of President Joe Biden's executive orders on immigration.

What's the background?

After entering office on Wednesday, Biden signed numerous executive orders, many of which reversed the policies of his predecessor, now-former President Donald Trump.

One of the executive orders enacted ""a 100-day pause on deportations for some undocumented immigrants,"" according to the Texas Tribune.

More from the Texas Tribune:

The pause in deportations, which begins Friday, is part of a review and reset of enforcement policies within Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agencies as the Biden administration ""develops its final priorities,"" according to a DHS statement.



The moratorium applies to ""certain noncitizens ordered deported to ensure we have a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety"" according to the DHS. That category excludes any immigrant who is ""suspected of terrorism or espionage, or otherwise poses a danger to the national security of the United States,"" those who entered after Nov. 1 and those who have voluntarily waived any rights to remain in the country, according to a DHS memo.

What did the email say?

Carlson said that his team obtained an internal email sent to ICE officers in Texas.

The email read, ""As of midnight tonight, stop all removals. This includes Mexican bus runs, charter flights and commercial removals (until further notice) ... all cases are to be considered [no significant likelihood of removal in foreseeable future].""

""Release them all, immediately. No sponsor available is not acceptable any longer,"" the message added.

According to Carlson, the directive is the ""result of the complete chaos"" that resulted from Biden's sweeping executive order.

The official who sent the email noted that he was just ""the messenger"" explaining the directive. In other words, It wasn't his idea. It was Joe Biden's. Now, this email was news to us. The memorandum from the Biden administration to halt deportations did not call for people here illegally to be released from detention. So we made some calls, and we learned that the Department of Homeland Security is currently hammering out how to enact the memorandum. It does not specifically call for the instant release of all migrants in detention.



So what was this memo about? Just the result of the complete chaos that resulted when the incoming administration changed a policy this big on its first day without explaining what it means.

Twice-deported illegal alien sentenced in murder of 6-year-old girl,"On September 9, the 56-year-old Mexican national Maximino Delgado Lagunas was sentenced to 15 years to life for murdering a 6-year-old Orange County girl. Lagunas was found guilty of one felony count of second-degree murder on June 22.

Despite having been convicted in 2015 for drunk driving, on February 17, 2018, Lagunas got behind the wheel with a blood alcohol level nearly three times California's legal limit of 0.8%. Around 2:15 p.m., Lagunas drove onto the opposite sidewalk where Grace Aguilar was playing.

Lagunas, a twice-deported illegal alien, ran Grace Aguilar down and then smashed into a parked vehicle.

The child died of her injuries.

Lagunas, whose blood alcohol was reportedly .22%, told police that his brakes were not working and that he had lost control of his vehicle.

While he would otherwise have faced voluntary manslaughter charges, his prior conviction enabled prosecutors to upgrade the charges to second-degree murder.

KCOP13 reported that this upgrade was made possible by Lagunas' signing of a Watson advisement in 2015. A Watson advisement is a statement that an individual convicted with a DUI can be asked to sign, indicating foreknowledge that drunk driving can kill or injure people.

Orange County district attorney Todd Spitzer stated in a Friday release: ""A six-year-old girl is dead because someone who had already been warned about the dangers of drinking and driving ignored those warnings and got behind the wheel drunk. Every time someone drives under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they take the risk that they could kill someone."" Spitzer noted further, ""This time it was a six-year-old girl named Grace who was just playing on the sidewalk.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told KNBC that Lagunas had been deported in 2001 and again in 2008.



After his 2015 DUI conviction, Lagunas was placed on informal probation and set free, even though requirements stipulate that he was supposed to have been detained 48 hours for pickup by immigration officials.

Lagunas was not the only illegal alien caught driving drunk in 2018.



According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, there were 1,113 criminal non-citizens convicted of driving under the influence in 2018.

In 2019, the number of convictions fell to 614, and the number dropped again in 2020 to 364. However, in 2021 there were 1,629 DUI convictions. So far in 2022, there have already been 1,241 illegal aliens convicted of driving while intoxicated.

Convictions only tell a partial story. There is also the matter of the Americans maimed or killed by criminal non-citizens.

Earlier this year, illegal alien Jose Virgilio Carcamo Elvir left a 72-year-old Florida man dead and three others injured in a drunk-driving crash.



In January, illegal alien Jarol Leiva-Navarro killed a 32-year-old American while reportedly drunkenly driving 110 miles per hour.

In March 2021, an illegal alien named Rolbin Pacheco killed Cheston Edwards, a North Carolina father of two, while driving drunk.

A 5-year-old girl was killed in a Florida hit-and-run last October when an intoxicated illegal alien was speeding at night without his lights on.

Three members of the Thin Blue Line police motorcycle club were killed outside San Antonio in July 2020 when a DACA-protected illegal alien with a lengthy criminal record drunkenly ran them down.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illegal-alien-sentenced-murder-little-girl,2022-09-12
Illinois Democrats' extreme gerrymandering inadvertently helps Republicans in 2022 midterm elections,"Democrats in Illinois may have inadvertently helped Republicans after redrawing the state's congressional districts.

What is the background?

Illinois Democrats unveiled last week their proposed congressional district map after congressional apportionment, based on the 2020 Census, resulted in Illinois losing one House seat.

The proposed map is heavily gerrymandered, and was designed to give Democrats 14 House seats and Republicans just three House seats.

Ironically, prominent Democrats are known for condemning extreme gerrymandering.

Just this month, in fact, former Attorney General Eric Holder condemned ""Republican gerrymandering"" as a ""real danger to our democracy."" Notice that he did not say anything about Democratic gerrymandering because apparently gerrymandering is only a threat to democracy when Republicans do it.

How did it backfire?

According to congressional districting expert Dave Wasserman, Illinois Democrats — instead of bolstering Democratic control over Illinois' congressional seats — have actually made three seats currently held by Democrats potential toss-ups in the 2022 midterm elections.

""IL Dems appear to have gone out of their way to make their gerrymander *less* efficient. As proposed (left), #IL03, #IL14 and #IL17 would be close to toss ups in 2022. With a few slightly different choices (example, right), 14/17 districts would've been Biden +10 or more,"" Wasserman explained.

The extreme gerrymandering is so bad, according to Wasserman, that one Republican strategist joked that a GOP ""mole"" must have helped Democrats draw the map.

""One GOP strategist called this afternoon and joked to me that there 'must have been a Republican mole' in IL Dems' map-drawing room. A DC Dem consultant fuming over the map: 'if you're going to make it that ugly, at least make it more effective,'"" Wasserman said. ""Even in Downstate IL, where Dems face no incumbent constraints, they stranded a few hyper-blue precincts in ultra-red districts, costing #IL13 and #IL17 a few points of Biden margin.""

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), one of the few Republican lawmakers who supported impeaching former President Donald Trump earlier this year, released a statement condemning Illinois Democrats for redrawing him into a district that leans blue.

""This redistricting process has been anything but transparent, which comes as no surprise to anyone. I believe the people of Illinois deserve better,"" Kinzinger said.

Meanwhile, Illinois Republican Party chairman Don Tracy called the proposed map ""the Nancy Pelosi Protection Plan,"" owing to the motive of Illinois Democrats to intentionally hurt Republican lawmakers and help Democrats retain control of the U.S. House in the 2022 midterm elections.

""It's appalling that fair representation, keeping communities of interest together, and transparency in the mapmaking process in Illinois all had to take a back seat to the demands of national politics,"" Tracy said.



While the redrawn map is only a proposal, it may likely be what Illinois lawmakers approve. Democrats have firm control in the Illinois General Assembly, and Illinois' governor, J. B. Pritzker, is a Democrat.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illinois-democrats-gerrymander-helps-republicans,2021-10-17
'Most dangerous law I've ever seen': Illinois mayor warns radical criminal justice overhaul might lead citizens to 'take the law into their own hands',"An Illinois mayor told Fox News on Monday that the state's new Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, set to go into effect in a few months, is the ""most dangerous law"" he has ever seen.



Orland Park Mayor Keith Pekau is running for Congress in Illinois' 6th District and has been vocal about his opposition to the radical new act. According to Pekau, the law essentially overhauls the state's current criminal justice system, and he fears that it could cause crime in Illinois to ""spiral out of control.""

""We create potential anarchy because law enforcement can't do their job and then people feel that they have to do that job,"" he said. ""People aren't trained in the use of force. They're not trained to de-escalate situations.""

The SAFE-T Act includes provisions to end cash bail for most offenses and limits how defendants are determined to be flight risks. It also allows offenders placed under electronic monitoring to be in violation for 48 hours before they can be charged.

Proponents of the bill argued that it would create a more equitable criminal justice system in Illinois and combat systemic racism.

""It was passed in the middle of the night, with 40 minutes to read an 800-page bill, which is unacceptable,"" Pekau said in September.

""It abolishes cash bail for almost every offense. This includes — but isn't limited to — kidnapping, armed robbery, second-degree murder, drug-induced homicide, aggravated DUI, threatening a public official, and aggravated fleeing and eluding,"" he continued.

The Illinois mayor explained that the new law would drop trespassing from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class B. Pekau stated that law enforcement would no longer be able to physically remove a trespasser.

""Now they can't arrest, they can only write a ticket,"" he said. ""So, they get to stay in that business, on your property, at your house, etc.""

Pekau argued that the bill is ""just a potpourri of everything"" that failed to consider ""law enforcement, judges or all the stakeholders in place."" The mayor stated that the new law would allow criminals back on the streets.

The law was signed last year by Governor J.B. Pritzker, and it will go into effect on January 1, 2023.

The congressional candidate said he hopes Illinois voters will cast their ballots to remove the governor and the state legislators who supported the extreme bill.

""I don't think we know what's coming from this,"" Pekau told Fox News. ""I think we can project that if criminals are allowed to run free and police officers can't protect citizens, citizens are going to start protecting themselves and take the law into their own hands.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illinois-mayor-warns-criminal-justice-law,2022-10-25
'I'm not making new law. I'm eliminating bad policy': Biden defends high number of executive orders,"President Joe Biden made a point Tuesday to defend the breakneck flurry of executive orders he has churned out since taking office nearly two weeks ago, asserting, ""I'm not making new law. I'm eliminating bad policy.""

What are the details?

Biden signed three executive orders on immigration issues Tuesday in the Oval Office, telling the media:

""I want to make it clear: There's a lot a talk with good reason about the number of executive orders that I have signed. I'm not making new law. I'm eliminating bad policy. What I'm doing is taking on issues that 99% of them that the president — the last president of the United States — issued executive orders I thought were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country. Particularly in the area of immigration. This is about how America is safer, stronger, more prosperous when we have a fair, orderly, and humane legal immigration system.""

Fox News reported that the immigration executive orders were ""part of a sweeping push by Biden to roll back"" policies put in place by former President Donald Trump, who took heat for imposing aggressive measures regarding immigration and border security.

Biden added Tuesday, ""We are going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families ... with no plan, none whatsoever to reunify the children who are still in custody and their parents.""

According to The Washington Post:

Although officials described in broad terms their intent to repudiate the previous administration's policies, they acknowledged that some of Trump's border control measures will remain in place for the time being, in one sign of their concern about a new migration wave building in the middle of the pandemic.

While campaigning ahead of the Nov. 3 election, Biden argued that circumventing Congress through executive orders was no way to legislate, and likened such actions to those of ""a dictator."" But by the end of his first week in office, he signed an eye-popping number of orders in comparison to his last eight predecessors.

Biden signed 24 executive orders over his first seven days in the White House, far more than President Barack Obama (5), President Trump (4), President Bill Clinton (2), President George H.W. Bush (1), and President Jimmy Carter (1). Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush did not sign any executive orders in their first week of office. He also signed 37 presidential actions in his first week in power.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/im-not-making-new-law-im-eliminating-bad-policy-biden-defends-high-number-of-executive-orders,2021-02-03
Indiana GOP governor vetoes bill seeking to ban biological males from competing in women's sports,"Indiana Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb this week vetoed a bill that sought to prevent biological males from competing in women's interscholastic sports, calling the legislation too broad and claiming there is currently no need for such a policy in Indiana.

Holcomb's veto comes as at least 11 other Republican states across the country have passed bills to guard competitive fairness against the designs of the transgender movement. In recent years, it has become more common for schools and other institutions to allow biological males presenting as transgender females to compete in women's sports.

Often, the athletes go on to easily defeat the female competition given their physical advantage. Just this past week, University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas garnered national headlines and ignited controversy after becoming the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA women's swimming title.

But in a letter to state lawmakers on Monday, Holcomb argued that such a problem doesn't currently exist in his state, and so the bill, known as HEA 1041, is not necessary.

""The presumption of the policy laid out in HEA 1041 is that there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention,"" the governor wrote.

""It implies that the goals of consistency and fairness in competitive female sports are not currently being met,"" he continued, adding, ""After thorough review, I find no evidence to support either claim even if I support the overall goal.""

Holcomb also raised concerns that the bill sent to his desk was too broad and consequently would lead to confusion in school districts and result in legal challenges upon passage.

""If it is the goal of HEA 1041 to provide clarity and one consistent state policy regarding the fairness in K-12 sports in Indiana, for me this current bill falls short,"" Holcomb wrote. ""The wide-open nature of the grievance provisions in HEA 1041 that apply to all K-12 schools in Indiana makes it unclear about how consistency and fairness will be maintained for parents and students across different counties and school districts.""



While the bill's message is clear, it intentionally leaves vague the processes by which grievances are filed and subsequently resolved.

The bill states that ""a male, based on a student's biological sex at birth in accordance with the student's genetics and reproductive biology, may not participate on an athletic team or sport designated under this section as being a female, women's, or girls' athletic team or sport.""



From there, any student or parent can submit a grievance and every schooling institution in the state is required to establish and maintain a resolution procedure.

It wasn't immediately clear whether Holcomb, who has often embraced conservative policies, would consider signing a tweaked or narrower version of the bill. But in his letter, the governor did call the aim to protect fairness in women's sports ""a worthy cause for sure.""

On the same day that he vetoed HEA 1041, Holcomb signed a bill that allowed for permitless carry of handguns in his state.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/indiana-gop-governor-vetoes-bill-seeking-to-ban-biological-males-from-competing-in-womens-sports,2022-03-22
International Rugby League bans transgender women from international women's matches,"The International Rugby League has announced that transgender women will not be allowed to play in international rugby league competitions, for now.

The IRL says the ban will be in place while the issue is examined and a policy is developed.

""Until further research is completed to enable the IRL to implement a formal transgender inclusion policy, male-to-female (transwomen) players are unable to play in sanctioned women’s international rugby league matches,"" the announcement noted.

""It is the IRL’s responsibility to balance the individual’s right to participate - a long-standing principle of rugby league and at its heart from the day it was established - against perceived risk to other participants, and to ensure all are given a fair hearing,"" the statement said.

""The IRL will continue to work towards developing a set of criteria, based on best possible evidence, which fairly balance the individual’s right to play with the safety of all participants,"" the statement noted. ""To help achieve this, the IRL will seek to work with the eight Women’s Rugby League World Cup 2021 finalists to obtain data to inform a future transwomen inclusion policy in 2023, which takes into consideration the unique characteristics of rugby league.""



Debate continues to swirl globally about whether biological males who identify as women should be allowed to compete in women's sports.

FINA, an entity related to swimming and other water sports, has banned biological men from competing against women unless they meet certain criteria.

Male athletes who wish to compete against women must prove that ""They have complete androgen insensitivity and therefore could not experience male puberty,"" or that ""They are androgen sensitive but had male puberty suppressed beginning at Tanner Stage 2 or before age 12, whichever is later, and they have since continuously maintained their testosterone levels in serum (or plasma) below 2.5 nmol/L,"" according to the policy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/international-rugby-league-transgender,2022-06-21
'It doesn't impact me': Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis reacts after attacks from CNN,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) engaged in a heated exchange with a CNN reporter that went viral on Tuesday, leading to fellow CNN journalists criticizing the governor — with one even calling him a name live on air.

But the Republican dismissed the attacks when asked about it, saying, ""It doesn't impact me.""

What are the details?

On Monday, CNN's Rosa Flores pressed DeSantis during a news conference, asking about the cause of wait lines experienced by seniors in the state seeking to receive the recently approved COVID-19 vaccines after the state prioritized citizens age 65 and over.

During a tense back-and-forth, the governor explained that hospitals were in charge of administering the vaccines rather than his office issuing directives, saying ""these people are much more competent to be able to deliver health services than a state government could ever be.""

After video of DeSantis' and Flores' exchange gained attention, CNN reporter Jim Acosta rushed to his colleague's defense, saying Flores ""does a fantastic job here insisting that the governor answer the question. It's too bad DeSantis frequently interrupts and insults Rosa. But we've seen that routine before.""

On-air Tuesday evening, a CNN anchor called DeSantis an ""ass"" for his treatment of Flores.

But Fox News' Tucker Carlson hosted DeSantis on his show the same evening, and asked the governor for his reaction to CNN's treatment of him in comparison to the kid gloves the network shows New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — a Democrat whose brother is a CNN host.

Gov. Cuomo has faced heavy criticism for his executive order sending coronavirus patients into nursing homes early on in the pandemic, receiving blame from some loved ones of elderly residents who passed away from COVID-19. But CNN has highlighted the New York Democratic on the show of his brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo.

Meanwhile, Gov. Cuomo has written a book about his leadership during the ongoing pandemic and won an Emmy Award for his communication style.

What else?

The treatment of Gov. DeSantis has been quite different.

""Do you think you'd get fair treatment from CNN if your brother had a primetime show on that channel?"" Carlson asked the Florida governor on Tuesday.

DeSantis laughed, saying, ""You know, I think it's pretty clear some of these networks, obviously, they have agendas. They're doing narratives, they're not trying to report facts anymore. It's all about spinning whatever narrative they think can get ratings, and that's just the reality of the situation.""

He added, ""It doesn't impact me. We're gonna continue keeping our eye on the ball and working as hard as we can to deliver results.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/it-doesnt-impact-me-florida-gov-ron-desantis-reacts-after-attacks-from-cnn,2021-01-06
'It's definitely awkward because Lia still has male body parts': UPenn swimmer says team members uncomfortable having Lia Thomas in the locker room,"While the controversy surrounding transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas has largely centered around the issue of fairness in women's sports, the very practical matter of locker room usage is also reportedly a problem.



The Daily Mail reported that some University of Pennsylvania swimmers are not comfortable having Thomas in the locker room.

""It's definitely awkward because Lia still has male body parts and is still attracted to women,"" a member of the swim team told the outlet.

The individual informed the outlet that although Thomas utilizes a towel sometimes to conceal, there is a fair amount of nakedness. The swimmer and other individuals have seen Thomas's private parts, according to the outlet.

The swimmer said that team members have brought the matter up to the coach in an effort to get Thomas removed from the locker room.

""Multiple swimmers have raised it, multiple different times,"" the swimmer noted. ""But we were basically told that we could not ostracize Lia by not having her in the locker room and that there's nothing we can do about it, that we basically have to roll over and accept it, or we cannot use our own locker room.""



""It's really upsetting because Lia doesn't seem to care how it makes anyone else feel,"" the swimmer said. ""The 35 of us are just supposed to accept being uncomfortable in our own space and locker room for, like, the feelings of one.""

Thomas has racked up wins while swimming against women. In one race last month Thomas finished about 38 seconds ahead of the second place finisher.

But while athletic fairness represents a key concern for critics who oppose allowing biological men to compete in sports designated for women, the issue of nudity in locker rooms also highlights another significant issue.

Correction: This story previously said that Thomas won a race by more than 38 seconds — the win was actually just under 38 seconds and the story has been corrected to note that Thomas won that race by about 38 seconds.

Jamaal Bowman accuses Supreme Court of breaching Constitution,"Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York has accused the Supreme Court of breaching the Constitution and called for impeaching the supposed law breakers and adding seats to the nine-member high court.

""The Supreme Court is brazenly violating the Constitution, so it's time to impeach those who have broken the law and expand the court,"" Bowman declared in a tweet.

Bowman is also accusing members of the Supreme Court of making decisions on the basis of their own religious beliefs.

""Instead of doing their job and upholding the Constitution and the rights of the people, SCOTUS decides cases based on their faith and their far-right extremism,"" Bowman declared in a tweet.

""We all swore an oath of office when we became congresspeople, senators, justices, and presidents. It's time we uphold our oaths of office by stopping the Supreme Court from participating in a judicial coup and attempting to expand their power,"" he declared in another post. ""SCOTUS' decisions chose to disregard the entire Constitution and the American people,"" another tweet declares.

Democrats have been up in arms about several recent Supreme Court rulings, including a decision that enables states to outlaw abortions. While pro-life advocates have celebrated the decision, many Democrats, including Bowman, have said that the ruling marked a ""dark day"" for America.

""Nothing about overturning Roe v Wade is pro-life when thousands will die due to a lack of medical care,"" Bowman has tweeted.

Last month, Elon Musk announced that he had voted for Republican Mayra Flores in a Texas special election, but Bowman responded to Musk by accusing him of backing white supremacy. Flores, who won the election and has since been sworn in as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, was born in Mexico.

""I voted for Mayra Flores – first time I ever voted Republican. Massive red wave in 2022,"" Musk tweeted.

""Elon Musk is not a leader. He's just another Republican billionaire who supports white supremacy and authoritarianism because he doesn't want his workers to unionize or to pay his fair share in taxes.

Janet Yellen gets called out after claiming proposal for IRS to get bank account data is about holding wealthy Americans accountable,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was promptly called out after defending a controversial proposal that could have the Internal Revenue Service intrusively tracking all bank accounts with transactions that annually total $600 or more.

What is the proposal?

To improve ""tax compliance"" and boost government revenue, the Treasury Department outlined a proposal in May that would allow the IRS to track bank account data for any account with withdrawals or deposits that annually total at least $600.

The proposal states:

This proposal would create a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime. Financial institutions would report data on financial accounts in an information return. The annual return will report gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown for physical cash, transactions with a foreign account, and transfers to and from another account with the same owner. This requirement would apply to all business and personal accounts from financial institutions, including bank, loan, and investment accounts, with the exception of accounts below a low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600 .

Further, the proposal would give the treasury secretary ""broad authority to issue regulations necessary to implement this proposal.""

What did Yellen say?

During an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" this week, Yellen defended the proposal, saying its purpose is to hold billionaires and wealthy Americans accountable.

""Look, the big picture is that we have a tax gap that over the next decade is estimated at $7 trillion,"" Yellen said. ""Namely, a shortfall in the amount that IRS is collecting due to a failure of individuals to report the income that they have earned.""

""But that's among billionaires,"" host Norah O'Donnell pointed out. ""Is that among people who are transferring $600?""

""No, it tends to be among high-income individuals whose income is opaque and the IRS doesn't receive information about it,"" Yellen replied. ""If you earn a paycheck, you get a W-2, the IRS knows about it. But high-income individuals with opaque sources of income that are not reported to the IRS, there's a lot of tax fraud and cheating that's going on, and all that's involved in this proposal is a few aggregate numbers about bank accounts: the amount that was received in the course of the year, the amount that went out in the course of a year.""

What was the response?



Yellen was promptly called out and accused of being dishonest.

Critics pointed out the obvious: If the proposal is about holding accountable wealthy Americans, like billionaires, why is the annual transaction threshold proposed to be a mere $600?

""Can't tell you how many billionaires got that way by withdrawing $600 at a time from a bank. Because that would take literally 1,666,666 transactions,"" Ben Shapiro questioned.

""Biden will double the size of the IRS and surveil every bank account in America... and find that billionaires are corps still have better tax lawyers than the government and can defend everything they claim. But millions of small businesses will be audited blind,"" Phil Kerpen warned.

""That's insane. You don't become a Billionaire by hiding transactions of $600 from scrutiny,"" National Review's Michael Brendan Dougherty responded.

""$600 to hold billionaires accountable. This is an insult to the intelligence of the American people,"" another person reacted.

""This is the Chinese Communist Party's police state right here in America, Biden-style,"" Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) said.

""Everyone knows this is bulls**t. They know everyone knows this is bulls**t,"" another person said.

""I'm having a hard time understanding how this holds our billionaires accountable,"" one person wondered.

""Wow, if $600 is the threshold then I know more billionaires than I realized,"" another person mocked.

If the proposal ever came to fruition, it would take effect for tax years beginning after 2022.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/janet-yellen-irs-bank-account-data,2021-10-13
"Spanish actor Javier Bardem educates leftists annoyed that he played Desi Arnaz, a Cuban: 'That’s what I do for a living — try to be people that I’m not'","Seems the woke mob has found its latest victim in the battle to stamp out anything that doesn't fit its definition of acceptable: Acclaimed Academy Award-winning actor Javier Bardem.

What's the left's problem this time?

In short, there was criticism that Bardem accepted the role of Desi Arnaz in the Aaron Sorkin biopic ""Being the Ricardos"" opposite Nicole Kidman, who plays Lucille Ball.

Bardem is from Spain, you see. And Desi Arnaz — who played Ricky Ricardo in the iconic TV series ""I Love Lucy"" — was from Cuba.

Uh oh. Seems people of color can violate cultural appropriation rules, too.

Observers ""voiced concern that Bardem isn’t Cuban like Arnaz was and said the role should go to an actor from Latin America,"" the Hollywood Reporter pointed out.

In fact, Laura Bradley — entertainment reporter for the Daily Beast — ripped Bardem's casting in her piece, ""'Being the Ricardos' Has Got Some ’Splaining to Do About Javier Bardem,"" which is subtitled, ""Aaron Sorkin’s choice to cast a Spanish actor as the Cuban legend has been controversial from the start — and Bardem’s performance does little to rebut the naysayers.""

""When I first saw that Javier Bardem had been cast as Desi Arnaz in Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, I groaned. When I heard Bardem’s 'Cuban' accent in the trailer (on the couple of words he got to speak), I had to laugh,"" Bradley wrote. ""And when I finally saw him in the movie, I felt my late abuelo’s favorite refrain rattling around deep in my soul: ¡Qué barbaridad!""

What did Bardem have to say?

52-year-old Bardem — best known for his hitman role in ""No Country for Old Men"" — had a pointed response in regard to criticism that a Latin American should have been cast instead of him.

“I’m an actor, and that’s what I do for a living: try to be people that I’m not,” Bardem told the Reporter. “What do we do with Marlon Brando playing Vito Corleone? What do we do with Margaret Thatcher played by Meryl Streep? Daniel Day-Lewis playing Lincoln? Why does this conversation happen with people with accents?""

He added to the magazine, ""You have your accent. That’s where you belong. That’s tricky. Where is that conversation with English-speaking people doing things like 'The Last Duel,' where they were supposed to be French people in the Middle Ages? That’s fine. But me, with my Spanish accent, being Cuban? What I mean is, if we want to open the can of worms, let’s open it for everyone. The role came to me, and one thing that I know for sure is that I’m going to give everything that I have.”

Bardem offered more pushback, noting to the Reporter that ""we should all start not allowing anybody to play Hamlet unless they were born in Denmark.""

To be fair, the magazine added that a day after his interview, Bardem emailed the reporter and seemed to temper his previous comments: ""I do recognize that there are many underrepresented voices and stories that need to be told, and we should collectively do better to provide access and opportunities for more American Latino stories and storytellers.""

What did observers have to say?

A couple of folks responding to the Daily Beast's tweet about Bradley's story weren't taking the criticism, either:

"" Remember when the left used to realize that acting involves, ya know, ACTING, and you don't have to actually BE the person you're portraying?"" one commenter wrote. ""I guarantee the left would sling poo at Hillary Swank for doing Boys Don't Cry if it came out in 2021.""

"Dem governor wants to criminalize lying about election results, gets slammed by constitutional expert","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) announced Friday that he wants to outlaw lying about elections.

What are the details?

Inslee announced Thursday forthcoming legislation ""that would outlaw attempts by candidates and elected officials to spread lies about free and fair elections when it has the likelihood to stoke violence.""

The announcement was made on the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots at the United States Capitol, an event Inslee cited in a statement.

""January 6 is a reminder not only of the insurrection that happened one year ago, but that there is an ongoing coup attempt by candidates and elected officials to overturn our democracy,"" Inslee said. ""They are willing to do this by provoking violence, and today I proposed we do something about that in Washington.""

The Democratic governor explained the forthcoming legislation ""would make it a gross misdemeanor for candidates and elected officials to knowingly lie about elections."" In Washington, a gross misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and up to 364 days of confinement in the county jail, the Seattle Times explained.

Inslee claimed the ""proposed law is narrowly tailored to capture only those false statements that are made for the purpose of undermining the election process or results and is further limited to lies that are likely to incite or cause lawlessness."" However, Inslee failed to address what safeguards the law would contain to prevent gross abuses of power by the state government.

Inslee reportedly believes the law would be constitutional because it would require ""knowledge that there’s potential to create violence"" by the dissemination of an alleged lie,"" the Seattle Times reported.

Would the law pass constitutional muster?

Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, a self-described ""liberal,"" explained the law that Inslee is proposing would ""be dangerously and flagrantly unconstitutional.""

Citing United States v. Alvarez — a 2012 Supreme Court case that ruled unconstitutional a federal law that criminalized lying about military awards — Turley explained the highest court in the land has already decided ""that it is unconstitutional to criminalize lies.""

Indeed, the Seattle Times also noted that ""the Washington State Supreme Court has in the past rejected efforts to ban lies by political candidates.""

Turley also debunked Inslee's assertion that his proposal would be legal via Brandenburg v. Ohio. Inslee claimed that 1969 Supreme Court case determined that ""speech can be limited where it is likely to incite lawlessness. However, Turley explained the case actually determined that ""even calling for violence is protected under the First Amendment unless there is a threat of 'imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.'""

In summary, Turley said Inslee's law ""would be ripe for abuse and would create a chilling effect that would be positively glacial.""

""Such a law would threaten political speech and create a chilling effect for those who want to raise such concerns in contested elections,"" Turley explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jay-inslee-law-lying-about-elections,2022-01-08
CNN host uses Democrat's own words to show how she is using double standard to defend Biden over classified docs,"CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota offered Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) an opportunity to be fair regarding criticism of politicians who mishandle classified documents.

But she declined to take it.

What is the background?

Last September, when the government had revealed the scope of Donald Trump's retention of classified documents, Jayapal demanded the full force of the law be used against the former president.

She even went so far as to claim that Trump ""stole"" the documents.

""Donald Trump stole classified documents,"" Jayapal said. ""He put not only our national security at risk, but the security and safety of our allies around the world. He must be held accountable to the full extent of the law.""

What did Jayapal say?

During an interview on ""CNN Newsroom,"" Camerota asked Jayapal about her tweet and whether she believes the same standard should be applied to President Joe Biden in light of classified documents being discovered in at least two areas private to him.

""Should President Biden be held to that same standard?"" the CNN anchor asked. ""Isn't it possible that President Biden is putting our national security at risk also?""

But immediately, Jayapal began to equivocate and defend Biden.

""I absolutely think that is why the Department of Justice has appointed the special counsel,"" she said.

""But again, I would just point to the fact that these documents so far that we know, what we know is that they were kept in a locked place. That was a very small number and I don't know how important these are, they might be incredibly important. They were marked top secret,"" she added. ""But the storage and the approach to this is completely different.""

Jayapal acknowledged that Biden's retention of classified documents is a ""political problem for all of us as Democrats."" But she tried to emphasize distinction between Biden's mishandling of classified information and Trump's. Biden, Jayapal claimed, is ""cooperating completely.""

However, she has no way of knowing that.

After all, the White House declined to disclose the discovery for more than two months, and when it finally admitted to the existence of classified documents inside Biden's private office, it refused to disclose the second batch of documents that had already been found at Biden's private residence.

Jean-Pierre faces ridicule after calling Russian pipeline 'Nordstrom-1',"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was mocked and ridiculed after she accidentally referred to a Russian natural gas pipeline as ""Nordstrom-1.""

Jean-Pierre made the gaffe during Tuesday's White House media briefing while discussing the controversy surrounding the Nord Stream-1 pipeline that delivers gas from Russia to some European countries.

“What we see Russia is doing, we’ve been very clear about this, is that they’re using energy, they’re weaponizing energy,” she said. “One of the things that has been out there, they shut down the pipeline of Nordstrom 1.”

Jean-Pierre apparently confused the oil pipeline with the department store, and many on social media were merciless in their reactions.

""Not sure what’s worse, that Karine Jean Pierre just called it The NORDSTROM Pipeline, or that Biden yelled at his TV, 'no dummy it’s Bloomingdales,'"" replied Fox Radio host Jimmy Failla.

""You can return stuff to the pipeline even if you wore it 3 years ago. No tag necessary,"" responded bitcoin commentator Natalie Brunell.

""In fairness, she appears to know roughly as much about it as the rest of the White House,"" said security advisor Omri Ceren.

""The pipeline through which Europe receives over-priced cardigans,"" joked another user.

""Russia is currently building Nieman-Marcus and Macy's pipelines, as we speak,"" replied one jokester.

Although the official reason for Russia cutting off natural gas from flowing through the pipeline is a malfunction in a turbine, a spokesperson for Moscow said that the suspension would continue until Western countries end their sanctions over the Ukraine war.

The suspension is likely to worsen the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. Some business owners have posted their electricity bills on social media to show that their utility costs have skyrocketed to as much as ten times as their normal bills.

""We closed our tearoom/cafe we’ve run for 7 years due to increasing costs,"" claimed one user. ""We can’t sustain the hikes and thought we would wait until the economy perked up again in the summer but obviously we will never open again.""

Some financial experts believe Europe will plunge into a recession caused at least partly by the energy crisis.

Jeff Bezos takes aim at Biden over inflation crisis and 'misdirection' of the country; wants 'disinformation board' to review Biden's claims,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos slammed President Joe Biden on Sunday over the ongoing inflation crisis and for claiming he has personally lowered the budget deficit.

What did Bezos say?

Bezos, the third-richest person in the world, took aim at Biden for contributing to the inflation crisis, which Bezos observed most impacts the ""least affluent.""

He was responding to a Twitter thread that itself criticized Biden for claiming he lowered the budget deficit.

""In fact, the administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already over-heated, inflationary economy and only Manchin saved them from themselves,"" Bezos said. ""Inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent. Misdirection doesn’t help the country.""

The comment was the second time in three days that Bezos publicly criticized the president.

On Friday, Biden implied that driving down inflation is somehow connected to raising the corporate tax rate to ensure that businesses ""pay their fair share."" However, that claim, according to Bezos, needs to be reviewed by the Department of Homeland Security's controversial new disinformation governance board, because there is no connection between corporate taxes and inflation.

""The newly created Disinformation Board should review this tweet, or maybe they need to form a new Non Sequitur Board instead,"" Bezos responded. ""Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection.""

Has Biden actually lowered the deficit?

Biden has claimed repeatedly that he lowered the deficit and has placed the U.S. on track for record deficit reduction in 2022. But the claim is highly misleading.

That is because, as CNN reporter Daniel Dale explained last week, the budget deficit was already projected to fall before Biden entered office. The deficit exploded in 2020 because of short-term pandemic-related spending. But that spending was not permanent, which meant the deficit was always going to fall.

Even more problematic for Biden, his policies meant deficit reduction was not as great in 2021 as it could have been without them. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the deficit would have fallen about a half-trillion dollars more than it actually did.

""So, when President Biden talks about a projected $1.5 trillion decline in the deficit this year, even if that does happen, the deficit would still be higher this year than initially projected when he took office,"" Dale explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jeff-bezos-criticizes-biden-inflation-crisis,2022-05-16
Disgraced former Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. admits he's not a 'religious person',"In a lengthy profile piece published by Vanity Fair this week, disgraced former Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. opened up about his remarkable fall from grace and, in doing so, acknowledged what many Christian onlookers long-suspected — that he never seriously cared for the faith his father's school so famously espoused.

""Because of my last name, people think I’m a religious person. But I’m not,"" Falwell told reporter Gabriel Sherman in a series of interviews late last year, adding, ""My goal was to make them realize I was not my dad.""

While this statement may amount to more of a repudiation of his father's fundamentalism than a wholesale rejection of Christianity, elsewhere in the profile, Falwell went into greater detail about his spiritual beliefs. In the end, the version of faith Falwell described to Vanity Fair appeared at odds with the mission and values of the university he would at one point lead.

Reportedly at a spiritual crossroads upon entering college, Falwell decided to major in religious studies to figure out what he really believed. It was during those studies, and particularly through a class on apologetics — the study of the defense of the faith — that he developed a ""rational"" belief that Jesus was literally the son of God.

But nowhere in the write-up is it suggested that Falwell's rational belief in Jesus became anything more than that, much less a personal relationship with him. Moreover, after graduation, Falwell never bothered to join a church but instead embraced a looser interpretation of the commands of scripture.

According to Sherman, ""Jerry decided believing in Christ didn’t mean he had to follow the evangelical rules.""

While it's true the Bible teaches that faith precedes moral action, it also teaches that ""every tree is known by its fruit"" (Luke 6:44). And one's obedience to scripture is certainly a marker of faith, or lack thereof.

Based on the descriptions of Falwell's faith recorded in the profile, it appears that the largest Christian university in the world was run by a man who took little interest in the Christian faith.

That news may not be so surprising given the events that led up to Falwell's ouster last year. The former president became embroiled in a series of controversies ranging from his sycophantic support for former President Donald Trump to the posting of a picture on social media of himself aboard a yacht with his pants unzipped and a drink in his hand.

A few weeks later, Falwell's downfall dramatically escalated when an alleged former business partner and pool boy, Giancarlo Granda, came forward with allegations that he engaged in regular sexual encounters with Falwell's wife, Becki, while Falwell would watch.

Falwell later admitted that his wife had an affair with Granda but denied taking any part in it. Instead, he claimed his wife's paramour was attempting to extort him and his family for money.

During that time, a former Liberty University student claimed that Becki Falwell pursued him romantically and performed oral sex on him while he stayed at the Falwell residence.

Falwell was eventually forced to resign from his post as president and wa sued by the university, which argued that he breached ""various fiduciary duties"" and summarily damaged the school's reputation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jerry-falwell-not-religious-person,2022-01-26
AG reacts to Jim Acosta claiming Virginia schools are Soviet-style,"Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares skewered CNN talking head Jim Acosta for comparing the state's new tip line for concerned parents to the police state of the former Soviet Union.

On Tuesday, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a new email tip line for parents to report any violations of students' ""fundamental rights"" and any ""divisive practices"" in schools.

""Helpeducation@governor.virginia.gov, for parents to send us any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools,"" Youngkin said, according to WJLA-TV. ""And we're asking for input right from parents, to make sure that we can go right to the source, as we continue to work to make sure Virginia's education system is on the path to re-establish excellence.""

Youngkin referenced a public school class in Fairfax County that recently had students play ""privilege bingo."" The controversial assignment had children acknowledge their privileged classes, such as those who are white, Christian, male, cis-gendered, able-bodied, have never been racially profiled, and belong to a military family.

The new ""Help Education"" tip line sparked a backlash from liberals, including singer John Legend.

""Black parents need to flood these tip lines with complaints about our history being silenced,"" Legend instructed his nearly 14 million followers on Twitter. ""We are parents too.""

Another outspoken critic of Youngkin's tip line was CNN personality Jim Acosta.

""You know, I seem to remember Glenn Youngkin campaigning in a fleece vest in Virginia,"" Acosta said on Tuesday night during a CNN special titled ""Democracy in Peril."" ""He was running as a different kind of Republican. I was told there was going to be a vest, not a Soviet-style police state across the Potomac from Washington.""

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares fired back at the comparison of the Virginia government to a Soviet-style police state.



""I think what Jim Acosta said — listen, my family fled Communist Cuba. You want to talk about what 'Soviet-style' looks like? It's the opposite of freedom,"" Miyares said during a Wednesday appearance on ""Hannity.""

""My mother has distinct memories of being forced to take classes in Marxist-Leninism,"" the Cuban-American AG explained.

He noted that his uncle was arrested in the middle of the night by now-deceased Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's secret police then detained without due process. Miyares said his family's home was ""nationalized: in the name of fairness and equity.""

""So clearly, Jim Acosta maybe needs to take some history classes of what Soviet-style communism actually looks like. And [Virginia is] the opposite,"" Miyares proclaimed.

Miyares said parents under Youngkin's governance have the option of masking their children or not.

""What we have said is parents matter. Listen, if you're a parent and you want to mask your child for six, seven, eight hours a day, you absolutely have that right. That's your individual decision,"" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""The great irony of all this, is in Soviet-style communist states like Cuba, the state diminishes parents. They say, ‘Your loyalty is to the state,’ and parents have less control. This is about parental empowerment.""



In a Fairfax County Times article from October, Miyares explained how his mother fled from Castro's Cuba in 1965.

""My mother escaped Communist Cuba when she was only 19 years old, legally immigrated to the United States homeless and without a penny to her name,"" Miyares noted. ""While in Cuba, her brother, my uncle, suffered the humiliation of a mock execution for being an anti-communist and she saw her house and every other personal artifact become the property of the Cuban Government.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-acosta-jason-miyares-soviet-schools,2022-01-27
"J.K. Rowling exposes hypocritical intolerance of trans activists who threatened her with rape, death, pipebomb","Author J.K. Rowling exposed Monday the absurdity of some activists who demand tolerance for LGBT people, yet invoke intolerance for those, like Rowling, who disagree with some aspects of LGBT ideology.

What are the details?

According to the ""Harry Potter"" author, trans activists have targeted Rowling with threats of rape and death. One activist angered by Rowling's refusal to acquiesce to the radical trans activism even appeared to threaten Rowling with a pipe bomb.

Rowling posted a screenshot of a tweet from the now-deleted Twitter account ""@queerqegaard"" that said, ""I wish you a very nice pipebomb in mailbox."" In response, Rowling highlighted the hypocritical intolerance of radical LGBT activists who demand no dissent to their ideology.

""To be fair, when you can't get a woman sacked, arrested or dropped by her publisher, and cancelling her only made her book sales go up, there's really only one place to go,"" Rowling said.

In response to a question of whether the threat was sent because of her position on trans women using women's bathrooms, Rowling explained, ""Yes but now hundreds of trans activists have threatened to beat, rape, assassinate and bomb me I've realised that this movement poses no risk to women whatsoever.""

What is the background?

Rowling is no stranger to harassment by LGBT activists online.

The billionaire author became the target of backlash when she publicly supported a woman who was fired for declaring that biological sex is, in fact, real.

""Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who'll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?"" Rowling tweeted in December 2019.

Rowling again affirmed biological gender last year, resulting in attempts to ""cancel"" her.

If sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction. If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn't hate to speak the truth. The idea that women like me, who've been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they're vulnerable in the same way as women — ie, to male violence — ""hate"" trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences — is a nonsense.



I respect every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them. I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans. At the same time, my life has been shaped by being female. I do not believe it's hateful to say so.

Rowling has also spoken out against hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-intolerant-trans-activists-threatened-rape-death-pipebomb,2021-07-20
Joe Biden tries to mock Sarah Palin while signing bill. But his attempt failed miserably.,"President Joe Biden attempted Monday to bash former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin by mocking comments he thought she once made. But his attempt went over like a lead balloon.

What did Biden say?

While signing into law the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, Biden touted his experience implementing bills with ""speed,"" ""discipline,"" and minimal waste, citing the 2009 Recovery Act.

""I'm proud to say that when we finished implementing that Recovery Act, it was determined that there had been less than two-tenths of 1% waste, fraud, or abuse,"" Biden said. ""And it was how I learned and earned the nickname 'Sheriff Joe' from President Obama. Because I made it a point, every single day for well over a year, to stay on top of how the money was being used.""

Biden said he managed to ensure minimal waste by routinely speaking with mayors, county executives, and every state governor — ""save one,"" he added, then clearly invoking Palin.

""I won't mention that 'save one,'"" Biden continued after laughing, ""She could see Alaska from her porch.""

What is the problem?

There are two significant problems with Biden's attempt to mock Palin. First, Biden incorrectly restated the infamous quote. Second, Palin is not even the person who said it.

The quote that Biden was attempting to resurrect from his memory is, ""I can see Russia from my house.""

However, Palin is not responsible for the quote. In fact, actress Tina Fey is responsible for those words, which she used to mock Palin during an episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" that aired in September 2008 in the weeks preceding the 2008 presidential election.

Sarah Palin and Hillary Address the Nation - SNL www.youtube.com

To be fair, Palin is responsible for an infamous remark involving Russia and Alaska.

While attempting to boost her presidential acumen, Palin claimed that living in proximity to Russia bolstered her foreign policy understanding.

""They're our next-door neighbors, and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska,"" Palin remarked in September 2008.

At the time, the statement did incite mockery, hence the ""Saturday Night Live"" punchline.

Palin later doubled down on the remark, later telling then-CBS News anchor Katie Couric that by leading a state whose neighbors are two countries — Russia and Canada — she had the foreign policy understanding to serve as vice president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-mocks-sarah-palin-fails-miserably,2021-11-16
"Joe Biden may owe up to $500,000 in back taxes, according to government report","President Joe Biden may owe up to $500,000 in back taxes, according to the analysis of a new nonpartisan government report. A Republican Congressman claims that President Biden improperly avoided paying Medicare taxes before he took office.

At the request of Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), the Congressional Research Service furnished a report analyzing ""cases in which the IRS won a judgment against taxpayers who paid themselves suspiciously low salaries from S corporations and counted most of the revenue as 'distributions' exempt from the Medicare tax,"" according to the New York Post.

""Banks said the report shows Biden improperly used 'S corporations' to avoid paying Medicare tax on speaking fees and book sales in 2017 and 2018,"" the Post reported.

The tax loophole allows self-employed people to set up an S corporation in order to avoid payroll taxes – including Social Security and Medicare taxes.

President Biden and first lady Jill Biden purportedly raked in more than $13 million through book sales and speaking fees in 2017 and 2018, but counted less than $800,000 of the income as salary eligible for the Medicare tax — exempting the rest from being taxed 3.8% for Medicare.

A Wall Street Journal report from 2019 titled ""Joe Biden Used Tax-Code Loophole Obama Tried to Plug"" stated, ""Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, routed their book and speech income through S corporations, according to tax returns the couple released this week. They paid income taxes on those profits, but the strategy let the couple avoid the 3.8% self-employment tax they would have paid had they been compensated directly instead of through the S corporations.""



Rep. Banks, who is chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, said, ""Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $2.1 trillion while claiming the rich need to pay their 'fair share.' But in 2017, multimillionaire Joe Biden skirted his payroll taxes — the very taxes that fund Medicare and ObamaCare.""

""According to the criteria CRS provided to my office, he owes the IRS and the American people hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes,"" Banks said. ""Every American should know about Joe Biden's tax hypocrisy.""

Biden has branded himself ""Middle Class Joe"" and has frequently demanded that wealthy Americans ""pay their fair share."" On Wednesday, Biden wrote on Twitter, ""I'm sick and tired of the super-wealthy and giant corporations not paying their fair share in taxes. It's time for it to change.""

The CRS report, which doesn't name Biden specifically, cites examples of individuals using the S corporation loophole to skirt employment taxes.

""Courts have agreed with the IRS that shareholder-employees are subject to employment taxes when shareholders take distributions, dividends, or other forms of compensation in lieu of reasonable compensation,"" the report states.



When questioned about the practice in 2020, the Biden campaign said, ""The salaries earned by the Bidens are reasonable and were determined in good faith.""

The report from the CRS, which operates within the Library of Congress, notes that presidential tax returns are subject to automatic audit only for years when a president is in office.

In May when the Bidens released their tax returns to the public, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden's S corporation will ""remain dormant.""



""Well, I will say first that he received no income from a CelticCapri in 2020, which is the S-corp and it's dormant and it will not be engaging in any business other than to receive potential royalties, which would relate to books he has already written and of course, as you know, you only know about this because the President released his tax returns, which has long been history — historic precedent even if it wasn't over the last several years. In terms of additional tax reform proposals, I don't have any to announce for you today,"" Psaki told reporters. ""I would note that the President paid a higher rate than most high income individuals and most corporations around the country.""



Since the S corporations are dormant, the IRS does not automatically review their use.

When questioned about the S corporations in 2019, the Biden campaign said, ""As demonstrated by their effective federal tax rate in 2017 and 2018 — which exceeded 33% —the Bidens are committed to ensuring that all Americans pay their fair share.""

""There's no reason for these to be in an S corp — none, other than to save on self-employment tax,"" Tony Nitti, an accountant at RubinBrown LLP who reviewed the returns, told MarketWatch.



High-profile politicians have been previously scrutinized for using the technique often referred to as the ""Gingrich-Edwards tax loophole,"" named for former presidential candidates Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and John Edwards, a Democrat.



Former President Barack Obama attempted to put an end to the controversial tax loophole in his 2015 budget.

In 2005, the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration said, ""The S corporation form of ownership has become a multibillion dollar employment tax shelter for single-owner businesses.""

Joe Manchin is open to supporting Biden's SCOTUS nominee regardless of philosophical beliefs,"On Thursday, Joe Manchin — the controversial moderate Democratic Senator from West Virginia — indicated that he is open to supporting President Biden’s upcoming Supreme Court nominee regardless of the nominee's “philosophical beliefs.”

While on the air with the West Virginia MetroNews’ radio show “Talkline,” Senator Manchin — who voted to confirm two of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominees — said that “you look at the qualifications and if the person’s competent enough to do the job.”

Manchin said that his difference in worldview from Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett was not reason enough for him to oppose their confirmation to the Supreme Court. Manchin stated that he did not vote to approve Coney Barret because “it was just hypocritical to put her up one week before [the 2020 general election] after they held up Merrick Garland for a year.”

Noting that the Supreme Court confirmation process has grown increasingly partisan and bitter in recent years, Manchin said that “if we are going to have a rule, then have a rule of civility.”

The host of ""Talkline,"" Hoppy Kercheval, noted to Senator Manchin that whomever the Biden administration nominates to fill Justice Breyer’s vacancy will be “to the left” of the West Virginia senator, to which Manchin replied, “What you want is someone, forget the philosophical beliefs they may have, it’s basically how they have dispensed justice, their record, have they been outspoken, have they been fair – things of that sort.”

“Whoever [Biden] puts up will have experience, and we’ll be able to judge them off of that,” Manchin continued, “But, as far as just the philosophical beliefs, no, that will not prohibit me from supporting somebody.”

Whereas Senator Manchin is concerned with the professional capabilities of President Biden’s nominee, those to his left are primarily concerned with the race and gender of whoever is elevated to the bench. In 2020, while running for President, Biden pledged to nominate a black woman should an opening on the Supreme Court arise during a Biden presidency.

Progressive Democrats took to social media to remind the president of what he promised while working to secure the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination during the 2020 primary.





White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the President’s commitment to nominating a black woman to the Supreme Court.



Despite the likelihood that Joe Biden will nominate a left-wing activist to the bench, should his nominee be affirmed, it is extremely unlikely that the new justice would shift the Supreme Court's ideological leanings.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-manchin-is-open-to-supporting-biden-s-scotus-nominee-regardless-of-philosophical-beliefs,2022-01-28
Joe Rogan said transgender swimmer Lia Thomas competing is an assault on women's sports,"Joe Rogan has weighed in on the Lia Thomas controversy, and claims that the NCAA transgender swimmer competing and dominating is an ""assault on women's sports.""



In Thursday's episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" the prolific podcaster provided his two cents on how Thomas being the best ""women's swimmer"" is actually ""terrible"" for the transgender movement.



""What it is now is not good. What it is now is assault on women's sports, and the idea that anybody would think it's fair that someone who was number 462 as a man, 462 in the nation is number one as a woman a year later, and that's fair,"" said Rogan.

Thomas – a biological male – is a fifth-year senior who swam for three years on the men's team before transitioning to female. Thomas skyrocketed from being ranked the 462nd-best male college swimmer to the No. 1-ranked female collegiate swimmer.

Fellow comedian and guest Yannis Pappas joked, ""You don't think maybe it was her passion for swimming that got her to number one? Or changing diet?""

Rogan replied, ""Could be, maybe just becoming her true self.""

""But that might be the woke straw that breaks society's camel's back. Women are so frustrated, or parents,"" Rogan continued. ""If your daughter is competing, and they're competing against a trans woman, it's not fair. It's just not fair. No matter what anybody says.""

Rogan declared, ""There’s this nonsense idea of like, well, there's outliers — there's outliers and then there's biological males, right? That's beyond outliers.""

Rogan noted that sports is where people draw a line as to what is acceptable or not, especially when biological males can easily outperform females because of advantages provided by nature.



""Well, it's interesting because in all other aspects of society, it's pretty much a given that, you know, a person can become trans and change their name and we're all pretty accepting of it,"" the Spotify star stated. ""Where people have the most pushback is in sports, athletic competition. That's where the real pushback is, right? Where people like 'Hey, f*** right. This is not fair.' This is clearly not fair, is a reason why we have a distinction between men and women's sports.""

Pappas pointed out that typically liberals are vehement supporters of equality, equity, and ensuring a level playing – except when it comes to transgender athletes competing in sports.

""And it's ironic because the people on that side usually always champion equality and nobody having an advantage and you know, the people who are maybe disenfranchised or less capable should have an equal opportunity and by throwing someone like Lia Thomas in there, you're kind of — that's the opposite of that,"" Pappas noted.

Rogan warned that transgender athletes obliterating females in competition may have unintended consequences in advancing the trans movement.

""I think it's also probably terrible for the whole trans movement, because it makes people more cynical about what the positive aspects of it are, and it makes people more, you know, less likely to accept it, because they think of, now they think of trans people and trans rights, and they connect it to this athletic thing,"" the comedian/veteran UFC color commentator. ""It's probably making people more distrustful or more upset and less accepting.""

In January, Rogan appeared on ""The Tim Dillon Show,"" where he said, ""The swimmer that's like lapping all these biological women, that’s f***ed because they don’t have a choice they have to compete.”

Last week, House Republicans introduced a resolution declaring Emma Weyant the ""rightful winner"" of the 500-yard freestyle event at the NCAA Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships over Thomas.

Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantissigned a proclamation that declared Weyant the ""real winner"" of the NCAA Women's 500-yard freestyle swim competition instead of Thomas from the University of Pennsylvania.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-rogan-lia-thomas-transgender,2022-04-03
"Anti-woke comedian John Cleese blasts 'deception, dishonesty and tone' of interview, says he was painted as 'old-fashioned, uncaring and basically harmful'","Legendary comedian John Cleese blasted the ""deception, dishonesty and tone"" of a recent BBC Asia interview that he said focused on cancel culture and the Dave Chappelle controversy rather than on the agreed-upon topic — his upcoming ""Why There Is No Hope"" tour in Singapore and Bangkok, the Daily Mail reported.

The 82-year-old Monty Python alum also said the interviewer — whom he identified only as ""Karishma"" — tried to portray him as ""old-fashioned, uncaring and basically harmful,"" the outlet said.

In response, Cleese said he ended the interview early and would be making a formal complaint to the BBC — which subsequently defended the interviewer, the Daily Mail added.

What are the details?

Cleese took to Twitter on Wednesday, outlining in multiple posts what took place from his perspective. Cleese said when he was asked about cancel culture rather than about his upcoming shows, he ""replied courteously and in full"" and noted that overprotective parents don't ""prepare children well"" for the ""real and often not-very-nice world.""

He said the interviewer followed with a ""disjointed question, clearly trying to portray me as old-fashioned, uncaring and basically harmful."" After answering one aspect of her question by pointed out that many therapists who help young people with anxiety and depression do not adhere to ""woke principles,"" Cleese said the interviewer ignored his answer, then went on to question why he was coming to Asia amid the pandemic, ""apparently blaming me for making the situation worse!""

Then once she asked Cleese about the Dave Chappelle controversy, Cleese said he took off his headphones and ended the interview.

""The media will no doubt report that I 'stormed out.' I didn't. Nor did I lose my temper. But I was depressed that this kind of presenter-ego crap is so prevalent now,"" the comedian added in a final tweet.

Chappelle has been attacked as transphobic over the last few months over some jokes he told in his comedy special ""The Closer,"" and leftists far and wide have been savaging him and pushing for his cancellation ever since.

As it happens, Cleese's fellow Python alum Terry Gilliam has been dealing with fallout after recommending that his Facebook followers watch ""The Closer."" In fact, a small group of staffers at London's famous venue the Old Vic reportedly influenced their bosses to cancel an upcoming musical Gilliam is co-directing due to his support of Chappelle.

What did the BBC have to say?

The BBC responded to Cleese's claims by saying the interview was ""fair and appropriate"" and that it ""touched on topics that John Cleese has previously been vocal about as well as themes within his new tour. Our presenter is an excellent and experienced journalist who conducted the interview entirely within our editorial guidelines,"" Metro.co.uk reported.

What else has Cleese been up to?

Last month Cleese canceled himself from an upcoming speaking gig at Cambridge University after he caught wind that an art historian was canceled there over an impersonation of Adolf Hitler that reportedly offended students.

""I was looking forward to talking to students at the Cambridge Union this Friday, but I hear that someone there has been blacklisted for doing an impersonation of Hitler,"" Cleese wrote on Twitter. ""I regret that I did the same on a Monty Python show, so I am blacklisting myself before someone else does.""

He added, ""I apologise to anyone at Cambridge who was hoping to talk with me, but perhaps some of you can find a venue where woke rules do not apply.""

Over the summer Cleese highlighted a documentary series called ""Cancel Me,"" in which the comedian questions why the new woke generation is trying to censor everyone, even for harmless jokes.

And last year Cleese ripped keyboard leftists and refused to bow to them in the wake of their ""transphobia"" accusations after he signed a letter of solidarity with author J.K. Rowling, who herself has come under fire for statements challenging transgenderism.

""I hope they fry in their own sanctimoniousness and narcissistic posturing,"" Cleese said of the woke mob. ""Until they get a sense of perspective, that is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-cleese-blasts-deception-bbc-interview,2021-12-17
Biden judicial nominee dodges same question 9 times when grilled about social justice-inspired crimes: 'That was embarrassing',"Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) was forced to ask one of President Joe Biden’s judicial nominees the same question nine times this week to elicit a response — but the question still was ultimately dodged.

What happened?

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday on the nomination of Anne Traum to become a U.S. District Judge for the District of Nevada, Kennedy asked Traum for her legal view of certain crimes related to social justice.

""Do you think we should forgive criminal misbehavior in the name of social justice?"" Kennedy asked.

But Traum, a law professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, was not interested in offering a direct response.

""Senator, thank you for that question. I recognize that all issues of crime and all responses to crime are fundamentally policy issues,"" Traum responded. ""So, those are important issues, they are important for our community and our nation, but I leave those policy issues to the policymakers. If confirmed as a judge I would not be a policy maker.""

""I’m not asking your opinion as a judge,"" Kennedy interrupted. ""I’m asking your opinion as a person, as a law professor. I’ll stipulate, with all of you, that you’re all going to be fair and unbiased. Now, do you think misbehavior and illegal acts should be forgiven in the name of social justice?""

When Traum began offering the same response, Kennedy cut her off again, and re-asked his question.

""Senator, that is not a view that I have taken in my work,"" Traum finally admitted.

""That’s no?"" Kennedy said. ""Is your answer 'no?'""

Traum did not answer that question directly, only stating that she has not ""taken that view"" in her work. But Kennedy pressed further.

""I'm asking, professor, what you believe. I think this is really straightforward. Do you believe that an illegal act should be forgiven in the name of social justice,"" Kennedy said. ""It’s pretty simple.""

Kennedy questions Anne Traum in Judiciary www.youtube.com

The grandstanding, however, continued. Kennedy asked his question several more times while Traum offered up several versions of the same response: that she cannot speak generally and that she is not a policymaker.

""Do you not have an opinion?"" Kennedy finally asked. Traum responded that she does ""not have a view point to share.""

""I can tell you don't want to share. I got that part,"" Kennedy responded. ""I don't understand why you don't want to answer my question. If confirmed you’re going to be a federal judge. And I join my good friend, Sen. [Dick] Durbin, in saying judicial temperament is important. But I think being unbiased is even more important, and I find it incredible that you won’t answer my question.""

Kennedy asked his question two additional times, but Traum refused to provide a direct answer. He then jokingly asked Traum about her favorite color — a question that she answered — before declaring that he will not vote for her nomination.

""I can’t vote for you, not if you’re not going to answer the questions,"" Kennedy said. ""I mean that was embarrassing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-kennedy-anne-traum-same-question,2021-12-18
WH press secretary gets twisted into knots when ABC anchor confronts her over 'Orwellian' narrative on inflation bill,"ABC News anchor Jonathan Karl confronted White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Sunday over the ""Orwellian"" narrative the Biden administration pushed on the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.

What is the background?

Despite its name, multiple nonpartisan analyses have determined the inflationary impact of the Inflation Reduction Act will be negligible at best.

For example, the Penn Wharton Budget Model explains the bill ""would have no meaningful effect on inflation in the near term but would reduce inflation by around 0.1 percentage points by the middle of the first decade. These point estimates, however, are not statistically different from zero, indicating a low level of confidence that the legislation would have any measurable impact on inflation.""

Even more important, the CBO reached the same conclusion.

""In calendar year 2022, enacting the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation, in CBO’s assessment. In calendar year 2023, inflation would probably be between 0.1 percentage point lower and 0.1 percentage point higher under the bill than it would be under current law, CBO estimates,"" CBO Director Phillip Swagel explained in a letter.

What happened with Jean-Pierre?

During an interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Jean-Pierre was forced to explain the contradiction between the analyses and the White House's messaging.

""Let me ask you: It's called the Inflation Reduction Act, but the Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, said that there would be a negligible impact on inflation this year and barely impact inflation at all next year. I mean, isn't it almost Orwellian?"" Karl asked.



""How can you call it Inflation Reduction Act when the nonpartisan experts say it’s not going to bring inflation down?"" he pressed.

The question caused Jean-Pierre to stumble, and in her rebuttal, she failed to address the CBO's report.

""We've actually addressed this, the CBO. It was the top-line number. There's more in there that shows that it will have the money from —"" Jean-Pierre responded before pivoting to a different aspect of the bill.

""Remember how we're doing this, too,"" she continued. ""It's making sure that billionaires in corporate America are paying their fair share, making sure that it’s — that the tax code is a little bit more fair, and so when you do that, when you put it in its totality, you will see that it will — it will bring down — lower the deficit, which will help fight inflation.""

We do not interfere, get briefed: White House press secretary on FBI Mar-a-Lago raid | ABC News youtu.be

Still, without directly addressing the CBO's analysis, Jean-Pierre claimed the bill will most definitely ""fight inflation"" because some politicians have said so.

""So you disagree with the assessment of the CBO?"" Karl pushed back.

In the end, Jean-Pierre blamed Republicans for pushing a ""false"" argument, and she again claimed, without evidence, that it has been ""proven"" that the bill will ""fight inflation.""

""Well, there’s more to it,"" she told Karl. ""It’s just — it was — the way that Republicans did that was so that it could make an argument that is false. It is going to fight inflation. It has been proven, it has been said by economists across the board on the Republican side and on the Democrat (sic) side.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jonathan-karl-orwellian-inflation-reduction-act,2022-08-15
Jordan Peterson tears up after Olivia Wilde mocks him as hero of 'incel community': 'I thought the marginalized were supposed to have a voice',"Canadian psychologist and best-selling author Jordan Peterson became emotional in an interview when asked to respond to Hollywood director Olivia Wilde using him as the inspiration for the villain in her new film.

Peterson was being interviewed by Piers Morgan on Wednesday on the Fox Nation show ""Piers Morgan Uncensored"" when he was asked about comments Wilde made earlier this month while promoting her film ""Don't Worry Darling.""

Wilde said that a sinister character played by Chris Pine was based on the popular and controversial psychologist.

“We based that character on this insane man, Jordan Peterson, who is this pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community,” Wilde told Interview Magazine.

""They’re basically disenfranchised, mostly white men, who believe they are entitled to sex from women,"" she continued. ""And they believe that society has now robbed them—that the idea of feminism is working against nature, and that we must be put back into the correct place.""

""Jordan Peterson is someone that legitimizes certain aspects of their movement because he’s a former professor, he’s an author, he wears a suit, so they feel like this is a real philosophy that should be taken seriously,"" she added.

Morgan asked the ""12 Rules for Life"" author to respond to Wilde's comments, and he began to tear up.

“Is that you? Are you the intellectual hero to these people?” Morgan asked.

“Sure. Why not?” Peterson replied, voice cracking. “You know, people have been after me for a long time because I’ve been speaking to disaffected young men. You know, what a terrible thing to do, that is.”

“I thought the marginalized were supposed to have a voice?” Peterson asked.

""It's making you emotional to talk about,"" Morgan observed.

""Well, God!"" Peterson exclaimed. “It’s very difficult to understand how demoralized people are, and certainly many young men are in that category.

""You get these casual insults, these incels — what do they mean? Is it like, well, these men, they don’t know how to make themselves attractive to women who are very picky, and good for them. Women, like, be picky. That’s your gift, man. Demand high standards from your men. Fair enough. But all these men who are alienated, it’s like they’re lonesome and they don’t know what to do, and everyone piles abuse on them,” he said.

Peterson went on to brush off Wilde's specific critique as ""low-level,"" observing that Marvel Comics had already ""painted"" him as the Red Skull, a ""magical super-Nazi.""

""That was kind of the end of the insult. There's no place past that,"" he said. He said her comments didn't bother him and that he thought her movie looked interesting.

But Morgan was interested in why Peterson got emotional.

“I mean, you’ve been so controlled today, and yet in that brief moment, you got very emotional. Why?” he asked.

Tearing up again, Peterson said, ""It’s really something to see — constantly how many people are dying for lack of an encouraging word.""

""And how easy it is to provide that. If you’re careful, you know, give credit where credit is due and to say you’re a net force for good if you wanna be,” he added.

“Do you believe you’re a net force for good?” Morgan followed up.

“Net? Yes. In all the details? Probably not. You know, no one’s perfect. So, people make their mistakes as they stumble uphill,” Peterson answered.

"MSNBC's Joy Reid goes on racist rant, attacks 'white, so-called Christian conservatives' — and rips GOP, Fox News, and GETTR, 'which kind of sounds like porn'","It would be tempting to announce that MSNBC's Joy Reid was in ""rare form"" after one of her infamous monologue rants, but the host recently played her radical extremist hand in front of the camera — and has on numerous occasions — so we'll just go with ""she's at it again.""

What did she say this time?

Reid — no stranger to racist attacks against white people — added to her dubious skin-color commentary catalog Monday by attacking ""white, so-called Christian conservatives who feel like this country was built by them, for them, and so everyone but them needs to suck it up and let them have their way, or else.""

The host said the aforementioned group consists of ""special citizens"" who declare things like, ""I don’t want to wear a mask, and if you try to make me, I’ll attack the low-waged clerks at the store or at the Burger King. And I don’t wanna to get the vaccine, either. People get sick from me? Oh well, not my problem. Joe Rogan said it was fine. My kids aren’t going to mask up to protect those other kids. F those other kids; their parents are probably commies anyway.""

Reid added that the Republican Party — the political home to those ""white, so-called Christian conservatives"" — has ""gone from pretending to be the party of personal responsibility to unmasking themselves as the party of selfish people who cannot play well with others.""

And as an image of Fox News' Tucker Carlson flashed upon the screen, Reid noted that Republicans even have ""their own cable networks — plus something called GETTR, which kind of sounds like porn.""

Joy Reid on “What it means to be an American Citizen” youtu.be

Anything else?

Prior to her racist rant, Reid presented her argument against ""special citizens"" who ""must always win and be appeased in order for things to be, quote, fair."" Which oddly sounds like the end goal of the mostly peaceful riots from the summer of 2020.

Reid also said ""special citizens"" complain about school history lessons — presumably critical race theory — because they cause ""uncomfortable"" emotions: ""My special citizenship means that all history has to make me happy all the time."" Yeah, OK.

Still speaking in the voice of a ""special citizen,"" Reid said ""books that make me uncomfortable should be banned or burned."" Uh-huh.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-reid-racist-rant-attacks-white-so-called-christian-conservatives,2022-01-04
"Joy Reid admits she was vaccine 'hesitant' under Trump because former president was 'controlling,' 'manipulating' CDC and FDA","It's a good week to be Joy Reid.

Sitting upon her posh MSNBC pedestal, the host of ""The Reid Out"" took COVID-19 potshots at rapper Nicki Minaj one day and the entire Republican Party on another — and as a result Reid's name has been all over social media.

It's commentary and part of what she does and completely fair game — but when unsubstantiated stuff is baked into her rapid-fire delivery, it needs to be noted at the very least.

Such as Reid's wild rant saying Republicans ""love COVID so much"" they ""want it to spread into schools, at the office, in the Walmart, on the cruise ships, and at the club"" — and even ""want it pumping through [their] veins with an ivermectin chaser.""

Or Reid's unprovable accusation that Minaj, by expressing her vaccine hesitancy on Twitter, ""put people in the position of dying"" of the virus.

The hits just keep on coming

But viral social media hits are at stake here, folks — and Reid smelled the blood in the water and kept going for the jugular on Thursday.

Speaking to author and professor Michael Eric Dyson about Minaj's vaccine hesitancy — and general hesitancy in the black community — Reid revisited her own reluctance to get a COVID-19 vaccine not long ago.

""I was hesitant,"" Reid told Dyson. ""When [former President] Donald Trump was out there controlling the CDC and controlling the FDA and manipulating them and making them put out falsehoods, anybody rational was hesitant.""



But now with President Joe Biden in office, Reid is just fine with the vaccines and added to Dyson that ""the reality is now, what I really fear is ... more masses of people dying ... and disproportionally they look like you and me, Michael. And what scares me is that people are creating a cultural imperative to set themselves up for death when the people pushing them to do it like Tuckums [i.e. Fox News' Tucker Carlson] are vaccinated and safe — and even if they got COVID are gonna get all the monoclonal antibodies. They could give a damn if Nicki Minaj gets COVID and dies. They don't give a damn about us.""

How did folks react to Reid's claims?

Quite a few observers were only too happy to point out Reid's partisan-fueled vaccine hesitancy when Trump was in office. Here's the start of a Twitter thread containing a jaw-dropping number of examples of Reid's crusade under Trump:

And while the following tweet is noted in the above thread, it deserves a spotlight, since Reid actually declared vaccine hesitancy even if Biden were elected:

Judge denies Ghislaine Maxwell bid for mistrial over juror failure to disclose he is a victim of sexual assault,"A federal judge on Friday rejected a bid by Ghislaine Maxwell to toss out her conviction on sex trafficking charges over the failure of a juror to disclose that he was a victim of sexual assault.

The juror admitted that he had failed to disclose the information on a jury questionnaire form, but he said that it was accidental and that he had been distracted when he filled it out.

Maxwell, a British socialite, was convicted in December for sex trafficking a 14-year-old girl during her time as a close confidante to disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. He was found dead in a Manhattan jail cell in Aug. 2019 while awaiting trial for the same crimes.

The judge interviewed the juror last month and said that he found him to be responsive and forthright and believed that his experience with being a victim of sexual abuse did not interfere with his duty to be a fair and impartial juror.

The jury deliberated for about 40 hours before handing down a guilty verdict for Maxwell on one count of sex trafficking a minor, three counts of conspiracy, and one count of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.

Prosecutors alleged that Maxwell had helped Epstein to lure young girls into sexual relationships with him. Four women testified that they had been sexually assaulted by Epstein through the facilitation of Maxwell.

Prior to Epstein's suicide, prosecutors were getting closer to publicly releasing a trove of documents that would reveal many of the wealthy and famous celebrities who were involved in child trafficking.

Maxwell could face up to 65 years in prison when she is scheduled to be sentenced in June.

"Judge throws out teen rape conviction, says time served prior to sentencing is 'plenty of punishment'","A judge in Illinois is under fire for abruptly overturning an 18-year-old defendant's sexual assault conviction, allowing him to walk free without further punishment or stain on his criminal record.

Adams County Judge Robert Adrian has been reassigned to small claims following his stunning ruling, which the victim's father claims made his daughter ""feel like she spoke up for nothing.""

What happened?

Adrian found Drew Clinton, 18, guilty of one count of criminal sexual assault following a bench trial in October. The defendant had held a pillow over an unconscious 16-year-old girl's face while he raped her at a graduation party in May.

Under state law, he was destined to receive a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison for his crime. But in a shocking turn of events during sentencing last week, the judge announced that he was changing the verdict and sparing the teen any more jail time.

“Mr. Clinton has served almost five months in the county jail, 148 days,” said Adrian, according to the court transcript viewed by local news outlet, the Herald-Whig. “For what happened in this case, that is plenty of punishment. That would be a just sentence.”

“There is no way, for what happened in this case, that this teenager should go to the Department of Corrections. I will not do that,” he also said.

In reversing his verdict, the judge claimed that the prosecution failed to adequately prove their case. He also noted that Clinton had only turned 18 two weeks before and had no prior criminal record.

Judge's Reversal Of Teen's Sexual Assault Conviction Sparks Outrage www.youtube.com

What has been the reaction?

Adrian considered his new ruling fair and just. But to the victim and her family, it felt like anything but justice.

Identifying herself in an interview with WGEM-TV following the judge's reversal, the victim, 16-year-old Cameron Vaughan, said when she heard the ruling, she immediately left the courtroom in tears.

""It made me seem like I fought for nothing and that I put my word out there for no reason,"" she said.

Her father, Scott Vaughn, said, ""It’s worse now than it was [before], because not only does she not have her justice, but now she feels like she spoke up for nothing, and you know that hurts. Now she wishes she wouldn’t have even said anything.”

The father added in an interview with the Independent that ""in 15 minutes,"" the judge destroyed all of his daughter's healing.

What else?

During sentencing, Adrian seemed to pin much of the blame for the incident on the parents involved who, he said, were negligent in allowing underaged children to party with alcohol and swim in a pool in their underwear.

“They allowed 16-year-olds to bring liquor to a party. They provided liquor to underage people, and you wonder how these things happen. Well, that’s how these things happen,” the judge said in court.

But the Vaughn family was outraged at his comments and maintained that the only person ultimately responsible for sexual assault that night was Drew Clinton.

“I woke up at my friend’s place with a pillow over my face so I couldn’t be heard and Drew Clinton inside of me,” Cameron Vaughn said. “I asked him to stop multiple times and he wouldn’t. I finally got off the couch and pushed him off of me and he jumped up and just started playing video games as if nothing had happened.”

Clinton's attorney, Drew Schnack, however, has maintained his client's innocence. He argued that consent was offered the night of the incident and that the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof in the case.

“The only evidence of what went on in that room for that three- or four-hour period of time was the girl saying couldn’t remember or didn’t know, and [Clinton] who was interviewed by the police when they first picked him up and gave a long, long statement and who testified in court,” Schnack said, according to the Herald-Whig. “His statement has never changed.”

Judge vacates murder conviction of ‘Serial’ subject Adnan Syed after 23 years in prison,"On Monday, Adnan Syed was freed after having spent 23 years fighting his conviction on charges that he murdered his former high school girlfriend.

Syed’s case was chronicled in the first season of the hit podcast “Serial.”

Judge Melissa M. Phinn of Baltimore City Circuit Court vacated the conviction “in the interests of justice and fairness,” reports the New York Times . The judge found that prosecutors had failed to turn over evidence that could have helped Syed at trial.

Syed was 17 when he was charged with murdering his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a park outside of Baltimore. Authorities suspected that Syed, upset with Lee breaking up with him, struggled with Lee in a car before killing her.

The “Serial” podcast became a national sensation in 2014 when, over the course of 12 episodes, it detailed the case against Syed. The podcast highlighted the strange events surrounding Syed’s lawyer, who was disbarred in 2001 and died in 2004.

Prosecutors said that they have been conducting an investigation along with Syed’s lawyer and have identified two possible “alternative suspects” in Lee’s murder. Those suspects have not been named publicly or charged, according to the New York Times. The investigation also identified “significant reliability issues regarding the most critical pieces of evidence” used to convict Syed.

“If that evidence had been disclosed, perhaps Adnan would not have missed his high school graduation, or his pre-med plans, or 23 years of birthdays, holidays, family gatherings, community events and everyday moments of joy,” Syed’s attorney, Eric Suter said.

The state has 30 days to decide whether it wants to retry Syed.

Lee’s brother told the court that he’s not against a continued investigation, but he believes Syed’s conviction should stand. He noted that his family still grieves over the death of his sister. “Every day when I think it’s over ... it always comes back,” he said. “It’s killing me.”

Syed did not speak to reporters on his way out of court, but Suter recalled Syed telling her “he couldn’t believe it’s real” after the ruling, reports the Baltimore Sun.

Jury finds Purdue University discriminated against female student after she filed a sexual assault complaint,"On Friday, a jury determined that Purdue University discriminated and retaliated against a female student after she filed a sexual assault complaint. According to WLFI-TV, student activists are now demanding that the two administrators named in the student's case step down.



Jurors in a federal lawsuit against the university found that Nancy Roe, a female student, made a good-faith sexual assault complaint in 2017.

Roe reported to the university that a male student sexually assaulted her when he audio-recorded their sexual encounter without her consent.



In response to the complaint, Roe's lawsuit stated that Purdue suspended her for filing ""the assault maliciously"" and only required the male student to write a 10-page paper.

The case against the school named dean of students Katie Sermersheim and vice president of ethics and compliance Alysa Rollock. The jury found that the administrators failed to provide Roe with adequate notice and did not fully hear her claims during their investigation of the reported incident.

Purdue was ordered to pay Roe $10,000 in compensatory damages.

Members of the university's activist group #MeTooPurdue spoke out against the two administrators and demanded they resign. The campus activists have organized several rallies protesting sexual assault at campus fraternity houses.

Campus activist Beth Kelley told WLFI-TV, ""We're really just trying to keep people aware that this issue is still here and it's not going away any time soon.""

Purdue University activist Liam Hostetler said, ""When you see the immediate disregard of evidence and a lack of compassion toward survivors on campus ... it just really shows they do not care much for the survivors.""

Hostetler stated that the university set a ""horrible precedent"" that causes students to be afraid to report complaints of sexual assault.

""While we appreciate the opportunity to defend this case, we could not disagree more that Purdue or either of its administrators deserves any finding of fault based on the evidence presented,"" Purdue University said in a statement to WLFI-TV. ""It's noteworthy that, while the jury did not decide in favor of Dr. Katie Sermersheim or Ms. Alysa Rollock, it also concluded the plaintiff did not deserve any compensation for those findings. Purdue maintains an unwavering commitment to Title IX and is confident in its policies and procedures for investigating and adjudicating these difficult cases.""

The university concluded that it ""stands fully in support of Dr. Sermersheim and Ms. Rollock for their professionalism, diligence, integrity, and commitment to fairness in this and all such matters.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jury-finds-purdue-university-discriminated-against-female-student-after-she-filed-a-malicious-sexual-assault-complaint,2022-09-29
"Jussie Smollett believes his skin color is why he got jail time for staging hate crime against himself, lying to cops, sources say","Jussie Smollett believes he got 150 days in jail for staging a racist, homophobic hate crime against himself — and then lying to cops and courts about it — because he's black, sources close to the former ""Empire"" star told TMZ.

The sources added that Smollett anticipated getting jail time and also told his defense team before sentencing he believed he'd be treated more harshly than others convicted of non-violent crimes due to his skin color — and that it's evidence of systemic racism in the judicial system, the outlet reported.

Image source: YouTube screenshot, composite

What's the background?

Smollett, 39 — who is black and gay — made national headlines for claiming a pair of supporters of then-President Donald Trump physically attacked him near his apartment in Chicago in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, 2019.

He claimed the two men wearing ski masks confronted him as he was leaving a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. in below-freezing conditions and yelled, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before beating him up, putting a rope around his neck, pouring bleach on him, and hollering, ""This is MAGA country!"" — a reference to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

But once a police investigation began, Smollett's story began to crumble. In December a jury found him guilty on five of six counts of felony disorderly conduct for his costly charade — crimes that could have resulted in three years behind bars. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Smollett likely will serve only half of his 150-day sentence since his jail term is eligible for “day-for-day” credit for good behavior.

In addition to jail time, Cook County Judge James Linn last week sentenced Smollett to 30 months of probation and ordered him to pay $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago as well as a $25,000 fine.

Prior to issuing his sentence, Judge Linn eviscerated Smollett, calling him a ""charlatan"" and telling him ""your hypocrisy is astounding"" and ""you wanted to make yourself more famous"" through the elaborate, ""premeditated"" caper and then ""you threw a national pity party for yourself."" But the worst part, Linn said, was that Smollett lied to authorities about it all — and then committed perjury on the witness stand.

But after he was sentenced, Smollett continued his defiance, standing up and shaking his finger and telling Linn and the courtroom that ""I am innocent, and I am not suicidal! If I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBTQ community!”

Smollett added, “I did not do this, and I am not suicidal. And if anything happens to me when I go in [jail], I did not do it to myself. And you must all know that ... I am not suicidal.”

Then the singer offered a grand finale, raising his fist as he was led out of the courtroom and flat-out hollering in the process: ""I am not suicidal! I am not suicidal! And I am innocent! I could've said I was guilty a long time ago!""

Jussie Smollett has courtroom outburst after judge sentences him to jail | ABC7 youtu.be

TMZ, citing its sources, said Smollett declared he wasn't suicidal because he wanted the public to know that if something happens to him in jail, it's due to foul play — and that Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in jail, also was on his mind.

Anything else?

Jocqui Smollett said Saturday that his brother was placed in the psychiatric ward at the Cook County Jail in Chicago due to ""being at risk of self-harm,"" Fox News reported.

But Jocqui Smollett insisted that ""he is in no way, shape, or form at risk of self-harm. He wants to let folks know that he is very stable, he is very strong, he is very healthy and ready to take on the challenge that... has been put up against him,"" the cable network reported.

Still, Smollett was placed in protective custody in the jail, separated from other inmates and monitored by security cameras and an officer, authorities added to Fox News.

Meanwhile, Taraji P. Henson — a fellow ""Empire"" cast member — said Smollett's imprisonment is unfair and compared him to Emmett Till, a black teen who was brutally murdered in the 1950s and became an icon of the civil rights movement after his killers were acquitted.

""I am not here to debate you on his innocence, but we can agree that the punishment does not fit the crime,"" Henson wrote on Instagram with a ""FreeJussie"" hashtag. ""Emmett Till was brutally beat and ultimately murdered because of a lie, and none of the people involved with his demise spent one day in jail, even after Carolyn Bryant admitted that her claims were false. No one was hurt or killed during Jussie’s ordeal. ... My prayer is that he is freed and put on house arrest and probation because in this case that would seem fair.""

And about a dozen Smollett supporters rallied outside Cook County Jail on Sunday to protest him being placed behind bars, WFLD-TV reported, adding that protesters said the judicial system is racist and that Smollett should not serve any jail time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jussie-smollett-believes-his-skin-color-is-why-he-got-jail-time-for-staging-hate-crime-against-himself-lying-to-cops-sources-say,2022-03-14
"Despite 2 million illegal immigrants stealing into US under her watch, Vice President Kamala Harris claims, 'We have a secure border'","In an NBC ""Meet the Press"" segment filmed in Texas, which aired on September 11, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed border security with host Chuck Todd. Citing the record-breaking number of illegal aliens who have stolen across the southern border into the U.S. over the past year, Todd asked Harris, ""Would you call the border secure?""

Harris first responded by suggesting what needs to be done is ""pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship."" She then answered Todd's question with a caveat: ""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system.""

So far in 2022, there have been over 1,946,780 encounters with illegal aliens at the southern border, surpassing last year's totals, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection had 1,734,686 such encounters. Over 69% of these illegal aliens are single adults. As a point of comparison, in former President Trump's final year in office, there were 458,088 encounters at the southern border.

Todd pressed Harris on whether she was indeed confident in the border's security.

Harris responded: ""We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration.""

She reiterated her earlier claim that it is a priority of the Biden administration to ""put into place a law and a plan for a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people who are here and are prepared to do what is legally required to gain citizenship.""

The amnesty push

Democrats have long sought to confer amnesty and ultimately citizenship on millions of illegal aliens.

Then-candidate Joe Biden indicated during his 2020 campaign that he would seek to work with Congress on ""providing a road map for citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants.""

Upon taking power, the Biden administration introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would have set illegal aliens up for citizenship and provided green cards to others present in the U.S. illegally. Since Republicans would not support such a measure, the bill died.

Democrat lawmakers tried to get amnesty provisions into the Build Back Better Act, which would have provided amnesty to at least 7 million illegal aliens and work authorizations to many more. The bill passed the House but was not taken up by the Senate.

Is the border really ""secure""?

In response to Harris' remarks on ""Meet the Press,"" Rep. Mayra Flores (R-Texas) told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Harris ""has done nothing for us in South Texas to secure the borders. She's useless.""



Arizona Governor Doug Ducey (R) tweeted on Sunday that ""VP Harris and President Biden are clueless when it comes to border security. Let's call this for what it is: an Open Border Policy.""

In another tweet, Ducey wrote: ""Border security is clearly NOT a priority for the Biden Administration. They have NO IDEA what's happening at their nation's southern border.""

Referencing the recent revelation that over 66 suspects on a U.S. terror watch list had been caught illegally crossing the border, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) wrote: ""How many got away undetected? Border security is national security. Under the Biden administration, we have neither.""

In August, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) suggested that ""The Biden Regime has facilitated an invasion of our sovereign borders of more than 4.2 million illegal aliens since January 2021.""

According to Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, the perception that illegal aliens are permitted into the U.S. under the Biden administration's policies has spurred more criminal traffic across the border. ""In my experience, we have seen increases [in illegal immigration] when there are no consequences.""

Harris' past remarks regarding border security



Harris stated on ABC's ""The View"" in 2019 that illegal aliens should not be treated as criminals. ""It should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal one,"" she said. ""We can't treat people like criminals when they are crossing the border.""



In her 2019 book ""The Truths We Hold,"" Harris noted that ""a wall on the border with Mexico was a total waste of taxpayer money.""

She explained to NPR that she ""would not enforce a law that would reject people and turn them away without giving them a fair and due process to determine if we should give them asylum and refuge.""

When Trump suggested he would send the U.S. military to secure the southern border until the border wall was completed, Harris claimed that doing so was about ""vilifying people"" and that there were more pressing issues such as ""climate change, because guess what, guy, it's real and it's a crisis.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-claims-border-is-secure,2022-09-12
Kamala Harris mercilessly mocked after tweeting that US is 'moving again' due to infrastructure package when freezing drivers were stranded on I-95 near DC,"Vice President Kamala Harris was the recipient of a big dose of mockery after tweeting Tuesday that America is ""moving again"" due to the new, Democrat-backed $1.2 trillion infrastructure spending package.

""Because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, America is moving again,"" Harris wrote in her ill-timed tweet. ""That's what infrastructure is all about: getting people moving.""

See, the problem was that the Harris tweet hailing the notion that ""America is moving again"" was posted at the same time hundreds of freezing motorists were still stranded on Interstate 95 in Virginia.

Traffic between Ruther Glen in Caroline County and Dumfries in Prince William County — not too far from Washington, D.C., where Harris calls home — came to standstill Monday and stayed that way overnight amid freezing temperatures and vehicles running out of gas.

How did folks react to Harris' tweet?

As you might imagine, quite a few commenters pointed out to the vice president that the stranded drivers in her figurative back yard likely weren't singing the praises of the infrastructure spending package or chanting ""America is moving again!""

To wit:

And the hits just kept on coming:

""Why, why oh why would anyone think this tweet is a good idea at the same time I-95 is trending for a 12 hour+ 30-50 mile standstill?"" one commenter wrote. ""Are you guys *trying* to write GOP midterm attack ads for them?""

""Hey Kamala, Heads up: Someone on your social media comms team hates you,"" another user said. ""Great timing.""

""Of all the days to say this, today is the funniest,"" another user declared.

""You can’t seem to get your footing,"" another commenter said. ""I’m trying to be supportive but when a major highway shuts down for over 20 hours with no solution, this is not the day for this tweet

Other commenters pointed out that Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine was among the stranded parties:

""One of your senators literally isn’t moving, he’s been stuck for 24 hours on the highway with thousands of other people because our infrastructure sucks butt,"" another user said in regard to Kaine.

Ready for another left-wing faux pas?

Others — presumably those left of center politically — enjoyed pointing out that the not-ready-for-freezing-weather roadways actually are the fault of Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who was elected Virginia governor in November:

Fair point — save for the fact that Youngkin hasn't yet taken office. He'll be inaugurated Jan. 15.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-mercilessly-mocked-after-tweeting-that-us-is-moving-again-due-to-infrastructure-package-when-freezing-drivers-were-stranded-on-i-95-near-dc,2022-01-05
Kamala Harris unveils 5-pillar strategy to combat the border crisis. It says virtually nothing about the border.,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday released her long-anticipated plan to combat the ongoing immigration crisis at the U.S. southern border. Unsurprisingly, the plan has scarcely anything to offer as far as the actual border goes.

In fact, the plan, released without a news conference, ""does not include a detailed timeline or specific policy actions to be taken"" at all, The Hill reported Thursday. Instead, the administration argued the problem could be resolved with greater ""engagement"" with Central American countries and more ""humane"" immigration practices, generally.

In a statement introducing the ""Root Causes Strategy,"" the White House touted Harris's five-pillar plan as a core component of the administration's efforts to ""establish a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system"" through ""various U.S. government tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, public diplomacy, and sanctions.""

But instead of offering concrete solutions to secure the country's southern border amid an unprecedented surge of migrants, the administration deferred to using feel-good language and offering abstract aspirations about addressing the ""humanitarian"" crisis in Central America.

The lofty, feel-good language can be felt in the plan's stated five pillars, which go as follows, according to a White House fact sheet:

Pillar I: Addressing economic insecurity and inequality;

Pillar II: Combating corruption, strengthening democratic governance, and advancing the rule of law;

Pillar III: Promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and free press;

Pillar IV: Countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations; and

Pillar V: Combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence.

Nowhere in the five-pillar plan does Harris — who was tasked with managing the border crisis in March — mention anything about border enforcement. One would think that U.S. border enforcement ought to be of utmost importance for the U.S. vice president. But judging by the details of the plan, it seems as if Harris is more concerned with crafting government policy for Central American countries.

Don't worry, Harris indicates to the American people as scores of migrants continue to surge the border — 50,000 of them released into the country without court dates — she and President Biden ""have restarted our nation's engagement in Central America and diplomatic efforts with Central American governments.""

That promise will likely not come as a relief to border-town Americans and others whose lives are being upended by the border crisis.

Besides, political ""engagement"" usually means more than talks and vague cooperation. It means dollars, and Harris admits as much in her plan when she says, ""We have already received commitments from the governments of Mexico, Japan, and Korea, and the United Nations, to join the United States in providing relief to the region"" (emphases added).

In her coverage of the news, HotAir's Karen Townsend noted that all the ""fuzzy feel-good language"" just means that ""the Biden administration is offering up pallets of cash for corrupt Central American leaders [who] will line their pockets and those within their inner circles."" Instead, she argued:

Here's what should be happening, if this administration can, in fact, walk and chew gum at the same time. There should be attention paid to the southern border before we worry about long-term solutions to anything. The Biden border crisis is an immediate humanitarian and public health crisis. All the other stuff is unicorns and rainbows and hopes for later in a better world. Who is in charge of the present real-life crisis? It's not DHS and Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, obviously. He's still denying the crisis and at the same time claiming everything is under control.

The crux of the matter may be that the administration simply doesn't see the immigration problem as just that — a problem.

One senior administration official acknowledged, ""We're not seeking to end migration as part of the fabric of this region ... what we're seeking to change is the ways in which people migrate, to provide an alternative to the criminal smuggling and trafficking rings and to give people access to opportunity and protection through safe legal channels, safe legal pathways.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-releases-border-plan,2021-07-29
Conservative who paid off her student loans called 'selfish' for opposing student loan forgiveness,"Kassy Dillon faced significant backlash on Twitter for saying that she worked diligently to pay off her own student loans and would be incensed if President Joe Biden forgave student debt.

""I just worked my butt off to pay off my very expensive student loans a few months ago. If Biden forgives student loans, I’m going to be livid,"" Dillon tweeted on Wednesday, expressing a sentiment likely shared by scads of other people.

But the straightforward and reasonable comment was met by a wave of criticism, including from celebrity Valerie Bertinelli who accused Dillon of being selfish.

""Tell me you’re selfish without telling me you’re selfish,"" Bertinelli tweeted in response to Dillon's post.

""This isn’t about selfishness it’s about responsibility. Forgiving student loans won’t fix the problem of schools hiking tuition costs,"" Dillon replied.

""Exactly Kassy focus on the actual problem,"" Bertinelli tweeted.

In response to Bettinelli's post accusing Dillon of selfishness, another Twitter user suggested that Bertinelli spend some of her own money to pay off people's student debts.

""Selfish for paying off one’s own loans, and not wanting taxpayers to cover the dumb decisions of others? You’ve got money, Val. Why don’t you help them pay those degrees off?"" the person tweeted.

Bertinelli replied, ""I’ll never be wealthy enough to not pay taxes. So, you see, dear, I am one of those 'taxpayers covering the dumb decisions of others'. I have an idea tho, how about we get tax dodgers (*coughmultibillionaires) to actually pay their fair share.""

In a tweet responding to comments made by Ian Haworth, Bertinelli noted, ""Dude, I don’t even have a dog in this fight, I never graduated high school. Forgiving debt that never should’ve been incurred by greedy colleges ... and changing the system should be a no-brainer.""

Others also criticized Dillon for feeling outraged over the prospect of the government forgiving student debt.

""The lesson of this @kassydillon person's tweet is that only SHE, and no one else, matters - yet she asks us to set aside OUR own interests and worry about her becoming livid #LividForKassy #OnlyKassyMatters #ThinkOfKassy #WontSomebodyThinkAboutKassy,"" Keith Olbermann tweeted.

Someone else drew the following bizarre analogy: ""Here's what you sound like: My mom died from Alzheimer's disease a few years ago. If they find a cure now, I'm going to be livid. You are an idiot in my opinion. You want people to remain drowning in debt because you're a fragile little snowflake that will melt in the sun.""



""Imagine thinking someone getting Alzheimer's is the same as willingly taking on a loan that you agreed to pay back,"" Dillon responded.

Another individual likened Dillon's position to someone who opposes Polio vaccinations because they were crippled by Polio during their own childhood: ""'I was crippled by polio as a child so why the hell should you get vaccinated???'""

""Student loan forgiveness isn't a vaccine to a disease. It's enabling the universities that are overcharging because they know they'll get government help. These people willingly took on these student loans, no one willingly takes on polio. This is a ridiculous analogy,"" Dillon noted.

President Biden said on Thursday that he is ""considering dealing with some debt reduction.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kassy-dillon-student-loans-biden,2022-04-28
Justice Kavanaugh nukes NCAA in concurring opinion to landmark decision ruling student athletes should get benefits,"In an unanimous decision handed down Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA is violating U.S. antitrust law by restricting the benefits colleges can make available to student athletes.

Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the court's opinion, which said the NCAA unlawfully harmed college athletes by limiting schools from competing for top talent by offering education-related benefits — like school supplies or paid internships. Gorsuch wrote that the NCAA sought ""immunity from the normal operation of the antitrust laws,"" which the court refused to give.

The decision does not immediately open the doors for paid compensation for college athletes, as that issue was not before the court. Instead, it will permit schools to offer a wide range of educational benefits including tutoring, study abroad programs, and graduate scholarships, according to the Associated Press.

Current NCAA rules stipulate that student athletes cannot be paid and cap the scholarship money schools can offer at the cost of attending the school. The NCAA claims these rules are necessary because college athletes do not play at a professional level, and compensating them financially would detract from the amateur nature of collegiate sports.

But several former athletes who sued the NCAA, including former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston, disagreed. They argued in their lawsuit that the NCAA's rules on education-related compensation were unlawful and unfair, and the Supreme Court agreed with their argument.

In a concurring opinion that will turn heads, Justice Brett Kavanaugh signaled that he at least is willing to go further and declare the NCAA's refusal to allow college athletes to be paid a violation of antitrust law.

""The NCAA has long restricted the compensation and benefits that student athletes may receive,"" Justice Kavanaugh wrote. ""And with surprising success, the NCAA has long shielded its compensation rules from ordinary antitrust scrutiny. Today, however, the Court holds that the NCAA has violated the antitrust laws. The Court's decision marks an important and overdue course correction, and I join the Court's excellent opinion in full.""

Continuing, the justice said that ""the NCAA's remaining compensation rules also raise serious questions under the antitrust laws.""

""The NCAA couches its arguments for not paying student athletes in innocuous labels,"" he wrote. ""But the labels cannot disguise the reality: The NCAA's business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America. All of the restaurants in a region cannot come together to cut cooks' wages on the theory that 'customers prefer' to eat food from low-paid cooks. Law firms cannot conspire to cabin lawyers' salaries in the name of providing legal services out of a 'love of the law.' Hospitals cannot agree to cap nurses' income in order to create a 'purer' form of helping the sick. News organizations cannot join forces to curtail pay to reporters to preserve a 'tradition' of public-minded journalism. Movie studios cannot collude to slash benefits to camera crews to kindle a 'spirit of amateurism' in Hollywood.""

He went on to accuse the NCAA of ""price-fixing labor,"" which he called a ""textbook antitrust problem.""

""The bottom line is that the NCAA and its member colleges are suppressing the pay of student athletes who collectively generate billions of dollars in revenues for colleges every year. Those enormous sums of money flow to seemingly everyone except the student athletes. College presidents, athletic directors, coaches, conference commissioners, and NCAA executives take in six- and seven-figure salaries. Colleges build lavish new facilities. But the student athletes who generate the revenues, many of whom are African American and from lower-income backgrounds, end up with little or nothing,"" he charged.

Kavanaugh torched the NCAA's justifications for refusing to let student athletes be paid based on the tradition of amateur sports.

""Those traditions alone cannot justify the NCAA's decision to build a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated,"" he wrote. ""Nowhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate. And under ordinary principles of antitrust law, it is not evident why college sports should be any different. The NCAA is not above the law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kavanaugh-nukes-ncaa-in-concurring-opinion-to-landmark-decision-ruling-student-athletes-should-be-get-benefits,2021-06-21
Senior Biden advisor says ‘MAGA Republican agenda’ is to ‘essentially destroy the United States of America’,"An advisor to President Joe Biden claimed that the ""MAGA Republican agenda"" was to ""essentially destroy the United States of America"" during an interview Sunday.

Keisha Lance Bottoms made the comments while a guest on ""The Sunday Show"" with Jonathan Capehart on MSNBC.

“There is a MAGA Republican agenda that gives no consideration to the rule of law, that has no respect for a woman’s right to choose, that wants to defund the FBI,” said the senior adviser for public engagement. ""There is a MAGA Republican agenda that thought that it was OK to attack our nation's capitol on January 6th.""

Bottoms was responding to a set of goals laid out by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and called the ""Commitment to America"" ahead of the pivotal midterm elections.

Biden has taken to using the phrase ""MAGA Republicans"" in order to accuse his political opponents of extremism. In August, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre went as far as to say MAGA Republicans fit the definition of fascists.

Capehart asked Bottoms if the administration would continue to hammer away at Republicans by using the ""MAGA"" description before the midterms.

“I think it will always be important to call out any effort there is to destroy, essentially destroy the United States of America,” Bottoms continued. “President Biden has been very clear he wants to work in a bipartisan effort. He has worked in a bipartisan effort. He’s been able to get things done on behalf of our country, but when you have a MAGA Republican agenda that has no respect for the Constitution, that has no respect for free and fair elections then it is important for all of us, not just the president, not just me, for all of us to call it out for what it is.”

Capehart also criticized the plan put out by Republicans as having too few specifics and details.

While most experts have predicted that Democrats will lose enough seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to flip control over to the Republicans in the midterm elections, some recent polling shows Biden has made a slight uptick in popularity.

Kelly Loeffler launches conservative voter drive organization in Georgia to rival Stacey Abrams' liberal group,"Former Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler has launched a conservative version of Stacey Abrams' Democratic get-out-the-vote group in the state, in a push to encourage Republicans to register and show up at the polls after the formerly red state flipped blue during the Jan. 5 runoffs.

What are the details?

On Monday, Loeffler unveiled Greater Georgia, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with a mission to register more voters, reach more communities, and strengthen election transparency in the state.

In an ad posted to her Twitter feed, Loeffler noted that the state saw record high voter turnout in both the 2020 general election and in the runoff elections earlier this year, but that there were roughly 500,000 Georgians who cast their vote on Nov. 3 that did not show up for the Senate races in January — ""a majority of whom were Republicans.""





Loeffler and fellow Republican Sen. David Perdue both lost to their respective Democratic challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in the runoffs, flipping control of the U.S. Senate to Democrats who now run the White House and both chambers of Congress.

Loeffler appears to be taking a page out of Abrams' playbook — and taking the Democrat on.

Abrams, who lost to Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in the 2018 gubernatorial race, has blamed widespread voter suppression on her loss. The Democrat, who never conceded the race, launched a liberal group called Fair Fight in the aftermath of her defeat — and many credit Abrams' efforts with Democratic victories in the state in 2020 and 2021.

After Georgia was called for now-President Joe Biden in the general election, then-President Donald Trump lambasted Kemp and Georgia's Republican election officials, insisting that the election was rigged and that the integrity of the system was compromised.

The issues were litigated in court and several recounts were conducted, but many Trump supporters and the president himself remained soured. Some high-profile Trump allies, including attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, led a push for Republican Georgians to boycott the January runoffs in protest.

What's next?

Loeffler wants to build back the confidence lost by conservative voters and bring more into the ring, and she's thrown her own money into the Greater Georgia cause.

The Washington Examiner reported that ""Loeffler, who has a background in finance and an estimated net worth of around $800 million, put seven figures into the organization and will be its chairwoman.""

""Elections at every level have consequences — and we're already seeing the consequences of recent elections play out in Georgia and across the country,"" Loeffler says. ""Conservatives have a winning message, we just need to go out and share it with more people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kelly-loeffler-launches-conservative-voter-drive-organization-to-rival-stacey-abrams-liberal-group,2021-02-23
Kemp beats Abrams in Georgia gubernatorial election,"Incumbent Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has defeated Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams in the state's nationally watched gubernatorial election, NBC News has projected.

If neither candidate had secured a majority of the votes, the contest would have headed to a December runoff.

The election marked a rematch between the two political rivals after Kemp defeated Abrams in the Peach State's 2018 governor's race.

Abrams would have been the first black woman in America to serve as a governor.

Kemp decisively defeated Trump-backed former U.S. Sen. David Perdue earlier this year during the GOP gubernatorial primary.

Abrams, whose candidacy was supported by left-wing mega donor George Soros, has claimed that being pro-choice is part of her faith. ""I cannot strike down another person's rights simply because I don't agree,"" she said. Abrams also said that, according to her faith, ""[Y]ou protect the vulnerable and you wrap them in your love.""

In a 2018 campaign ad, she said that according to her reading of scripture, ""Jesus Christ was a progressive.""



Kemp signed pro-life legislation that bans most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, though the ban does include some exceptions.

Abrams previously claimed that the 2018 gubernatorial election was not a fair contest. The New York Times Magazine reported in 2019 that the Democrat noted, ""I legally acknowledge that Brian Kemp secured a sufficient number of votes under our existing system to become the governor of Georgia. I do not concede that the process was proper, nor do I condone that process."" She also said that she had ""legally sufficient doubt about the process to say that it was not a fair election.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kemp-defeats-abrams-georgia-gubernatorial,2022-11-09
Kentucky Republicans override Democrat governor's veto of sweeping anti-abortion bill,"The Republican-controlled Kentucky state legislature on Wednesday overrode a barrage of vetoes issued by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, including a veto of a pro-life law banning abortions after 15 weeks.

With their legislative supermajority, GOP lawmakers passed nearly two dozen bills the governor had opposed, including the new abortion restrictions, a fairness in women's sports bill, and welfare reform.

Among those bills is HB 3, a 72-page omnibus abortion law that imposes sweeping new restrictions on abortion in Kentucky. In addition to banning abortion procedures after 15 weeks of pregnancy, the new law prohibits receiving abortion medication by mail, requires that girls under 18 seeking an abortion show an abortionist informed written consent from a parent or legal guardian, requires that the corpses of aborted babies be buried or cremated, and more.

Beshear vetoed the legislation last week, criticizing the bill for lacking exemptions for rape and incest and claiming that it is likely unconstitutional. He raised a hypothetical scenario where a 12-year-old girl is raped by her father and would be required to notify her rapist to get an abortion.

""Rape and incest are violent crimes. Victims of these crimes should have options, not be further scarred through a process that exposes them to more harm from their rapists or that treats them like offenders themselves,"" Beshear said.

The governor also opposed what he said was an ""unfunded mandate"" in the law, citing a requirement that the Cabinet for Health and Family Services create an oversight system to monitor drugs used to induce abortions.

Opponents of the legislation, including the Kentucky chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood, have threatened legal action challenging the new law. They say it contains so many restrictions that it will effectively eliminate access to abortion in Kentucky.

“Because the law is impossible to comply with, it amounts to a de facto abortion ban, thus violating patients’ federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade,"" representatives from the two organizations said in a statement.

Pro-life activists at Kentucky Right to Life counter that the law implements needed health regulations on ""at-home abortions via mail-order"" and that all unborn children deserve a right to live, regardless of the circumstances of their conception.

""Without an in-person consultation between a pregnant woman or minor girl and a medical professional, not only is it difficult to assess any serious risk factors such as an ectopic pregnancy, pre-existing conditions or the presence of STIs - sexual transmitted infections, but the door is left wide open for vulnerable women and girls to be physically forced into an unwanted or quick decision on abortion,"" Kentucky Right to Life said in a statement opposing Beshear's veto.

""The Governor states that there is no exception for rape and incest. The issues of rape and incest are extremely sensitive and personal matters, and those harmed by sexual violence often carry a lifetime of scars,"" the group said.

""Unfortunately, those opposed to any restrictions on abortions often insert rape and incest to undermine the legislation. The fact that statements on HB 3 are made about such tragic and life-impacting matters as rape or incest without fully reading the bill ... which explicitly indicates exceptions for sexual abuse and sexual abuse by the minor girl's parent — is a political travesty.""

Two previous Kentucky laws banning abortion at six and 14 weeks have been blocked in federal court after legal challenges from the state's two abortion providers, Planned Parenthood and EMW Women's Surgical Center in Louisville.

The Republican legislature overrode several more vetoes from the Democratic governor.

Senate Bill 83, legislation that bans gender-dysphoric males from competing against girls and women in sixth grade through college, is now law in Kentucky. So is HB 9, which funds charter schools; HB 7, which adds new rules to public benefits programs including Medicaid and food stamps; HB 8, an income tax cut; and SB 216, an election security bill that requires more post-election audits, video surveillance of voting machines and ballot boxes when not in operation for the general election, and a full transition to paper ballots by 2024.

Kevin Hart defends Dave Chappelle and says cancel culture has gone too far,"Comedian Kevin Hart came to the defense of Dave Chappelle and decried cancel culture while admitting that he has changed his approach to comedy in order to be respectful of others.

Hart made the comments in an interview with the New York Times.

“That man don’t have a hateful bone in his body. And I don’t say that because it’s hypothetical — I say that because I know him,"" said Hart of Chappelle, who has been accused of transphobic comments.

""I know his world,"" Hart continued. ""I know that he embraces the LGBT+ community, because he has friends who are close to him from that community. I know that his kids understand equality, fair treatment, love. I know that his wife embeds that in their kids. I know why people embrace him. He’s a good dude.""

Hart was also the victim of cancel culture in 2018 when resurfaced tweets sunk his hopes of hosting the Oscar awards ceremony. He later apologized for the jokes and Chappelle used his story to criticize cancel culture in one of his comedy specials.

Hart went on in the Times interview to opine that cancel culture had gone too far in society.

""If there is a joke, there’s an attempt to be funny. You can find a joke tasteful or distasteful. If you’re a supporter of a performer, then you’re probably OK with whatever’s happening. And if you’re not a fan, you’re infuriated and you’re outraged. Rightfully so — you have every right to be,"" he said.

""You also have a right to not support it,"" Hart concluded. ""But the energy that’s put into wanting to change or end someone, it’s getting out of hand.”

The newest protest against Chappelle originated from some students at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, where the comedian went to high school. Students are protesting the school's plans to name a theater after Chappelle after he has donated and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for his alma mater.

Chappelle has responded to the controversy by challenging his critics to raise more money for the school than his supporters. He said that if they are successful he'll refuse to put his name on the theater.

Hart is on a campaign to publicize his new dramatic limited series on Netflix entitled, ""True Story,"" starring himself and Wesley Snipes.

Kevin McCarthy rejects 'nativist dog whistles' of the 'America First Caucus' led by Marjorie Greene and others,"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) issued a missive in flat opposition to the newly announced ""America First Caucus"" organized by some Republican members of Congress including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) told reporters on Friday that he was looking into joining the caucus and said that Greene was leading the charge.



A document obtained by Punchbowl News with a logo of the caucus described one of the aims of the group.

""America is a nation with a border, and a culture, strengthened by a common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions,"" the document read.

The document also said the caucus would be in support of infrastructure projects that befit ""the progeny of European architecture, whereby public infrastructure must be utilitarian as well as stunningly, classically beautiful, befitting a world power and source of freedom.""

Some saw the inclusion of the phrase ""Ango-Saxon"" as racially charged and even accused the Republicans involved of being aligned with white supremacist ideals.

The beleaguered Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who is inundated with his own scandal, unabashedly tweeted that he was joining the caucus.

""I'm proud to join @mtgreenee in the #AmericaFirst Caucus. We will end wars, stop illegal immigration & promote trade that is fair to American workers,"" tweeted Gaetz.

'The party of Lincoln... not nativist dog whistles'

McCarthy appeared to be on the other end of the debate.

""America is built on the idea that we are all created equal and success is earned through honest, hard work. It isn't built on identity, race, or religion,"" responded McCarthy in a tweet that didn't directly name the America First Caucus.

""The Republican Party is the party of Lincoln & the party of more opportunity for all Americans—not nativist dog whistles,"" he added.



McCarthy's criticism aligned with many of the reactions against the America First Caucus. He had previously defended Greene when she was criticized by Democrats over statements she made in the past supporting various conspiracy theories.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-rejects-nativist-dog-whistles-of-the-america-first-caucus-led-by-marjorie-greene-and-others,2021-04-16
Unions angry at Biden for canceling Keystone pipeline,"Unions that endorsed Joe Biden for president are experiencing some buyer's remorse only days after his inauguration. In one of his first actions in the White House, President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. Now, the unions that supported Biden are criticizing the newly-elected president for the political move that they say will ""kill thousands of good-paying union jobs!""

The Keystone XL pipeline was first proposed in 2008, but the Obama administration vetoed the 1,200-mile pipeline in November 2015. On his fourth day in office, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to advance the $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline project, which would pump 35 million gallons of crude oil a day from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska.

Citing climate change concerns, the Biden administration announced on Wednesday it would revoke the federal permits for the Keystone XL pipeline.

The Keystone XL pipeline disserves the U.S. national interest. The United States and the world face a climate crisis. That crisis must be met with action on a scale and at a speed commensurate with the need to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory. At home, we will combat the crisis with an ambitious plan to build back better, designed to both reduce harmful emissions and create good clean-energy jobs. Our domestic efforts must go hand in hand with U.S. diplomatic engagement. Because most greenhouse gas emissions originate beyond our borders, such engagement is more necessary and urgent than ever. The United States must be in a position to exercise vigorous climate leadership in order to achieve a significant increase in global climate action and put the world on a sustainable climate pathway. Leaving the Keystone XL pipeline permit in place would not be consistent with my Administration's economic and climate imperatives.

TC Energy Corporation, the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL pipeline project, said they would cut more than 11,000 jobs.



Jason Kenney, Premier of Alberta, appeared on Fox News' ""The Story,"" where he said that Biden's move ""kills thousands of union labor jobs on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border and counterintuitively makes the United States more dependent on 'dictatorships' for its energy needs.""

Andy Black, president and CEO of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, said, ""Killing 10,000 jobs and taking $2.2 billion in payroll out of workers' pockets is not what Americans need or want right now.""

Biden was also slammed for canceling the Keystone XL pipeline by the same unions who endorsed him in the 2020 election.

""Pipeline construction has been a lifeline for many #LIUNA members across the country,"" the Laborers' International Union of North America said. ""The anticipated decision to cancel the Keystone Pipeline will kill thousands of good-paying UNION jobs!""

In September, LIUNA ""proudly"" endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, claiming the Democrats ""stand out as the blue-collar candidates.""

On Nov. 7, 2020, Terry O'Sullivan, General President of LIUNA, stated, ""Together, we helped push Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over the top, and we helped elect many pro-union, pro-labor, and pro-family candidates to office.""



""Deeply disappointed,"" the head of the North American Building Trades Unions, which endorsed then-candidate Biden in October, said.



The United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters endorsed Biden for president in August.



""We're not going to sit on the sidelines at the UA. This endorsement is about putting UA members to work and fighting for fair wages and good benefits.

"Kid Rock releases song 'We the People' tearing into Biden, Fauci, CNN, Facebook, and more: 'Let's go, Brandon!'","Musician Kid Rock released a new politically charged single blasting President Joe Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and more, Fox News reported Tuesday.

What are the details?

Kid Rock — real name Robert James Ritchie — released a brand-new single in the early hours of Tuesday morning titled ""We the People,"" which takes aim at coronavirus mandates, Big Tech, and the mainstream media.

The song — which features a fair amount of profanity and explicit lyrics — begins, ""We the people in all we do/ Reserve the right to scream 'F*** you'/ Wear your mask, take your pills/ Now a whole generation's mentally ill.""

The song later goes on to compare the media's treatment of Biden to that of former President Donald Trump.

""But COVID's near, it's coming to town, we gotta act quick, shut our borders down/ Joe Biden does, the media embraces, Big Don does it and they call him racist,"" Ritchie raps on the guitar-heavy song.

The choruses also feature ""Let's go, Brandon!"" chants.

He later adds, ""F*** Facebook, f*** Twitter too/ And the mainstream media, f*** you too, too, too.""

What else?

In a Facebook video about the new single, Kid Rock said that the song is about ""all the craziness going on in our world in the last few years"" as well as the ""politics and polarization and social justice.""

""You know, constantly for just being a Trump fan attacked in the media day in day out,"" he added. ""I don't mind taking a punch, but I hit back motherf***er and I hit hard.""

Kid Rock's Bad Reputation Tour kicks off on April 6 at the Ford Center in Evansville, Indiana.

Koch-backed group joins push to legalize weed following Zoom with Snoop Dogg,"A group backed by billionaire political donor Charles Koch is part of a new coalition pushing for the legalization of marijuana at the federal level, after chatting about the issue over Zoom with Snoop Dogg, Politico reported Tuesday.

What are the details?

The third gentleman on the Zoom call that took place last summer was Weldon Angelos, who created the nonprofit The Weldon Project, which works to release people from incarceration who were locked up for marijuana offenses. Angelos was granted a full pardon by former President Donald Trump in January, after serving 13 years of a 55-year sentence for marijuana trafficking.

The trio might seem an unlikely meeting to some. But while Koch has long been demonized by the left along with his late brother, David, for funding conservative initiatives and politicians, Koch has a strong libertarian streak and the resources to influence change.

""I had known that his position on drugs was very libertarian,"" Angelos said of Koch.

But with Democrats now in charge in Washington (and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in favor of legalization), a freedom-loving right-wing donor could be the answer to making marijuana prohibition a thing of the past.

""We can't cut with one scissor blade. We need Republicans in order to pass [a legalization bill],"" Angelos told Politico. ""We need 10 to 12 Republican senators. With Koch's influence, I think that's likely a possibility.""

Out of the Snoop-Koch-Angelos Zoom meeting came a brainchild: a new coalition dubbed the Cannabis Freedom Alliance, which includes Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity, The Weldon Project, the libertarian Reason Foundation, and a trade organization called the Global Alliance for Cannabis.

The Cannabis Freedom Alliance announced its launch Tuesday, saying in a news release that its on a mission to ""end the prohibition, criminalization, and overregulation of cannabis in the United States."" The organization says it ""aims to do so in a manner consistent with helping all Americans achieve their full potential and limiting the number of barriers that inhibit innovation and entrepreneurship in a free and open market.""

Anything else?

The Hill reported that Brent Gardner, the chief government affairs officer for Americans for Prosperity, issued a statement expressing his group's enthusiasm over the new initiative.

""Americans for Prosperity is excited to work alongside our partners to bring cannabis businesses into the light, replacing black and gray markets with a free and fair legal framework,"" Gardner said. ""Cannabis commerce will become a way for Americans to lift themselves up, rather than a barrier holding them back.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/koch-backed-group-joins-push-to-legalize-weed-following-zoom-with-snoop-dogg,2021-04-07
Gov. Kristi Noem says South Dakota celebrating International Women's Day with bill banning biological males from girls' sports,"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem joined in Monday on a social media frenzy to recognize International Women's Day, sending the message that her state was celebrating the occasion by passing legislation that will protect women's sports by prohibiting biological males from competing with girls.

What are the details?

Noem tweeted out, ""In South Dakota, we're celebrating #InternationalWomensDay by defending women's sports! I'm excited to sign this bill very soon.""

The Republican governor linked to a message sent by the group American Principles, which proclaimed, ""GREAT NEWS! The South Dakota Senate just passed the Women's Fairness in Sports bill, 20-15. It now heads to @govkristinoem's desk for signature.""

The Hill reported that the bill, once signed into law, will ""legally prevent any student at a state institution from joining a sports team that does not match their at-birth biological identity."" The legislation would require ""athletes in South Dakota state schools to provide information regarding their biological sex as well as their age and whether they are taking steroids.""

The American Civil Liberties Union in South Dakota is not happy about the legislation, issuing a statement that said the bill ""is an attack on transgender women and girls that will cause them serious emotional and physical harm.""

""It prevents transgender women and girls from having the opportunity to play sports and have their personal dignity respected,"" the statement added.

Debate continues on transgender athletes

Biological males competing in girls' sports has sparked a fierce debate in recent years as transgender athletes have dominated biological females in competitions. The situation has caused particular controversy in high school sports, where girls' athletic records and college scholarships are on the line.

President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling on U.S. schools to allow transgender athletes to compete in the gender category with which they identify, dismissing biological women's civil rights protections under Title IX. When pressed on the issue, White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently explained that ""the president's belief is that trans rights are human rights,"" Fox News reported.

But the White House and trans advocacy organizations have dismissed biological women's civil rights in regard to the issue.

The ACLU, which purports to stand up for all those whose civil liberties are oppressed, is one of the groups that has selectively ignored biological female athletes' civil liberties on the topic.

In the organization's own tweet celebrating women on Monday, the ACLU tweeted, ""On International Women's Day, here's your reminder that trans women are women.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kristi-noem-says-sd-celebrating-international-womens-day-with-bill-banning-biological-men-from-girls-sports,2021-03-09
"Kyle Rittenhouse 'brought a gun to a fistfight, and he was too cowardly to use his own fists to fight his way out,' prosecutor argues","One of the prosecutors in the Kyle Rittenhouse murder trial, Assistant District Attorney James Kraus, argued Monday that the defendant ""brought a gun to a fistfight, and he was too cowardly to use his own fists to fight his way out.""

What are the details?

The prosecution's general argument was that Rittenhouse — who was 17 years old in August 2020 when he went to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and joined other armed individuals to protect property from rioters — should have used hand-to-hand combat to fight off a mob of adults who were threatening his life, chasing him, and physically assaulting him.

Kraus, in a rebuttal against the closing argument of Rittenhouse's defense, echoed a statement from lead prosecutor Thomas Binger that it was unfair of Rittenhouse to bring a gun to protect himself against the angry mob when his fists alone would have sufficed.

""Why do you get to immediately just start shooting?"" Kraus asked the jury. ""As Mr. Binger said, he brought a gun to a fistfight, and he was too cowardly to use his own fists to fight his way out. He has to start shooting.""

Binger had previously argued — in reference to 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum chasing and threatening the life of Rittenhouse before the defendant fatally shot him — ""but let's assume for a minute, yeah, Joseph Rosenbaum is chasing after the defendant 'cause he wants to do some physical harm to him. [Rosenbaum is] an unarmed man. This is a bar fight. This is a fistfight. This is a fight that maybe many of you have been involved in. Two people. Hand to hand. We're throwing punches, we're pushing, we're shoving, we're whatever. But what you don't do is you don't bring a gun to a fistfight.""

And yes, Binger actually did use a still image in court from the Patrick Swayze cult-classic movie ""Road House"" to illustrate his point:

Of course, the same can be said for Gaige Grosskreutz, who also brought a gun to this supposed ""fistfight"" and admitted to pointing it at Rittenhouse while the defendant was on the ground before Rittenhouse shot Grosskreutz in the arm.

'Everybody takes a beating sometimes, right?'

Kraus underscored the prosecution's argument that Rittenhouse was in no position to defend himself with a gun against the attacking mob by saying getting beaten up is no big deal.

""Everybody takes a beating sometimes, right?"" Kraus casually floated to the jury. ""Sometimes you get in a scuffle, and maybe you do get hurt a little bit. That doesn't mean you get to start plugging people with your full metal jacket AR-15 rounds.""

Kyle Rittenhouse's mom issues six-word response when asked if they will sue Joe Biden for 'defaming' Rittenhouse,"The mother of Kyle Rittenhouse suggested Saturday that her attorneys are considering a lawsuit against President Joe Biden for allegedly associating her son with white supremacy.

What are the details?

During an interview on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends,"" Wendy Rittenhouse was asked if the Rittenhouse team plans to take any action against powerful Americans — including Biden — for ""interfering in the justice system"" and ""defaming"" the 18-year-old Rittenhouse.

The elder Rittenhouse had a six word response.

""Our lawyers are gonna handle that,"" Wendy Rittenhouse responded.

In 2020, then-presidential candidate Biden tweeted a video of alleged examples of white supremacy with audio from a presidential debate between Biden and then-President Donald Trump. The video included an image of Rittenhouse.

""There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night,"" Biden tweeted on Sept. 30, 2020.

During an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Wendy Rittenhouse explained what she felt when she saw Biden's tweet.

""When I saw that, I was shocked,"" she said. ""I was angry. President Biden don't know my son whatsoever, and he's not a white supremacist. He's not a racist. And [Biden] did that for the votes. And I was so angry for a while at him and what he did to my son. He defamed him.""

What about the verdict?

Of course, Rittenhouse told Fox News she is hoping for — and expecting — a not guilty verdict.

""I'm hoping that the outcome is what I expect: a not guilty verdict,"" she explained. ""But I know a lot of people out there wants (sic) my son to be guilty.""

""It's in the hands of the jury, and watching them, they've been taking notes, listening to the truth, and I hope they take that into what the outcome is going to be — not from the media, not from the president of the United States, not from celebrities, not from athletes: It's about the truth,"" she continued.

Kyle Rittenhouse's mother shames Biden after she says he 'defamed' Kyle by suggesting he was a white supremacist: Biden 'did that for the votes',"Wendy Rittenhouse, mother of 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse — who is on trial for fatally shooting two men during Kenosha, Wisconsin, riots — says that President Joe Biden ""defamed"" her son by suggesting that the teen was a white supremacist.

The Kenosha riots erupted following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

During Wednesday's proceedings, a tearful Kyle insisted that he acted in self-defense after feeling cornered by one of the victims.

What are the details?

Wendy appeared on Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Thursday night, where she called out Biden for wrongly intimating that Kyle was a white supremacist.

In 2020, then-presidential candidate Biden tweeted images of Kyle and slapped then-President Donald Trump for ignoring what the Democrat said was ""white supremacy."" In the tweet's caption, Biden suggested that white supremacists were partially responsible for the violence that unfolded during the protests.



""There's no other way to put it: The President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacist on the debate stage last night,"" Biden wrote at the time.

Wendy told Fox host Sean Hannity that she was furious when she saw Biden's tweet.

""When I saw that, I was shocked,"" she said. ""I was angry. President Biden don't know my son whatsoever, and he's not a white supremacist. He's not a racist. And [Biden] did that for the votes. And I was so angry for a while at him and what he did to my son. He defamed him.""

Wendy told Fox host Sean Hannity that her son still has nightmares about the incident and that the 18-year-old still has a ""lot of healing to do.""

Hannity later asked Wendy if she believes her son is receiving a fair trial thus far.

""The judge is very fair,"" she said. ""The people that I talked to that lived in Kenosha all their lives, they told me that Judge Schroeder is a very fair judge and he doesn't allow no nonsense in his courtroom.""

What else is there to know?

Kyle's defense rested its case on Thursday, and closing arguments are set to begin on Nov. 15.

Kyle was charged with two counts of homicide for shooting 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum and 26-year-old Anthony Huber during the riots. Gaige Grosskreutz, a surviving third person Kyle shot, testified on Monday.

Kyle was also charged with possession of a weapon by a person under 18, as well as multiple counts of reckless endangerment.

"Kyle Rittenhouse will testify at his own trial, attorney says","Kyle Rittenhouse — the Illinois teenager facing multiple felony murder charges for fatally shooting two men and wounding another during Black Lives Matter riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year — will testify during his own trial, his attorney suggested on Tuesday.

What are the details?

During opening arguments at the Kenosha County Courthouse Tuesday morning, defense attorney Mark Richards said that Rittenhouse would take the stand and discuss why he feared for his life, Reuters reported.

One of those references, according to Fox News, came when Richards told the jury they would hear testimony ""not just from Kyle Rittenhouse"" but from another individual who the attorney said would be testifying at trial.

The revelation, if true, would increase the drama in the highly anticipated case, which is being closely watched by much of the country, though Richards did not go into any further detail about his apparent plans for Rittenhouse's testimony.

Kyle Rittenhouse trial: Defense presents its opening statement | FOX6 News Milwaukee www.youtube.com

What's the background?

The defense team has insisted for months that Rittenhouse — who was 17 years old when the shootings occurred on Aug. 25, 2020 — acted in self-defense when he shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounded Gage Grosskreutz.

Rittenhouse reportedly brought a gun to Kenosha that night to protect local businesses against looting and ransacking as rioters took to the streets in response to a white police officer's shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man.

Videos of the incidents seen by the public appear to show each of the supposed victims advancing on Rittenhouse when they were shot.

But in the prosecution's opening statement, assistant district attorney Thomas Binger argued the defendant acted more like a moth ""to a flame"" when he was ""drawn to the chaos"" of Kenosha before he needlessly killed Rosenbaum and Huber.

""Out of the hundreds of people that came to Kenosha during that week, the hundreds of people that were out on the streets that week, the evidence will show that the only person that killed anyone was the defendant, Kyle Rittenhouse,"" Binger pressed.

The trial, though it only began recently, has already produced a fair bit of drama.

Last week, the judge presiding over the case, Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder, ruled that prosecutors can't refer to the three men that Rittenhouse shot as ""victims,"" though defense attorneys can call them ""rioters"" or ""looters.""

Lab-leak denying EcoHealth Alliance president recuses self from COVID-19 investigation amid conflict-of-interest claims,"EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak has recused himself from a U.N.-partnered commission that is investigating the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus after vigorously working to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis and failing to disclose his organization's ties to the Chinese lab at its center.

Daszak is a highly influential scientist who since the onset of the pandemic has fiercely attacked anyone who suggested the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was manufactured and somehow leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Between 2014 and 2019, his organization funneled $3.4 million in National Institutes of Health grants to the Wuhan lab to study bat coronaviruses. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Daszak was the only American representative of a 10-member World Health Organization team sent to investigate the origins of the virus. He is also a member of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission, an interdisciplinary initiative established by the Lancet medical journal to make recommendations on how to prevent and contain future pandemics.

The Lancet COVID-19 Commission announced Tuesday that Daszak recused himself from the investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic after it came to light that his nonprofit group had funded research at the Wuhan lab that some claim could be related to the virus' origins.

""The Lancet COVID-19 Commission will carefully scrutinize the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in advance of its final report, with the overriding aim of recommending policies to prevent and contain future emerging infectious disease outbreaks. The Commission's technical work will be conducted by independent experts who were not themselves directly involved in US-China research activities that are under scrutiny. Dr. Peter Daszak has recused himself from the Commission's work on the origins of the virus,"" the statement said.

""The Commission urges all scientists who were involved in the US-China research to explain fully and transparently the nature of their work. In the meantime, the Commission will tap global experts in biosafety and other fields to help assess the relevant hypotheses on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and to recommend ways to prevent and contain future outbreaks, whether from naturally occurring zoonotic events or research-related activities.""

There is controversy surrounding Daszak because of his failure to be fully transparent about the nature of his work. Aside from failing to disclose his organization's ties to the Wuhan lab and his interests in the research performed there, Daszak worked both in public and behind the scenes to organize a campaign to discredit the lab-leak theory.

Publicly, Daszak has made misleading statements about the nature of the work conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused those who've suggested it's possible the virus leaked from the lab there of promoting conspiracy theories.

Privately, he led a campaign to give the appearance of authoritative scientific weight to his preferred natural origin hypothesis and ostracize opposing views. Last year, Daszak organized and drafted a statement signed by 27 prominent public health scientists that denounced ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" The letter contained a declaration by the authors of no competing interests, despite Daszak's personal interest in ensuring that the research he supported in Wuhan continued uninterrupted by accusations that it caused the COVID-19 pandemic.



The statement was published by the Lancet in February 2020 and became the dominant media narrative about the origins of the virus throughout 2020. Big tech social media companies took action to de-platform all dissenting opinions, labeling claims that contradicted the ""science"" as ""misinformation."" As Vanity Fair noted in its explosive report on the various investigations into the origins of the virus, the Lancet statement ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

On Monday, the Lancet published an addendum acknowledging Daszak's potential conflicts of interest regarding the February 2020 statement.

""In this letter, the authors declared no competing interests. Some readers have questioned the validity of this disclosure, particularly as it relates to one of the authors, Peter Daszak,"" the Lancet wrote. ""In line with guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, medical journals ask authors to report financial and non-financial relationships that may be relevant to interpreting the content of their manuscript.

""There may be differences in opinion as to what constitutes a competing interest. Transparent reporting allows readers to make judgments about these interests. Readers, in turn, have their own interests that could influence their evaluation of the work in question,"" the journal stated, adding that it invited each of the 27 authors of the February 2020 letter to ""re-evaluate their competing interests.""

The Lancet then provided an updated disclosure statement from Daszak (edited for readability):

[Peter Daszak]'s remuneration is paid solely in the form of a salary from EcoHealth Alliance, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation. EcoHealth Alliance's mission is to develop science-based solutions to prevent pandemics and promote conservation. Funding for this work comes from a range of US Government funding agencies and non-governmental sources. All past and current funders are listed publicly, and full financial accounts are filed annually and published.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China was previously funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Neither PD nor EcoHealth Alliance have received funding from the People's Republic of China.



PD joined the WHO–China joint global study on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 towards the end of 2020 and is currently a member. As per WHO rules, this work is undertaken as an independent expert in a private capacity, not as an EcoHealth Alliance staff member. The work conducted by this study was published in March, 2021.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China includes collaboration with a range of universities and governmental health and environmental science organisations, all of which are listed in prior publications, three of which received funding from US federal agencies as part of EcoHealth Alliance grants or cooperative agreements, as publicly reported by NIH. EcoHealth Alliance's work in China is currently unfunded. All federally funded subcontractees are assessed and approved by the respective US federal agencies in advance and all funding sources are acknowledged in scientific publications as appropriate.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China involves assessing the risk of viral spillover across the wildlife–livestock–human interface, and includes behavioural and serological surveys of people, and ecological and virological analyses of animals. This work includes the identification of viral sequences in bat samples, and has resulted in the isolation of three bat SARS-related coronaviruses that are now used as reagents to test therapeutics and vaccines. It also includes the production of a small number of recombinant bat coronaviruses to analyse cell entry and other characteristics of bat coronaviruses for which only the genetic sequences are available.



NIH reviewed the planned recombinant virus work and deemed it does not meet the criteria that would warrant further specific review by its Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3CO) committee.



All of EcoHealth Alliance's work is reviewed and approved by appropriate research ethics committees, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Review Boards for biomedical research involving human subjects, P3CO oversight administrators, and biosafety committees, as listed on all relevant publications.

Dr. Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economics professor and the the chairman of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission, wrote a related op-ed Tuesday explaining the state of the debate on the origins of the virus. While the op-ed does not mention Daszak by name, it does discuss the issues the commission will consider in its investigation of the origins of the virus, from which Daszak recused himself, and states: ""The Commission's overriding aim is to recommend policies to prevent and contain future disease outbreaks, and its technical work will be conducted by independent experts who were not themselves involved directly in the US-China research under scrutiny. The scientists who were involved should explain fully the nature of their work.""



Sachs emphasized that both the lab-leak hypothesis and the natural origin hypothesis ""are viable at this stage of the investigation.""

""Those who have claimed that a natural origin is the only viable hypothesis overlook the extensive research activity that was underway in the field and in laboratories on SARS-like viruses, including in Wuhan, China, where the first outbreak was identified, and in the United States,"" Sachs wrote. ""Those who claim that a research-related infection is the only viable hypothesis overlook the frequency of natural zoonotic transmissions of viruses, such as the SARS outbreak. There are many ways that a natural event could have occurred with SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in China and then been brought to Wuhan by an infected individual or an animal brought to market.""

He clarified that research seeking to prove the virus has natural origins remains inconclusive. It's still possible that the virus was transmitted to humans from some animal, though scientists have not yet identified an animal host. It's also possible that the virus originated from coronavirus research without being artificially created, which would be the case if a researcher contracted it in the field, brought it back to the lab, developed mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, and it spread from there.

The third possibility is that the virus was engineered in the Wuhan lab through gain-of-function research, which involves modifying viruses to be more transmissible among humans.

""The public and policy community have become increasingly aware of the intensive research on SARS-like viruses that was underway in the US, China, and elsewhere, both in collecting viral samples from the field and in studying their infectivity and pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) in the laboratory,"" Sachs wrote. ""We have learned that much of this work can be classified as 'gain of function' (GoF) research ... Experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) involving the modification of bat-origin coronaviruses to express proteins that are likely to enhance entry into human cells are viewed by many scientists as falling squarely into the category of GOFROC.""

Sachs acknowledged that the NIH funded U.S. and Chinese scientists to work collaboratively on collecting SARS-like viruses, taking them back to the Wuhan lab for study, though he did not mention EcoHealth Alliance by name.

""If there was indeed a laboratory-related release of SARS-CoV-2, it may well have occurred in a project funded by the US government, using methods developed and championed by US scientists, and as part of a US-led and US-financed program to collect and analyze potentially dangerous viruses, including in China,"" Sachs wrote.

He called on the NIH and on the Chinese government to release more information on the research that was funded and conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also called for ""an international and independent investigation"" to learn the truth and for both the U.S. and Chinese governments to cooperate ""fully and transparently"" with such an inquiry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lab-leak-ecohealth-alliance-president-recuses-self-covid-investigation,2021-06-22
Scientists who rejected lab-leak theory publish second Lancet letter doubling down on claims,"Twenty-four of the 27 prominent public health scientists who were signatories of an influential letter that condemned the COVID-19 lab-leak hypothesis as a ""conspiracy theory"" have signed a new statement doubling down on their claims that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in nature.

The new letter published in the Lancet on Monday asserted that there is no ""scientifically validated evidence that directly supports"" the lab-leak hypothesis while ""new, credible, and peer-reviewed evidence"" cited suggests ""that the virus evolved in nature."" The letter also defended the ""integrity"" of Chinese scientists working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, some of whom have been accused of deleting key data that could help identify the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

""On Feb 19, 2020, we, a group of physicians, veterinarians, epidemiologists, virologists, biologists, ecologists, and public health experts from around the world, joined together to express solidarity with our professional colleagues in China,"" the letter began. ""Unsubstantiated allegations were being raised about the source of the COVID-19 outbreak and the integrity of our peers who were diligently working to learn more about the newly recognised virus, SARS-CoV-2, while struggling to care for the many patients admitted to hospital with severe illness in Wuhan and elsewhere in China.

""Recently, many of us have individually received inquiries asking whether we still support what we said in early 2020,"" the scientists wrote. ""The answer is clear: we reaffirm our expression of solidarity with those in China who confronted the outbreak then, and the many health professionals around the world who have since worked to exhaustion, and at personal risk, in the relentless and continuing battle against this virus.""

Among the signatories is EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak, who's nonprofit organization provided the Wuhan Institute of Virology with federal funding from the National Institute of Health to conduct coronavirus research. Daszak is a forceful critic of the lab-leak hypothesis, but last month he recused himself from the Lancet COVID-19 Commission's investigation into the origins of the virus because of his ties to the Wuhan lab.



Debate over the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus centers on two main theories. The first is that the virus occurred naturally, was carried by an animal host, and evolved to become transmissible among human beings. But since the pandemic began, scientists have been unable to find a sample of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nature and have failed to identify an animal host, leading many to consider an alternative theory.

The second hypothesis is based on the fact that Chinese researchers at the Wuhan lab were conducting risky experiments with coronaviruses in potentially unsafe conditions. These gain-of-function experiments involved genetically manipulating viruses to make them more transmissible among humans in order to study how pathogens might evolve to become a threat to human life. The hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 or one of its progenitors was created artificially in the Wuhan lab and somehow was leaked, leading to a global pandemic.

If true, the lab-leak hypothesis would mean that the federal government and Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance were possibly responsible for funding the research that led to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Throughout most of 2020, the lab-leak hypothesis was attacked as a ""conspiracy theory"" by mainstream media outlets. Discussion of the Wuhan lab's role in the origins of the virus was censored on social media and discouraged by National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci and other prominent public health experts.

Behind the scenes, many of these same experts coordinated acampaign to discredit the lab-leak theory. Daszak drafted and recruited several of the scientists who signed the original Feb. 19, 2020, Lancet letter denouncing ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" The 27 scientists who signed this statement proclaimed that individuals questioning the supposed natural origin of COVID-19 were creating ""fear, rumours, and prejudice.""

As recounted by Vanity Fair in a bombshell exposé on the efforts to discover the origins of the virus, the first Lancet letter ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

It wasn't until a year since the pandemic began that scientists' failure to find conclusive evidence proving the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2 made consideration of the lab-leak hypothesis mainstream.

In this second Lancet letter, Daszak and 22 of the original Lancet signatories pushed back, accusing lab-leak proponents of making ""allegations and conjecture"" to support their hypothesis, rather than relying on peer-reviewed research.

The letter cited several peer-reviewed studies supporting the natural origins hypothesis.

""It is time to turn down the heat of the rhetoric and turn up the light of scientific inquiry if we are to be better prepared to stem the next pandemic, whenever it comes and wherever it begins,"" the scientists wrote, welcoming ""scientifically rigorous investigations"" into the origins of the virus.

Notably, Dr. Peter Palese, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, did not sign the second letter. Palese was an original signatory of the February 2020 letter, but last month said ""disturbing information has surfaced"" since he signed the letter, which necessitated further investigation into the origins of the pandemic.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lancet-letter-scientists-double-down-denying-lab-leak-theory,2021-07-07
"America's largest teachers' union poured tens of millions into political causes last year, spent comparatively little on members","America's largest teachers' union, the National Education Association, spent twice as much on politics-related expenses as it did on its own members last year, according to an analysis of the union's financial disclosures.

In a report published Thursday, the Washington Examiner shared details of an analysis of the union's filings produced by the right-to-work nonprofit organization Americans for Fair Treatment that appeared to show the NEA's overt mission to sway the nation's politics.

In its analysis, the nonprofit reportedly found that during the 2020-2021 fiscal year, the NEA, which boasts more than 3 million members, ""donated $66 million to political activities and another $117 million to 'contributions, gifts, and grants' that were primarily political donations.""

The $66 million in political donations amounted to 18% of the union's $374 million budget for 2020-2021, while the $117 million in ""contributions, gifts, and grants"" amounted to 32% of its expenditures. Meanwhile, just 9% of the union's budget was spent on direct assistance to members.

The exorbitant amount of political spending, the group said, shows where the union's ""priorities lie.""

It also comes as parents across the country become increasingly concerned over the teaching of progressive ideologies such as critical race theory and gender fluidity in schools.

""The National Education Association’s political and charitable spending in 2020-2021 makes the NEA look more like a political organization than a membership organization,"" Americans for Fair Treatment said in a statement to the Examiner. ""The union spent $2 on politics for every $1 it spent on representing its members.""

Furthermore, many of the NEA's political donations were sent to political action committees representing Democratic candidates or to liberal advocacy groups, Americans for Fair Treatment noted.

For example, the union sent more than $8 million to the State Engagement Fund and the Strategic Victory Fund, organizations that funnel money to left-wing political groups and Democratic candidates. It also donated $1 million to Future Forward USA Action, a PAC that supported President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.

Based on statements posted on the NEA's website and social media accounts, it is clear which political party the union supports.

The NEA's president, Becky Pringle, recently released a statement celebrating the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, calling Jackson's story ""the story of all of us who have overcome great obstacles in the pursuit of making our country a better, more equitable place for all.""

According to the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm, in the past, the NEA has supported controversial causes such as Black Lives Matter, the teaching of critical race theory in classrooms, taxpayer-funded reparations, and abortion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/largest-teachers-union-political-spending,2022-04-08
Larry Elder considers mounting a presidential bid,"Larry Elder is thinking seriously about mounting a White House bid.

Last year, Elder ran for California governor during the Golden State's gubernatorial recall election. He earned far more votes than any of the other candidates vying for the opportunity to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, but the governor ultimately survived the recall after a majority of voters declined to oust him from office. Newsom is currently running for reelection in California's 2022 gubernatorial contest.

Elder, who writes a column and has authored multiple books, departed from his role as a talk radio show host with the Salem Radio Network earlier this year. He is also the executive producer of ""Uncle Tom II,"" a documentary which follows after the 2020 film ""Uncle Tom.""

During an interview on CSPAN's Book TV, Elder noted that he is strongly considering a presidential run.

He said that it is not that he thinks he could ""displace"" former President Donald Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, if they pursue the presidency. ""But I've got some things to say. And the major thing is the breakdown of the American nuclear family,"" Elder explained. ""The welfare state has, in my opinion, incentivized women to marry the government and incentivized men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility.""

DeSantis is currently running for reelection in Florida, but has not announced plans for a presidential bid. Former President Donald Trump is widely expected to run again in 2024, though he has not made an official announcement yet.



""I don't feel I'm running against him,"" Elder told the Des Moines Register. ""I'm running for president. And I'm not running against anybody on the Republican side. I'm running against Joe Biden, if he runs, or Kamala Harris, if she runs."" He noted that he is ""kicking the tires"" in the state of Iowa as he mulls a bid for higher office.

Elder spoke at an Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition event on Saturday, according to the outlet. Last month, he attended the Iowa State Fair.

“If you're going to run for president … the Iowa State Fair is kind of a rite of passage,"" Elder told the Daily Wire. ""So I went, and I was kind of overwhelmingly surprised by the gracious reception. I met with the governor of Iowa. I met with (the) lieutenant governor. I met with a number of local politicians, and I met with some pretty deep-pocketed donors. Nobody felt that it was an outlandish kind of thing to consider.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/larry-elder-considers-presidential-run,2022-09-19
Lawsuit demanding that more than 10% of election inspectors be Republicans thrown out by Whitmer-appointed judge,"A Whitmer-appointed judge dismissed a Republican lawsuit that claimed election officials in Flint, Michigan, hired too few Republican election inspectors. Consequently, nearly 90% of election inspectors entrusted with administering and overseeing the election will be partisan actors belonging to a single political party.

Republican concerns, Democrat overrepresentation

The Michigan Republican Party and the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit in the 7th Circuit Court for Genesee County on Oct. 28, seeking a court order that would require election officials to hire more Republican election workers.



The lawsuit claimed that Flint's interim city clerk Davina Donahue, city attorney William Kim, and city assessor Stacey Kaake failed to ensure a fair number of election inspectors from both parties in accordance with Michigan law.

Michigan Election Law specifies that the ""board of election commissioners shall appoint at least 1 election inspector from each major political party and shall appoint an equal number, as nearly as possible, of election inspectors in each election precinct from each major political party.""

The Detroit Free Press reported that figures provided by the city's attorney indicate that only 120 of 680 election workers (roughly 17%) hired to work in the upcoming midterm are Republicans.

The lawsuit claimed that notwithstanding the Michigan GOP's provision of 122 Republican applications sent to the former city clerk in May (who resigned amid scandal on Sept. 30), there only wound up being 49 Republican election inspectors during the state's August primary, for which there were 442 Democrat election inspectors.

According to MLive, the Michigan GOP reached out to the former city clerk in September with another list of Republicans keen to work on the election but was told on Oct. 15 that only 57 (10%) of the 562 election inspectors would be Republicans.

Ron Weiser, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, stated, ""Corrupt Democrats in elected office continue to change the rules or not follow the rules, and that’s unacceptable. We believe this blatant attempt to skirt the law will negatively impact our elections, and we’re not going to stand for it.""

RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said, ""Michigan election law clearly states that election commissioners have a responsibility to hire an equal partisan breakdown of election inspectors, but Flint has hired hundreds more Democrats than Republicans.""

McDaniel added, ""This is unacceptable and unfair to Michigan voters.""

9:1 representation good enough for the equity party

On Nov. 2, Circuit Court Judge Mark Latchana rejected the Republicans' case, saying they lacked standing to bring the complaint under state law. Latchana agreed with the city that only the county chair of the Republican Party would be in a position to bring the complaint to court.

Gustavo Portela, communications director for the Michigan Republican Party, said, ""Flint has over 80% Democrat inspectors, and over 90% Democrat inspectors for the absentee vote counting boards. ... This is unacceptable.""



According to MLive, city attorneys claimed Flint had satisfied the requirements of the law, having appointed ""as nearly as possible"" an equal number even if the result was a ratio of 9 to 1.

The Republicans indicated they would appeal the ruling with only five days left to go until Election Day.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawsuit-demanding-that-more-than-10-of-election-inspectors-be-republicans-thrown-out-by-whitmer-appointed-judge,2022-11-03
Lawsuit pushes for permitted individuals to be able to carry pistols at Minnesota State Fair,"A lawsuit lodged by the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus and two individuals demands that people who are permitted to carry a pistol be allowed to do so while attending the Minnesota State Fair, which is slated to begin later this month.

In addition to the group, the plaintiffs include two individuals who plan to attend the State Fair. One of those plaintiffs is identified in the suit as a member of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus. The suit names as defendants Ramsey County, Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher and the State Agricultural Society.

According to the Associated Press, the suit contends that the State fair, which is run by the Minnesota State Agricultural Society, is subject to state laws that let people with permits carry their guns into the State Capitol and other public locations. The AP noted that the society's authority is derived from state statutes but that the society and the fair do not get public funds.

Documents filed in the suit included a July letter from a law firm representing the State Agricultural Society, which appeared to be a response to a June letter from counsel to the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus.

""The State Agricultural Society has the obligation and the authority to impose rules and policies that prioritize the health and safety of fairgoers,"" the letter noted. ""To that end, the State Agricultural Society has consistently maintained the policy that private citizens may not bring weapons onto the fairgrounds during the fair.""

Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher said in a statement that the State Agricultural Society determines the admission policies, according to KARE 11.



""The Ramsey County Sheriff's Office has law enforcement responsibility inside the State Fairgrounds once attendees have entered one of the public gates,"" Fletcher said.

""The State Fair does not comment on pending litigation,"" a Minnesota State Fair spokesperson said, according to KARE 11. ""We will maintain our time-honored Minnesota tradition of peaceful, family-friendly fairs by protecting the safety and security of our guests.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawsuit-pushes-for-permitted-individuals-to-be-able-to-carry-pistols-at-minnesota-state-fair,2021-08-11
AP reporter berates State Dept. spox on claim that Russians planned false flag operation in order to invade Ukraine,"Associated Press reporter Mike Lee berated State Department spokesperson Ned Price over a report that the Russians were planning a false flag operation in order to justify an invasion of Ukraine.

The report claimed that the Russians were planning to fake a mass attack on Russian-speaking people in Ukraine in order to give them a pretext to invade and retake the country.

""One possible option the Russians are considering, and which we made public today, involves the production of a propaganda video, a video with graphic scenes of false explosions, depicting corpses, crisis actors pretending to be mourners, and images of destroyed locations or military equipment, entirely fabricated by Russian intelligence,"" said Price at the media briefing Thursday.

""To be clear, the production of this video is one of a number of options that the Russian government is developing as a fake pretext to initiate and potentially justify military action against Ukraine,"" he added.

Lee and other reporters pressed Price to produce evidence of the claims against Russia beyond the word of the State Department.

""It is an action that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that,"" said Lee. ""What is the evidence that they've planned, I mean, this is like, crisis actors? Really? This is like Alex Jones territory that you're getting into now. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?""

""Matt this is derived from information known to the U.S. government, intelligence information that we have declassified,"" responded Price.

""Well OK? Where is it? Where is this information?"" interjected Lee.

""It is intelligence information that we have declassified,"" Price said.

""Well where is it, where is the declassified information?"" Lee asked.

""I just delivered it,"" Price laughed.

""No, you made a series of allegations and statements,"" replied Lee. ""That's not evidence, that's you saying it, that's not evidence, I'm sorry.""

The situation devolved into a yelling match about whether Price's statements should be constituted as evidence of the accusations made against Russia. Price later fired back that Lee was more willing to trust Russia than the U.S. and its allies.

""If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" said Price.

Other reporters then pressed Price in the same way Lee did.

""The facts that we are able to go into such great detail, obviously I am not going to spell out what is in our possession, but I will leave, I will leave it to your judgement,"" said Price to another reporter.

""There are no facts that you've spelled out!"" interjected Lee.

""We are making clear what we know so that in the event it does take place, it will be clear to the world what this actually was and what it was not,"" explained Price later on.

Price tweeted about the heated exchange and praised Lee despite their disagreement.

""Clearly, he’s no one’s dupe, and I’d never want to suggest otherwise. Nothing but respect for him, which I underscored in a call to him after the briefing,"" tweeted Price.

Russia has amassed more than a hundred thousand troops outside of the border of Ukraine, sparking fears of a military invasion with the intent reconquer the country that was once part of the former Soviet empire.

President Joe Biden has more than once intimated that he believes an invasion is imminent. The statements have elicited bitter recriminations from Ukraine officials who have warned him against spreading rumor and panic.

Left-wing activist calls out Clint Eastwood for his joke almost 50 years ago at Oscars that 'mocked' Native American actress. It's a cancel culture fail.,"You may have notice that Clint Eastwood — the iconic 91-year-old actor and director who's still going strong — was put on blast this week by a left-wing activist who called out Eastwood for a joke he uttered at the Academy Awards

The 1973 Academy Awards, to be exact.

Yup, it seems progressive blue-check activist Rafael Shimunov tried cashing in his cancel culture chips by rewinding the tape and letting all his 50,000-plus Twitter followers know that Eastwood ""mocked"" a Native American actress at the gala event 48 years ago.

What are the details?

Actor Marlon Brando made headlines refusing to accept his Best Actor Oscar for his work in ""The Godfather"" — Brando didn't even show up — and having Sacheen Littlefeather speak out in his place regarding treatment of Native Americans in Hollywood.

Littlefeather told the crowd that Brando ""very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry.""

With that the audience members began to murmur before a number of them booed while others clapped: ""Excuse me,"" Littlefeather told the crowd before it quieted down and she continued.

""And on television, in movie reruns, and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee,"" she added. ""I beg at this time that I have not intruded upon this evening and that we will, in the future — our hearts and our understandings — will meet with love and generosity. Thank you on behalf of Marlon Brando.""

The cameras soon turned to Eastwood — known at the time for his roles in the ""Dirty Harry"" movies as well as numerous westerns such as ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" — so he could present the award. And he made a joke.

""I don't know if I should present this award, on behalf of all the cowboys shot in all the John Ford Westerns over the years,"" Eastwood said to mild chuckles.

How did folks react?

Well, as you might expect there were a fair number of commenters who agreed with Shimunov's sentiments, but others found it petty and ridiculous that he went back nearly 50 years to make a case against Eastwood:

""Y'all are digging this up again?"" one commenter said. ""It is pretty obvious at this point that you are in perpetual need of something to get offended by and virtue signal how much better you supposed[ly] are than everyone else. Meanwhile, normal people collectively yawn.""

""You think you're doing something important by 'exposing' A FAMOUS incident from 48 years ago (it was before you were born so I'll give you a pass on not knowing about until today) but I promise you you're not going to cancel Clint Eastwood,"" another user said with a laughing emoji. ""He's 91 and doesn't have Twitter.""

""This was 48 years ago. Are people just looking for anyone & anything to tear down?"" another commenter asked. ""I was alive then & knew about this & somehow I've managed to live a wonderful life since. I consider 'Unforgiven' one of the best westerns. Please, people, pick your battles. This is a molehill.""

""Rafael, your little coup against Eastwood failed,"" another user declared. ""What a life, the guy make big movies in Hollywood for [a] living, you... spend your day on Twitter and Google finding things from 48 yrs ago to bring hate on today's impressionable youth, and that makes you feel good...wow...""

""What is wrong with you? STOP trying to ruin people because of misdeeds or poor judgement from 40 years ago,"" another commenter asserted. ""Babe Ruth smoked BTW, and he helped orphaned kids like himself. Do we ruin him because he was a poor role model? So cowardly, just unbelievable.""

Given the degree to which Eastwood is revered and lauded by left-wing Hollywood — and that actors, producers, screenwriters, and movie studios have been jumping at the chance to work with him for the last 30 years since he's been on the director's chair — it seems unlikely that woke power brokers in Tinseltown are going to light their torches and go after Eastwood any time soon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-activist-cancel-clint-eastwood-joke-50-years-ago,2021-10-15
Left-wing CNN anchor: Fox News hosts decry 'sacrilege' of their burned Christmas tree — but believe Capitol riots 'not such a big deal',"CNN's left-winganchor Brianna Keilar ripped Fox News hosts Thursday morning in a decidedly smug commentary, saying that they've been overzealous covering the ""sacrilege"" of Christmas tree set on fire outside their Manhattan offices this week — while also viewing the Jan. 6 Capitol riots as ""not such a big deal.""

What are the details?

Keilar began her segment noting that the Fox News' Christmas tree ""went up in flames"" in ""an act of arson at a time where crime in America is escalating.""

She then insisted that CNN ""covered this story as a crime"" and added that Fox News also did so — ""extensively."" In fact, Keilar said, Fox News made their burned tree “the centerpiece of their news day.""

After a montage of Fox News hosts commenting on the crime, the camera turned back to Keilar: “Now, no one was injured in this incident. But they could have been. This is a serious incident. Obviously it's incredibly scary to feel that your workplace is under attack, unless ...""

Video of the Capitol riots briefly ran, and then the camera turned back to Keilar, who continued her sentence: ""...your workplace is the Capitol. Then, according to many, many Fox hosts, it’s not such a big deal.”

Then more video ran showing Fox New hosts seeming to downplay the Capitol riots, after which Keilar went in the for kill.

“At Fox, when the target is a Christmas tree at their workplace, it is a sacrilege,” she began. “But when the target is the seat of American democracy, it’s not.""

Keilar added: ""The whole of Congress, as they certify a presidential election that was fair and secure; when the perpetrators are [then-President Donald] Trump supporters in the thousands, four of whom died that day; when the victims are police officers, 140 of whom were injured, and when five police officers have died in the wake of the attack, including four by suicide; when Fox's own colleagues had to take cover inside the Capitol complex on January 6, Fox downplays the attack. And in many cases, flat-out doesn't cover it; ignores that it ever happened.""

Oh, but she wasn't done.

""Just imagine if Fox hosts could muster for an armed attack on the Capitol the same outrage that they did for their Christmas tree,"" Keilar concluded. ""Perhaps some of the almost half of Republicans who think January 6 was a legitimate protest might actually see it for what it really was.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-cnn-anchor-fox-news-hosts-decry-sacrilege-of-their-burned-christmas-tree-but-believe-capitol-riots-not-such-a-big-deal,2021-12-09
Left-wing writer gets skewered for saying 'white men' have been acting like 'victims' ever since the Vietnam War,"Progressive magazine New Republic last week published a book review titled ""The White Men Who Wanted to Be Victims.""

The reviewer, Chris Lehmann, heaps praise upon Joseph Darda's tome, ""How White Men Won the Culture Wars: A History of Veteran America,"" calling it ""eye-opening"" and an ""original and persuasive revisionist study.""

Lehmann also gleefully declares that when it comes to ""cancel culture, wokeness, and the like,"" the ""loudest and most visible partisans in these battles are aggrieved white men, insisting that they're scapegoats in unhinged identity-driven witch hunts and eagerly putting themselves forward as martyrs in ugly confrontations over free speech.""

The central argument is that beginning with the Vietnam War ""aggrieved"" white men have been playing ""a discriminated-against minority"" — and among the pop-culture examples is Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo character, particularly in 1985's ""Rambo: First Blood Part 2"" in which the ""aggrieved"" Vietnam veteran issues bloody payback against all of his overseas opponents.

Here's how Lehmann puts it:

Stallone's title character is dispatched back to Vietnam on a POW rescue mission and delivers his signature catchphrase in reply to the officer briefing him: ""Sir, do we get to win this time?"" The movie script also goes out of its way to give the character of Rambo a new ethnic identity that hadn't been referenced in the franchise's debut film or in the novel that formed the basis of the Rambo series: He's made half-Native American. As Darda notes, Rambo's manufactured Indigenous backstory gave a character played by a white actor a way to co-opt a narrative of discrimination: ""The white ethnic revival had made white minorities the most American thing of all.… In the 1980s, that meant a white actor starring as a half-Indian soldier—a minoritization that, as simulated rather than embodied, allowed all white men to see themselves reflected in it.""

Reaction is brutal

In the aftermath, New Republic posted a tweet Wednesday noting Lehmann's ""The White Men Who Wanted to Be Victims"" review — and the backlash and ratio-ing has been severe so far. As of Thursday afternoon, the tweet has attracted 964 comments compared to only 42 likes.

Here's what some of the commenters had to say to Lehmann — and in fairness likely to Darda and the New Republic:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-writer-skewered-white-victims,2021-05-27
Leftists apoplectic as Utah bans 'gender-affirming' care for minors,"Gov. Spencer Cox (R-Utah) signed legislation Saturday banning ""gender-affirming"" health care for minors, making Utah the first state in 2023 to do so.

""Legislation that impacts our most vulnerable youth requires careful consideration and deliberation. ... More and more experts, states and countries around the world are pausing these permanent and life-altering treatments for new patients until more and better research can help determine the long-term consequences,"" Cox tweeted Saturday.

""We sincerely hope that we can treat our transgender families with more love and respect as we work to better understand the science and consequences behind these procedures,"" Cox added.



The newly signed legislation, S.B. 16, will become effective on May 3, 2023. It will prospectively prohibit minors with gender dysphoria from being subjected to body-mutilating surgeries and other medical interventions. The bill will ""place an indefinite moratorium on their access to puberty blockers and hormone therapy,"" NBC reported.

""Playing with trucks and rough-housing with friends does not make your daughter a boy. It just makes them unique; it makes them creative. It does not require corrective action in the form of sterilization,"" 18-year-old Chloe Cole said in her testimony on Utah's related H.B. 132.



California-based Cole, a biological female, describes herself as a ""former trans kid"" who had puberty blockers at 13 and a double mastectomy at 15. Cole is now de-transitioning.

Activists in favor of subjecting children to these physiologically and psychologically damaging procedures, some of which involve chemical and/or physical castration, expressed discontent with the decision.

Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall offered an apology to Utah's gender-dysphoric youth. ""This is wrong and it isn't fair. I'm sorry this is happening to you. You are loved. I stand with you,"" the 42-year-old Democrat tweeted Friday.

Echoing Mendenhall, Dr. Jack Turban decried Utah legislators' decision, suggesting they had overstepped their bounds by countering assorted health organizations' stance on the matter. The membership of these organizations, notably, stand to benefit financially from the ongoing care children subjected to these procedures will require.

Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called the bill ""brutally unfair"" and says it will face a legal challenge. ""We are preparing a challenge,"" Minter told Law Dork, adding that the ACLU of Utah and NCLR will file a lawsuit ""as soon as we can.""

"Leftists lash out at 'cowards' in RNC for threat to prohibit Republican candidates from participating in presidential, VP debates due to bias against GOP","After the Republican National Committee on Thursday threatened the Commission on Presidential Debates that it would ""prohibit future GOP nominees from participating in future CPD-sponsored debates"" over what the RNC sees as unfairness and bias against Republicans, leftists predictably lashed out.

Who said what?

Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison tweeted that “Republicans can’t win a fair fight and they know it"":

Joy Behar — loyal leftist co-host of ""The View"" — asked in a tweet, ""Are they afraid that their candidates can’t keep up?""

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki — when asked for a reaction to the news — quipped that ""it's a question best posed to the RNC on what they’re so afraid of"":

Veteran Democratic politico Jon Cooper asked, ""Who agrees these Republican cowards FEAR THE TRUTH?""

Journalist David Leavitt concluded that GOP candidates ""don’t want to answer critical questions"":

New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen surmised that the GOP ""wants out"" of ""a common world of fact, about which candidates for president can be questioned"":

Columnist Tim O'Brien tweeted that the RNC's move is ""another example of Republicans’ antipathy toward public institutions and civic processes leading them to just…walk away. Doesn’t bode well for accountability or transparency"":

Comedian Titus attempted to summarize the RNC's stance like so: ""Alright guys, our candidates can’t form complete sentences, answer questions or think on their feet, so instead of finding good candidates, let’s refuse to let the morons speak, cool?""

Writer Molly Jong-Fast said the RNC's decision ""makes me think the GOP is doubling down on its anti-democratic instincts"":

Nick Knudsen, executive director of nonprofit DemCast, echoed Jong-Fast's sentiments: ""The GOP is fully withdrawing from democracy"":

Anything else?

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted in regard to her letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates said that ""for years"" the organization that's supposed to be nonpartisan ""has shown bias against Republicans. Since they continue to stonewall commonsense reforms, the RNC is leveling the playing field to make debates fair for future nominees.""

Among the reforms the RNC wants:

term limits on the CPD's board of directors;

hold at least one debate prior to the start of early voting;

create a code of conduct for CPD officials prohibiting them from making public statements about candidates or taking part in political activities with candidates;

establish criteria for disqualifying debate moderators with conflict of interest regarding candidates; and

establish a code of conduct for debate moderators in regard to what extent they will interact with nominees.

In the 2020 debates between then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump, it would seem that the moderators made more headlines than they should have.

In the first debate, moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked Trump to condemn ""white supremacists and right-wing militia"" even though Trump had done so repeatedly and even vowed the week before to designate the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist organization. However, Wallace didn't ask Biden to condemn Antifa — and Biden, in fact, actually claimed during the debate that the violent leftist group is ""an idea, not an organization."" Interestingly, Wallace announced last month his departure from Fox News to join CNN.

The CPD tapped Steve Scully — then-political editor for C-SPAN — to moderate the second Trump-Biden debate, but it was soon reported that Scully had served as an intern for then-Sen. Joe Biden in college and later worked on the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy's staff. What's more, C-SPAN suspended Scully after he admitted he lied about his Twitter feed being hacked in regard to a question he posted to former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci after Trump accused Scully of being a ""nevertrumper."" Soon the second debate was canceled after Trump complained about the format being changed to a virtual event due to the coronavirus pandemic.

And despite a report that the third debate moderator, Kristen Welker — chief White House correspondent for NBC News — has deep ties to the Democratic Party, she won high praise from both sides of the aisle for her job moderating the third debate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftists-lash-out-rnc-threat-presidential-debates,2022-01-14
Legal immigrants to help pay for illegal migrants to seek asylum in US,"On Tuesday, the Biden administration's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a new proposal that would significantly increase permit fees for legal immigrants to help cover costs related to the backlog of asylum cases that resulted from record-high illegal immigration.



According to the USCIS, the fee adjustments are forecasted to generate between $5.2 billion to $6.4 billion in yearly revenue. The department's current fee schedule is expected to yield roughly $3.28 billion yearly in 2022 and 2023.

USCIS noted that the extra $1.9 billion per year will be ""needed"" to ""fully recover the cost of all expenses and meet projected demand for services.""

The new fee schedule ""represents a 40-percent overall weighted average increase to ensure full cost recovery."" The last time the Department of Homeland Security adjusted fees in 2016, it implemented a weighted average increase of 21%.

Additional fees would apply to permits, visas, and green cards. For example, H-1B pre-application fees jumped from $10 to $215, a 2050% increase. Additionally, employers will be expected to pay a new $600 Asylum Program Fee for work visa applications.

The proposal states that the extra funds will go towards 7,778 additional staff, annual employee pay raises, contact cost increases, technology maintenance and refresh, customer service, new officer training, FOIA responses, refugee resettlement, and the ""Asylum Processing Rule.""

The USCIS estimates that $425.9 million will be allocated to ""fund more asylum officers adjudicating credible fear and reasonable fear claims at the border."" In addition, approximately $1,165.7 million will be used to hire more staff, and another $149 million will be used for annual raises.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 2.3 million migrants at the southern border in the fiscal year 2022.

Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported that, due to backlogs, asylum-seeking applicants must wait, on average, 4.3 years to appear in court. TRAC estimated that at least 1.6 million asylum cases are waiting for a scheduled court date.

""In addition to improving customer service operations and managing the incoming workload, USCIS must continue to fulfill our growing humanitarian mission, upholding fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve,"" USCIS Director Ur M.

University chaplain says 'vaccination is a citizenship obligation' and the unvaccinated should face a monetary penalty or other form of 'mandatory option for alternative service',"Lehigh University professor of religion studies and university chaplain Lloyd Steffen has written an opinion piece in which he contends that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a ""citizenship obligation"" and that those who duck their duty should face some sort of obligatory alternative.

Steffen wrote that ""those who refuse vaccination should be viewed as owing a debt of obligation to society. What needs to be thought through are the ways the unvaccinated can meet this obligation.""

""Whatever options might be considered, the focus should be on the fact that vaccination is a citizenship obligation, which persons should accept not only for their own wellbeing but for that of others. The plea for vaccination exemption should be met with a mandatory option for 'alternative service,' some burden comparable to that accepted by conscientious objectors who refused military service,"" he opined.

Steffen floated the idea of charging the unvaccinated a monetary penalty.

""A financial penalty is perhaps the easiest option to contemplate,"" he wrote. ""Rather than paying persons to get vaccinated, unvaccinated persons should pay to meet the citizenship obligation they continue to bear. The unvaccinated should, in the interests of fairness, take on a financial burden as a moral equivalent to vaccination; an 'alternative service' option much like those who have in our nation’s history sought exemptions to military service through conscientious objection.""



He also suggested that if hospitals were to run out of space, they could boot the unvaccinated from beds in order to make room for the vaccinated.

""More difficult options might include hospital triage policies that would allow a vaccinated individual to take the bed of a nonvaccinated individual if there were no more beds available. This might meet a test of fairness, but it would be excruciating for health care workers to enact such a triage policy. Such options should be discussed, however, and the discussions themselves might inspire vaccination increases since they dramatically highlight the seriousness of the pandemic,"" Steffen wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lehigh-university-professor-says-vaccination-is-a-citizenship-obligation-and-the-unvaccinated-should-face-mandatory-option-for-alternative-service,2022-01-26
Riley Gaines reveals extreme discomfort in sharing locker room with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas,"A former NCAA swimmer is speaking out about the ""extreme discomfort"" she encountered while she was forced to share a locker room with transgender athlete Lia Thomas from the University of Pennsylvania.

Riley Gaines – who was a seven-time Tennessee State Champion in swimming – attended the University of Kentucky in 2018. Gaines was named to the All-SEC Second Team in her first two years, and named to the All-SEC First team in her junior and senior years. Gaines was lauded as ""one of the most decorated swimmers in program history.""

In March, Gaines competed against Lia Thomas – a biological male – in the 200 freestyle final at the NCAA Women’s Championships. Gaines tied Thomas for fifth place. However, the NCAA only had one fifth-place trophy. Gaines told the Daily Wire that Thomas was awarded the fifth-place trophy and Gaines was told that she would get her trophy in the mail. Gaines had to pose with a sixth-place trophy on the podium.

Gaines appeared on Wednesday’s episode of “Tucker Carlson Today” where she detailed her experience competing against a biological male who had transitioned.

""So not only were we forced to race against a male, we were forced to change in the locker room with one,"" Gaines told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. ""That’s not something we were forewarned about, which I don’t think is right in any means, changing in a locker room with someone who has different parts.""

""There’s extreme discomfort in the locker room, there’s kind of these grumbles,"" Gaines explained. ""Then we’re sitting there not even knowing who to talk to, who to complain to, because this kind of all happened behind the scenes and very discreetly.""

""[B]etter swimmers know if your better swimmers regardless of what school or what conference you're at,"" Gaines said. ""You compete internationally together. Even if you're not on the same collegiate team, you've probably been on teams together before.""



""All of a sudden, out of nowhere, there's this article posted that says, 'Lia Thomas, swimmer at UPenn, posts 1.41 200m freestyle,' which is a very, very fast time,"" the former University of Kentucky swimmer noted.

Gaines recalled, ""I kind of just went about my training because I was like, this is a good thing maybe, but, turns out, two weeks before our national championships, the NCAA announced Lia will be competing with the females, and I was just like, 'mind blown.'""

Gaines – who is one of the few NCCA athletes to publicly speak out against Thomas competing against women – described the atmosphere at the NCAA national championships as ""edgy.""

""The environment is nothing like I've ever seen before,"" Gaines revealed. ""People didn't really know what to say, who to say what to, how to feel. Obviously, I know how I felt and I knew how my teammates felt, but no one really wanted to talk about it.""



After Thomas captured a championship title in the first event, Gaines said the mood deteriorated.

""That next day we came back and the mood had shifted to where people were mad,"" Gaines remembered. ""There were tears, these poor ninth and seventeenth-place finishers who missed out on being named an all-American.""



Gaines slammed the NCAA for a ""huge lack of accountability"" in allowing a biological male to dominate female swimmers.

""I think people forget that women's sports were a protected group. The category was made because the playing field was not level by any means when you have them competing against men,"" Gaines expressed. ""And so obviously it was created to ensure that fairness. And now that we are kind of completely flipping that, it devalues what it was created for.""



""Once you start infringing upon something that people have fought so hard to get and something that I know, personally, I have dedicated essentially my whole life to, I'm allowed to think that's not okay and obviously not support that by any means,"" she declared.

Before speaking about the controversy, Gaines consulted people in her inner circle.

""I talked to my athletic director, I talked to my parents, and I was like, 'Are you all okay with this?' And they all said, 'Speak your heart, go for it,'"" Gaines said.

Since speaking her mind, Gaines said she received ""an influx of support all across the board.""

Gaines railed against her detractors, ""You have your couple of negative comments, but it's things calling me, like, 'transphobic' – which, if they say that, it just rolls right over my head because they're not listening to the message.""

Earlier this month, UPenn nominated Thomas for the ""Woman of the Year"" award.

Gaines bashed the NCAA, ""This is yet another slap in the face to women. First a female national title and now nominated for the pinnacle award in collegiate athletics. The NCAA has made this award worthless.""

This week, Thomas did not win the ""Woman of the Year"" award.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lia-thomas-swimmer-riley-gaines,2022-07-28
Trans swimmer Lia Thomas loses 'Woman of the Year' bid to biological female — and leftists suddenly act like it doesn't matter to them,"Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas earlier this month was nominated by the University of Pennsylvania to be in the running for the NCAA's ""Woman of the Year"" award for 2022.

But the controversial swimmer's bid came to end Monday when the NCAA announced its conference selections — and named Columbia University fencer Sylvie Binder as its pick for the Ivy League, Fox News said.

Now the field of award candidates has narrowed to 151, and the cable network said the Woman of the Year Selection Committee will choose 10 nominees from each division, and the top 30 will be announced in October.

Binder is a biological female, and conservatives like Republican U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee couldn't have been happier that Thomas is out of the running:

""Lia Thomas lost the bid for NCAA’s ‘Woman of the Year’ — maybe they finally figured out she isn’t a woman?"" Blackburn tweeted.

Readers of TheBlaze will recall that Blackburn in March asked then-U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson during her confirmation hearings if she could define the word ""woman."" Jackson said she couldn't because she's ""not a biologist.""

There was a reason behind Blackburn's question, as Thomas — a biological male — had been making big waves in the pool at the time, destroying biological female opponents on the way to becoming an Ivy League champion and the No. 1-ranked woman collegiate swimmer in the country.



In fact, just a few days before Blackburn grilled Jackson, Thomas won the NCAA women's 500-yard freestyle amid deepening controversy.

Along the way, leftists were in near lockstep support for Thomas displacing biological female swimmers — some in humiliating fashion — despite the left's traditional support for women.

But after Thomas was displaced in the running for ""Woman of the Year"" — by a biological female, no less — there hasn't seemed to be much outrage coming from the left. Hmm.

How is the left reacting?

In fact, annoyed reactions to Blackburn's tweet indicate leftists suddenly don't seem to care that their trans icon is out of the ""Woman of the Year"" running.

Here's one example: ""Or maybe winning one swim meet wasn't that impressive and not the end of society as some made it out to be,"" one commenter told Blackburn. ""Onto real issues that actually matter... What are you doing to address the rampant gun violence?""

Deflection, anyone?

The hilariously transparent ""Lia who?"" hits just kept on coming — as if commenters were working from the same list of talking points:

""What have you done so far to combat inflation or mass shootings?"" another lefty whined. ""While Democrats are busy actively working hard to solve these issues in our country, you and your party are busy getting outraged by masks, vaccines, pronouns, other people’s gender identities, and drag shows.""

""Could you focus on actual issues?"" another commenter parried. ""Don't be so insecure about how you identify.""

""Well I guess we can all rest easier now that you're certainly on top of such pressing issues facing our country,"" another user declared. ""Did you accept Rudy Giuliani's call to circumvent a free and fair election on Jan. 6?""

""Thanks for staying on top of critical issues for your constituents,"" another commenter noted.

""What have you done for the American people in the past 5 years, Marsha?"" another user asked. ""I've only seen you supporting a racist Russian operative, spewing hate, and making bad hairstyle choices.""

""Marsha, what does Lia Thomas receiving an award (or not) from the NCAA have to do with your 'work' as a United States Senator?"" another commenter wondered.

Now, that's just sad.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lia-thomas-woman-of-year,2022-07-27
Liberal independent candidate Mike Itkis releases sex movie,"A liberal New York congressional candidate hopes to raise his chances in the upcoming election by releasing his own sex tape.

Mike Itkis is a ""liberal independent"" candidate who desires to discharge Rep. Jerry Nadler (D) from holding the seat in New York’s 12th Congressional District. Itkis is running on a campaign that ""supports abortion rights, gun control, equal economic opportunities for everyone, strong social safety nets, and appropriate government control over markets to assure fair trade practices.""

Itkis – an Army cyber operations officer – is also a strong proponent of the rights of sex workers.

""One of my three primary goals is to advance sex positivity, including several proposals for legislation designed to explicitly protect sexual rights by ending government involvement in marriage, the right to not become a parent in case of pregnancy, a right for women to terminate an abortion, decriminalization of sex between consenting adults, a nation-wide definition of consent, and legalization of sex work,"" Itkis said.

To show that he is a hardened supporter of sex positivity, Itkis released a 13-minute video on the adult video website Pornhub. Itkis – a registered Democrat – starred in the sex movie with porn star Nicole Sage.

Itkis gushed about the X-rated movie, ""One of the most meaningful experiences of my life.""

""Creating the video significantly influenced my political platform, leading me to create the principles of sex work legalization, to speak about the complexities of consent, and the pros and cons of privacy considerations,"" Itkis revealed.

Itkis told New York's City & State publication, “If I would just talk about it, it wouldn’t demonstrate my commitment to the issue.""

The New York congressional candidate said the erotic video would serve as a “starting point for conversations about the equal value of married people and those who are not, the expansion on sexual rights beyond abortion, and finally, the need to provide all citizens the tools necessary to protect themselves online.”

“I’m very much an introvert,” Itkis claimed. ""I'm kind of a nerd who doesn’t like to be the center of attention if I can avoid it. But I thought the issues I’m trying to address are so important… I wanted to have my issues talked about in some way.""

Itkis slammed both political parties.

""The far right, led by the Supreme Court, has a negative view of sexual rights, pursuing the position that sex should only happen between a married man and woman, clearly leaving out multiple demographics such as single individuals, and people whom the 'traditional' marriage arrangement doesn’t work,"" he claimed. ""With this worldview in mind, modern conservatives are clearly opposed to sexually-explicit speech as well as research that doesn’t comply with their views.""

""Unfortunately, many Democrats have also opposed freedom of speech, contributing to 'cancel culture' and political correctness,"" he continued. ""Being born in the Soviet Union, I’m well aware of the consequences for people who deviate from the party line, and am strongly opposed to restrictions on speech because someone may be offended.""

Mike Zumbluskas – the Republican candidate running in New York’s 12th Congressional District – somewhat understood the public relations stunt by Itkis.

""You gotta do what you gotta do,"" Zumbluskas said. ""The media ignores everybody that’s not a Democrat in the city.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-independent-candidate-sex-movie,2022-10-15
Liberal legal commentator wants to trash the Constitution and start over: 'Slaver’s organizing document is trash',"Liberal lawyer Elie Mystal, who works as The Nation's justice correspondent, admitted Thursday that he wishes the entire United States Constitution could be trashed.



What did Mystal say?

During an interview with WPIX-TV, Mystal affirmed that he argues in his new book — ""Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy’s Guide to the Constitution"" — that the U.S. Constitution should be ""scrapped altogether.""

""If we could throw that out and start over with a new document that was more inclusive of everybody that was written by everybody — at no point have black people, brown people, or women had a say in actually writing the Constitution or the amendments to that constitution — if we could throw that out and have a delegation of all Americans to write a new one? I would be all for that,"" Mystal said.

Using South Africa as a modern example, Mystal said that when apartheid ended in South Africa, the country eliminated its apartheid-era constitution and drafted a completely new governing document.

""I don't think that's going to happen here,"" Mystal conceded. ""So, instead of that, what I'm really advocating for is that we interpret our constitution so that we extend justice and fairness and equality to all, as opposed to whatever the heck we do now.""

Does Mystal's criticism hold muster?

The Constitution does, in fact, extend justice and fairness and equality to all in its current form, via the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which says:

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Meanwhile, it is not true that black Americans and women have not had a say in shaping constitutional amendments.

While those who drafted and ratified the Constitution in the 1780s were white men, black Americans have been members of Congress since 1870 and women have been members of Congress since 1917. Black Americans and women were serving in state legislatures even earlier than their respective breakthrough dates in Congress.

Thus, because the ratification process for the Constitution requires approval from Congress and state legislatures, black Americans and women have had at least some say in shaping the majority of the Constitution's amendments.

Anything else?

In response to criticism of his comments on WPIX, Mystal said that he had triggered ""white wing media this morning by noting that their slaver's organizing document is trash.""

He also said that he could write a better constitution in just two weeks time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-legal-commentator-wants-to-trash-the-constitution-and-start-over,2022-03-03
Liberal ProPublica hits St. Jude charity that provides free health care for kids for not paying parents' mortgage and car payments,"The nonprofit ProPublica has published an investigative report detailing how St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is a mammoth fundraiser, provides free medical treatment for children, and yet does not pay for every single financial burden incurred by families struggling to care for their sick children.

St. Jude, based in Mepmhis, Tennessee, is the largest health care charity in the United States. The hospital costs an estimated $3.3 million per day to operate, but patients are not charged for the care they receive. Instead, the majority of the nonprofit's funding comes from generous donors, including celebrities and well-known public figures who feature in the hospitals advertisements.

ProPublica reports that St. Jude was recognized as the 10th-best children's cancer hospital by U.S. News & World Report and raised a record $2 billion last year — nearly as much as the other nine hospitals ahead of it raised combined. The report notes the hospital currently has another $5.2 billion in reserves, ""a sum large enough to run the institution at current levels for the next four and a half years without a single additional donation.""

Because of the overwhelming generosity of its donors, St. Jude promises that ""families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food — because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.""

But the report focuses on the expenses St. Jude does not cover, including ""housing, travel and food costs that fall outside the hospital's strict limits.""

While families may not receive a bill from St. Jude, the hospital doesn't cover what's usually the biggest source of financial stress associated with childhood cancer: the loss of income as parents quit or take leave from jobs to be with their child during treatment. For many families, the consequence is missed payments for cars, utilities and cellphones. Others face eviction or foreclosure because they can't keep up with rent and mortgage payments.



Parents at St. Jude have exhausted savings and retirement accounts, borrowed from family and friends or asked other charities for aid. ProPublica identified more than 100 St. Jude families seeking financial help through the online fundraiser GoFundMe, with half of the campaigns started in the past two years. We counted scores of other events like concerts and yard sales organized to help St. Jude families in need.

ProPublica reported that in the last five fiscal years, roughly half of the $7.3 billion St. Jude raised funded research and care for patients. About 30% of that figure covered operating expenses and the remaining 20%, $1 out of every $5 gifted, was put into the reserve fund.

""Further, ProPublica found, a substantial portion of the cost for treatment is paid not by St. Jude but by families' private insurance or by Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families,"" the outlet reported.

""About 90% of patients are insured, bringing in more than $100 million in reimbursements for treatment a year. If a family shows up at St. Jude without insurance, a company hired by the charity helps them find it. St. Jude does cover copays and deductibles, an unusual benefit.""

In a written response to ProPublica, lawyers for St. Jude and its fundraising arm, the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, highlighted how the research team at St. Jude is committed to finding cures for deadly childhood diseases and pointed out thousands of sick children have been treated for free over the years.

""This often comes as a huge relief to families who often expect to sell all their belongings just so their children can get the medical care and treatment they need to save their lives,"" the lawyers wrote. ""St. Jude and ALSAC understand that this arrangement cannot cover all financial obligations of all families, nor can St. Jude or ALSAC shield families from all the financial and emotional effects"" of a child's illness.

""ProPublica should be celebrating St. Jude and ALSAC for their commitment to finding cures, saving children's lives, and optimizing patient outcomes,"" the lawyers wrote.

The report received a fair amount of backlash on social media from readers who thought ProPublica was criticizing the charity unfairly.

But following ProPublica's reporting, St. Jude announced a ""dramatic expansion"" of the financial assistance it will provide to parents and other relatives during their child's stay at the hospital.

""Among the most significant changes are increasing travel benefits to two parents instead of one and covering regular trips to Memphis for siblings and other loved ones. St. Jude's letter to parents said the changes take effect Nov. 15,"" ProPublica reports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-propublica-hits-st-jude-charity-that-provides-free-health-care-for-kids-for-not-paying-parents-housing-and-food-bills,2021-11-12
Liberal journalist: There is 'no good reason' only citizens can vote,"A guest columnist for the New York Times argued this week that ""there is no good reason you should have to be a citizen to vote.""

According to the Times, the essay is ""part of a series exploring bold ideas to revitalize and renew the American experiment.""

Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, a New York-based progressive journalist and former senior editor of the Nation, claimed in an opinion piece Wednesday that ""it's time for Democrats to radically expand the electorate.""

How? First by granting permanent legal residents the right to vote. Why? Because, according to Abrahamian, they contribute as much to the country as any natural-born citizen.

""Nearly 15 million people living legally in the United States, most of whom contribute as much as any natural-born American to this country's civic, cultural and economic life, don't have a say in matters of politics and policy because we — resident foreign nationals, or 'aliens' as we are sometimes called — cannot vote,"" Abrahamian wrote.

According to her, the non-citizens who ought to be able to vote include ""people with green cards, people here on work visas, and those who arrived in the country as children and are still waiting for permanent papers.""

A permanent legal resident herself, Abrahamian argued that ""expanding the franchise in this way would give American democracy new life, restore immigrants' trust in government and send a powerful message of inclusion to the rest of the world.""



She casts it as an inspiring message of unity. But for those concerned with diluting the franchise, it is more than fair to wonder whether granting the right to vote to permanent legal residents is only the beginning. It's not hard to imagine how, after the franchise is expanded to include permanent residents, it could easily be expanded again and again.

Notwithstanding, the U.S. has adopted laws permitting only citizens to vote for a reason. Becoming a citizen ""should mean something,"" argued the New York Post Editorial Board in 2020:

An immigrant's affirmative decision to become a citizen is a vital acceptance of duties as well as privileges.



""I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty,"" reads the oath of allegiance for the newly naturalized. And ""I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic"" and ""bear true faith and allegiance to the same,"" including military service and other ""work of national importance"" as required by law.

The solemn oath is not one that someone should take lightly. It aims to isolate one's allegiance to the United States alone, over and above all foreign allegiances, in most cases.

That is a notion that Abrahamian clearly rejects. The journalist — who reportedly holds Swiss, Canadian, and Iranian citizenship — is also the author of a 2015 book titled, ""The Cosmopolites: The Coming Global Citizen.""



According to a summary posted online, in the book, Abrahamianan interviews scores of so-called ""cosmopolites,"" or ""citizens of the world,"" to promote what she sees as an ""increasingly fluid, borderless world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-writer-no-good-reason-only-citizens-can-vote,2021-07-29
4 teens charged as adults for dragging elderly woman to death in gruesome carjacking plead not guilty,"The four teens in Louisiana accused of dragging a 73-year-old woman to her death in a grisly carjacking have pleaded not guilty.

The teens, who are being charged as adults in the heinous crime, are each being held on a $1 million bond.

What are the details?

Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams said that the suspects — identified as 17-year-old John Honore, 15-year-old Lenyra Theophile, 15-year-old Marquel Curtis, and 15-year-old Briniyah Baker — all face charges of second-degree murder in the dragging death of 73-year-old Linda Frickey, who died during a carjacking in New Orleans.

Second-degree murder charges in Louisiana carry a penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years.

""Four or five years is just not enough,"" Williams said in a late April statement on the charges. “The juvenile sentencing limits would be inadequate to ensure that these young people are appropriately held accountable for taking a life.”

He continued, “This was one of the most violent carjackings we’ve ever seen; these young people dragged Mrs. Frickey, severing her arm as they all fled the scene in her car. Today’s grand jury decision to indict these young people for second-degree murder is fair and ensures they are appropriately held accountable.”



Frickey was leaving her job at an insurance agency when the teens stormed her vehicle as she was putting an item inside it. The teens then reportedly sped off with Frickey still tangled in the seatbelt and dragged her for more than a block. She was only freed from the vehicle when her arm detached from her body. The teens reportedly took off, leaving Frickey's body lying in the road. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to a report from the Titusville Herald, all four teens have pleaded not guilty in connection with Frickey's death.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/linda-frickey-murder-teens-charged,2022-05-11
Video shows live bats at Wuhan lab despite WHO investigation,"The Wuhan Institute of Virology had live bats inside the Chinese biosafety level 4 laboratory in recent years, according to unearthed video revealed by Sky News Australia on Sunday. This discovery directly contradicts what World Health Organization investigators said earlier about the origins of COVID-19, dismissing the notion as a baseless conspiracy theory.

The eye-opening report included footage said to be taken from inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2017. The video allegedly shows bats being held in a cage at the Wuhan lab. Another purported scene from inside the premises shows a scientist feeding a worm to a bat.

WORLD EXCLUSIVE: Footage proves bats were kept in Wuhan lab www.youtube.com

Live bats inside the Wuhan lab is a contradiction to what was said by zoologist Peter Daszak, who was a member of the World Health Organization. Daszak was named to the WHO investigation team sent to China in January to investigate the origins of COVID-19.



Daszak is the president of the non-profit research organization Ecohealth Alliance, which received grants from the National Institutes of Health.

""EcoHealth's bat research in China was entirely funded through the $3.7 million NIH grant,"" NPR reported. ""A small portion — about $76,000 per year — was used to pay the Wuhan lab for its on-the-ground work.""



Daszak personally thanked Dr. Anthony Fauci for dismissing the possibility that the origin of the coronavirus pandemic may have been from a lab leak, according to leaked emails.

""I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Daszak wrote in the email to Fauci. ""From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus' origins.""

""He has worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to test bats for coronaviruses with the potential to spill over into people,"" science journal Nature wrote about Daszak in December 2020.

At the same time Daszak joined the WHO investigative team, he publicly lampooned the idea that the coronavirus pandemic origin may have been from a lab leak. Daszak emphasized that the Wuhan lab doesn't have ""live or dead bats"" on-premises.

""This is a widely circulated conspiracy theory,"" Daszak tweeted in December 2020. ""This piece describes work I'm the lead on & labs I've collaborated w/ for 15 yrs. They DO NOT have live or dead bats in them. There is no evidence anywhere that this happened. It's an error that I hope will be corrected.""



In a since-deleted tweet from December 2020, Daszak reiterated that no live bats were sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

""No BATS were sent to Wuhan lab for genetic analysis of viruses collected in the field,"" Daszak wrote. ""That's now how this science works. We collect bat samples, send them to the lab. We RELEASE bats where we catch them!""

National Review shared reports from Taiwan News, which claimed the Wuhan Institute of Virology reportedly filed patents for bat cages. There is also reports from the Daily Caller referring to an alleged archived version of the Chinese Academy of Science website claiming that the Wuhan facility has ""126 cages for Japanese white rabbits, 340 cages for SD and Wistar rats, inbred strains, closed groups, mutant strains, and genetically engineered mice. There are 3,268 cages, 12 ferrets, 12 bats, and two species of cotton bollworm and beet armyworm, totaling 52 strains.""

The newly unearthed video was reportedly recorded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which released the video to mark the launch of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in May 2017. The voice in the alleged video ""speaks about the security precautions that are in place if 'an accident' occurs and reveals there had been 'intense clashes' with the French Government during the construction of the laboratory.""

""The animal room in the P4 facility can handle a variety of species, including primate work with SARS-CoV-2,"" the video states.

The alleged video also shows ""hundreds"" of mice cages at the Wuhan lab.

The exposé on the Wuhan lab from Vanity Fair claimed that the Chinese military ""engineered mice with humanized lungs"" to test viruses on them in 2019, only months before the coronavirus pandemic erupted. The bombshell report said researchers with the Chinese military studied the humanized lungs to evaluate their ""susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.""

During the G7 summit, the head of the World Health Organization said that the lab leak theory should not be ruled out.

When WHO director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was asked about the possibility of a lab leak as the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, he responded, ""Every hypothesis should be open.""

Ghebreyesus added that China had not cooperated fully, and added that Beijing should provide more ""transparency and cooperation"" to help discover the origin of the virus out of ""respect"" for the dead.

""I think the respect these people deserve is knowing what the origin of this virus is so that we can prevent it from happening again,"" he said.

In February, members of the WHO investigation team said it is ""extremely unlikely"" that coronavirus leaked from the lab in Wuhan, instead they said it was likely spread naturally from animals to humans, possibly from a wet market in Wuhan.

""Our initial findings suggest that the introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one that will require more studies and more specific targeted research,"" Dr. Peter Ben Embarek from the World Health Organization said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/live-bats-wuhan-lab-video-who,2021-06-13
Lizzo describes cancel culture as 'appropriation',"Music superstar Lizzo opined about cancel culture in a tweet on Sunday, asserting that the phenomenon ""is appropriation"" and is being ""misused"" as well as ""misdirected.""

""This may be a random time to say this but it’s on my heart.. cancel culture is appropriation. There was real outrage from truly marginalized people and now it’s become trendy, misused and misdirected. I hope we can phase out of this & focus our outrage on the real problems,"" Lizzo tweeted.

Last year, Lizzo changed the lyrics in one of her songs that had originally included the word ""spaz.""

She posted a statement on June 13, 2022, noting that there was a new edition of the song with altered lyrics.

""It's been brought to my attention that there is a harmful word in my new song 'GRRRLS' . Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language,"" she noted in the statement. ""As a fat black woman in America, I've had many hurtful words used against me so I can overstand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case, unintentionally). I'm proud to say there's a new version of GRRRLS with a lyric change. This is the result of me listening and taking action. As an influential artist I'm dedicated to being part of the change I've been waiting to see in the world.""

""I'd never heard it used as a slur against disabled people, never ever,"" Lizzo told Vanity Fair. ""The music I make is in the business of feeling good and being authentic to me. Using a slur is unauthentic to me, but I did not know it was a slur. It's a word I've heard a lot, especially in rap songs, and with my Black friends and in my Black circles: It means to go off, turn up. I used [it as a] verb, not as a noun or adjective. I used it in the way that it's used in the Black community. The internet brought it to my attention, but that wouldn’t [have been enough] to make me change something.""

One individual who expressed disagreement with the use of the word, also expressed an unwillingness ""to cancel"" the musical artist.



""As a black disabled individual w/spastic cerebral palsy, I am upset that Lizzo used an ableist slur in her song. Using ""sp@z"" as a slur in a song or everyday language neglects to understand the lived experiences of folks who have to deal with spasms on a daily basis,"" Oluwatobi Abubakare tweeted on June 13, 2022. ""But I am not willing to cancel or drag her for it. She should be held accountable for her use and publicly acknowledge the harm that word has towards disabled folks,"" Abubakare continued.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lizzo-cancel-culture-appropriation-misused,2023-01-11
Louisiana's Democratic governor allows transgender sports ban to become law,"Gender dysphoric men will not be allowed to compete on girls' and women's sports teams in Louisiana after the Fairness in Women's Sports Act became law on Monday.



Though Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards opposed the transgender sports ban, he permitted it to become law without his signature because the GOP-controlled legislature had made clear it would override his veto.

""This legislation unfairly targets vulnerable children who are already struggling with gaining acceptance in every aspect of their lives,"" Edwards wrote in a letter explaining his decision. ""Nevertheless, the legislature has made it clear over the last two regular legislative sessions that it believes the policy of the state should be to treat these children differently than who they really are.""

""It was obvious to me after two years it was going to become law whether or not I signed or vetoed the bill,"" the governor said.

The governor's action makes Louisiana the 18th state to ban men who identify as women from playing in girls and women's sports leagues. Supporters of these bans say men have biological advantages over women that, regardless of how they identify or which hormone supplements they take, make competition between the two sexes unfair. Critics of these transgender sports bans say they are discriminatory, bigoted, hateful, and harmful to transgender athletes.

Republican state Sen. Beth Mizell, who sponsored the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, told USA Today her bill will protect female athletes from unfair competition.

""Women have worked too hard for too long to get to the competitive level we have attained to now face an unfair playing field,"" Mizell said.

Edwards argued in his letter that the bill was unnecessary because the Louisiana High School Athletics Association has policies for regulating how transgender athletes compete. He asserted that unfair competition is a problem that ""doesn't exist in our state"" and that the bill will ""lead many of our transgender youth to believe there is something wrong with them.""



A previous version of Mizell's sports bill passed last year but failed to overcome a veto by Edwards. Democratic opponents of the bill said it bullies transgender kids.

""These children, our children, will only see this as an attack,"" state House Democratic Chairman Sam Jenkins said during debate on the bill. ""These kids will see us as bullies. Some people are just flat out uncomfortable with the existence of transgender children in our state.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/louisiana-s-democratic-governor-allows-transgender-sports-ban-to-become-law,2022-06-07
"To celebrate Juneteenth, Grammy winner wants to cancel the American flag: 'Divisive and incorrect'","In celebration of ""Juneteenth,"" Grammy-award winning singer Macy Gray wants to cancel the American flag as it currently exists.

Gray's proposal came on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill declaring ""Juneteenth"" — June 19, the day on which the abolition of slavery is annually celebrated — a federal holiday.

What did Gray say?

Writing in an essay for MarketWatch, the five-time Grammy-nominee claimed Old Glory now represents the same values as the Confederate flag, citing the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

""The Confederate battle flag, which was crafted as a symbol of opposition to the abolishment of slavery, is just recently tired. We don't see it much anymore. However, on the 6th, when the stormers rained on the nation's most precious hut, waving Old Glory — the memo was received: the American flag is its replacement,"" Gray wrote.

""President Biden, Madame Harris and members of Congress: the American flag has been hijacked as code for a specific belief,"" she continued. ""Like the Confederate, it is tattered, dated, divisive, and incorrect. It no longer represents democracy and freedom. It no longer represents ALL of us. It's not fair to be forced to honor it. It's time for a new flag.""

Among other problems with the American flag — which currently has 50 stars and 13 stripes — Gray contended the flag should have 52 stars, to include Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, and the white stripes should be ""off white"" because the color, which represents purity and innocence, does not accurately represent America.

""America is great. It is beautiful. Pure, it ain't. It is broken and in pieces,"" Gray said.

""What if the stripes were OFF-white? What if there were 52 stars to include D.C. and Puerto Rico? What if the stars were the colors of ALL of us — your skin tone and mine — like the melanin scale?"" Gray continued. ""The blue square represents vigilance and perseverance; and the red stripes stand for valor. America is all of those things. So, what if those elements on the flag remained?""

The U.S. has flown the same American flag design since 1960. Ohio high schooler Bob Heft was credited for designing the current flag.

So what does Gray's proposed flag look like?

Louisiana ban on men in women’s sports goes into full effect today,"Men identifying as women and boys identifying as girls can no longer participate in women’s sports in the state of Louisiana. Republican's Fairness in Women's Sports Act is now in effect.

Louisiana was the eighteenth state to enact such a ban prohibiting both biological men from competing in women’s sports and biological women from competing in men’s sports. In addition to ensuring certain advantages correlated with biological sex could not be exploited for an unfair advantage, the act provides schools immunity from ""adverse actions,"" which is to say grievance lawsuits.

This particular act first became law June 6 without Gov. John Bel Edward’s signature, who had previously vetoed similar legislation in 2021. Its successful passage was rendered veto-proof by overwhelming majority support, with 72 in favor and only 21 opposed.

While the bill represented a victory for women in the state, outside the state and in national competitions, the win might not carry.

The Board of Governors at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) updated its policies earlier this year, indicating that ""transgender participation for each sport [will] be determined by the policy for the national governing body of that sport."" The chair of the NCAA board, John DeGioia, emphasized that the NCAA is ""steadfast in our support of transgender student-athletes and the fostering of fairness across college sports.""



Among the governing bodies the NCAA defers to on the matter of transgender participation in women's sports is the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which no longer requires male athletes to undergo procedures or treatment to qualify as their assumed gender.

New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard, for instance, was permitted under the IOC's rules to compete during the women's weightlifting competition at the Tokyo Olympic Games in August 2021.

It's not just the governing bodies that stand to render women's sports co-ed. Democrat-controlled states like Michigan are codifying the language of sexual orientation and gender identity into civil rights law, which would make it difficult to pass laws like Louisiana's protecting women's sports.

Even where such laws have been passed, there is federal pushback. On July 26, a federal judge blocked Indianapolis Public Schools from prohibiting boys from participating in girl's sports, claiming that it possibly ""violates Title IX and the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock V. Clayton County.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/major-battle-for-womens-sports-won-in-louisiana-but-war-awaits-at-nationals,2022-08-01
MSNBC expert Malcolm Nance faces ridicule over bizarre claim about Chernobyl during attack on Ukraine,"MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance faced online ridicule and mockery over a bizarre claim he made about the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine amidst the Russian attack on the former Soviet republic.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian president confirmed that Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl site, where the world's worst nuclear disaster was contained in 1986. The report raised concern after higher than usual levels of radiation were detected, though they were still within safety guidelines.

When someone asked on social media, ""What does [Russian President] Putin want with Chernobyl?"" Nance had an odd response.

""It powers central North Ukraine,"" he replied.

Social media users immediately mocked the suggestion, given that the nuclear plant had been decommissioned for decades.

""What in the ever loving hell is wrong with Malcolm Nance?"" read one tweet. ""And he was in 'intelligence' for over 30 years?? Explains a lot, actually.""

""Malcolm Nance googled 'Chernobyl,' saw that it was a nuclear power plant, and then just stopped reading,"" joked another user.

""Malcolm Nance is a Russian expert & doesn't know Chernobyl is a nuclear waste land?"" asked another detractor.

""Please don't listen to him. I mean the rest of Chernobyl has been shut down since 2000, ffs. He's just a grifter,"" said another critic.

""Well, In fairness to @MalcolmNance.... If he were smart or had any credibility at all, he wouldn't be on @msnbc, now would he?"" read another tweet.

Nance later deleted the tweet, but it was documented at an online archive.

Despite Nance's odd explanation, other experts said that Chernobyl was simply in the path of one of the quickest routes to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

Nance previously outraged many when he told Americans to get over the bombing in Afghanistan during the U.S. withdrawal from that country. He later said that he tweeted before knowing about the U.S. casualties in the terror attack.

On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that the Chernobyl nuclear plant was safe and secure despite the military occupation by Putin's troops.

Male MMA fighter effects brutal beatdown on female fighter during 'inter-gender' show,"Many fans were disgusted after a horrific inter-gender MMA show in Poland made headlines.

What are the details?

Video footage showed the brutal beatdown female fighter Ula Siekacz received at the hands of male fighter Piotr Lisowski — identified by the sun as Piotrek Muaboy — on Friday night.

According to a Monday report from the Sun, the referee was forced to stop the match after Muaboy pinned a defenseless Siekacz and began pummeling her with punches.

The fight, which took place at a hotel in the Polish city of Czestochowa, saw Muaboy take home a brutal TKO victory.

A clip of the fight, shared to Twitter on Friday night, has been viewed more than 50,000 times at the time of this reporting.

What was the response?

The Sun reported that many social media users were disgusted with the match and its predictable outcome.

One user wrote, ""How is this sanctioned? This is horrific.""

""F*** everyone who took part in this,"" another user added. ""And f*** you for posting [highlights of] it.""

Another user chimed in, ""What in the unrivaled f*** is this?""

Anything else to know?

Sport Bible reported that the fight between the two wasn't the only one of its kind to take place that evening.

""The other bout featured Michał Przybyłowicz, also known as 'Polski Ken' due to his plastic Barbie doll appearance, going up against Wiktoria Domżalska,"" the outlet reported. ""Przybyłowicz won in the first round when Domżalska was not able to defend herself from punches and forced the referee to step in and bring proceedings to halt.""

According to the outlet, fans decried the event and said that it was a ""festival of embarrassment"" and more.

Siekacz told her fans that she is ""alive"" after the fight, according to Outkick.

""I'm not going to get slapped by a guy anymore. I consciously took up this fight — that is, I knew what I was [doing],"" Siekacz said, adding, ""I am waiting for some interesting suggestions and I will continue to develop. What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.""



The Mirror reported that the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation condemned the fight.

In a statement for the federation, a spokesperson said, ""Media coverage has brought our attention to an inter-sex MMA bout that took place in Poland over the weekend. Although neither the promoter nor competitors have any association with IMMAF, as the international governing body for amateur mixed martial arts, I feel it is important that I state our position. IMMAF categorically disagrees with this intentionally scandalous, form of entertainment, which does not represent the sport of MMA or its values and puts women at risk. It is unacceptable that women and men should compete against each other in combat sports, essentially for reasons of safety but also fair play, and we in no way endorse this.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/male-mma-fighter-brutal-beatdown-female-fighter-inter-gender-show,2021-11-01
Canadian citizen wants to be euthanized by the government in order to avoid becoming homeless,"Amir Farsoud, 54, lives in chronic pain owing to a back injury he suffered several years ago. While the problem underlying the pain that often prevents him from sleeping and sometimes leaves him ""crying like a 5-year-old"" is not deadly, the help he now seeks from the Canadian government would be.

Farsoud, a resident of St. Catharines, Ontario, is reportedly in the process of applying for Canada's taxpayer-funded and state-administered euthanasia, euphemistically termed medical assistance in dying (MAID).

Farsoud told CityNews that the pain is not what prompted his decision, but rather the prospect of ending up homeless. ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be homeless more than I don't want to die,"" he said.

While Farsoud presently lives on social assistance in a rooming house with two other people, it is currently up for sale in a booming and fiercely competitive real estate market. Should he have to move, Farsoud doubts he will be able to find someplace he can afford.

""I know, in my present health condition, I wouldn't survive it anyway. It wouldn't be at all dignified waiting, so if that becomes my two options, it's pretty much a no-brainer,"" he said.

When asked whether access to stable housing might preclude him from considering euthanasia, Faroud indicated he wouldn't ""even be close to it yet.""

'New chapter of death on demand'

Canada's supreme court decided unanimously in 2015 to allow doctors to assist patients in killing themselves. In June 2016, the federal government under Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau passed the Medical Assistance in Dying Act, legalizing the practice nationwide.



Originally, those seeking state-facilitated death were required to be at least 18 years of age with a ""grievous and irremediable medical condition"" causing ""enduring physical or psychological suffering that is intolerable"" to them. Additionally, they had to be in an ""advanced state of irreversible decline,"" with death a likely outcome in the foreseeable future.

A Quebec Superior Court judge ruled in 2019 that people who were suffering but not dying also had a constitutional right to be put down.

The law concerning euthanasia was amended accordingly in 2021, such that the prospect of imminent death no longer was a requirement. Thereafter, to qualify one must only ""have a serious and incurable illness, disease or disability,"" ""be in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability,"" and ""have enduring and intolerable physical or psychological suffering that cannot be alleviated under conditions the person considers acceptable.""

Alex Schadenberg, executive director of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition, said the amended law made Canada ""the most wide-open euthanasia regime in the world.""



Cardinal Thomas Collins of Toronto stated that this ""is a new chapter of death on demand. Canada has cast aside restrictions at a far quicker pace than any other jurisdiction in the world that has legalized euthanasia.""

The law is ""probably the biggest existential threat to disabled people since the Nazis' program in Germany in the 1930s,"" said Tim Stainton, director of the Canadian Institute and Citizenship at the University of British Columbia.

As of March 17, 2023, Canadians whose only medical condition is a mental illness will be able to request state-assisted euthanasia. That will include persons suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and various other mental issues.

Dr. Sonu Gaind, former president of the Canadian Psychiatric Association and physician chair of the MAID team at Humber River Hospital in Toronto, anticipated cases like Farsoud's.

The National Post reported that earlier this year, Gaind expressed concern over the overlap of isolation and poverty, saying, ""We know there is so much overlap with all sorts of psycho-social suffering.""

Gaind noted that ""when you expand it to sole mental illness conditions, the entire demography shifts, and it's people who have unresolved life suffering that also fuels their request.""

By the tens of thousands

Over 10,000 Canadians were put down by the state via MAID in 2021, making up 3.3% of all deaths in Canada that year. 31,664 Canadians have been killed via the MAID program since 2016.

81% of euthanasia requests were approved.

Canadian Alan Nichols, age 61, for instance, who had a history of depression and medical issues — none of which were life-threatening — was hospitalized in June 2019 as a preventive measure, as he was considered suicidal. His family asked that he be released, but he never came home.

Citing hearing loss as the cause, Nichols, whose capacity to provide consent was in doubt, applied to be killed. Those tasked with preventing his suicide facilitated it. His brother Gary Nichols stated, ""Alan was basically put to death.""

University of Toronto law professor Trudo Lemmens told CTV News that euthanasia rates are ""rising remarkably fast.""

Canada has been roundly criticized, both domestically and internationally, for its keenness to kill the weak, the infirm, and the mentally unwell.

Marie-Claude Landry, the head of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, said euthanasia ""cannot be a default for Canada's failure to fulfill its human rights obligations.""

German professor of law and disability studies at the Protestant University for Applied Sciences Theresia Degener said the ""implication of (Canada's) law is that a life with disability is automatically less worth living and that in some cases, death is preferable.""

In August, an employee of Veteran Affairs Canada raised the possibility of euthanasia to a Canadian Armed Forces veteran seeking support for his PTSD. The ordeal prompted outrage as well as concern that it was far from being an isolated incident.

In November 2020, Roger Foley, a man with a severe neurodegenerative disease, testified to the House of Commons that ""the hospital ethicist and nurses were trying to coerce me into an assisted death. ... I felt pressured by these staff raising assisted dying rather than relieving my suffering with dignified and compassionate care.""

Whereas previously, minors were ineligible for MAID, that standard is similarly slipping, with euthanasia activists advocating not just for teens to qualify but infants as well.

Earlier this month, Dr. Louis Roy of the Quebec College of Physicians suggested in his address to the House of Commons' Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying that euthanasia be made available for babies born with ""severe malformations"" and ""grave and severe symptoms.""

Krista Karr, executive vice president of Inclusion Canada, denounced the suggestion, stating that Canada, which has no limits on abortion, ""cannot begin killing babies when doctors predict there is no hope for them. Predictions are far too often based on discriminatory assumptions about life with a disability.""

The financial dimension

Just like the voiceless, the penniless are also apparently fair game.

In April, Yuan Yi Zhu posed the question, ""Why is Canada euthanising the poor?"" in the Spectator. Zhu noted that in Trudeau's Canada, the rich and poor alike can be put down by the state. ""In fact, the ever-generous Canadian state will even pay for their deaths. What it will not do is spend money to allow them to live instead of killing themselves.""

A 51-year-old Canadian woman who was sensitive to chemicals had trouble finding affordable housing that didn't reek of cigarette smoke and aggravate her symptoms. After years of her inability to find healthy housing, the state agreed to put her down in February. She was killed eight days after she stated on camera, ""The government sees me as expendable trash, a complainer, useless and a pain in the ass.""

Like Farsoud, the chemically sensitive woman wanted to live, but, according to Rohini Peris, president of the Environmental Health Association of Quebec, ""she couldn't live that way.""

A 31-year-old Toronto woman with a comparable sensitivity is also reportedly pursuing death, enabled and facilitated by the state, not because of her illness but owing to financial restraints.

The Spectator noted how, prior to the legalization of the MAID amendments, Canada's parliamentary budget officer released a report indicating how much money would be saved as a result of Bill C-7, which broadened and loosened the language of Canada's euthanasia law. Extra to the $86.9 million per year previously saved by state-facilitated killings, an additional $62 million in costs would be reduced.

The Trudeau government recognized that it could save money by taking lives, even if the taxpayers had to pay $2,327 every time a fellow citizen reached the breaking point.

Man says he was kicked off Southwest flight for failing to put his mask on — between bites of food,"One minute Avi Mandel was minding his own business on a Southwest Airlines plane before takeoff this weekend and eating a box of Twizzlers — and the next minute, he was kicked off the Florida-bound flight.

What are the details?

Mandel told WBZ-TV that he had been a frequent Southwest customer — that is until his Sunday flight from Thurgood Marshall Baltimore Washington International Airport to Fort Lauderdale.

While waiting for the flight to take off, Mandel told the station he got hungry and opened a pack of Twizzlers — and naturally when one eats, a mask makes that kind of awkward. So he removed his mask.

Then a flight attendant told Mandel he had to put his mask on, WBZ said, and he recalled that she ""kind of, like, ran away. And I'm like, 'Oh, I guess she didn't know I was eating.' Then I hear on the loudspeaker, 'Everyone who's eating has to wear mask in between bites.'""

Suddenly, the plane returned to the gate, and a security team entered the plane to escort Mandel off, he told the station.

Image source: WBZ-TV video screenshot

There was no drama. Mandel told WBZ he remained calm and respectful despite feeling embarrassed — but other passengers stuck up for him.

He showed the station video of passenger Stephanie Misiaszek telling the security team, ""That is so wrong. He did nothing wrong. Wow.""

The team was also told, ""He was eating. Oh my God.""

After departing the plane, Mandel appeared on a video clip saying, ""I, Avi Mandel, just got kicked off a plane because I wasn't wearing my mask in between my bites while I was eating.""

Image source: WBZ-TV video screenshot

Mandel told WBZ he was rebooked on the next flight to Florida Monday morning but won't fly Southwest again any time soon.

""It was absurd,"" he told the station. ""The way I was treated was absolutely absurd. It was crazy, and it wasn't fair.""

Mandel added to WBZ that ""there was no warning of it, there was no explanation, there was nothing. It was just a matter of, like, 'I don't like you; get off the plane.'""

Word from on high

After he emailed Southwest, the station said he learned that a new federal mask mandate went into effect in February requiring passengers to wear face masks at all times — including ""in between bites.""

""If I knew this rule ahead of time, I would have happily listened, but I had no clue,"" Mandel told WBZ.

Image source: WBZ-TV video screenshot

The Transportation Security Administration told the station that airline passengers can remove masks while eating, drinking, or taking medications — but they must put them on between bites and sips and cannot leave them off for ""prolonged periods.""

Mandel maintained to WBZ that the rule that got him kicked off the flight wasn't addressed beforehand.

""I think it could be handled a lot better, and I think the rule could have been placed better,"" he told the station. ""I always do follow the rules. I'm on their plane, I get it. But this was not a rule I knew of, and it wasn't explained to me. I didn't see it anywhere at that point, so to me, it wasn't a rule that I was breaking. Had I known, I obviously would have done it differently, but you got to tell someone the rule in order for them to follow it.""

A Southwest spokesperson told WBZ in a statement that while the airline regrets ""any inconvenience caused, the face covering policy is communicated throughout the booking and check-in process, and it's the responsibility of their crew to enforce federal regulations.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-kicked-off-flight-mask-between-bites,2021-04-30
"Manchin finally caves on massive spending bill, but new headaches quickly emerge for Democrats","Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) shocked political observers on Wednesday when he announced an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on new legislation.

But there may already be new roadblocks to getting the bill passed.

What are the details?

The legislation — ironically dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act — advances several key pieces of the progressive agenda, including:

Raising taxes by instituting a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, which Democrats estimate will raise just $313 billion of revenue

Beefing up IRS tax enforcement to raise $124 billion

Permitting Medicare to negotiation prescription drug prices, raising a projected $288 billion

Spending $369 billion on ""energy security and climate change""

Closing the so-called ""carried interest loophole""

While Democrats celebrated a Manchin-Schumer deal, the legislation presents two new headaches for Democrats: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Democrats who want to reserve the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions.

The bill is scheduled for a floor vote in the Senate next week, according to Politico, despite the full bill not yet having been distributed to lawmakers for review.

What about Sinema?

Specifically, Sinema opposes ending the tax loophole, which, according to a group of Senate Democrats, ""allows investment managers to pay the lower 20 percent long-term capital gains tax rate on income received as compensation, rather than the ordinary income tax rates of up to 37 percent that they would pay for the same amount of wage income.""

NBC News reported that Sinema is the only Senate Democrat who opposes ending the loophole.

A Sinema spokesperson said, ""We do not have a comment, as she will need to review the text.""

What about SALT taxes?

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Republicans passed in late 2017, capped SALT tax deductions at just $10,000 per year. Since then, House Democrats, especially those from New York and New Jersey, have repeatedly urged for the cap to be rolled back.

The Manchin-Schumer bill, however does not touch SALT tax deductions.

""Our tax code should not favor red state or blue state elites with loopholes like SALT and should focus more on closing unfair loopholes like carried interest,"" Manchin said in a statement.

It remains to be seen whether Democrats who campaigned on ending the SALT deduction cap will dig in and oppose the bill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manchin-caves-massive-bill,2022-07-28
Manchin abruptly shoots down Biden's plan to revive Build Back Better: 'I've never found out that you can lower costs by spending more',"President Joe Biden attempted to resuscitate his ""Build Back Better"" plan Tuesday during his State of the Union speech. But Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) quickly poured cold water on Biden's plans.

What did Biden say?

Throughout his speech, Biden never explicitly invoked the words ""Build Back Better,"" but repeatedly referred to ""my plan"" and listed several key provisions of the Build Back Better Act that failed to pass in the Senate last year.

Biden discussed cutting the costs of prescription drugs, cutting energy costs ""by combatting climate change,"" cutting the cost of child care, and making sure ""corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share"" of taxes. Biden claimed his ""plan"" will ""fight inflation, ""lower your costs,"" and ""lower the deficit.""

Prior to Biden's speech, Politico reported that Biden would attempt to curry favor with Manchin to revive Build Back Better. The news outlet described Biden's overture as a ""last-ditch attempt at getting Manchin back to the negotiating table.""

How did Manchin respond?

As if Manchin has not been clear enough — repeating himself countless times for months that he opposes Biden's multitrillion-dollar social spending agenda — the moderate Democrat confirmed after the State of the Union that Build Back Better remains dead.

""They just can’t help themselves,"" Manchin reportedly said when asked about Biden's remarks.

""I don’t know where that came from,"" he added. ""Nothing’s changed. ... There might be parts they want to talk about. I don’t know. That was a little bit far.""

When Manchin was asked about Biden's plans to address inflation, he mocked the president.

""I've never found out that you can lower costs by spending more,"" Manchin quipped.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who was walking with Manchin at the time, then said, ""You can't say it better than that!""

Anything else?

Manchin sat with Republicans during Biden's speech. His spokesman later said Manchin's decision was a gesture of bipartisanship.

""Sen. Manchin sat with his colleague Sen. Romney to remind the American people and the world that bipartisanship works and is alive and well in the U.S. Senate,"" said spokesman Sam Runyon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manchin-shoots-down-biden-plan-to-revive-build-back-better,2022-03-02
Manchin opposes taxing unrealized gains,"President Joe Biden's fiscal year 2023 budget proposal includes a minimum 20% tax on wealthy individuals, but the plan would allow for the taxation of unrealized gains, a move that Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia says that he opposes.

""You can’t tax something that’s not earned. Earned income is what we’re based on,"" Manchin told The Hill. ""There’s other ways to do it.""



""Everybody has to pay their fair share, that’s for sure. But unrealized gains is not the way to do it, as far as I’m concerned,” he said, according to the outlet.



Biden's proposal would apply to the wealthiest of individuals, those worth more than $100 million.



""The tax code currently offers special treatment for the types of income that wealthy people enjoy. This special treatment, combined with sophisticated tax planning and giant loopholes, allows many of the very wealthiest people in the world to end up paying a lower tax rate on their full income than many middle-class households,"" according to the budget proposal. ""To finally address this glaring problem, the Budget includes a 20 percent minimum tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires who so often pay indefensibly low tax rates. This minimum tax would apply only to the wealthiest 0.01 percent of households—those with more than $100 million—and over half the revenue would come from billionaires alone.""

Manchin has previously been an obstacle to Democrats on other issues, like last year when he said that he would not support passing Biden's ""Build Back Better"" proposal, a massive spending plan that lacked GOP support.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manchin-signals-opposition-to-taxing-unrealized-gains,2022-03-30

The photo of the kit was captioned, ""We have been building guns out of blocks for the last 30 years and wanted to flip the script to aggravate Mom. There is a satisfaction that can ONLY be found in the shooting sports and this is just one small way to break the rhetoric from Anti-Gun folks and draw attention to the fact that the shooting sports are SUPER FUN! Here's the thing. Guns are fun. Shooting is fun. 30 rounds full auto is fun.""

The photo sparked massive outrage earlier this week after it went viral and ultimately prompted Lego to reach out to the company to condemn the gun mod kit and demand the company remove the offending photo.

Culper Precision complied.

In a statement to Newsweek, Lego said, ""We have contacted the company and they have agreed to remove the product from their website and not make or sell anything like this in the future.""

What are the details?

Following the backlash, Culper Precision on Wednesday said it designed the handgun in the spirit of ""freedom, fun, and responsible gun ownership.""

""We just want to extend a huge [kiss emoji] to all the Block 19 haters out there,"" the company wrote in the Wednesday post. ""We have decided to take down the product after some communication with Lego. What does have us deeply concerned is the number of people who evidently grant their children unsupervised access to firearms. All of this was about the process of freedom, fun, and responsible gun ownership. Yet there are millions of angry, freedom-hating people out there who wish to exercise their First Amendment rights. Thank you for your comments and responses, we've seen a lot of good and a lot of bad.""

""Even now, our Google reviews are being flooded with jaded reviews from anti-gun trolls who have never been customers,"" the post continued. ""Here at Culper, we believe this makes a clear statements [sic] out of the state of the gun debate and the sad reality of communication issues that run deep in this country. Having the discussion about the Block 19 and other modified Glocks was always something we wanted to do. So a big thank you to everyone who gave us valuable input.""

Earlier in the day, the company shared a second Instagram post in which it addressed gun rights and laws.

""We here at Culper Precision are grateful for the attention that Block19 is currently getting across the globe,"" the company wrote. ""We built Block19 to create an opportunity to talk about the enjoyment of the shooting sports and the joy that can only be found in marksmanship practice and training. While the 2nd Amendment is foundationally important to the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States of America as a check on the power that We the People grant our elected officials and as a tool to make the weak strong in the face of those who would oppress and maim, we also recognize and built this to highlight the pure enjoyment of the shooting sports as we feel that like us, our customers truly deeply love the shooting sports and the inherent fun, satisfaction and joy that comes from participation in them.""

The post continued, ""It has long been the expectation of the firearm community that each of us as responsible owners of firearms take measures to secure our firearms from ANY unauthorized person. While we are never in support of legislating personal responsibility, we understand that many municipalities have current laws in place to penalize or hold responsible those who fail to secure their firearms and allow unauthorized access to a firearm by juveniles or any other prohibited person. We would remind everyone that failing to secure a firearm of ANY color from unauthorized persons is irresponsible.""

""There are many solutions for balancing safety and readiness for under $100 all over the marketplace,"" the post concluded. ""Our business is taking a firearm of known value and transforming it into a personalized invaluable treasure for a fair price. People have the right to customize their property to make it look like whatever they want. It is our business to assist firearms owners in making their guns better reflect them as a person and individual, our pieces speak to the owner of the gun as they have selected those options from a seemingly infinite range of possibilities. It seems that no matter what we create in the firearms industry anti gunners seem to leverage every *true* innovation (block19 is NOT an innovation it is a fun safe queen) shortly after its release to talk about why guns are bad. We are sick of the past.""

Billionaire wants to build woke 'equitable' utopia in the American desert,"Billionaire Marc Lore unveiled plans last week to build a woke utopian city from scratch somewhere in the American desert.

The former Walmart executive and e-commerce tycoon told Bloomberg the new city — called Telosa, after the ancient Greek word, telos, meaning ""highest purpose"" — will aim to solve the growing wealth gap in America, which he says is the country's biggest challenge.

""Most civilizations in history at some point fall, right?"" he asked. ""This is going to bring down America.""

But before it does, Lore is determined to try out his version of a solution: a 150,000-acre modern metropolis with eco-friendly architecture, sustainable energy production, and a drought-resistant water system.

""The mission of Telosa is to create a more equitable, sustainable future. That's our North Star,"" Lore said in a promotional video, according to CNN, describing his proposal as ""the most open, the most fair, and the most inclusive city in the world.""

Planners are reportedly considering areas in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Texas, and the Appalachian region as potential sites for the city.

We Are Disruptors | Creating a More Equitable and Sustainable Future - Telosa www.youtube.com

According to Lore, the proposal is based on ideas espoused by American economist and social theorist Henry George. In his 1879 book, ""Progress and Poverty,"" George essentially argues that private land ownership is to blame for rising inequality.



Along those lines, Lore claims that the current system of capitalism has ""significant flaws,"" many of them due to ""the land ownership model that America was built on.""

""While the current economic system is a growth engine, it has led to increasing inequality,"" the project's website explains. Instead, it touts a new economic vision called ""equitism"" as a way to build ""inclusive growth.""

""If you went into the desert where the land was worth nothing, or very little, and you created a foundation that owned the land, and people moved there and tax dollars built infrastructure and we built one of the greatest cities in the world, the foundation could be worth a trillion dollars,"" Lore told Bloomberg.

""And if the foundation's mission was to take the appreciation of the land and give it back to the citizens in the form of medicine, education, affordable housing, social services: Wow, that's it!"" he added.

Bloomberg reported that the initial phase of the project would be built to accommodate 50,000 residents across roughly 1,500 acres by 2030 at a cost of $25 billion. But over 40 years, the city would eventually grow to house 5 million people across 150,000 acres at a cost of $400 billion.

Lore, who is reportedly worth $4 billion, hired Copenhagen-based architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group to design the city.

Renderings of Telosa displayed on the proposal's website show pedestrians leisurely strolling in a futuristic city surrounded by greenery, with air taxi systems for transportation.

In its writeup, Bloomberg notes that Lore is not the first ambitious entrepreneur to envision building a city from scratch, and he likely won't be the last.

Sarah Moser, an associate professor of geography at Montreal's McGill University who studies planned cities, told the outlet that she has identified at least 150 city-building projects backed by either governments or private groups. None of them have hit their population targets, she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marc-lore-woke-utopia-telosa,2021-09-08
Senator Marco Rubio slams Biden for farleft executive orders,"In President Joe Biden's second full day in the White House, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) issued a warning about the new administration's early penchant for signing executive orders, especially the policies that have been on ""the wish list of the far left.""

""So far Biden has talked like a centrist but governed from the radical left,"" Rubio wrote on Twitter.

The tweet included a video, where the Florida Republican said, ""An important thing to point out this morning, President Biden is using the words of the center, talking about unity. But he's governing from the far left.""

""Number one, he has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever,"" Rubio pointed out Friday. ""More than Obama, more than Trump, anyone.""

By the end of Biden's first full day in office, he had signed 17 executive actions, 15 of which are executive orders.

According to CNN, ""Biden issued 30 executive orders, presidential memoranda and agency directives"" since he was sworn in on Wednesday.

""Second, these aren't just normal executive fiats,"" Rubio said. ""This is literally going down the wish list of the far-left and checking all of them off. Some of them are incredibly dramatic and far-reaching in real life.

""At the stroke of a pen, he literally put thousands upon thousands of hard-working blue-collar union members out of work,"" Rubio continued. ""These are people that were working on Monday, that were working on Tuesday. And then the president goes into the Oval Office, signs an executive order wiping out the Keystone pipeline and they're out of work.

""These folks now have to go back to their families in the middle of a pandemic and tell them 'we just lost our job and I don't know where I'm gonna go work next.' That's a far-left agenda there,"" he stated.

Fox Business estimates that 11,000 jobs were lost because of the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.

""The list goes on, I'll talk more later today about, as I read carefully last night, this moratorium on deportations,"" Rubio explained. ""I think there are some incredibly dangerous criminals that are going to get to stay in this country as a result of it.""

Starting Friday, the Biden administration is imposing a 100-day moratorium on deportations of certain immigrants already in the country.

""For 100 days, starting January 22, 2021, DHS will pause removals for certain noncitizens ordered deported to ensure we have a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety,"" a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.

""We now have a president who talks like a centrist but is governing from the far left,"" the senator concluded. ""We're not going to be able to just sit around here in a honeymoon period and watch these things happen.""



""It's not going to be a good one for the country, and it's not going to be a good one for people, for working Americans and your jobs,"" Rubio concluded.

Many of Biden's executive orders dismantle the policies instituted by former President Donald Trump. President Biden called to halt the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization, to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, end the travel ban from certain majority-Muslim countries, and stop construction on the southern border wall. Biden also signed a face mask mandate on all federal government property.

On Inauguration Day, Rubio questioned President Biden's calls for ""unity.""

""Fanning the flames of grievances or pursuing vengeance disguised as accountability will not produce unity; it's the politics of resentment and retribution, which leaves us a fractured nation of people who hate each other,"" Rubio said Wednesday. ""Demanding that the other side agree to all of your demands isn't unity; it's the arrogance of believing only those who agree with us are good and anyone who disagrees is not just wrong — but actually are evil.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marco-rubio-biden-executive-orders,2021-01-22
Twitter viciously mocks Mark Zuckerberg over 'eye gougingly ugly' graphics on his billion dollar virtual reality app,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was mocked mercilessly on social media over the ""eye gougingly ugly"" graphics he posted from his multibillion dollar virtual reality project Horizon Worlds.

""We're launching Horizon Worlds in France and Spain today! Looking forward to seeing people explore and build immersive worlds, and to bringing this to more countries soon,"" wrote Zuckerberg in a post on his official Facebook page.

The Horizon Worlds social application is a part of Zuckerberg's rebranding of Facebook into Meta, a company he says will be on the forefront of online virtual reality. In April, he said the company had lost $3 billion in order to build the Metaverse.

The underwhelming graphic he posted immediately became the target of ridicule and mockery over its lack of detail.

""Mark Zuckerberg launches Horizon Worlds in France and Spain with an eye-gougingly ugly VR selfie. Meta's metaverse ploy is surely dying in the dark,"" read one tweet with more than 30.7k likes.

""I think I'd be really into all of Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse stuff if I'd fallen into a coma in 1996 and woken up this week. (As long as I didn't see anything else on the internet first when I came to),"" replied writer Josh Gondelman.

""To be fair this is the most animated Mark Zuckerberg has ever looked,"" tweeted comedian Gianmarco Soresi.

""It’s truly embarrassing that someone this rich is hinging his gargantuan company’s existence on something that looks like a JibJab birthday video from 2004,"" responded writer Mitch Dyer.

""Mark zuckerberg heard you all joking that he looks like a robot baby and is trying to get his revenge by creating an entire alternate universe where everyone and everything looks like that,"" read another tweet.

Forbes contributor Paul Tassi similarly torched the offering from Zuckerberg.

This is just embarrassing, and yet Zuckerberg seems entirely immune to the embarrassment, or really just does not understand how bad this looks, both literally, the graphics are garbage and it’s bizarre no one has legs after five years of this, but also for him and his company and his grand vision of the metaverse, which he seems to understand less than all of his competition.

He concludes, ""This is not going to go well for him or Meta if he continues down this path.""

Mark responds

Zuckerberg posted again on Friday and addressed some of the criticism over the graphics.

""Major updates to Horizon and avatar graphics coming soon,"" he wrote. ""Also, I know the photo I posted earlier this week was pretty basic -- it was taken very quickly to celebrate a launch. The graphics in Horizon are capable of much more -- even on headsets -- and Horizon is improving very quickly.""

He also added another, more detailed graphic.

Married teachers on OnlyFans lose their jobs after they reportedly filmed sexual content in wife's middle school classroom: 'Our professional salary did not pay enough',"A married couple in Arizona have both lost their teaching jobs after students and staff discovered that they had posted pornographic material — some of which had been filmed in the wife's middle school classroom — to OnlyFans.

Samantha Peer, known to some OnlyFans devotees as ""Khloe Karter,"" and her husband, Dillon Peer, have both been fired from Lake Havasu Unified School District when their sexually-explicit OnlyFans material became locally known earlier this year. Samantha Peer had allegedly shared links to her OnlyFans content, much of which is still available for free, through social media accounts listed under her real name and to TikTok and Instagram accounts that many students followed.

On Friday, Samantha Peer, a former science teacher at Thunderbolt Middle School, posted a video to OnlyFans entitled ""who's husband am I stealing next?"" and explained her version of the story. According to Peer, she and her husband could not afford to support themselves and their two children on their teacher salaries, so she created the OnlyFans account.

""My children are the most important thing to me,"" she said in the post, ""and I'm already spending countless hours outside of my contract time on extra school activities, and I don't think it's fair that I have to sacrifice my own children's time because our professional salary did not pay enough.""









Peer also admitted that she filmed explicit content at her middle school classroom, but stated she did so only after school and on weekends, when students were not there. One image supposedly depicts Peer posed sexually on a child's desk.

According to the Washington Examiner, Peer's OnlyFans bio still reads, ""I like to be a slut at work too.""

On October 24, Samantha Peer was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation after Alea Bilski, a local parent, heard about the OnlyFans account from her young daughter and inquired about it with the school.

""If it was 'just' an Only Fans account,"" Bilski stated, ""I wouldn’t be as upset because then that would 100% be on the kids’ parents, but this was public and an easy Google search to find everything.""

Samantha Peer said she had been asked to resign from her position a week later. Dillon Peer, 28, a former fourth grade teacher at Nautilus Elementary who also occasionally appears on the account, was fired on November 4.

Following the scandal, the district issued a statement to parents: ""It has come to our attention that students have been airdropping explicit material. The images did not happen during the school day and the person depicted no longer works for LHUSD. Please remove all images from your child’s phone and talk with them about the appropriate use of technology.""

Samantha Peer apparently remains unrepentant about the OnlyFans account that supposedly cost her young family two teaching jobs.

""I am already paying the consequence by losing my teaching certificate as well as losing the job I loved most,"" she said.

""I do not believe that my name should be smeared throughout the community when I made one mistake that didn't affect anybody,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/married-teachers-on-onlyfans-lose-their-jobs-after-they-reportedly-filmed-sexual-content-in-wife-s-middle-school-classroom-our-professional-salary-did-not-pay-enough,2022-11-13
Maryland county enforces teen curfew due to rise in crimes committed by 'armed and dangerous children',"During a Monday news conference, Maryland's Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks announced strict enforcement of a teen curfew following a rise in violent crime.



Alsobrooks reported the arrest of 430 juveniles this year, nearly double compared to last year.

""At this point, these kids don't just need a hug, they need to be held accountable,"" Alsobrooks said.

While the curfew already exists in Maryland law, it has not been strictly enforced since 1995, WTOP reported. The teen curfew will be enforced beginning next weekend and will continue for at least 30 days.

Teens under 17 must be off the streets from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11:59 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday through Saturday.

Parents of repeat offenders could be fined up to $250 and have their children turned over to the Department of Social Services.

Alsobrooks stated that the goal of the strict enforcement was not to burden law enforcement but to protect teens.

The county executive called on parents and family members to ""step up and do their part."" She stated, ""I know it's not a popular thing to say, but it's a fair question: Where are their parents? Where are the aunties, where are the uncles and other family members who are responsible for them?""

Alsobrooks reported a 52% increase over last year in carjackings. More than half of the 350 carjackings this year were perpetrated by ""armed and dangerous children,"" Alsobrooks said. Only 61 of the carjackings were committed by adults.

According to the county's data, most of the juveniles who committed carjacking crimes were repeat offenders.

Prince George's County Police Chief Malik Aziz stated that 55 of the 84 juveniles apprehended for carjackings had prior arrests.

""The vast number of juveniles are out doing the right thing and living a meaningful and positive live in Prince George's County,"" Aziz said. ""These are the outliers that are causing our residents to fear so much crime in our own neighborhoods.""

Alsobrooks noted that August was the deadliest month the county had seen in decades. Authorities investigated 24 deaths in August and noted a rise in violent crime by repeat offenders. However, the county executive also reported that, despite the spike in August, homicides are still down 15% compared to last year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maryland-county-enforces-teen-curfew,2022-09-06
Chief judge for Maryland district courts orders all employees to stop wearing Thin Blue Line logos while working,"Chief Judge John P. Morrissey has ordered all district court employees to avoid wearing any articles of clothing that feature the ""thin blue line"" logo out of concern that displaying such items could be ""an issue of perceived bias.""

What are the details?

According to a Friday report from the Washington Post, court staffers are prohibited from wearing or using ""thin blue line"" masks, clothing, and any other paraphernalia.

Morrissey sent a memo to employees this week with the new directive. The memo was in direct response to a May 4 letter from Maryland Public Defender Paul DeWolfe, who complained that personal articles featuring the logo created a ""fair trial issue"" in courtrooms across the state.

In his letter, DeWolfe wrote, ""The 'thin blue line' is commonly depicted as a black and white rendition of the American flag with a blue stripe running just under the stars, with the 'thin blue line' itself representing the belief that the police are the only thing that stands between order and chaos.""

""It has been adopted by the 'Blue Lives Matter' movement, which launched in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, and has been associated at times with white supremacist groups,"" DeWolfe added.

He concluded, ""To allow these masks to be worn by courtroom staff during hearings and trials of our clients, a large swath of them black, denies them the appearance that their hearing is being conducted fairly and without bias.""

Morrissey agreed, according to the Baltimore Sun, and wrote in response that wearing logos ""which may be perceived as showing bias of favoritism to a particular group of people could undermine the District Court's mission.""

“The Judiciary must maintain itself as an unbiased and independent branch of Maryland state government,"" he added.

The new policy went into immediate effect.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maryland-judge-bans-thin-blue-line-logos,2021-05-07
Massachusetts voters secure opportunity in November to end law permitting illegal aliens to get driver's licenses,"On February 16, the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts House of Representatives overrode Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's veto and approved a bill called the Work and Family Mobility Act. The bill would enable illegal aliens to acquire driver's licenses. The state Senate, similarly Democrat-controlled, signed H.4805 into law on May 5, making Massachusetts the 17th state to confer licenses on criminal non-citizens.



Although touted by some advocates as a step towards ""transformational change for undocumented immigrants across the Commonwealth,"" that step might amount to a stumble.

In the upcoming November election, the people of Massachusetts have an opportunity to repeal the law.

As the result of an energetic campaign and a petition allegedly netting over 100,000 signatures — of which only 71,883 signatures were ultimately accepted — Massachusetts' Election Division certified the proposed referendum as Question 4 on the November 8 ballot. Only 40,120 signatures were required.

The work to get the question of whether to keep or repeal the new license law on the ballot began in earnest in June, when Maureen Maloney and Kevin Dube filed a statement of organization with the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance to create the Fair and Secure Massachusetts committee.

As the committee made considerable progress collecting signatures into the summer, some Democrats took notice. The Federation for American Immigration Reform reported that Senate President Karen Spilka (D) saw the ballot question's passage not only as possible but as ""a concern.""

In a September 9 statement, Maloney, chairman of the committee, said of the petition's success, ""Making the ballot is a huge achievement, and to do it with such an excess of signatures shows the groundswell of support across the commonwealth for repealing this law.""

Maloney's son Matthew was brutally killed by an illegal alien, who struck him with a truck and dragged his body in 2011. In 2019, Maloney first testified against the bill in the state House before its passage and was met with jeers and boos.

Advocates for the bill suggested, ""In the Trump era, immigrant families risk being torn apart every time they drive,"" citing instances where illegal aliens were deported after being charged with traffic offenses.

Maloney indicated in 2019 that the rhetoric about illegal aliens being separated from their families didn't sit well with her, given that ""I have been permanently separated. This is the ultimate separation. ... They're afraid they'll be deported, but they can take their kids with them or their kids can go visit them. I don't have that option.""

Boston 25 reported that Maloney and others involved with the repeal campaign were not only concerned that the law would enable foreign nationals in the United States illegally to take to the roads and endanger the lives of citizens. They were also worried that the law may undermine the integrity of state elections by providing illegal aliens with a means to vote.

Although the law specifies that the state is required to ensure that people without legal residences are not automatically registered to vote along with everyone else who receives a driver's license, some believe there will nevertheless be considerable abuse.



Governor Baker argued, when issuing his veto, that the bill ""significantly increases the risk that noncitizens will be registered to vote."" He added that the bill ""restricts the Registry's ability to share citizenship information with those entities responsible for ensuring that only citizens register for and in our elections.""

Republican gubernatorial nominee Geoff Diehl and Leah Allen, Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, announced their support for the ballot question in June, similarly arguing that this law will ""threaten the integrity of our elections.""

In the bill's initial hearings, another concern was raised: the well-being of economically vulnerable citizens.

According to the Massachusetts Coalition for Immigration Reform, the provision of licenses to illegal aliens legitimizes illegal competition. ""A whopping 200,000 illegal aliens already reside in Massachusetts — up one-third from a decade ago — taking jobs that would otherwise go to lawful residents, and driving down the wages of low-skilled residents who are still working, because of an oversupply of any resource reduces its value.""

The MCIR also noted that not only does the issuing of licenses to illegal immigrants serve to sanction criminality, but it facilitates the use of services intended for citizens by non-citizens.

A poll conducted in April by Suffolk University indicated that the vote may be a toss-up, with 46.13% supporting licenses for illegal aliens, 46.63% opposed, and 55% undecided.



Unless the law is blocked by citizen voters in November, illegal aliens can begin applying for licenses on July 1, 2023.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/massachusetts-can-vote-giving-licenses-illegal-aliens,2022-09-13
'Master bedroom' getting dropped from home sale listings over slavery connotations as 'wokeness' spreads among Minnesota realtors,"Jackie Berry — a listing agent for Edina Realty in Minnesota who teaches a racism and real estate continuing education class — told the Star Tribune the term ""master bedroom"" hasn't exactly sat well with her.

""There's a hidden discriminatory piece that falls when you say 'master' bedroom,"" she told the paper.

""I'm a person of color and every time the term 'master bedroom' was used, I kept saying to myself, 'I don't like how it sounds.' Now as I'm walking through a property, I'll just say it's the owners' or primary suite,"" Berry added to the Star Tribune.

Racial reckoning continues

The paper said that numerous real estate agents and agencies in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area have been phasing out the word ""master"" in recent years due to its connections to slavery.

But in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police last year, the effort to change the industry's vocabulary picked up steam, the Star Tribune reported.

""It's something that has come up more and more the past few months,"" Berry told the paper. ""There's been an increased awareness and wokeness since George Floyd's murder. We're seeing racial justice work being put into play.""

Indeed, TheBlaze noted last year that the Houston Association of Realtors said it no longer would use the word ""master"" to describe bedrooms and bathrooms on real estate listings and that the term ""primary"" would be used in its place.

The Star Tribune said that in July 2020 the Real Estate Standards Organization noted that while industry professionals said ""master"" was not a discriminatory violation under U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development standards, replacing it with ""primary"" was recommended.

""It makes sense for the industry to coalesce around a new term to clearly define what it represents and ensure ongoing productive communication between professionals and their communities,"" the RESO said in a statement, the paper said.

Minnesota industry groups haven't offered guidelines on recommended terminology, the Star Tribune said, adding that it's up to real estate agencies and individual realtors.

Chris Galler, CEO of the Minnesota Association of Realtors, noted to the paper that the association's more than 21,000 members must abide by the National Association of Realtors Code of Ethics, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity — as well as federal housing guidelines under the Fair Housing Act.

Gender-inclusive real estate terms gaining popularity, too

The Star Tribune noted other real estate terms specific to gender inclusivity that are gaining popularity in the industry as others are getting put out to pasture:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/master-bedroom-dropped-minnesota-home-sale-listings,2021-08-10
"Rep. Matt Gaetz defends himself in op-ed, says he's 'not a monk' but 'certainly not a criminal'","Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz has come out swinging back amid the Department of Justice's investigation into allegations that the congressman engaged in sex trafficking of a minor, penning an op-ed saying that he is ""not a monk"" but also ""certainly not a criminal.""

What are the details?

In a piece published in The Washington Examiner on Monday titled, ""The swamp is out to drown me with false charges, but I'm not giving up,"" Gaetz wrote, ""Let me first remind everyone that I am a representative in Congress, not a monk, and certainly not a criminal.""

""Nancy Pelosi once defended President Bill Clinton after he got an intern to fellate him in the Oval Office,"" he continued. ""But when it comes to the allegation that I, a grown man, paid for an adult girlfriend's expenses? Well, consider that a bridge too far for the power-hungry hypocrites.""

The congressman went on to write, ""I want to be clear about something as we process the leaks and lies from the past week. To this point, there are exactly zero credible (or even non-credible) accusers willing to come forward by name and state on the public record that I behaved improperly toward them, in the manner by which Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has ten accusers.""

Gaetz predicted in his op-ed that ""anti-Trump cheerleaders such as Meghan McCain"" and others would call on him to resign. Sure enough, McCain did so Monday on ""The View.""

He further noted that he ""defended Rep. Katie Hill's 'throuple' when her own Democratic colleagues wouldn't."" Also on Monday, Vanity Fair published an op-ed by Hill where she acknowledged that Gaetz was one of the few people who defended her after nude photos of her were leaked online, but said now he is ""accused of doing just that"" and should resign ""immediately"" if any of the allegations are true.

Katie Hill resigned after she was hit with an ethics investigation over allegations that she was sleeping with one of her legislative staffers, which violates House rules that were implemented after the #MeToo movement.

In his op-ed, Gaetz continued to deny any wrongdoing and reiterated — as he has since the initial allegation that he slept with a 17-year-old and subsequent claims that he paid for drug-fueled hotel romps — that he is ""absolutely not resigning."" He vehemently denies the claims.

After the initial allegations against Gaetz came out in The New York Times, he said that the DOJ investigation was part of a criminal extortion plot led by former Justice Department official David McGee. McGee forcefully denied Gaetz's claims.

Gaetz did not mention the alleged plot in his op-ed.

Anything else?

Gaetz's congressional office also held a news conference Monday where his former military director, Nathan Nelson, expressed his doubts that the Justice Department's investigation into Gaetz has any merit.

Nelson left Gaetz's office in late October of last year, The New York Post reported, in what he called a ""planned departure"" in order to support ""the military missions in a private capacity"" in the Florida Panhandle.

Nelson explained that the FBI showed up at his home and interviewed him shortly after the allegations against Gaetz hit the news, and agents claimed media sources had contacted them asserting that Nelson left Gaetz's office because of the accusations surrounding the congressman.

The former Gaetz staffer told the media, ""I'm here this morning to state that nothing could be further from the truth. Neither I nor any other member of Congressman Gaetz's staff had any knowledge of illegal activities.""

He added, ""This baseless claim against me leaves me further convinced that the allegations against Congressman Gaetz are likewise fabricated and merely an attempt to discredit a very vocal conservative.""

"Matthew McConaughey delivers winding, pro-America message on July 4: 'We're basically going through puberty'","Actor Matthew McConaughey delivered a headline-making speech on Sunday to commemorate Independence Day and America herself.

What are the details?

McConaughey on Sunday afternoon shared a widely viewed video in which he said that America — still a very young nation — is ""basically going through puberty.""

“Happy Birthday, America,"" he began the video. ""Yes, indeed. As we celebrate our independence today, as we celebrate our birth as a nation, the day that kick-started a revolution to gain our sovereignty, let's admit that this last year, this trip around the sun, was also another head-scratcher.""

He continued, pointing out that when compared to other countries across the globe, America is still very early in its development.

“But let's also remember that we're babies as a country,"" McConaughey explained. “We're basically going through puberty in comparison to other countries' timeline, and we're going to go through growing pains. We are going through growing pains. This is not an excuse, this is just the reality, and this is good, because we got to keep learning, we got to keep maturing, we gotta keep striving, we gotta keep climbing, we gotta keep building. And we gotta make sure we maintain hope along the way, as we continue to evolve.""

McConaughey added, ""Why? Because it's who we are. Why? Because the alternative sucks.""

He went on to laud Americans and their daily lives, making the country greater and greater as days go by.

“We're constantly in motion, we're on the way, trying to get wiser, trying to get braver, trying to dream more, trying to do more, trying to be more fair, take the right kind of responsibilities, to gain the right kind of freedoms, and we gotta keep realizing that we're a place where our individual pursuits and desires need to be appreciative and supportive of our collective responsibilities as Americans,"" the Oscar-winning actor continued. “Hence, the United States of America. Sure, we're each unique. We're each independent. We each have innate abilities that others don't have, as people and as states. But at the same time, we are all in this together, and if you don't purchase that, move on. Go somewhere else.""

He concluded, ""So, as we celebrate the red, white and blue this weekend, let's be sure and just reflect just a minute, take a little bit of inventory on where we've come from, where we are and how and where we want to go from here on the way to being the best we can be. Now what if that was a song, and each of us just said, 'I can't not sing that song?' I want to be a little bit better, you want to be a little bit better. Let's be on the way to being the best we can be. Let's make that a song we can't not sing. Why? Because it's who we are. It's who we gotta be, and again, the alternative sucks. Let's rock, America. Happy Birthday, just keep livin'. I'll see you there.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/matthew-mcconaughey-winding-pro-america-message,2021-07-05
Maxine Waters thanks FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried for being 'candid',"Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of crypto-exchange company FTX who admittedly ""had a bad month,"" received praise on Twitter from Congresswoman Maxine Waters for his apparent dedication to transparency.

Bankman-Fried, who has recently said he was masquerading as a ""woke westerner,"" has benefitted from an avalanche of favorable press as of late, including an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and a public webcam event with the New York Times.

""[Sam Bankman-Fried], we appreciate that you've been candid in your discussions about what happened at #FTX,"" Waters stated on Twitter. ""Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company's customers, investors, and others. To that end, we would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13th.""





The statement was co-tweeted by the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, for which Waters is the spokesperson. The committee has announced a hearing regarding FTX set for December 13, 2022, saying the ""urgent need for legislation has never been greater.""

While it is fair to state that there is widespread skepticism about any punishment the founder will face, other crypto-currency companies such as Alameda Research and Binance are set to appear at the hearing as well.

The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee will also hold a hearing titled “Lessons Learned from the FTX Collapse"" on December 1, 2022.

Bankman-Fried has received no apparent condemnation from federal authorities or regulators and at points seems genuinely confused by backlash or questioning he's received.

""When I filed, I'm fairly sure FTX US was solvent, and that all US customers could be made whole. To my knowledge, it still is today. I was expecting that to happen. I'm surprised it hasn't. I'm not sure why US withdrawals were turned off,"" the mogul pontificated online.





Bankman-Fried and Rep. Waters have been pictured together before, with Waters even seemingly blowing a kiss to the businessman after a congressional hearing:

Still operating out of the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried appears to be doing his own public relations damage control on social media, even taking time to clarify his status as a vegan. ""Is SBF still vegan?"" a crypto-currency account asked. ""Yea, the picture going around was a joke, I'm still vegan,"" Bankman-Fried clarified.

"Mayor blasts 'dangerous' Illinois law, saying it ends cash bail for kidnapping, armed robbery, second-degree murder — and bars cops from removing trespassers","A suburban Chicago mayor blasted a ""dangerous"" Illinois law set to take effect in 2023, saying it ends cash bail for kidnapping, armed robbery, and second-degree murder — among other offenses — and even bars police from removing trespassers from residences and businesses.

What are the details?

Keith Pekau, mayor of Orland Park — a village about an hour southwest of Chicago — has gone on record blasting the new Safety Accountability and Fairness Equity Today (SAFE-T) Act.

""I can’t even begin to tell you how dangerous this act is,"" he said.

The mayor didn't stop there:

First, it was passed in the middle of the night, with 40 minutes to read an 800-page bill, which is unacceptable. As of January 1, 2023, the following things will go into effect — and people need to be aware of this. It abolishes cash bail for almost every offense. This includes — but isn't limited to — kidnapping, armed robbery, second-degree murder, drug-induced homicide, aggravated DUI, threatening a public official, and aggravated fleeing and eluding. Offenders released on electronic monitoring have to be in violation for 48 hours before law enforcement can act. They could almost drive to Alaska before we can even look for them. It denies victims their constitutional rights. And keep this in mind, businesses and homeowners: officers will no longer be able to remove trespassers from your residence or your businesses. Someone could decide to live in your shed, and all we can do is give them a ticket. You have to decide what level of force is required to remove them and whether or not it's legal.

Pekau also called the SAFE-T Act a ""massive threat"" to local residents.

Standing Up to the So-Called “SAFE-T” Act youtu.be

Local response

The Orland Park village board unanimously approved a resolution last week calling on state legislators to work with public safety representatives and community stakeholders to fix problems with the SAFE-T Act, WFLD-TV reported.

The station said the SAFE-T Act is ""central to Republicans’ portrayal of Gov. J.B. Pritzker as soft on crime.""

However, WFLD said the governor, a Democrat, has defended the SAFE-T Act, noting in February 2021 when he signed the law that it will have the effect of ""transforming the pretrial detention system so low-income people aren’t thrown behind bars while only the wealthy walk free, diverting low-level drug crimes into substance-treatment programs, and reducing excessive stays in prison.""

'War zone full of criminals'

Pekau, in the above video, also called attention to a bill he said was in front of the state house that would ""remove school resource officers from our schools, which means no resource officer at Sandburg High School. The city of Chicago's already done this. I personally don't want to see the city of Chicago become the standard for how we conduct public safety because they've abandoned their police officers and abandoned their residents and created a war zone full of criminals.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mayor-blasts-dangerous-illinois-law-safet-act,2022-09-15
Mayor Eric Adams exempts NYC athletes from vaccine mandate after Kyrie Irving controversy reaches critical mass — but other city workers aren't so lucky,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced an exemption on Thursday for city-based athletes and performers from NYC's vaccine mandate following plenty of pressure, most notably the bad optics of NBA star Kyrie Irving being barred from playing in Brooklyn Nets' home games — yet being allowed to enter the Nets' arena as a spectator and sit courtside.

Other city workers are still required to abide by the mandate, however, and leaders of their unions aren't happy, the New York Post reported.

What are the details?

The paper said the exemption for athletes and performers is effective immediately.

“Being healthy is not just about being physically healthy, but being economically healthy,” Adams said at Citi Field, according to the Post. The stadium is the home of major league baseball's New York Mets.

The mayor, prior to his announcement, said he's ""going to make some tough choices. People are not going to agree with some of them. I must move this city forward. Generals lead from the front. I was not elected to be fearful, but to be fearless,"" the paper added.

The Post said New York City's vaccine mandate — which resulted in more than 1,400 employees getting fired — still applies to municipal and private-sector workers. Adams added that he's not planning to rehire them, the paper reported.

The mayor said the exemption was needed because New York City — heavily reliant on the tourism — ""has to function,"" the Post noted.

“We’re leading the entire country, for the most part, in unemployment,” he added, according to the paper. “We’re seeing unbelievable vacancies in our business district.”

The Post reported that Adams also said the provision exempting out-of-town athletes and performers from the mandate wasn't fair to the city's own athletes and performers.

“This is about putting New York City-based based performers on a level playing field,” he said, according to the paper. “Hometown players had an unfair disadvantage.”

The Kyrie Irving controversy

Earlier this month, Irving strutted into Barclays Center — the Nets' home arena — in his street clothes and watched his teammates play from a courtside seat. He wasn't injured, but he was unvaccinated — and therefore barred from playing in New York City. Yet, like other fans, he could enter the arena and sit a few feet from players — as if the COVID virus can't travel that far. Visiting unvaccinated players were allowed to take part in the contest, too.

Irving's teammate Kevin Durant demanded that Adams make things right.

""It's ridiculous,"" Durant said after the game. ""I don't understand it at all. There's a few people in our arena that's unvaxxed, right? They lifted all of that in our arena, right? So I don't get it ... I don't get it. It just feels like at this point now, somebody's trying to make a statement or a point to flex their authority. But everybody out here is looking for attention, and that's what I feel like the mayor wants right now, is some attention. But he'll figure it out soon. He better.""

Durant added, ""But it just didn't make any sense. There's unvaxxed people in this building already. We got a guy who can come in the building, I guess, are they fearing our safety? I don't get it. We're all confused. Pretty much everybody in the world is confused at this point. Early on in the season people didn't understand what was going on, but now it just looks stupid. So hopefully, Eric, you got to figure this out.""

NYC Mayor Eric Adams lifts COVID-19 vaccine rules for pro athletes, performers youtu.be

Other city workers still under mandate: 'Like second-class citizens'

Leaders of several municipal unions on Thursday ripped Adams for enacting a double standard that favored famous people, the Post reported.

Patrick Lynch, president of the 24,000-member Police Benevolent Association, said that ""if the mandate isn’t necessary for famous people, then it’s not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis,” the paper reported.

“While celebrities were in lockdown, New York City police officers were on the street throughout the pandemic, working without adequate PPE and in many cases contracting and recovering from Covid themselves,"" Lynch added, according to the Post. ""They don’t deserve to be treated like second-class citizens now.”

Paul DiGiacomo, head of the NYPD Detectives’ Endowment Union, said Adams’ decision “doesn’t make sense,"" the Post noted.

“The objective, scientific findings do not support giving athletes one option and New York City detectives another option,” DiGiacomo added, according to the paper.

Harry Nespoli — president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association and chair of the umbrella Municipal Labor Committee — said ""there can’t be one system for the elite and another for the essential workers of our city,” the Post reported.

Nespoli also noted that city workers fired for refusing vaccine shots should be rehired, the paper said: “When New York City shut down, many workers were mandated to come in every day without vaccines to keep the city running. These workers often got sick, and when they got better, came right back to work.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mayor-eric-adams-exempts-nyc-athletes-from-vaccine-mandate-kyrie-irving-controversy,2022-03-24
'A part of his choices': John McEnroe gets cut off by commentator while defending Novak Djokovic's unvaccinated history,"Tennis legend John McEnroe and ESPN commentator Chris Fowler verbally jostled on-air during the celebration of famously unvaccinated tennis player Novak Djokovic's win at the Australian Open.

Djokovic was deported from Australia in 2022 over his vaccination status, even missing the U.S. Open tournament for the same reason. Australia had some of the strictest COVID-19 policies in the world, which included forcible confinement of its citizens in quarantine camps.

While Djokovic was celebrating his victory at the 2023 Australian Open, McEnroe began to recap what the pro had gone through in the year before regarding his deportation and inability to play in certain tournaments. While listing the obstacles, co-announcer Fowler argued that his disqualifications were fair.

""He got defaulted at the Open when he hits the lineperson by mistake, he gets deported out of Australia, doesn't get any points at Wimbledon, can't play the Open,"" McEnroe listed, before Fowler interjected.

""A part of his choices, to be fair. He made choices that led to that for some of those things,"" Fowler said.

""I think he should have been committed to play,"" McEnroe responded.

""OK, well, that’s a debate,"" Fowler replied. ""He did make choices that led to that, but that’s forgot for the moment,"" he concluded.

In 2022, McEnroe defended Djokovic regarding the U.S. Open, calling it ""BS"" that he was unable to compete:

""Well, first of all, I think it’s BS. That’s what I think. I think he should be allowed to play. My personal opinion, as I’ve been vaccinated, I had a booster shot, that’s up to the individual,"" McEnroe said.

""The guy is one of the greatest athletes in any sport. He’s very careful about anything he puts in his body,"" the legend continued in the summer of 2022.

""So, it’s frustrating to see at this point when we’re sitting here and all having a great time at an LAFC soccer game and that he’s not allowed into the country right now because he’s not vaccinated.""

In 2023, an Italian tennis star named Camila Giorgi was accused of using a fake vaccine passport in order to compete in international tennis tournaments, which, like Djokovic, she would otherwise have been barred from playing in.

Medical group sues Pfizer for 'open' discrimination against whites and Asians: Report,"A group of medical professionals and other health care associates has sued pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. for supposedly discriminating against ""white and Asian-American applicants"" for one of its fellowship programs.

Earlier this month, Do No Harm — which describes itself as ""a diverse group of physicians, healthcare professionals, medical students, patients, and policymakers"" who wish to ""[p]rotect healthcare from a radical, divisive, and discriminatory ideology"" — filed a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan to end the supposedly discriminatory aspects of Pfizer's Breakthrough Fellowship Program.

Pfizer claims that it established BFP ""to increase minority representation at Pfizer"" and ""to enhance [its] pipeline of diverse leaders."" To achieve that end, BFP recipients are given funding for: several summer internships, a master's degree, and pre- and post-graduate employment at the company. However, Pfizer limits those who may apply for BFP. In addition to being a U.S. citizen or resident; a junior at an accredited college or university; interested in a master's in business, pharmacology, or statistics; and willing to remain in or relocate to New York City, applicants must ""[m]eet the program’s goals of increasing the pipeline for Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic and Native Americans.""

In other words, Do No Harm alleges, whites and Asian-Americans need not apply. Such a policy, Do No Harm states, is ""discriminatory on its face.""

""Racial discrimination demeans us,"" the complaint continues.

Not only does Do No Harm insist that this form of racial discrimination is wrong, the group also alleges that ""open exclusion of white and Asian-American applicants is illegal"" because it violates municipal, state, and federal civil rights laws as well as laws regulating which companies can receive federal funding.

The lawsuit seeks to end the discriminatory BFP requirements, prevent Pfizer from discriminating against white and Asian-American applicants for the 2023 BFP awards, and collect $1 in compensatory damages.

However, Pfizer seems unfazed by either the lawsuit or the accusations. Though representatives of the COVID vaccine manufacturer claim they had not read the entire lawsuit, they said they have ""every confidence"" that Pfizer's policies comply with all local, state, and federal employment laws.

""We will continue to strive to create more opportunity,"" the statement from Pfizer said, ""including through specific programs designed to cast a wide net for talent.""

As it stands, Pfizer said it hopes to develop 100 fellows within the next three years.

Google has also recently come under fire for supposedly discriminating against whites and Asians in one of its Ph.D. fellowship programs.

""The Google Fellowship program is a blatantly unlawful and immoral quota plan that pits students against one another by skin color and ethnic heritage,"" said Edward Blum, the founder of Students for Fair Admissions. ""Our nation’s enduring civil rights laws were passed to specifically forbid this type of racial discrimination.""

Like Pfizer, Google said that it stands by its policy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/medical-group-sues-pfizer-for-open-discrimination-against-whites-and-asians-report,2022-09-22
Megan Rapinoe pens essay saying banning biological males from women’s sports is 'discrimination': 'They need to be allowed to play',"Megan Rapinoe, U.S. women's soccer star, says that banning transgender women from women's sports is nothing short of discrimination.

What are the details?

In a Sunday op-ed in the Washington Post, Rapinoe, an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ community, says that transgender women — biological males who consider themselves to be female — should not be excluded from women's sports.

As such, transgender men, she adds, ought to be permitted in men's sports.

Blasting the 25 states seeking to enact laws prohibiting transgender players from participating in sports of their chosen gender, Rapinoe wrote, ""These bills are some of the most intense political assaults on LGBTQ people in recent years. Sports have become another avenue to attack the rights of trans people. These efforts cause incredible harm to trans youth, who, like all kids in a global pandemic, are feeling isolated and need compassion and support.""

""Even before the pandemic hit, 1 in 3 transgender youth reported attempting suicide, as one national crisis-prevention organization reported in 2019,"" she added.

Such bills, she explained, are only trying to ""solve a problem that doesn't exist.""

""Proponents of these bills argue that they are protecting women,"" Rapinoe continued. ""As a woman who has played sports my whole life, I know that the threats to women's and girls' sports are lack of funding, resources, and media coverage; sexual harassment; and equal pay.""

Anything other than permitting transgender females from competing on women's sports teams is ""discrimination,"" she alleged.

""Adults can't present that we care about the well-being of children while actively creating environments that cause serious harm to them,"" Rapinoe added. ""We can't make demands for a false sense of fairness while ignoring the actual needs of women and girls.""

She pointed out that transgender children deserve equal chances to enjoy playing on sports teams — no matter their gender.

""Transgender kids deserve the same chances to enjoy sports; to gain confidence, self-respect and leadership skills; and to learn what it means to be part of a team,"" the soccer star insisted. ""When we tell transgender girls that they can't play girls' sports — or transgender boys that they can't play boys' sports — they miss out on these important experiences and opportunities. And we lose the right to say we care about children.""

She concluded, ""Discrimination hurts everyone. We're stronger as teams, and as a country, when all people who love sports have a chance to have their lives changed for the better, just like I did. I want every transgender kid out there to know that they can live their dreams and be true to who they are. For them to realize those dreams, they need to be allowed to play.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/megan-rapinoe-let-males-play-womens-sports,2021-03-30
"Two men displaying 'Trump Won' banner escorted from Yankee game, at least one in handcuffs","Security removed two men from Yankee Stadium — one apparently in handcuffs — after the pair displayed a massive pro-Donald Trump banner during Thursday night's game.

What happened?

Photos and videos posted on social media from Thursday night's game show the men unraveling the banner which said, ""Trump Won, Save America,"" and draping over the second deck behind first base.

In footage posted by Sports Illustrated reporter Max Goodman, fans can be heard loudly booing the men while others appeared to clap and cheer. At one point, one angry fan attempts to jump up and grab the banner to pull it down.

Goodman wrote in the post that it ""sounded like the entire crowd was booing until security confiscated the banner, which then resulted in a loud cheer.""

Photos captured by the New York Post appear to show the two men struggling with security guards who were attempting to confiscate the banner.

In another video posted on Facebook, one of the two men is seen being escorted out of the stadium in handcuffs surrounded by a group of four or five security guards while the other man follows behind unrestrained.

As the two men were removed, fans flipped them off and shouted something along the lines of ""Get Them Out!""

What else?

Lindsey Adler, who covers the Yankees for The Athletic, wrote in a tweet, ""Lots of booing here after some jabronis unfurled a 'TRUMP WON' banner off the second deck. (He didn't).""

""Now we have extremely loud cheering as the conspiracy theory banner people are led out of the section by security,"" she added in another tweet.

The incident occurred during the second game of a doubleheader between the New York Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays.

One of the men involved in the incident appears to be Don Cini, who describes himself on Twitter as a ""Guerilla Marketeer, Founder of OperationFlagDrop and 'Professional Provacatuer.'""

Anything else?

While it's fair to wonder if a similar banner promoting a Democratic politician would have been treated in the same fashion, Yankee Stadium official policies permit security to remove banners or signs at their discretion:

Banners and signs are permitted provided they are baseball-related, in good taste, not of a commercial nature and not supported by wood, metal or other materials that could be injurious in a crowded public setting. Banners and signs may not obstruct the view of other Guests or Yankee Stadium advertising signage or be affixed to the Stadium in any manner. Banners and signs may be carried through the stands between innings only. Banners and signs may not be displayed in fair territory. Any banner or sign may be removed, at any time, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Yankees.

Similarly, the stadium says, ""Guests who refuse to follow the direction of Yankee Stadium Team Members or who do not comply with the Guest Code of Conduct face immediate ejection and revocation of season tickets and/or future ticket privileges without refund.""

According to a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday, two-thirds of Republican voters do not think President Joe Biden's defeat of Donald Trump in the 2020 election was legitimate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/men-removed-from-yankee-game-trump-banner,2021-05-28
Former Dem congressman pleads guilty to orchestrating ballot-stuffing scheme to benefit Democrats,"Disgraced former Democratic congressman Michael ""Ozzie"" Myers has pleaded guilty to ballot stuffing in multiple elections.

Myers was infamously expelled from the House of Representatives — the only member of Congress to be expelled in the 20th century — in 1980 after being caught up in a bribery scandal. He was later convicted of bribery and conspiracy, and he was sentenced to three years in prison.

What are the details?

The Justice Department announced on Monday Myers, now 79 years old, pleaded to conspiracy to deprive voters of civil rights, bribery, obstruction of justice, falsification of voting records, and conspiring to illegally vote in a federal election.

According to the DOJ, Myers ""orchestrat[ed] schemes to fraudulently stuff the ballot boxes for specific Democratic candidates in the 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 Pennsylvania elections.""

An unsealed indictment against Myers explains

As a political consultant, defendant MYERS held himself out as an effective and successful political operative capable of ensuring his clients' electoral success. Defendant MYERS exercised influence and control in Philadelphia's 39th Ward by distributing cash payments and supporting family, friends, and allies for elective office in the 39th Ward, and installing Ward Leaders, Judges of Elections, and Democratic State Committee Persons.



Through the scheme described below, MYERS advanced his political and financial interests through fraudulent and corrupt means by engaging in a ""ballot stuffing"" scheme that enabled him to take credit for the electoral success of his Philadelphia based clients and preferred candidates, secure his standing in local party politics that enabled him to control and influence the 39th Ward, and influence the distribution of local patronage jobs.

In a particularly brutal reminder of his past, FBI special agent in charge Jacqueline Maguire said Myers' latest crime spree is indicative of who he is as a person.

""One thing you can say about Ozzie Myers: his values have long been out of whack,"" she said. ""Decades ago, he valued a fake sheikh’s bribes more than the ethical obligations of his elected federal office.

""This time around, he valued his clients’ money and his own whims more than the integrity of multiple elections and the will of Philadelphia voters,"" Maguire added. ""Free and fair elections are critical to the health of our democracy, which is why protecting the legitimacy of the electoral process at every level is such a priority for the FBI.”

"Michael Phelps addresses transgender swimmer controversy, declares that sports must 'be played on an even playing field'","Swimming legend Michael Phelps addressed the controversy surrounding transgender swimmer Lia Thomas last week and expressed the importance of fair competition.

Thomas — a University of Pennsylvania swimmer who was born a biological male and competed as a male swimmer for most of her life — has dominated female competition in recent months.

Although Thomas took one year of testosterone suppression treatment in compliance with NCAA rules, critics believe that Thomas has an unfair competitive advantage. After all, Thomas was a highly competitive swimmer when competing as a male, even earning second-team All-Ivy League honors during the 2018-2019 swimming season.

What did Phelps say?

Speaking with CNN host Christiane Amanpour, Phelps said that sports must ""be played on an even playing field,"" something critics of Thomas say is not possible when a biological male completes against biological females.

""Look, like, I will say — I can talk from a standpoint of doping. I don't think I have competed in a clean field in my entire career,"" Phelps said. ""So, I think this leads back to the organizing committees again, because it has to be a level playing field.""

""I think that's something that we all need, because it's — like, that's what sports are,"" Phelps continued. ""And, for me, I don't know where this is going to go. I don't know what's going to happen. I believe that we all should feel comfortable with who we are in our own skin. But I think sports should all be played on an even playing field. I don't know what that looks like in the future. But it's hard.""

Phelps, a 23-time Olympic gold medalist, described the situation as ""very complicated"" but emphasized fairness in sports competition.

""This has been my sport my whole entire career. And I — honestly, the one thing I would love is everybody to be able to compete on an even playing field. That's all I can say,"" Phelps said.

Thomas made headlines again last week after she allegedly compared herself to Jackie Robinson.

""She compares herself to Jackie Robinson. She said she is like the Jackie Robinson of trans sports,"" one of Thomas’ teammates told the Washington Examiner.

""She laughs about it and mocks the situation. Instead of caring or showing that she cares about what she’s doing or what she’s doing to her teammates, she’s not sympathetic or empathetic at all,"" the teammate added. ""Lia never addressed our team. She never asked if it was OK. She never asked how we felt. She never tried to explain how she feels. She never has said anything to us as a group. She never addressed anything.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-phelps-addresses-transgender-swimmer-controversy,2022-01-18
Michelle Obama's brother sues kids' school for racial bias after they were disenrolled. The school says the parents were bullies.,"Craig and Kelly Robinson, former first lady Michelle Obama's brother and sister-in-law, have sued their children's school for alleged racial bias, CNN reported Thursday, after their two children were disenrolled from the school.

What are the details?

The Robinsons in their suit state that the prestigious University School of Milwaukee notified the couple that their children — ages 9 and 11 — would not be permitted back at the school for the 2021-2022 school year.

A portion of the letter sent at the end of last school year and obtained by CNN said, ""We cannot continue a relationship with your family.""

The Robinsons said that the school disenrolled their children because the parents ""brought up some issues that were sensitive to the administration.""

Craig told the outlet that he and his wife began providing feedback to the school on some of its teaching practices, which he said were ""troubling.""

""The first thing we noticed was a repeated use of racial and ethnic stereotypes in actual classroom assignments,"" Robinson said of the school's virtual learning sessions that took place during the previous school year.

The couple added that one such infraction was using the word ""plantation"" during a virtual learning lesson. The pair added that they were also disappointed about ""the way that [the school] dealt with"" the family's concerns ""and the fact that they didn't want to confront the actual issue.""

Instead of dealing with the issue, Kelly told CNN, the school ""retaliated against us and our children.""

The couple, according to the complaint, also ""raised concerns about USM's treatment of its students of color and submitted bias incident reports on behalf of underrepresented students.""

The family's attorney filed the civil suit against the school on Monday, alleging that it ""acted impermissibly to silence and to retaliate against those adversely affected by, and raising concerns about, the School's unfair treatment of students of color and underrepresented students.""

On Tuesday, the couple appeared on ""Good Morning America,"" where Greg said that he wants to hold the school accountable ""not just to our two children who they retaliated against,"" but a ""whole community of people who are out there that we wouldn't feel right if this happened moving forward.""

""The third reason is, this needs to stop and change and this will help all students at the University School of Milwaukee,"" he added.

The suit requests a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages.

What has the school said?

The school in a statement denied all allegations and said that the dismissal had everything to do with how the couple ""dealt with teachers and administrators.""

USM's letter to the Robinsons, dated June 2021 and sent by head of school Steven Hancock, said the decision came down to how the couple dealt with teachers and administrators.

""You neither demonstrated respect for their expertise and professionalism nor consistently related with them in a respectful, trustworthy, fair, or kind manner,"" a portion of the disenrollment letter to the Robinsons read. ""You repeatedly engaged in disrespectful and demanding communications with and about our teachers and administrators.""

The school on Tuesday released a statement saying that it was currently unable to comment on the litigation, but added, ""We can tell you that USM's enrollment decisions had nothing to do with complaints of inequity or discrimination and we intend to vigorously defend the school against any claim to the contrary.""



""We cannot and will not tolerate persistently disrespectful, bullying, or harassing behavior directed at our devoted and hardworking teachers and administrators,"" the statement added.

State Rep. Jewell Jones (D) was removed from committees in the state House by Republican House Speaker Jason Wentworth (R) on Thursday, the Detroit Free Press reported. The punishment was handed down after prosecutors from Livingston County said Jones attempted to smuggle a handcuff key into jail following a court hearing on Tuesday where a judge revoked his bond.

""Allegations in this matter allege the Defendant taping a handcuff key to the bottom of his foot with clear tape and was found by Livingston County Corrections Officers upon his incarceration,"" Livingston County Chief Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Carolyn Henry said. Jones was charged with one count of bringing a weapon into a jail and one count of attempting to escape waiting a felony trial.

""Rep. Jewell Jones's increasingly disruptive and distracting behavior in the months following his April arrest has eroded my confidence in his ability to conduct the people's work. That behavior hit a new low yesterday when he appears to have made a bizarre attempt to escape from jail, potentially resulting in two new charges. Action must be taken to protect the public's interest. I am now removing Rep. Jones from all House committees and encouraging him to use that time to make changes and take control of his actions,"" Wentworth said.

""The Michigan House of Representatives will continue to make sure he has access to every service and every bit of support we have to help him on his journey. I sincerely hope he finally takes advantage of those opportunities and gets the help he needs. The people he serves are counting on him to do so,"" he added.

House Democratic Leader Donna Lasinski (D) did not comment on Wentworth's decision but expressed support for a fair trial for Jones in a statement.

""Rep. Jones is facing an increasing number of serious charges. Our priority is providing him with the support he needs to meet these challenges and stay healthy. We are focused on ensuring Rep. Jones has a fair pathway to accountability so we can move forward together,"" she said.

""These are serious charges. It's important to let the investigation proceed and the legal process play out so all the facts can come to light,"" Lasinski added.

Jones was arrested in April after police said he crashed his vehicle while ""super drunk."" He was charged with driving while intoxicated, weapons possession, and resisting arrest after he allegedly became combative with police. Officers said that the lawmaker threatened them multiple times by saying he would call Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) about his arrest.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-democrat-loses-committee-assignments-after-allegedly-trying-to-escape-from-jail,2021-09-16
Cannibal rapist sentenced for sex attack and biting face,"A Michigan woman recounted a nightmarish attack that she likened to a ""horror movie"" during a court hearing on Wednesday. The brutal assault was committed by the victim's one-time friend – who allegedly bit off her ear and ate her cheek.

It started out as a friendly get-together

An unnamed 48-year-old woman invited Allison Thompson Weaver over to her home for some alcoholic beverages on Sept. 16, 2019. The two women were friends and former neighbors.

Weaver allegedly made sexual advances toward the homeowner, but she was not interested.

""She put the alcohol beverages that she brought – she put them down,"" the victim said, according to WDIV. ""She came over to give me a hug because we hadn’t seen each other in a long time, and that’s when she proceeded to kiss me. She kissed me with an open mouth kiss, and my reaction was to just kind of laugh and brush it off and stop it.""

The homeowner went to bed, but was reportedly awakened by a nude Weaver on top of her.

'My life changed forever'

""On Sept. 16, 2019, my life changed forever. I let Allison Thompson Weaver in my home, and in return, she tried to kill me. If the police hadn’t shown up when they did, from neighbors calling 9-1-1, I wouldn’t be here today,"" the victim told the courtroom during Weaver's hearing.

""(I remember) jumping off my bed and seeing Allison on all fours on my bed, and me standing there and she was on all fours giving me a really scary look,"" the anonymous woman said. ""I was, like, 'Allison, Allison, what are you doing?' She just kept giving me this look with her head going back and forth. I was, like, 'What are you doing?' She just lunged at me, and she just started strangling me.""

""I have some memories of the attack that night, like bits and pieces of a horror movie,"" the victim recalled. ""First, of waking up in my own bed to find her in some animal-like crawling position, naked, ready to pounce on me. Her strangling me, the expression on her face, until I was unconscious.""

She added, ""I do remember seeing pure evil in her eyes, though, and I truly believe nothing can save her.""

The 'cannibalistic rapist' told the victim: 'You have to die'

The victim told the judge that she has permanent nerve damage all over her body because Weaver had bitten her breasts, vagina, and face.

""She bit off my ear and literally consumed parts of me, like my cheek, for instance,"" she claimed. ""The pain in my neck, shoulder, and back, even with physical therapy, is only getting worse. I have been trying to avoid more surgeries, if possible, than I’ve already had.""

""The extreme pain I felt as I regained consciousness and could not move from being raped, beaten, and literally eaten alive from head to toe,"" the woman said. ""I knew in my head what was happening to me, and I couldn’t do a thing about it.""

""Then she whispered the words, 'You have to die.' I begged her, 'I'll do anything you want.' But she laughed and replied, 'It's too late,' and began strangling me again, a second time,"" the woman remembered. ""This time, I saw my loved ones flash before my eyes. I saw a bright light, and I saw the end of my life. That’s all I remember until the hospital.""

The victim said that the ""hundreds"" of photos of vicious bite marks all over her body ""just begin to show what this cannibalistic rapist put me through, all the while with a smile on her face.""

Assailant claimed to be a 'wolf' during sex attack

The brutal sex attack was heard by neighbors at the Lake Village Apartments in Rochester Hills. The resident informed police that he could hear a person moaning and begging for help.

Deputies from the Oakland County Sheriff's Office responded to the call at 1:23 a.m. on Sept. 17, 2019.

Deputies knocked on the front door of the victim's apartment, but nobody answered. They could hear a person wailing and calling for help. Police said they entered through an unlocked door and found the two women in a bedroom.

Sgt. Jason Dalbec of the Oakland County Sheriff's Office testified in 2019, ""They saw the two women covered in blood. One was lying on the floor. Another was kneeling next to her, and they're both in this dazed and confused (state).""

Deputy Shawn Hopkins told the courtroom, ""One was lying on her back on the floor, the other one was sitting up on her knees between the bed and the victim lying on the floor.""

""(Weaver) seemed to be in a happy-type mood,"" Hopkins revealed. ""She was having a good time. (The victim) was very quiet – almost appeared like she may have been in shock.""

Hopkins added, ""Ms. Weaver told me that they were having consensual sex and that (the victim) was a vampire and that Ms. Weaver was the wolf.""

Hopkins said of the victim, ""Other than the fact that she appeared to be covered in blood, I noticed a large wound to the side of her left eye area and cheek, and I also noticed that the outer edge of her left ear appeared to be missing. (The wound on her cheek) was approximately an inch in diameter. It appeared the flesh was completely gone like it had been removed from her face, possibly bitten off.""

He noted, ""I noticed the outer edge – the curve on the back side of her ear – appeared to be missing from just above the earlobe to up around the top part of the ear.""

Deputies said Weaver was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. They found alcohol, marijuana packages, and prescription medications in the kitchen.

Weaver was taken into custody by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office deputies.

Dalbec remarked, ""This is very unusual. This is one of those cases that will be once in a lifetime for deputies.""

Surviving the 'horror movie' attack was a 'miracle'

The victim told the court, ""No one knows why she chose me to be her victim that night. The doctors at the hospital said it was nothing short of a miracle that I survived that attack that night.""

The victim stated, ""Every hour of every day, I deal with excruciating pain because of what she did to me and the countless bite wounds.""

""I'm learning to live with the pain and countless scars, as well as the countless stares I receive, but what is scaring me is the nonstop visions of her demon eyes killing me and the fact that she will try to do this again someday,"" she said.



Judge says 'horrific is not even the word' for the savage attack



Oakland County Judge Nanci Grant said the savage abuse that the victim suffered was more violent than murder cases.



""The victim started off her statement, 'It was like being in a horror movie,' and I wrote that down because when I reviewed the (pre-sentence investigation), I had to read it a few times because I couldn’t believe what I was reading,"" Grant said. ""Then, when I talked to (the attorney) about it, the first thing out of his mouth was, ‘It was like reading a script for a horror movie.'""

""I can't even imagine what you were going through ... I've been up here for 25 years and I’ve seen murder cases that were not nearly as violent as this case,"" Grant declared. ""I can’t imagine, psychologically, where you (Weaver) were in doing this to her, and the excuses that were made for it, and then this is the first time I saw the medical records in terms of all the wounds on her body and her face and her genitalia. ‘Horrific’ is not even the word for it.”

Weaver, 47, had been charged with second-degree criminal sexual conduct, assault with intent to do great bodily harm, assault with intent to maim, and assault by strangulation. On Wednesday, Weaver pleaded guilty to assault charges.

Judge Grant sentenced Weaver to 10-15 years in prison, and she must register as a sex offender.

Grant said of the sentence, ""I think this is the correct resolution to this particular matter. I don’t think that these charges would ever have intended to reflect what actually happened here. These charges are not what was seen here. So in some ways, it’s a gift (for Weaver) what these charges are.""

The victim reacted to the judge's sentence.

""I don’t think it’s fair that she has taken so much away from me that I can never get back,"" the woman told the judge. ""She stole a part of me and she broke a part of me. She took away my sense of safety and trust, and so much more. Everything that this thing has done to me deserves more than 10-15 years behind bars. I will be living with these problems, pains, damages, and fears for the rest of my life.""

Weaver told the court, ""I would like to apologize to the victim and her family, and also to my family, as well. I do feel really, really horrible about what happened. I wish I could take it away.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-woman-wolf-attack-cannibal-rapist,2022-10-14
Mike Rowe: America will take 'another pie to the face' if Biden's Inflation Reduction Act doesn't reduce inflation,"Former ""Dirty Jobs"" host Mike Rowe criticized the rhetoric used by Democrats to describe their multi-billion dollar climate spending and tax bill, dubbed the ""Inflation Reduction Act,"" saying Americans will see past the bill title and judge it based on whether it improves the economy.

""Can we have bills that actually do what they say in their title?"" Rowe asked on ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning.



He continued, ""Now, if the Inflation Reduction Act truly reduces inflation, then we can start with a conversation about the nuts and bolts of the bill. But we've come to the point where nothing actually means what it says. And that gets us into an emperor's new clothes kind of mentality, where it's not one kid in the crowd going, 'Hey, that guy's naked.' It's the whole country going, 'Wait. Again with this? Again with the name of a thing that doesn't seem to reflect the thing?' And so we got to peel back the layers and we have to look at it. And then we have to have the conversation: How does this impact the middle class?

""What the heck do I know? If it lives up to its name, it'll impact them in a positive way. If it doesn't, it's another pie in the face,"" Rowe said.

The Inflation Reduction Act has been lauded by Democrats as a historic investment in green energy to save the climate and in policies that will force the wealthy to ""pay their fair share"" in taxes and reduce the deficit to fight inflation. The bill imposes a 15% minimum tax on corporations with profits over $1 billion, spends about $80 billion to ramp up Internal Revenue Service enforcement, and spends more than $360 billion on tax credits and subsidies to boost the green energy industry.

However, some economists have warned that the Inflation Reduction Act will have a negligible impact on inflation. Analysis from the Tax Foundation estimates the bill will reduce long-run economic output by about 0.2% and eliminate 29,000 full-time jobs in the United States.

Fox News co-host Peter Doocy pointed out that while unemployment is at historically low levels, fewer Americans are participating in the economy now compared to before the pandemic, and people are still feeling squeezed by inflation.



""It's almost impossible to have a rational conversation about this because it just flies past people,"" Rowe lamented.

""Years ago, when I started Mike Rowe Works, the skills gap consisted of 2.3 million jobs. But the headlines every day were the number of people who were unemployed. That's what we were fixated on, 10 million people out of work. So it became impossible to talk about a few million open jobs. Today, you have 7.5 million open jobs and super-low unemployment,"" he said.



""And we still can't get it into our heads that the existence of all of that opportunity must mean something. It must say something about who we are as a people and what we're elevating in terms of work. And I'm afraid what it says is not really good.""

Liberals melt down after Mike Rowe outlines the downside to raising minimum wage,"Mike Rowe outlined what could be the downside to raising the minimum wage and liberals online went into meltdown mode in response.

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" star spoke to Fox Business about the opportunities that might be lost to workers if the minimum wage is raised.

""I want everybody who works hard and plays fair to prosper,"" Rowe said.

""I want everybody to be able to support themselves. But if you just pull the money out of midair you're going to create other problems, like there is a ladder of success that people climb and some of those jobs that are out there for seven, eight, nine dollars an hour, in my view, they're simply not intended to be careers,"" he explained.

""They're not intended to be full-time jobs,"" he added. ""They're rungs on a ladder.""

Biden has vowed to fight to increase the minimum wage, but an analysis of the Democrats' plan by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it could lead to the loss of 1.4 million jobs.

Rowe was also concerned that lower wage jobs were opportunities for workers with few skills to gain those skills in order to gain better employment.

""[Those jobs] are ways for people to get experience in the workforce doing a thing that might not necessarily pay you as much as you'd like, but nevertheless serves a real purpose,"" he added.

""I worry that the path to a skilled trade can be compromised when you offer an artificially high wage for, I hate the expression, but an unskilled job,"" Rowe explained. ""So to me, the brightest line needs to be drawn between skilled and unskilled work. We need to encourage more people to learn a skill that's actually in demand.""

Supporters of the minimum wage were angered by Rowe's argument and took to Twitter to excoriate him.

""I come from a family of minimum wage and blue collar workers. I worked minimum wage jobs before and during college to pay the bills after I left the Army. Guys like Mike Rowe are hacks who perform white masculinity and American Exceptionalism' with remarkably uncalloused hands,"" tweeted Charlotte Clymer, LGBTQ activist.

""Hi, I'm mike Rowe. And today on Dirty Jobs, I'm going to introduce you to some people I don't value nor give two s***s about. Let's have some fun,"" said Jessica Huseman, a liberal journalist.

""A guy named mike rowe definitely exists. the real him is nothing like the dude who shows up on television to sell trucks, starvation wages and right to work,"" responded Nathan Bernhardt.

Rowe also addressed the minimum wage debate in 2017 in an appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show.

Here's the latest from Mike Rowe:

Mike Rowe blames labor shortage on American society looking down on hard work,"Mike Rowe said that the massive worker shortage undermining America's economic recovery is due to people looking down on jobs involving hard work.

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" star made his comments on Fox News on Thursday.

""There's something in us, it's the fault in our stars, you know, where we begin to resent the very thing we rely upon,"" said Rowe.

""My career has been spent mostly trying to find the workers who are out of sight and therefore out of mind, just tapping the country on the shoulder and saying, 'hey! What about him? What about her? Check these guys out,'"" he added.

Labor shortages across the country have hamstrung companies trying to meet the increased demand as the pandemic recedes and Americans go back to living life. Average wages have risen as a response, but skyrocketing inflation is also taking a toll.

""Look this whole problem, this disconnect, this skills gap, 11 million open jobs, this isn't a mystery. This is a reflection of what we value,"" Rowe continued.

""And our country has become disconnected from the kinds of jobs that you're talking about right now. We're not properly gobsmacked when we turn on the switch and the lights turn on, or when we flush the toilet and it all goes away,"" he said.

""So it's no great mystery why our kids aren't eager to fill these positions, we take them for granted, ourselves,"" he concluded.

Rowe went on to say that even people who value labor generally don't want their children to become welders or truck drivers, despite the opportunity to earn great wages working those jobs.

The economic recovery has been stymied by a lack of workers, a trend that some economists are calling ""the Great Resignation."" Many Republicans believed that generous unemployment benefits were keeping people from going back to work but the problem has continued long after those benefits were ended.

Mississippi passes bill blocking transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports,"The Mississippi House passed a bill Wednesday to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports across the state.

The bill is now headed to Republican Gov. Tate Reeves' desk. He is expected to sign the bill, according to a Fox News report.

What are the details?

The House passed the bill — dubbed the Mississippi Fairness Act — 81-28 on Wednesday, according to the outlet. Six representatives did not vote, and seven representatives voted ""present.""

The Republican-controlled state Senate passed the bill 34-9 in February.

The ban will apply to state schools and universities. According to ABC News, the bill would require ""any public school and university that is a member of the Mississippi High School Activities Association and NCAA, among other associations, to designate their athletic teams as male, female or co-ed and restrict athletes assigned male at birth from joining female teams.""

Idaho became the first state to pass a similar law banning trans women from competing in women's sports in 2020. A federal district court, however, suspended the new law and it has yet to be enacted.

What are people saying about this?

Mississippi Republican State Sen. Angela Hill, who sponsored the bill, said, ""If we do not move to protect female sports from biological males who have an unfair physiological advantage, we will eventually no longer have female sports.""

She added, ""This issue is imminent in Mississippi. We have to make a statement that women matter, female sports matter.""

Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said the state was clearly on the ""wrong side of history.""

""There is simply no justification for banning transgender girls and women from participating in athletics other than discrimination,"" David said in a statement on the Mississippi House passing the bill. ""Like all girls, transgender girls just want to play and be part of a team with their friends. History will not look kindly on this moment in Mississippi.""

David added, ""These dangerous bills are designed to make the lives of transgender kids more difficult while they try to navigate their adolescence.""

Biden's stance

In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order extending protections against discrimination of gender identity and sexual orientation.

""Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love,"" Biden said at the time. ""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or the school sports.""

Mississippi is now one of more than 20 states where lawmakers have proposed restrictions on trans athletes playing on sports teams. Only 17 states allow transgender high school athletes to take part in sports without regulation",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mississippi-ban-transgender-athletes-girls-sports,2021-03-04
Mitch McConnell says he 'has not made a final decision' on how he will vote on impeachment,"Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has broken his silence on the second impeachment of President Donald Trump, telling colleagues in a note on Wednesday that he ""has not made a final decision"" on which way he will vote on the matter.

What are the details?

The Hill reported that according to an excerpt released by his office, McConnell wrote, ""While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.""

The Republican leader's statement comes the day after The New York Times reported that McConnell ""has told associates that he believes President Trump committed impeachable offenses and that he is pleased that Democrats are moving to impeach him, believing it will make it easier to purge [Trump] from the party.""

Following the House's voted Wednesday to impeach Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"" over his actions and rhetoric surrounding the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob, McConnell issued a statement confirming earlier reports that he would not bring the Senate back in session prior to its scheduled Jan. 19 return—despite Democrats' push for an emergency session ahead of Trump leaving office.

""Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week,"" McConnell wrote, explaining, ""the Senate has held three presidential impeachment trials. They have lasted 83 days, 37 days, and 21 days respectively.""

""Even if the Senate process were to begin this week, and move promptly, no final verdict would be reached until after President Trump had left office,"" McConnell continued. ""This is not a decision I am making; it is a fact. The President-elect himself stated last week that his inauguration on January 20 is the 'quickest' path for any change in the occupant of the presidency.""

McConnell led the GOP-controlled Senate's successful quashing of House Democrats' effort to remove Trump from office via impeachment last year, but the Republican leader has taken a different approach this time by not condemning impeachment as he did before.

CNN reported:

Several GOP sources said on Tuesday that if McConnell supports conviction, Trump almost certainly will be convicted by 67 senators in the impeachment trial. ""If Mitch is a yes, he's done,"" said one Senate GOP source who asked not to be named.

Many Republican senators are staying quiet about whether they'll back conviction -- a sign that they, too, could support conviction in an effort to rid Trump from their party.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-says-he-has-not-made-a-final-decision-on-how-he-will-vote-on-impeachment,2021-01-14
MLB commissioner who dumped Atlanta for All-Star Game due to GA voting law gets massively mocked now that Braves are in World Series,"Major League Baseball's woke idea in early April apparently was to punish Georgia for what it viewed as its unfair, recently passed voting law by yanking the All-Star Game from Atlanta.

At the time, MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said the move was ""the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport,"" that pro baseball ""fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions at the ballot box,"" and that ""fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support.""

Georgia's election reforms include requiring absentee ballots be verified with a photo ID and expanding early voting for primary and general elections — changes generally supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats.

'Cancel culture and woke political activists'

After Manfred dumped Atlanta as the All-Star Game's host city, Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said ""Georgians — and all Americans — should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included.""

He added, ""This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections. I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections.""

The Braves also issued a statement upon hearing the news saying they were ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta and that ""unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.""

Indeed, according to Fox News, the move actually would hurt minorities by moving revenue from 51% black Atlanta to 76% white Denver, the All-Star Game's eventual landing spot.

Georgia gets some sweet revenge

Well, Manfred may have been able to deny Georgia a big national spotlight — along with coveted cash — by pulling the All-Star Game from Atlanta this year, but there's nothing he can do about the Braves punching their ticket to the World Series after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the National League Championship over the weekend.

The Braves will host at least games 3 and 4 on Friday and Saturday in Atlanta against the Houston Astros — and possibly game 5 on Sunday.

What was the reaction?

In the eyes of many folks, the Braves' appearance in the Series is some big-time comeuppance for Manfred and all those who supported dumping Atlanta for the All-Star Game.

At the top of the list was Kemp, who took aim again at Abrams — who has been a prominent voice against the state's voting law — as well as the MLB: ""While Stacey Abrams and the MLB stole the All-Star Game from hardworking Georgians, the Braves earned their trip to the World Series this season and are bringing it home to Georgia. Chop On, and Go @Braves!""

Another prominent Georgia Republican, Marci McCarthy — chair of the DeKalb GOP — reveled in the turn of events:

Other Twitter users expressed similar emotions:

""So now the woke-social justice warrior moron, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, has to watch the team, the city, and the state he screwed — on the biggest stage — the only one bigger than the All-Star game,"" talk radio station WJNO-AM said.

""Big Middle Finger to @MLB & Rob Manfred from the city of ATL,"" one user said. ""Would love to see Manchild 'forced' to present them the Series trophy after Game 5 in front of stadium full of fans from which he ripped Henry Aaron All-Star tribute ...""

""Rob Manfred has to come to Atlanta for the World Series!!"" another user said. ""Eat. S**t. MLB.""

""Now we need the Braves to win the series in 4 or 5 so Rob Manfred has to be here to face the fans to present the trophy after taking the All-Star Game,"" another user noted.

""I wonder how Rob Manfred feels about the city of Atlanta and Braves being in World Series after canceling All-Star game,"" another user mused. ""Another horrible hypocrite that should not show his face at World Series.""

I hope the @Braves go on & win the World Series at Truist Park! We'll see how warm of a reception Rob Manfred gets when he has to present the [Trophy] in Atlanta after moving the All-Star game in a 'woke' political move that has nothing to do with baseball.""

And on the day the Braves got the bad news about the All-Star Game moving — April 2 — one user posted a humorous tweet referring to a famous scene from the beloved baseball movie, ""Major League,"" which marks the turning point for the frustrated franchise in the film:

And the guy who posted the original tweet revisited it Sunday: ""Only fitting ending is for Rob Manfred to hand the trophy to the @Braves organization.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mlb-commissioner-atlanta-all-star-game-braves-world-series,2021-10-25
"Country music star Morgan Wallen issues impassioned apology following use of N-word: Details concerning 72-hour bender, talks sobriety, quotes Apostle Paul","Country music star Morgan Wallen has issued an apology following the controversy that ensued last week after video of him using the N-word emerged.

TMZ on Feb. 2 shared video of Wallen shouting the N-word after what was described as a rowdy night out on the evening of Jan. 31.

What are the details?

On Wednesday night, Wallen shared a video to his YouTube page and other social media channels, addressing the incident, apologizing for his behavior, and discussing sobriety.

""The video you saw was me on hour 72 of a 72-hour bender, and that's not something I'm proud of either,"" Wallen said. ""Obviously, the natural thing to do is to apologize further and continue to apologize, because you got caught, and that's not what I wanted to do. ... I let so many people down who mean a lot to me, who have given so much to me. It's just not fair. I let my parents down, and they're the furthest thing from the person in that video. I let my son down, and I'm not OK with that.""

He added, ""When I look at the times that I'm not [sober], it seems to be when the majority of my mistakes are made.""

The 27-year-old Wallen also added that he is working toward having meaningful conversations with members of the black community to gain a newfound perspective on the use of the N-word.

""This week I heard firsthand some personal stories from black people that honestly shook me,"" he added. ""And I know what I'm going through this week doesn't even compare to some of the trials I heard about from them. I came away from those discussions with a deep appreciation for them and a clearer understanding of the weight of my words.

""Our actions matter. Our words matter, and I just want to encourage anyone watching to please learn from my mistake,"" he continued. ""There's no reason to downplay what I did. It matters and please know I'm carefully choosing my next step in repair.""

Revealing that he's been sober for several days, Wallen said, ""I've decided to go off the grid for a little while and get used to making good decisions. I want my team, my family, my friends, and even strangers to trust me. Hell, I wanna trust me. Who knows if I'll be able to live down all the mistakes i've made, but I'm certainly going to try.""

Following the video's release, Wallen's record label dropped him, and a bevy of radio stations across the country refused to play his music.

He concluded the lengthy apology with a quote from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:13 on giving up ""childish ways.""

"Following N-word controversy, Morgan Wallen breaks 64-year Billboard chart record, surpasses Garth Brooks, the Eagles, and more","Country star Morgan Wallen has shattered a 64-year music chart record as his album, ""Dangerous: The Double Album,"" spent its eighth straight week in Billboard 200's No. 1 slot.

In February, Wallen came under fire after a video emerged depicting him using the N-word during a rowdy night out, and even though his record company and many radio stations in the U.S. dropped him, the country performer's star continued to rise.

What are the details?

In late February, Country Now reported that Wallen's ""Dangerous"" album has become the only country album to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the 64-year history of the chart.

According to a recent Billboard report, the album continues to dominate the Billboard 200 chart.

""Dangerous is now one of only six country albums that have spent at least eight weeks in total at No. 1,"" the outlet reported over the last week.

The outlet added, ""Dangerous now ties Taylor Swift's 2020 album Folklore for the second-most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the last five years — among albums of all genres.""

What could be more impressive, however, is the rest of the company in which Wallen's album is keeping atop the charts.

""Dangerous is also the only country set to spend its first eight weeks on the chart at No. 1,"" the industry leader added.

Country albums with the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 include Garth Brooks' 1991 album ""Ropin' the Wind""; Billy Ray Cyrus' 1992 album ""Some Gave All""; Taylor Swift's 2008 album ""Fearless""; Garth Brooks' 1994 album ""The Hits""; and the Eagles' 1977 album ""Hotel California.""

From Rolling Stone:

The chart dominance of Morgan Wallen continued this week as Dangerous: The Double Album coasted to Number One on the Rolling Stone Top 200 Albums chart. Wallen's set has now been in the top spot for two consecutive months. The backlash over a video of the singer using a racial slur has done little to shake his hold on Number One. Wallen sold more than 7,000 albums and earned nearly 90 million streams.

What else?

Wallen issued an apology for his remarks after the incident, saying that the video did not capture his finest moment.

""The video you saw was me on hour 72 of a 72-hour bender, and that's not something I'm proud of either,"" Wallen said at the time. ""Obviously, the natural thing to do is to apologize further and continue to apologize, because you got caught, and that's not what I wanted to do. ... I let so many people down who mean a lot to me, who have given so much to me. It's just not fair. I let my parents down, and they're the furthest thing from the person in that video. I let my son down, and I'm not OK with that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/morgan-wallen-n-word-billboard-chart-record,2021-03-09
Mother-daughter athlete duo appear on Fox News to rail against inclusion of transgender women in women's sports: This could mean 'the end of women's sports',"Athlete Cynthia Monteleone and her fellow athlete daughter, Reese, appeared on Friday's ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" where the two blasted the idea of including transgender women — or biologically born males — in women's sports.

What are the details?

In fiery remarks, the Monteleones said that trans weightlifter Laurel Hubbard — who will compete on New Zealand's female lifting team in July's Tokyo Games — should not be permitted to participate in the sport because of what they say are obvious advantages.

Hubbard, 43, is the very first transgender woman to qualify for the Olympics and will compete in the super heavyweight 87-kg category.

Cynthia, who formerly represented the United States at an international track and field competition in Spain, said that including Hubbard in the 2021 Olympics is just ""another step in erasing women from competition,"" The Post Millennial reported Friday night.

Her daughter, Reese — a high school sophomore track athlete in her own right — said that she ""lost out to a biological male competing in women's sports"" during her own experience at a high school event.

""We're here to speak up and to say it's happening,"" Cynthia said. ""It happened to me, and it's happening to my daughter. And this is a very dangerous issue. Not only can it be physically dangerous for girls in some sports, but it's dangerous to the whole concept of women's sports. Basically, this means the end of women's sports if this keeps happening.""

Carlson interjected, ""If not the end of women. I think we're challenging the category itself. What is a woman? Well, it's whatever you say it is, I guess.""

Cynthia, who is also a track coach, added that transgender women have distinctive advantages over biologically born females and insisted that fairness in women's sports is invaluable.

""We know from science that even after — let me be clear — even after hormone treatments and gender reassignment surgery, male-bodied athletes will still have an advantage over female athletes,"" Cynthia said. ""Frankly, we don't need science to tell us that — it's common sense, and instinct.""

She added, ""I feel badly for the girls I coach when they're psychologically distraught having to line up against a biological male in their race. I have compassion for all athletes, including these females who are being displaced.""

What else?

Reese told the Fox News host that she's received support for speaking out against the inclusion of transgender women in traditionally female sports.

""I've received mostly support from my fellow athletes and teammates, especially on my track team,"" she said, ""because girls like me have had to race against these athletes. Other mainstream media might try to shut us up or tell us not to share our message, but I believe that I'm standing up for what I believe in and I'm fighting for a fair playing field in women's sports.""

You can watch the segment in the video below.

What else?

A spokesperson for Save Women's Sport Australasia recently said that the International Olympic Committee should never have included Hubbard as a competitor in the forthcoming games.

""It is flawed policy from the IOC that has allowed the selection of a 43-year-old biological male who identifies as a woman to compete in the female category,"" the group said in an early June statement.

The group wasn't the only one to speak out against Hubbard's inclusion.

In May, Belgium weightlifter Anna Vanbellinghen said that the decision to include Hubbard is ""like a bad joke.""

""First off, I would like to stress that I fully support the transgender community, and that what I'm about to say doesn't come from a place of rejection of this athlete's identity,"" she said at the time. She added that ""anyone that has trained weightlifting at a high level knows this to be true in their bones: this particular situation is unfair to the sport and to the athletes.""

Earlier this week, NFL icon Brett Favre added that allowing Hubbard to compete on the women's team was nothing short of unfair.

""It's a man competing as a woman,"" he insisted during a recent ""Bolling with Favre"" podcast. ""That's unfair! It's not fair for a man, even if this person wants to be a woman or feels compelled — if you want to become the opposite sex, that's fine. I got no problem with it. But you can't compete against — males cannot compete against females.""

The Hall of Fame quarterback added, ""If I was a true female — I can't believe I'm saying that — and I was competing in weightlifting and lost to this person, I would be beside myself.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-daughter-athlete-duo-appear-on-fox-news-to-rail-against-inclusion-of-transgender-women-in-women-s-sports,2021-06-26
"Teen brutally sucker-punches girl. Mother charged for allegedly telling daughter to 'hit' opponent. Assailant's father, an ex-NBA player, apologizes.","A teen girl brutally attacked her opponent during a basketball game last month in Southern California. The assailant's mother has been charged in the sucker-punch attack for allegedly telling her daughter to hit the other girl. The attacker's father – who is a former NBA player – apologized for the barbaric assault.

During the tournament game between the SoCal Blaze and Dream Academy on Nov. 7, a player took a jump shot. A defender put a hand in her shooter's face, and the two players caused each other to fall down to the ground.

Both players get up and start walking to the other side of the court.

In the video, you can hear a female voice yell, ""You better hit her for that!""

A second later, one of the players winds up and brutally sucker-punches the defender in the head.

KNBC reported that the victim suffered a concussion, and is ""home and recovering.""

According to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, Latira Shonty Hunt allegedly instructed her daughter to ""hit"" the opponent. Hunt, 44, was charged with two misdemeanors — one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and one count of battery. Hunt, of La Puente, California, faces up to a year in jail if convicted.

""It is unconscionable that a parent would encourage her child to engage in violence during a sporting event,"" Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. ""Youth sports are invaluable in teaching our children discipline, teamwork, and sportsmanship. But a win at all costs mentality that is completely devoid of fair play, respect, and civility is disgusting. We as parents have the fundamental responsibility to raise our children to be good human beings who treat others with kindness and humanity.""



Kevin Hahn – an attorney for the victim – said, ""There was a clear direction from the mother to go hit my client. She clearly acted at the direction of her mother.""

The assailant's father – ex-NBA player Corey Benjamin – issued an apology.

""As a father, I'm shocked and disappointed at my daughter's behavior as this is not a reflection of the values and standards that my family holds,"" Benjamin said. ""Nor does it exemplify the values, character and spirit of sportsmanship that the game of basketball requires.""



""To the young lady who was punched by my daughter during a youth basketball game, I sincerely apologize to you and I am praying for your complete healing both physically and emotionally,"" he continued. ""To her family, I deeply apologize and regret that this happened to your daughter as she did not deserve this to happen to her. Finally, I apologize to all of those who have been impacted and hurt by the actions of my daughter as well as those of her mother.""

Brett Greenfield – a lawyer representing the Benjamini family – told NBC News, ""We look forward to seeing the evidence and will address the charges accordingly.""



""In the meantime, nothing is being done to protect the privacy of a minor nor has any protection been offered in the face of multiple unsolicited threats and racist rants directed toward the mother and minor daughter,"" Greenfield added.

"MSNBC workers announce union effort, but the progressive channel refuses to voluntarily recognize it","Employees of the progressive cable network MSNBC announced an effort to unionize, but the network said it would not voluntarily recognize it without a formal vote overseen by the National Labor Relations Board.

Several MSNBC hosts praised the announcement on Thursday that their staffers would be unionizing with the Writer's Guild of America.

""Extremely proud of my colleagues,"" responded Chris Hayes.

""All right then! Proud of my peeps,"" tweeted Joy Ann Reid.

The union effort specifically said it is seeking to be voluntarily recognized by MSNBC, but a statement from MSNBC President Rashida Jones quickly quashed those hopes.

""I believe our employees should be able to make such an important decision through a standard election process,"" said Jones. ""It is important to give everyone who would be included the chance to understand what this would mean before making their choice.""

Union organizers in other industries have lambasted the tactic of calling for an NLRB vote as a way to allow the company time to organize against the union efforts.

Among the gripes from the newly formed union were a lack of diversity and equal pay for equal work.

""We are organizing to advocate for equal pay for equal work; diversity at every level of production; clear job descriptions and access to career development,"" the MSNBC union tweeted, ""and fair compensation for the hours we all spend to deliver the news.

""We are standing up for each other and our work – because this is who we are. After 10 months of organizing, we are asking for voluntary recognition of our union and look forward to constructive negotiations with MSNBC and Comcast for a fair contract,"" they added.

The account for the group posted a petition of over 200 employees demanding the union be recognized.

Multiple companies yank donations from Republicans who opposed Electoral College certification,"At least three major corporations have announced they will stop giving to the political campaigns of Republican lawmakers who opposed the certification of Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.

The development comes as America attempts to reckon with the deadly riots on the U.S. Capitol last week, which happened as a joint-session of Congress was meeting to certify Biden's win. Those lawmakers who opposed the certification have been at least partially blamed for helping instigate the riots by sowing doubt into the legitimacy of Biden's victory.

Despite the violence, 147 Republican lawmakers — 139 representatives and eight senators — still voted against the certification of Electoral College results.

What's happening now?

Popular Information, a political newsletter operated by left-wing operative Judd Legum, contacted 144 corporations that financially supported the Republican lawmakers, specifically the eight senators, through their corporate PACs, asking if the companies would continue to support the lawmakers.

In response, three of the companies told Popular Information they would stop donating:

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel chain

Blue Cross Blue Shield, one of America's largest health insurance providers

Commerce Bancshares

In a statement, a spokesperson for Marriott said, ""We have taken the destructive events at the Capitol to undermine a legitimate and fair election into consideration and will be pausing political giving from our Political Action Committee to those who voted against certification of the election.""

Meanwhile, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association president and CEO Kim Keck told Popular Information that it was suspending political donations to the 147 Republicans who voted against certification, calling their decision one that sought to ""undermine our democracy.""

At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals. In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.



While a contrast of ideas, ideological differences and partisanship are all part of our politics, weakening our political system and eroding public confidence in it must never be. We will continue to support lawmakers and candidates in both political parties who will work with us to build a stronger, healthier nation.

Commerce Bancshares told Popular Information, ""At this time, we have suspended all support for officials who have impeded the peaceful transfer of power. Commerce Bank condemns violence in any form and believes the actions witnessed this week are abhorrent, anti-democratic and entirely contrary to supporting goodwill for Americans and businesses.""

Legum later said that Citibank also told him it would pull their donations, but in Legum's article, he said that Citibank was pausing all PAC donations, not just those for Republicans.

A few companies told Popular Information they would temporarily suspend all PAC donations without partisan particularity, while others told the newsletter they were reviewing their policies.

"Multiple new animal studies suggest that Omicron causes much less damage to lungs, is primarily an upper respiratory disease","A series of animal studies released in recent days regarding the Omicron variant all point to the same conclusion: that while Omicron is highly infectious, it is significantly less lethal than any previous variant of COVID-19 because it causes much less damage to the lungs, according to the New York Times.

The Times highlighted a study released Wednesday by a large group of American and Japanese researchers regarding the effects of the Omicron variant on mice. In the study, the mice demonstrated significantly less lung damage than mice infected with previous strains of COVID-19, lost less weight, and died with significantly less frequency.

The Times also pointed to a mouse study published Sunday by a team of researchers which found that ""Strikingly, in hamsters that had been infected with the omicron variant, a 3log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs as compared to animals infected with D614G and no infectious virus was detectable in this organ.""

Another study published Thursday by a different set of researchers also found that rodents ""infected with the Omicron variant had less severe clinical signs (weight loss), showed recovery and had a lower virus load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract. This is also reflected by less extensive inflammatory processes in the lungs"" than what was observed in previous COVID-19 variants. A fourth study published Sunday regarding Syrian hamsters reached a similar conclusion.

Roland Eils, a computational biologist at the Berlin Institute of Health, told the Times that ""It’s fair to say that the idea of a disease that manifests itself primarily in the upper respiratory system is emerging.""

This data on animal tests tracks with data from South Africa, where local health officials have announced that they are past their Omicron peak, and have not experienced significant load on their hospital system.

Still, local health officials in the United States caution that, while evidence continues to mount that Omicron is less dangerous per each individual case, the rate at which it spreads could cause strain on the health care system if positive cases continue to climb.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/multiple-new-animal-studies-suggest-that-omicron-causes-much-less-damage-to-lungs-is-primarily-an-upper-respiratory-disease,2021-12-31
"Triple murder suspect accused of cutting out victim's heart, cooking it, and trying to serve it as a meal before killing two family members","Oklahoma authorities said Lawrence Paul Anderson — after being released early from prison in January — killed a woman, cut out her heart, took it across the street to his aunt and uncle's Chickasha home, cooked it with potatoes ""to feed to his family to release the demons,"" and then killed his uncle, badly injured his aunt, and killed their 4-year-old granddaughter, the Oklahoman reported.

What are the details?

Anderson, 42, faces three counts of first-degree murder, one count of assault and battery with a deadly weapon, and one count of maiming in the Feb. 9 attacks, the paper said.

He's accused of killing his uncle, Leon Pye, 67, attacking his aunt, Delsie Pye, and killing their granddaughter, Kaeos Yates, and the Pyes' neighbor, 41-year-old Andrea Lynn Blankenship, the Oklahoman reported. Anderson was arrested at the Pye residence after police responded to a 911 call, the paper said.

Image source: KFOR-TV video screenshot

Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agents said Anderson confessed and said he killed the neighbor first and then cut out her heart before taking it to the Pye home to cook with potatoes ""to feed to his family to release the demons,"" an OSBI agent wrote in a request for a search of the home, the paper added.



Agents found a cooking pot containing residue and another cooking pot with food inside, the Oklahoman reported.

""Anderson ... cooked the heart at the Pye home and tried to make Delsie and Leon Pye eat the heart before he attacked them,"" another OSBI agent wrote in a search request of the neighbor's home, the paper noted. Investigators said Anderson stabbed them, KFOR-TV reported, adding that Anderson's aunt who survived was stabbed in the eye.

Blankenship's cousin told the station she was a single mother of two who lived alone and worked from home.

Image source: KFOR-TV video screenshot, composite

The cousin added that her family is unaware of any relationship between Blankenship and Anderson, KFOR added.



What's the background?

Anderson was sentenced to prison in 2006 for attacking and pointing a gun at his girlfriend, the station said, adding that he was back behind bars in 2012 for selling crack cocaine near an elementary school. Anderson was sentenced again in 2017 for having a gun and sneaking drugs into jail, KFOR said.

The suspect was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2017, the Oklahoman reported, adding that Gov. Kevin Stitt last year commuted the sentence to nine years at the recommendation of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board.

Stitt's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.

Anderson was released after serving just over three years and had been staying at an inn and visiting his aunt and uncle's home, although he listed their home as his residence, the paper said.

""They were surprised to see him just show up, that he was out,"" Oklahoma City attorney Robert Wagner said, according to the paper. ""They had no prior knowledge that he was being released, and they had never consented to him listing their address as his home.""

'When is enough enough?'

""When is enough enough?"" Grady County District Attorney Jason Hicks said at a news conference after filing charges, the Oklahoman noted.

""We have seen 'criminal justice reform' in the state of Oklahoma now for several years,"" Hicks added, according to the paper. ""We have put politics and releasing inmates in front of public safety. The goal that we have set in Oklahoma is to decrease the prison population with no thought for public safety. And that's not fair to the people of the state of Oklahoma. And we have to come to terms with that.""

He also said reformers repeatedly talk about nonviolent offenders in prison, the Oklahoman noted.

""Go tell these families — the Blankenship and the Pye families — that Anderson was just a low-level nonviolent offender. Look at what ... he's accused of doing,"" Hicks said, according to the paper.

He also revealed that the Pardon and Parole Board took up Anderson's commutation application in January 2020 while also considering 600 others, the Oklahoman reported: ""It's too many. You don't have the time to look through those things and give any meaningful consideration to them.""

'I don't want no bail'

Anderson wept Tuesday at his first court appearance, the paper reported: ""Oh God,"" he said. ""Oh God.""

Grady County Special Judge Regina Lowe denied bail, the Oklahoman said.

Anderson declared, ""I don't want no bail, your honor. I don't want no bail,"" the paper said.

Defense attorney Al Hoch said he'll request an evaluation to determine if Anderson is mentally competent to be prosecuted, the paper said, adding that Anderson told a judge when he pleaded guilty to the 2017 crimes that he took bipolar medications.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/murder-suspect-cut-out-cooked-heart,2021-02-24
"Music journalist suggests country fans are racists, says they and 'other supporters of racial slurs' are buying Morgan Wallen tickets in droves","Music news outlet Consequence of Sound rolled with a story headline Tuesday that reads, ""Country Fans, People Who Like N-Word Buy Ungodly Amount of Morgan Wallen Tickets.""

And if the headline isn't inflammatory enough, a sentence in the first paragraph of Wren Graves' story gets more specific: ""Country fans, and various other supporters of racial slurs, have bought over 700,000 Wallen tickets since the tour was announced three weeks ago.""

""Country fans, and various other supporters of racial slurs"": How do you feel about that, country music fans?

What's the background?

Wallen made big headlines earlier this year after a video surfaced of him using the N-word — and then his label, Big Loud Records, suspended him indefinitely and radio stations dropped his music.

But less than a week later — akin to a collective ""Oh, yeah?"" — it was reported that Wallen's sophomore effort, ""Dangerous: The Double Album,"" was skyrocketing in sales.

In fact, just a month later, the ""Dangerous"" album shattered a 64-year music chart record as it spent its eighth-straight week in the Billboard 200's No. 1 slot.

Wallen, as you might expect, apologized for his use of the N-word: ""The video you saw was me on hour 72 of a 72-hour bender, and that's not something I'm proud of, either. Obviously, the natural thing to do is to apologize further and continue to apologize, because you got caught, and that's not what I wanted to do ... I let so many people down who mean a lot to me, who have given so much to me. It's just not fair. I let my parents down, and they're the furthest thing from the person in that video. I let my son down, and I'm not OK with that.""

Now what?

And after all that, Consequence of Sound seems perplexed and distraught, noting in its story that Wallen's ""massive arena tour has become the hottest ticket of 2021"" — and then appearing to stick it to country music fans for contributing to Wallen's success.

COS added that nearly all of his tour dates have sold out, and that Billboard has declared ""Dangerous"" the top-selling album of the year. The outlet also said that while Wallen pledged $500,000 to black-led organizations in response to his N-word controversy, a September COS article said he was several hundred thousand dollars short of that promise.

What did observers have to say?

Commenters on the COS Facebook page seemed mixed in their reactions to the outlet's ""People Who Like N-Word"" story.

Some appeared to align with the outlet's take, with one commenter responding ""good headline"" and another saying ""Lol @ the title. That is accurate."" Another ally said ""country has been, and continues to be, the bottom feeder of popular music.""

But others were annoyed and took COS to task:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/music-journalist-country-fans-racists-morgan-wallen-tickets,2021-12-07
Bowman accuses Musk of backing 'white supremacy and authoritarianism',"Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York accused business magnate Elon Musk of backing ""white supremacy and authoritarianism"" — the congressman made the comment in response to Musk's announcement that he had voted for Republican congressional candidate Mayra Flores.

Flores, who was born in Mexico and legally arrived in the U.S. at the age of six, won the special election on Tuesday in Texas's 34th Congressional District — the seat had been vacated by Democrat Filemon Vela Jr., who resigned earlier this year.

""I voted for Mayra Flores – first time I ever voted Republican. Massive red wave in 2022,"" Musk tweeted Wednesday.

""Elon Musk is not a leader. He’s just another Republican billionaire who supports white supremacy and authoritarianism because he doesn't want his workers to unionize or to pay his fair share in taxes. The GOP just tried to end democracy and now he’s supporting them,"" Bowman tweeted in response to Musk's post.

Bowman's attack against Musk raised eyebrows.

""When you think an African American immigrant voting for a Mexican-American woman is 'white supremacy,' it might be an indication your brain is broken,"" GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas remarked.

""Leftism is a mental disorder: Example 718C,"" tweeted BlazeTV's Dave Rubin of ""The Rubin Report.""

""Coming soon: Mayra Flores: The Latinx Face Of White Supremacy,"" Saagar Enjeti tweeted.

""Electing a Latina born in Mexico equaling white supremacist authoritarianism is a galaxy brain take that'll lead to a mammoth red tsunami. The far-left possesses some frightening levels of hatred for the American people,"" Newsbusters managing editor Curtis Houck tweeted.

Musk, who was born in South Africa, noted on Wednesday that he is leaning towards supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president in 2024.

DeSantis has not announced a presidential bid and is currently seeking another term in office during the Sunshine State's 2022 gubernatorial contest. The governor said on Wednesday that he is ""focused on 2022,"" adding, ""I welcome support from African Americans.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/musk-bowman-white-supremacy-authoritarianism,2022-06-15
Elon Musk blasts Twitter after Libs of TikTok creator says she got 'about a dozen death threats' yet Twitter didn't sanction any of those accounts,"Elon Musk blasted Twitter — the social media giant he recently agreed to purchase for $44 billion — after the creator of Libs of TikTok said she's received ""about a dozen death threats,"" and yet Twitter didn't sanction any of the accounts from which the threats originated.

What are the details?

Libs of TikTok on Monday tweeted: “Update: I have now received about a dozen death threats after radical leftists accused me of being a domestic terrorist extremist. Twitter has not removed any of the accounts of those who sent the threats.""

With that, Musk tweeted a reply — one-word question directed at Twitter: ""Why?""

Musk's reply has received over 80,000 likes as of Tuesday afternoon.

He later added that ""a platform cannot be considered inclusive or fair if it is biased against half the country.""

Musk has repeatedly called out Twitter's left-wing bias and has said he wants the platform to operate as a proponent of free speech — which, of course, doesn't include death threats.

What happened next?

Libs of TikTok tweeted a message Tuesday apparently indicating that Twitter suspended a number of accounts in connection to the death threats — and thanked Musk, too:

Anything else?

The timing of Musk's Twitter critique carries some drama with it. The Tesla CEO reportedly will address Twitter employees for the first time at a Thursday virtual meeting and take questions, Bloomberg reported.

Libs of TikTok's issues with Twitter are not new, and just last week the social media platform reportedly locked out Libs of TikTok over a tweet thread criticizing drag queen-related events for children.

But the account made a triumphant comeback Thursday: ""I'm back! Apparently posting videos and flyers of drag events is abusive but the actual events are just 'innocent family friendly entertainment,'"" Libs of TikTok declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/musk-twitter-libs-of-tiktok,2022-06-14
"NAACP urges pro athletes to 'avoid' signing with Texas teams due to state's positions on voting, abortion, COVID-19","The NAACP on Thursday said it sent an open letter to every professional sports players' association in the United States urging free agent athletes to avoid signing contracts with teams in Texas due to the state's ""most recent attacks on voting rights and reproductive care"" as well as its stance on COVID-19.

What are the details?

The letter — signed by NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson and NAACP Texas President Gary Bledsoe — was delivered to the National Football League Players Association, the Women's National Basketball Players Association, the National Basketball Players Association, the Major League Baseball Players Association, and the National Hockey League Players' Association, the organization said.

""As we watch an incomprehensible assault on basic human rights unfold in Texas, we are simultaneously witnessing a threat to constitutional guarantees for women, children and marginalized communities,"" the letter states, according to the NAACP. ""Over the past few months, legislators in Texas have passed archaic policies, disguised as laws, that directly violate privacy rights and a woman's freedom to choose, restrict access to free and fair elections for Black and brown voters, and increase the risk of contracting coronavirus. If you are a woman, avoid Texas. If you are Black, avoid Texas. If you want to lower your chances of dying from coronavirus, avoid Texas.""

Texas' pro-life law bars abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected — or as early as six weeks into pregnancy — and went into effect last month. Also in September, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed an election security bill into law that tightens restrictions on voting by mail. And earlier this month, the Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations if Texans object to the shots on the grounds of conscience, religious beliefs, or medical reasons.

The five leagues noted in the NAACP letter include nine Texas teams, ESPN said: the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans; the MLB's Houston Astros and Texas Rangers; the NBA's Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks, and San Antonio Spurs; the NHL's Dallas Stars, and the WNBA's Dallas Wings.

""When all else fails, we must look within and answer the call to protect the basic human rights and democratic values which are fundamental to this country,"" Johnson noted in regard to the letter, according to the NAACP. ""Professional athletes serve as some of our country's greatest role models and we need them to join us to fight for democracy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/naacp-pro-athletes-avoid-signing-with-texas-teams,2021-10-29
Nancy Pelosi snaps at reporter for asking simple question: 'Such a waste of my time',"Outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi snapped at a reporter on Thursday for daring to ask whether she intends to serve out her full term in Congress.

At Pelosi's weekly press conference, the reporter simply asked her whether she will ""commit to serving your full two‑year term for the people of San Francisco."" The top House Democrat, however, clearly disliked the question.

""What is this? What is this? Don't bother me with a question like that. Really? Really?"" she snapped.

""I said what I'm going to do. You know, those kind of questions are such a waste of my time,"" she complained.

The question came after other reporters asked Pelosi to reflect on her legacy in House Democratic leadership.

She responded:

Nothing in any of the years that I was there compares to the Affordable Care Act, expanding health care to tens of millions more Americans and 150 million families having better benefits, lower costs, and no preexisting condition risking their access and no lifetime limits— being a woman no longer a preexisting condition. So that really was central because it's a health issue, it's an economic issue, a financial health issue for families, and it's a values issue for our country. So that, for me, was the highlight.

Still, it's not clear why Pelosi responded the way she did when asked about her vocational intentions.

The question, after all, was completely fair. Last month, Pelosi won reelection to serve her 18th consecutive full term in the House of Representatives. But at the same time, she is stepping down as leader of the House Democrats, a position she will have held for two decades.

Few members of congressional leadership voluntarily step down from power while maintaining their seats in Congress.

NBA star Jonathan Isaac takes stand on COVID vaccine days after media outlet smears him with blatant lie,"NBA power forward Jonathan Isaac, who plays for the Orlando Magic, delivered an eloquent response Monday to reporters who keep pestering him about the COVID-19 vaccine.

What is the background?

Rolling Stone egregiously maligned Isaac over the weekend by featuring him, among some of the NBA's top superstars, in an article that framed vaccine-hesitant players as ""anti-vaxxers.""

The conclusion, of course, may perhaps be the most uncharitable description of superstar athletes, in the prime of their health, who are making their own decisions about the COVID vaccine. Labeling them as ""anti-vax"" also suggests they are opposed to all vaccines, which is highly unlikely. But for Isaac, the suggestion that he is ""anti-vax"" is a blatant lie.

Isaac called out Rolling Stone in a brief response Sunday.

What did Isaac say?

Isaac — a 23-year-old devout Christian and ordained minister — explained Monday that he does not believe the COVID vaccine is necessary for him because he is young, extremely healthy as a professional athlete, and has COVID antibodies, meaning natural immunity stemming from a previous COVID infection.

""I am not anti-vax. I'm not anti-medicine. I'm not anti-science,"" Isaac said.

Isaac explained:

It is my belief that the vaccine status of every person should be their own choice and completely up to them without bullying, without being pressured, or without being forced into doing so. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm uncomfortable with taking the vaccine at this time.



I think that we're all different. We all come from different places. We've all had different experiences and hold dear to different beliefs. And what it is that you do with your body when it comes to putting medicine in there should be your choice — free of the ridicule and the opinion of others.

When asked by another reporter why he is ""hesitant"" to getting vaccinated, Isaac laid out four reasons:

""[W]ith me having COVID in the past and having antibodies, with my current age group and physical-fitness level, it's not necessarily a fear of mine.""

""Taking the vaccine, like I said, it would decrease my chances of having a severe reaction, but it does open me up to the — albeit rare chance — but the possibility of having an adverse reaction to the vaccine itself.""

""I don't believe that being unvaccinated means infected or being vaccinated means uninfected. You can still catch COVID with or with not having the vaccine.""

""I would say honestly the craziness of it all, in terms of not being able to say that it should be everybody's fair choice without being demeaned or talked crazy to, doesn't make one comfortable to do what said person is telling them to do.""

Later in the news conference, Isaac affirmed that he would follow ""whatever protocol"" the NBA establishes regarding COVID-19 vaccines and COVID-related restrictions.

Isaac is known for taking unpopular, yet principled stands — literally.

In late summer 2020, amid racial unrest across the country, Isaac became the first NBA player to stand for the national anthem when the NBA, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, resumed its 2019-20 season.

NBC anchor declares 'fairness is overrated' during acceptance speech for journalism award,"NBC News anchor Lester Holt received the Edward R. Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award from Washington State University on Tuesday. Now, as noted by the Washington Examiner, his virtual acceptance speech is drawing fire for his admission of what conservatives have always believed the mainstream media believed: ""fairness is overrated.""

Holt was sure to warn listeners not to jump too quickly on what he realized was a headline-making comment the moment it left his lips and tried to assure the public that he was talking about the disseminating of lies and fake news, but it was clear to his observers and critics that he was going after conservatives and any Trump supporters who may have issues with the liberal press.

What did he say?

After receiving the award, which WSU says is given to those who will be remembered ""as the pillars of the communication industry,"" Big Country News reported, Holt launched into his lecture about the treatment of the media and who deserves to have a platform.

""The unprecedented attacks on the press in this period I'm sure will fill plenty of books and be studied in classrooms,"" he said before offering his take on what journalists should learn from this moment in U.S. history.

""Number one is — I think it's become clearer that fairness if overrated,"" he said before warning, ""Woah, before you run off and tweet that headline, let me explain a bit.""

Then, seemingly unknowingly, he uttered a lament that fit right into the stereotype conservative media critics have for the mainstream media. Holt blasted ""the idea that we should always give two sides equal weight and merit,"" saying such a mindset ""does not reflect the world we find ourselves in.""

Despite the fact that the left has long clamored for what they call ""equal time"" and have even called for a revival of the Fairness Doctrine, Holt believes denying equal time to what he and his cohort of liberal newsmen consider ""unsupported arguments"" is actually a virtue of today's media.



He warned that the American news media can't just allow people to have an ""open platform"" that would let them say whatever they want.

""Decisions to not give unsupported arguments equal time are not a dereliction of journalistic responsibility or some kind of agenda,"" Holt said. ""In fact, just the opposite. Providing an open platform for misinformation, for anyone to come say whatever they want, especially when issues of public health and safety are at stake, can be quite dangerous.

""Our duty is to be fair to the truth,"" he continued. ""Holding those in power accountable is as the core of our function and responsibility. We need to hear our leaders' views, their policies and reasoning — it's really important — but we have to stand ready to push back and call out falsehoods.""

The Media Research Center's Tim Graham got a kick out of Holt's claim, noting the anchor's willingness to give an open platform to left-wing politicians like Hillary Clinton.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbc-anchor-fairness-is-overrated,2021-04-02
San Francisco affiliate corroborates NBC News report on Paul Pelosi attack,"The NBC affiliate in San Francisco released a new report regarding the hammer attack on Paul Pelosi in the early hours of Oct. 28. Interestingly enough, the new report from the affiliate's investigative team corroborates several details from an earlier NBC News report that the outlet determined was not up to par with its ""reporting standards.""

On Nov. 4, NBC News national correspondent Miguel Almaguer delivered new details regarding the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband at the couple's home in San Francisco. The report aired on the ""Today"" show and was promoted on the TV program's website.

The NBC News report claimed, ""Officers were unaware that it was the home of the House speaker.""

Officers allegedly knocked on the front door of the home around 2:30 a.m., and Pelosi answered the door.

NBC News reported, ""The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or try to leave his home. But instead, he began walking several feet back into the foyer, toward the assailant and away from police.""

There was reportedly a struggle between Pelosi and the home invader. David DePape, 42, then allegedly hit Pelosi in the head with a hammer. Police arrested DePape.

Pelosi was reportedly lying in a puddle of his own blood after the hammer attack. He was rushed to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured skull. He was released from the hospital on Nov. 3.

NBC News vanished the report about the Paul Pelosi attack just hours after it aired.

NBC News said: ""The piece should not have aired because it did not meet NBC News reporting standards.""

TheBlaze contacted NBC News to find out exactly what in the report did not meet the reporting standards, but the outlet did not respond.

Washington Post media critic Paul Farhi wrote on Nov. 5:

Much of Almaguer’s account was inaccurate, based on flawed information provided by a source who was unnamed in the report, according to people at the network. Those people said Almaguer was incorrect when he reported that the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) gave police no indication he was in danger when he answered the door. In fact, San Francisco police have said that Pelosi was struggling with the intruder, David DePape, when they first saw him.

On Nov. 14, the Daily Beast reported that Almaguer was suspended following an internal investigation.

Almaguer began his television career with California's KSBW in 2000. Almaguer provided reporting to ""NBC Nightly News,"" MSNBC, and ""Today."" Almaguer won an Edward R. Murrow Award in 2004, and an Emmy Award in 2007 for his reporting on the San Diego wildfires.

NBC's San Francisco affiliate — KNTV, also known as NBC Bay Area — released a report that shared the same details as the since-deleted NBC News account. KNTV's investigative team cites an unnamed source who allegedly personally viewed the police body cam video of the attack on Pelosi.

KNTV reported that the source said the body cam video contradicts ""one of the details included in the Department of Justice's account of what happened that evening.""

NBC Bay Area senior investigative reporter Bigad Shaban said, ""This all has to do with the moments, seconds really, just before Paul Pelosi was struck in the head with a hammer inside his San Francisco home. Now, there continues to be contradicting accounts of a relatively simple question. Who opened the door that night when San Francisco police arrived to the Pelosi house?""

The federal indictment said that the ""two officers"" opened the front door. However, the office of San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins previously stated, ""Mr. Pelosi opened the door with his left hand.""

Shaban, citing the source familiar with the investigation, said, ""Officers knocked on the door of the Pelosi home, then backed away. And the video clearly shows Paul Pelosi open the door with his left hand. Just like what was noted in the documents filed by the DA's office.""

Shaban continued, ""The body cam video shows officers having a brief conversation with Pelosi and David DePape ... before DePape starts beating Pelosi with a hammer.""

Shaban requested a comment from the Department of Justice on the discrepancy between the two accounts, but the DOJ did not respond.

Shaban asked Jenkins why Pelosi didn't flee from the crime scene when police arrived.

Jenkins said she wouldn't speculate or start ""Monday-morning quarterbacking"" as to why someone took the actions he did.

""We know that all victims of crime respond very differently under the stress of the situation,"" Jenkins said. ""And I don't think it's fair for us to place what we believe.""

Earlier this month, Jenkins said that some evidence in the Paul Pelosi case, including the body cam footage, would not be released to the public.

""For us, revealing that evidence through the media is just not what we think is appropriate,"" Jenkins told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We want to make sure that this individual is held accountable for these egregious acts. For us, we’re going to make sure that we limit the evidence as much as possible in order to get that done.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbc-news-paul-pelosi-attack-details,2022-11-17
'Republican wave': Panel of journalists sounds alarm for Democrats ahead of 2022 midterm elections,"A panel of journalists sounded the alarm Sunday over the Democratic Party's increasingly bleak outlook heading into the 2022 midterm elections.

Last week, a new CNBC poll found President Joe Biden's job approval stood at just 38%, while only 35% of Americans approved of the state of the economy. The survey also found significant losses of support among those Americans who helped elect Biden: Americans of color, woman aged 18-49, and Americans younger than 35.

What did the journalists say?

On NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" the panel of journalists explained how the poll exposed the issues ""powering the Republican wave this November.""

The most critical issue, host Chuck Todd pointed out, is young Americans and their perception of the economy. The CNBC poll found that 87% of Americans ages 18-34 rate the economy ""fair/poor,"" while just 12% rate it ""good/excellent.""

""Voters under the age of 35, who have never experienced inflation in their lifetime ... they're used to, like, when 'Oh, there's a new gadget, well, in six months it'll be cheaper' — not more expensive! This is a whole different world,"" Todd explained. ""If you want to buy a house for the first time, you're paying a higher interest rate than your parents have ever paid. Never mind food and gas. This is a huge part of the Dem coalition.""

Amna Nawaz, chief correspondent of ""PBS NewsHour,"" agreed with Todd.

""It's not great. It's not great. You're talking about one of the key groups that not only helped Democrats win back control of Congress, you know, propelled Biden into the White House, but are also going to be in play in larger numbers than ever before in the upcoming midterms,"" Nawaz explained, adding that voters who were optimistic when Biden entered office are now pessimistic.

Ruth Marcus, a deputy editor at the Washington Post, pointed to Nevada as ground zero for Democratic pains.

""This is a state that has gone for the Democratic candidate four times in a row. ... It's a state that Biden won. Now his approval rating there is below the overall poll: It's at 35%,"" Marcus said. ""And most scary, and perhaps most ominous, is the peeling off of Hispanic voters in Nevada. Slump of approval rating from 73% a year ago to 52% now.

""You just read that if you're a Democratic candidate or pollster, you read it and gulp, 'What is going on here?'"" she added.



Eugene Daniels of Politico said Democrats are not appealing to voters because they're only talking about what they've accomplished in the past, whereas ""voters are thinking, 'OK, but what are you doing now? What are you doing for me lately?'""

Matthew Continetti, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, summarized the panel's concerns by explaining the economy, education, and crime are the ""trifecta of issues that's powering the Republican wave this November.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbc-panel-sounds-alarm-for-democrats,2022-04-18
NCAA ‘unequivocally supports’ transgender athletes participating in women's sports and will pull championships from states that disagree,"The National Collegiate Athletic Association, the country's largest organization regulating college athletics, announced this week that it ""firmly and unequivocally supports"" the inclusion of transgender athletes in college sports competitions.

What are the details?

The announcement comes as Republican-controlled legislatures in multiple states around the country consider legislation banning transgender individuals who are biologically male from competing in women's sports. Proponents of the legislation argue that to allow such individuals to participate is ""unfair"" to female athletes.

However, in a statement issued Monday, the NCAA insisted its dedication to including transgender athletes in women's sports is for the purpose of producing ""fair competition.""

""The NCAA Board of Governors firmly and unequivocally supports the opportunity for transgender student-athletes to compete in college sports. This commitment is grounded in our values of inclusion and fair competition,"" the statement said.

The organization cited a policy implemented in 2010, which ""requires testosterone suppression treatment for transgender women to compete in women's sports,"" as a means to provide a ""more inclusive path for transgender participation in college sports.""

""Inclusion and fairness can coexist for all student-athletes, including transgender athletes, at all levels of sport,"" the board argued. ""Our clear expectation as the Association's top governing body is that all student-athletes will be treated with dignity and respect.""

What else?

The board also raised eyebrows in the statement by vowing to pull championship events out of states that disagree with its policies regarding transgender athletes' participation, a move that was immediately celebrated by transgender advocates.

""When determining where championships are held, NCAA policy directs that only locations where hosts can commit to providing an environment that is safe, healthy and free of discrimination should be selected,"" the statement said. ""We will continue to closely monitor these situations to determine whether NCAA championships can be conducted in ways that are welcoming and respectful of all participants.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, a left-wing advocacy organization, commended the decision on Monday, firing a warning shot to state lawmakers.

""Today the NCAA confirmed it will pull events from states with bills banning trans students from participating in school sports,"" the group said in a tweet, adding, ""State lawmakers take note: discriminating against trans youth is wrong, against the law, and costly.""

""Dangerous proposals around the country are putting transgender young people at risk,"" National Center for Transgender Equality deputy executive director Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen added. ""The NCAA is making it clear that their Board of Governors supports transgender athletes, and the board should hold those states passing these harmful laws accountable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ncaa-backs-transgender-athletes-womens-sports,2021-04-13
"NCAA shifts transgender policy, letting ruling body of each sport judge eligibility. But former athlete says NCAA has 'failed women by not prioritizing fairness.'","The NCAA has changed its policy regarding transgender athletes and given the governing body of each sport the authority to determine athlete eligibility, ESPN reported.

The network said the previous version of the NCAA policy, adopted in 2010, was uniform across all sports and based on hormone therapy requirements, adding that the policy shift is an attempt to bring the NCAA in line with the approach of the International Olympic Committee.

Now, starting with this year's winter championships, transgender athletes must document their testosterone levels in compliance with their specific sport four weeks before their sport's selection of championship participants, ESPN said. In addition, transgender athletes must provide testosterone-level documentation at three other predetermined points.

The network said that if a sport's national governing body doesn't have a policy, the sport's international federation's policy will be used. And if the sport's international federation lacks a policy, ESPN said the previously established IOC policy will be used.

It's worth it to note that in November, the IOC declared that transgender female athletes shouldn't be required to reduce testosterone to compete.

Pushback

Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead-Makar — a member of the Women's Sports Policy Working Group — has reservations about the new policy, ESPN said.

""The new NCAA policy sounds a lot like the old one,"" she told the network. ""The board hasn't resolved the intractable balancing between fairness, playing safety, and inclusion. They failed women by not prioritizing fairness.""

Chris Mosier — a duathlete and transgender-inclusion advocate — didn't seem enthusiastic about the policy shift, either.

""This update complicates the NCAA policy in a way that I don't believe they are equipped to handle,"" Mosier told the network. ""Given that many NGBs have not created policies for transgender athletes and that policies vary from sport NGB to NGB, tracking compliance is going to be a nightmare for the NCAA. This creates many different standards for trans athletes.""

Trans woman swimmer in the spotlight

Transgender swimmer Lia Thomas of the University of Pennsylvania — a biological male who identifies as female — frequently dominated women's swimming events over the last couple of months. Thomas recorded the top times in the country in the 200-yard and 500-yard women's freestyle, ESPN said. In a recent 1,650-yard freestyle race, Thomas beat the second-place finisher by over half a minute.

Interestingly, Thomas lost earlier this month to another transgender swimmer — a biological female who's transitioning to male but still was racing against women.

Under the NCAA's new policy, Thomas would need to be in compliance with USA Swimming's guidelines in order to participate in the NCAA championships in March, ESPN said.

The network noted that USA Swimming didn't respond to a request for details concerning its existing transgender policy, adding that the University of Pennsylvania also didn't respond to a request for comment.

Neurologist found guilty of sexually abusing 6 patients ‘suffering from debilitating diseases’,"Dr. Ricardo Cruciani was found guilty on 12 criminal counts of sexual abuse last Friday. The 68-year-old was convicted of predatory sexual assault, sex abuse, criminal sexual acts, rape, and attempted rape.



Cruciani, a once-esteemed and successful neurologist, was accused of grooming his patients and taking advantage of their severe injuries by overprescribing pain medication.

District attorney Alvin Bragg stated that Cruciani “left in his wake six survivors who continue to suffer from debilitating diseases, and now, years of trauma.”

The six women testified that the abuse took place during appointments in 2013. Often behind closed doors, Cruciani would expose himself and demand sex, they stated.

One witness testified, “He didn’t finish writing my prescriptions until I did something for him.”

Hillary Tullin, another victim of the disgraced doctor, publicly talked about the abuse she experienced. Adding to the mounting evidence against Cruciani, Tullin reported him to the sex abuse hotline in 2017. She told the hotline that the doctor had abused her from 2005 to 2013.

Following the guilty verdict, Tullin stated, “Mr. Cruciani and his lawyers were indefatigable in their attempts to portray me and the other witnesses as liars but the truth prevailed.” Tullin continued, “What happened to us is real, it’s traumatic, and it can no longer be denied.”

The doctor maintains that he is not guilty of any abuse against his vulnerable patients. Cruciani’s attorney, Fred Sosinsky, announced on Friday that they plan to file an appeal.

Sosinsky stated, “In the end, it appears that the collective weight of six accusers, rather than a fair consideration of each of their problematic accounts, carried the day.”

In a previous case, Cruciani pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges. As a result, he was required to forfeit his medical license and register as a sex offender.

Federal charges will also be filed against Cruciani for the 15 years of abuse that took place at his offices in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/neurologist-found-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-6-patients-suffering-from-debilitating-diseases,2022-08-01
New Jersey brewery sues state over ‘deliberate attack’ on independent businesses,"A New Jersey brewery is suing the state's Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) over license rules it considers ""a deliberate attack on small brewers.”

The Cherry Hill Courier-Post reports that the Death of the Fox Brewing Company filed the lawsuit in September, claiming that the state's Limited Brewery Special Conditions ""severely restrict limited breweries’ ability to advertise events and grow their businesses.""

Under the regulations, New Jersey breweries face a number of unique conditions. According to the Courier-Post, those conditions include severe limitations on the type of food breweries can sell, significant limitations on events, and required tours for patrons.

""ABC’s special ruling is a deliberate attack on small brewers in New Jersey. They are a transparent attempt to play favorites by helping some businesses at the expense of others,"" Death of the Fox founder Chuck Garrity said. ""What’s worse is ABC didn’t even bother to follow the law in proposing these rules by submitting them for public notice and comment. Hundreds of small businesses around the state are already being hobbled by these draconian rules. Death of the Fox Brewing Company is suing to protect all New Jersey brewers’ right to free speech and to build thriving businesses.""

State officials believe the regulations are necessary for maintaining balance among New Jersey’s businesses. When the special ruling was issued in May 2019, New Jersey ABC Director James Graziano said, ""We believe the activities permitted under this Special Ruling strike a fair and appropriate balance between the interests of full retail license holders, such as restaurants and bars, and the craft brewing industry.""

The brewery is being represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), a nonprofit legal organization that represents private citizens against the government. “State agencies cannot just craft rules behind closed doors without transparency or any opportunity for public involvement,” PLF attorney Luke Wake said. “State law requires that when an agency wants to impose rules affecting our lives and our livelihood, we must at least have an opportunity to voice our concerns. And agencies are required to submit regulations to the legislature — which can decide whether to override this sort of agency action.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-jersey-brewery-sues-state-over-deliberate-attack-on-independent-businesses,2022-10-03
"New Mexico leaders bash Biden admin's order targeting oil, drilling on federal land: 'How does that bring us together?'","The Biden administration's 60-day pause on new oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits on federal land, signed by Acting Interior Secretary Scott de la Vega late Wednesday, could result in devastating consequences to state economies that rely on proceeds from oil sales.

The order, which appeased progressive environmentalist groups, has significant immediate effects.

From the Associated Press:

Industry groups said the order effectively brings all regulatory activity to a halt, from routine requests that arise during the normal course of business to requests for rights of way for new pipelines designed to gather more natural gas as part of efforts to reduce venting and flaring — practices that Democrats have targeted in their fight against climate change.

What about the economic impact?

Leaders in New Mexico say the impact of making permanent the temporary moratorium would be ""economically devastating.""

New Mexico is one of the top oil-producers in the nation — third behind Texas and North Dakota, thanks, in part, to the Permian Basin — yet it is also one the most-impoverished states in the U.S., leaving the Land of Enchantment more economically vulnerable to what one local leader called ""knee-jerk"" decisions by President Joe Biden's Cabinet.

""During his inauguration, President Biden spoke about bringing our nation together. Eliminating drilling on public lands will cost thousands of New Mexicans their jobs and destroy what's left of our state's economy,"" Carlsbad Mayor Dale Janway told the Associated Press.

""How does that bring us together?"" Janway added. ""Environmental efforts should be fair and well-researched, not knee-jerk mandates that just hurt an already impoverished state.""

The Biden administration's order has New Mexican leaders concerned, in particular, because about half of their oil production occurs on federal lands, producing hundreds of millions of dollars in royalty revenue each year, the AP noted.

New Mexico Republican Party chairman Steve Pearce voiced another significant concern. He fears that the Biden administration's order could be a job killer.

""I think we're going to see companies choosing not to invest in New Mexico and take their jobs and drilling to Texas just 3 miles away,"" Pearce said, the AP reported. ""They can just scoot across the border where they don't have federal lands.""

New York Times reporter deletes tweets suggesting that Trump supporters 'enemies of the state',"New York Times Justice Department reporter Katie Benner announced that she deleted some tweets on Tuesday.

Without further clarification, Benner wrote on Tuesday evening that she had ""deleted unclearly worded tweets regarding the Jan 6. committee hearing.""

According to a screenshot included in a Fox News article, the series of now-deleted posts began by stating: ""Today's #January6thSelectCommittee underscores the America's current, essential natsec dilemma: Work to combat legitimate national security threats now entails calling a politician's supporters enemies of the state.""

Benner continued: ""As Americans, we believe that state power should not be used to work against a political figure or a political party. But what happens if a politician seems to threaten the state? If the politician continues to do so out of office and his entire party supports that threat?""

""This dilemma was unresolved by the Russia probe and 2 impeachments. With many Republicans denying the reality of the Jan. 6 attack, I doubt the #January6thCommittee will resolve it either. That leaves it up to voters, making even more essential free, fair access to the polls,"" the New York Times reporter wrote.

The House select committee tasked with probing the Jan. 6 Capitol riot held its first hearing on Tuesday.

Glenn Greenwald commented on Benner's remarks: ""Absolutely amazing: the New York Times' Justice Department reporter says the US faces an ""essential natsec dilemma"": namely, that Trump supporters are ""enemies of the state"" and all of the GOP is a threat to the State. This is a reporter -- not an op-ed writer -- saying this,"" he tweeted.

Newly minted transsexual crushes female competition in elite women's cycling event,"Once again, the top competitor in a woman's sport has proved womanhood is optional. On Saturday, a biological male who reportedly only began ""the physical process of gender transition"" in 2019 placed first in a female category at the Union Cycliste Internationale's (UCI) Verge Northampton International Cyclocross.

What are the details?

Cyclocross, according to USA Cycling, is a ""cross between road cycling, mountain biking and steeplechase,"" where participants use modified road bikes. Upper-body strength comes in handy, as cyclists are required in certain sections to dismount their bikes and carry them up stairs or steep inclines as well as jump with them over obstacles.

Austin Killips, 26, is a transsexual road racing cyclist who competes internationally against women for the U.S.

Just days after transsexual Brian Nguyen beat out a group of women in a local Miss America beauty pageant, Killips competed in the UCI Elite Women cyclocross race.

On day one of the UCI Elite Women race, Killips placed first with a time of 50 minutes and 25 seconds.

The first woman to complete the race was Canadian racer Ava Holmgren, who secured second place with a time of 50 minutes and 26 seconds. Lizzy Gunsalus came in third.



Killips proved wanting on day two of the race, coming third after Raylyn Nuss and Lizzy Gunsalus, who came in first and second respectively.

This is not Killips' first time competing against women with the Rhode Island-based ""nice bikes"" team.

On Sept. 3, Killips placed first in the Northampton Cycling Club Hydra Cross Women Category 1/2/3 when competing in Holyoke, Massachusetts. In June, the cyclist placed 8th, getting beaten by 7 real women in the 2022 American National Championships.

According to CrossResults.com, Killips competed in 22 races in 2019, 21 races in 2021, and 15 races in 2022.

TrainerRoad reported that Killips started out as a full-time bicycle mechanic in Chicago. After getting immersed in the city's cyclocross racing culture, Killips bought a cyclocross bike and began competing in 2019.



Once already competing, Killips began ""the physical process of gender transition"" and has been undergoing hormone replacement therapy since.

Killips told CyclingTips: ""I just really enjoyed this sport from the start. I come from a skiing and action sports background. In cross it's about finding lines and working around natural features like you do in skiing as well.""

Killips is keenly aware that some people don't think men should work around natural features and compete against women in female sports. ""It's half the country now involved in this culture war,"" said Killips. ""It's a hot-button issue in right-wing politics.""

In December 2021, CyclingTips reported that demonstrators representing the pro-woman group ""Save Women's Sport"" attended the U.S. cyclocross nationals in DuPage County, Illinois. Included in the messages on the signs held up by the protesters were ""Say no to males competing as females"" and ""woman = adult human female.""

Trans activists said the feminist sentiment created ""an atmosphere or exclusion and threat.""

Inclusion at the expense of women's sports

The UCI published rules governing the participating of transsexuals in its international events that were more restrictive than the International Olympic Committee's 2015 rules. In June, the UCI announced updates to those rules.

According to the UCI, the ""principle of eligibility of transgender athletes (in particular female athletes, ie those who have made a transition from male to female) is based on the reversibility under low blood testosterone (the level commonly observed in 'born female' athletes) of the physiological abilities that determine sports performance, and on the time needed to achieve this reversibility.""

The UCI cited scientific publications that indicated ""female level"" endurance capacity occurs within ""six to eight months under low blood testosterone, while the awaited adaptations in muscle mass and muscle strength/power take much longer (two years minimum according to a recent study).""

Accordingly, the UCI noted that as of July 1 it would require a ""transition period on low testosterone"" of 24 months and a maximum permitted blood testosterone level of 2.5 nmol/L, corresponding with the ""maximum testosterone level found in 99.99% of the female population.""

The purpose of these rules, which evidently did not prohibit Killips from participating, is to maintain ""fairness, equal opportunities and the safety of competitions.""

Cycling Weekly indicated that these rules might ultimately exclude some biological men from competing with women — transsexual riders like ""Emily"" Bridges, who couldn't hack it in competition with other men.

Bridges began identifying as a woman in October 2020. While working toward qualifying to compete in the female category, he got crushed in men's races, placing 43rd out of 45 at the Loughborough Cycling Festival.

Bridges said, ""I just want to race and race competitively again.""

While displacing biological women, Killips hopes that ""more women get the opportunity to make cycling a job. With the Women’s WorldTour more women can do so now – but this has not always been the reality, especially here in the U.S. With more money and resources allocated the right way we will soon see the level rise even more.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/newly-minted-transsexual-crushes-female-competition-in-elite-womens-cycling-event,2022-11-14
"NIH Director Francis Collins faces tough questions from CNN about Wuhan lab research, misleads with answers","CNN's Pamela Brown confronted National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins on Sunday on whether there was an ""oversight failure"" under his leadership that resulted in U.S. taxpayers funding risky coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Last week, the NIH released documents and sent a letter to a Republican lawmaker confirming that EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. nonprofit that studies emerging diseases, used an award from the agency to fund gain-of-function experiments in Wuhan, China. The letter said that EcoHealth funded an experiment ""testing if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model."" The documents released by the NIH revealed the experiment involved cloning MERS-CoV, the virus that caused a deadly outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, and then engineering the clone by giving it a receptor-binding domain from a bat coronavirus to see if it would be able to enter human cells that were put into mice.

This experiment had the ""unexpected result"" of making the MERS-based virus more transmissible among the humanized mice, which would apparently meet the NIH's definition of gain-of-function research. And the NIH said in its letter that EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of its grant by failing to report those results. But Collins and his subordinate, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, have each publicly denied many times that the NIH ever funded gain-of-function research.

Interviewing Collins on Sunday night, Brown asked, given the NIH's admission that EcoHealth Alliance funded research that made a virus more transmissible among human cells, how the agency could claim ""the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute.""

""You're just now finding out U.S. tax dollars were being used to pay for this risky research in that Wuhan lab two years ago,"" Brown said. ""So the question is how can you know what this money is going toward? What kind of research this is going toward in places like the Wuhan lab if you're just now finding this out from EcoHealth Alliance how the U.S.' taxpayer dollars were being used?""

In answer, Collins acknowledged that ""EcoHealth did violate the terms of their grant award"" by failing to report the experiment's ""unexpected result"" in a timely fashion. But then he argued that even if EcoHealth Alliance had reported its results to the NIH, its gain-of-function experiment was not the kind that requires ""special high level oversight,"" and he emphasized this experiment was ""in no way connected"" to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Yeah, they messed up,"" he said. ""We're going to hold them accountable. They sent us a progress report two years late that they should have sent a while ago, and it had information in it that they should have told us about.""

But Brown pressed the issue, noting that the NIH's recognition that EcoHealth violated the terms of its award ""does show ... that there was risky research being conducted in that lab with U.S. taxpayer dollars that the NIH was unaware of and is just now finding out.""



""So it raises the question of what other risky experiments could be going on with taxpayer funding that you don't know about,"" she asked. ""Does that concern you?""

""It does. I think in this instance, the particular grantee, which is EcoHealth Alliance, failed to follow the terms of their grant award that they should have followed, and they're in some trouble as a result of that,"" Collins replied.

""I don't think this is indication that there is a broad range of this kind of difficulty going on,"" he added.

""But isn't this also an oversight failure of the NIH?"" Brown then asked. ""Because the NIH is responsible for taking taxpayer money and giving these grants. So would you say this is also an oversight failure?""

Collins responded by shifting blame to Congress, stating that the NIH is not permitted by law to have direct oversight of a sub-award like that issued by EcoHealth Alliance to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for this gain-of-function experiment.

""That needs to be changed. We are actually interested in asking the Congress to change that,"" he said.

Brown kept pressing: ""Why should Americans trust you and the NIH on the issue of COVID origins when you didn't even know about the programs it was funding with taxpayer dollars in China?""

Collins seemed taken aback by the question. ""Well, that's a little too strong, Pam. We did know exactly what the funding was intended to support in terms of the research on these bat coronaviruses, and the vast, vast majority of what they did was exactly what we had given them permission to do,"" he said.

""In this one instance, they failed to report the results of an experiment that they should have told us about immediately. Frankly, it's not an experiment that we think has a huge impact on any of the work that was done, but they missed the opportunity to be completely responsive as they should have been.

""So please, relax, here. This is not a circumstance where I think you could say there was a major failure that put human lives at risk. It was a mess-up in terms of their being responsive to the requirements they should have followed.""

Asked if the NIH will pull funding from EcoHealth Alliance given the organization's failure to comply with the terms of its award, Collins correctly stated that the specific grant that was sub-awarded to the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been suspended since last year. However, he declined to mention that the NIH and NIAID have awarded millions of dollars in new grants to EcoHealth Alliance for other research projects.

The interview concluded with Collins promising to be completely transparent with what happens regarding other unpublished data EcoHealth Alliance must turn over to the NIH.

""We want to be completely transparent about it. The last thing that needs to happen right now is any sense that we're not revealing everything that we know,"" Collins said.

Although Collins assured CNN viewers he was being ""fair and open"" with what the NIH knows, Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin observed that Collins made many misleading statements in this interview.

For instance, his statement that EcoHealth Alliance's gain-of-function experiment is not the kind that requires ""special high level oversight"" makes no sense because the NIH said the organization should have reported its ""unexpected results.""

""The whole point of the NIH letter to Congress was that if EcoHealth HAD reported its research results, it WOULD HAVE triggered the extra, high level oversight,"" Rogin pointed out on Twitter. ""Why is Collins pretending he knows they would have been exempt from that?""

Rogin also observed that while Collins blamed Congress for restricting the NIH's ability to oversee grant sub-awards, the NIH failed to enforce its reporting requirements on EcoHealth Alliance for two years, which is why the agency is just now learning that EcoHealth was noncompliant with the terms of its grant.

Nike CEO touts company as ‘of China and for China’,"Nike's chief executive officer recently made a strong defense of its business prospects in China, issuing comments that are sure to spark controversy regarding where the sports apparel company's loyalties lie.

""Nike is a brand that is of China and for China,"" insisted Nike CEO John Donahue during an earnings call last week, according to BBC News.

The comments reportedly came as part of a discussion on the company's fourth-quarter earnings. Despite making significant gains across the board, Nike's earnings in China fell short of Wall Street analyst estimates.

The dip appears to be the result of a consumer boycott in the country over a recent statement it made raising concerns about forced labor practices in Xinjiang.

In the statement, the sportswear giant said it was ""concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR)"" and maintained it ""does not source products from the XUAR and [has confirmed with] contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region.""

Last year, Nike — along with several other U.S. companies — came under fire in the West over its alleged use of forced labor linked to the Muslim Uyghur slave trade in Xinjiang, a massive Chinese region where roughly one-fifth of the world's cotton is sourced.

The Chinese Communist Party has characterized Western companies' decisions to avoid using cotton sourced from the region as an effort to hamper the country's economy.

Yet despite the dip in Chinese business, Donahue asserted that the company would double down on its outsized efforts there.

""We've always taken a long-term view. We've been in China for over 40 years,"" Donahue said.

""We are the largest sport brand there, and we are a brand of China and for China,"" he reportedly added. ""And the biggest asset we have in China is the consumer equity. Consumers feel a strong, deep connection to the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands in China. And it's real.""

Critics of the sportswear company are sure to perceive the move as another example of its bending the knee to communist China in shameless pursuit of more profit.

""Nike cannot serve America and China. It has chosen its master, and it is not us,"" conservative sports commentator and BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock wrote over the weekend.

He added: ""China is a communist-run, authoritarian, racist country. America is (or has been) a democratic republic pursuing freedom and fairness. You can't be of China and for China and serve America.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nike-ceo-of-china-for-china,2021-06-28
"Report: NM Dem governor held in-person meetings despite COVID guidelines, spent thousands on alcohol, Wagyu beef","New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) reportedly did not follow her own coronavirus-related gathering edicts and spent thousands of taxpayer dollars on alcohol and luxurious Wagyu beef last year.

What are the details?

While New Mexico residents faced some of the most strict COVID-related restrictions in the nation, Lujan Grisham was reportedly meeting with her staff in-person — despite advising against such gatherings for New Mexicans.

According to the Santa Fe New Mexican, Lujan Grisham was holding in-person meetings with her Cabinet and New Mexico legislators while telling New Mexico residents not to gather with people they do not live with. The meetings were held at the governor's mansion in Santa Fe, despite the widespread use of video conferencing software, like Zoom.

Meanwhile, Lujan Grisham spent nearly $13,500 of taxpayer dollars on groceries, alcohol, and services like dry cleaning during the second half of 2020.

""Receipts show more than $6,500 on groceries, from Wagyu beef and tuna steaks to several purchases of alcohol, including bottles of tequila, vodka, gin, wine and beer,"" the New Mexican reported.



News of Lujan Grisham's spending comes after she reportedly gave several staff members salary raises ranging between $7,500 to $12,000.

What was the reaction?

New Mexico House Minority Leader Jim Townsend (R) called Lujan Grisham's spending ""disenchanting.""

""It's not what tax dollars ought to be spent for,"" he said. ""In the time when people are hurting all over the state, using their tax dollars to buy Wagyu beef has got to be a little bit disenchanting to many people. I think it's just more of indication of the problem that we have had and the governor has had connecting with people.""

""Those are the kinds of things that cause people to totally distrust the government,"" Townsend added. ""When they see these [messages] of, 'You need to stay home and you can't have your family for Christmas and you can't do this and you can't do that,' but I'm going to sit here and eat Wagyu beef and buy hundreds of dollars of alcohol with your tax dollars. What in the world would you expect them to think?""

House Minority Whip Rod Montoya (R) had harsher words for Lujan Grisham. He said the Democratic governor's actions indicate she believes that she is ""more privileged than everybody else.""

""It really appears in the Governor's Office as if she really believes herself to be more privileged than everybody else in New Mexico,"" Montoya said, the New Mexican reported. ""I didn't realize the governor was so underpaid that she has to use discretionary money for things that she should be paying for herself.""

What did Lujan Grisham say?

The governor's office excused her behavior and claimed there was a difference between Lujan Grisham telling New Mexicans not to gather with people they do not live with and Lujan Grisham gathering with people she does not live with.

""There's a difference between inviting someone into your house for the Super Bowl or someone's birthday and having three or four Cabinet secretaries there to talk about their budgets amid an unprecedented economic downturn and to work out what we're going to propose or recommend to the Legislature given the changing economic forecast,"" spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said.

Stelnicki told the New Mexican the food and alcohol purchases were for Lujan Grisham, her staff, security, and maintenance workers.

""The governor wanted to sort of try to make things and send them to people, like pozole at Christmas,"" he said.

On Friday, Lujan Grisham responded to scrutiny surrounding her spending, admitting that she had ""dropped the ball.""

""When people are struggling, should it be fair that residents [of the governor's mansion] literally have a locked-up grocery store closet … that has libations and catering stuff and food?"" she said. ""I don't want New Mexicans to feel like I don't take seriously their hardship.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nm-democratic-governor-violated-covid-guidelines,2021-02-22
National math council calls on schools to focus on social justice in their mathematics lessons to combat 'privilege' and 'oppression',"The National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics called on public schools to change curriculum in order to advance ""social justice"" causes like combating ""privilege"" and ""oppression"" in mathematics.

The organization trains math teachers across the U.S. and Canada and aims to ""improve the world"" through better teaching of mathematic concepts.

Their latest statement says math teachers need to also include ""social justice"" in their lesson plans.

""A social justice stance requires a systemic approach that includes fair and equitable teaching practices, high expectations for all students, access to rich, rigorous, and relevant mathematics, and strong family/community relationships to promote positive mathematics learning and achievement,"" read the NCSM statement. ""Equally important, a social justice stance interrogates and challenges the roles power, privilege, and oppression play in the current unjust system of mathematics education—and in society as a whole.

The NCSM called for teachers to acknowledge that current mathematics curriculum is ""unjust"" because it is ""grounded in a legacy of institutional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, class, and gender.""

The statement went on to say that school boards need to conduct annual audits on whether they have satisfactorily implemented the social justice action items recommended by the NCSM.

""We must hold the profession and our organizations accountable to making a just and equitable mathematics education a sustainable reality,"" the NCSM said.

The campaign from the NCSM is at odds with claims from those criticizing bans on Critical Race Theory in schools. They say that CRT isn't taught in schools and instead insist that Republican politicians simply want to erase all inconvenient lessons about racism in U.S. history.

Critics of CRT argue that it sends children the wrong message about dwelling on racism in the past instead of moving forward.

'No person can say this was a fair trial': Candace Owens weighs in on Chauvin guilty verdict,"Candace Owens decried the guilty verdict against former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin as ""mob justice,"" telling Fox News' Tucker Carlson that ""no person can say this was a fair trial.""

What are the details?

Chauvin was convicted Tuesday afternoon on all three counts including second- and third-degree murder charges in the death of George Floyd, who died in late ay after the ex-cop was seen on video kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes during detainment.

Tuesday evening, Owens joined Carlson to provide her take on the outcome of the trial, telling the host, ""What we're really seeing is mob justice, and that's really what happened with this entire trial.""

""This was not a trial about George Floyd or Derek Chauvin,"" she argued. ""This was a trial about whether the media was powerful enough to create a simulation and decide upon a narrative absent any facts.""

Speaking of Floyd, Owens told Carlson:

""You know, the media came out — let's not forget this, Tucker — the media came out and told us that this was a man who was just getting his life together, he was a good member of society, and he got mixed up because a racist, white police officer had it out for him and killed him. All of that fell apart...we now know, of course, that he had enough fentanyl in him, it was three times the lethal dosage — three times the lethal dosage — in him when he died. But nobody cares because the media was successful in putting out a narrative and they kept hitting that narrative.""

Owens went on to say that ""the reason Democrats are happy is because they realize, of course, the media supports them and [that] now means that Democrats can get whatever they want because they can create a narrative and then they can treat people like pawns and basically get them to say, 'if we don't get what we want, we will riot, we will loot, we will send these people out like soldiers to destroy neighborhoods.' And that is exactly what has happened.""

She added, ""This was not a fair trial. No person can say this was a fair trial.""

Anything else?

Following the verdict, President Joe Biden addressed the nation to celebrate the jury's decision, vowing to address what he called America's ""systemic racism.""

Both he and Vice President Kamala Harris promised to implement federal police reforms in tribute to George Floyd's legacy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/no-person-can-say-this-was-a-fair-trial-candace-owens-weighs-in-on-chauvin-guilty-verdict,2021-04-21
Conservatives blasted Kristi Noem for vetoing a transgender sports bill. Her office accused them of 'uninformed cancel culture',"In an email blast to reporters Wednesday, South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem's office said conservative critics of her decision to issue a ""style and form"" veto of a controversial transgender sports bill were participating in ""uninformed cancel culture.""

""Governor Noem is very used to fighting off criticism from the left. After all, in the past year, she was the only governor in the entire nation to never order a single business or church in her state to close. The left bullied her incessantly, but she didn't cave,"" Noem communications director Ian Fury wrote to reporters.

""But if any number of conservative pundits are to be believed, that same governor who refused to cave is now caving to the NCAA and Amazon on the issue of fairness in women's sports. What?"" he continued.

""Apparently, uninformed cancel culture is fine when the right is eating their own.""

Fury pushed back against accusations that the governor caved to the NCAA and woke big business interests by vetoing H.B. 1217, a bill that would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex. The bill, which has been championed by social conservative groups, was designed to prevent gender dysphoric males who identify as females from competing in sports against women.

""If conservative media would take 5 seconds to read past the knee-jerk headlines and actually understand Governor Noem's position, they'd come to a very different realization,"" Fury said.

Late last Friday afternoon, after previously saying she was ""excited"" to sign the bill, Noem blindsided conservatives by changing her position in an announcement that said she would send it back to the legislature with proposed changes.

Stating that H.B. 1217 was ""unrealistic in the context of collegiate athletics"" and raising concerns that it would make South Dakota vulnerable to litigation, the governor invoked a power from the veto clause of the South Dakota Constitution that permits her to send bills ""with errors in style or form"" back to the legislature with specific recommendations for change.

Conservative critics say Noem's proposed changes would gut the bill: Preventing it from applying to South Dakota colleges and universities — a concession to the NCAA's official position supporting transgender inclusivity; removing requirements for athletes to verify their age and biological sex and attest to not taking anabolic steroids; eliminating protections for K-12 girls who sound the alarm on boys being placed on their teams and removing their ability to sue school districts that ignore the law; and creating a loophole for transgender athletes by defining a student's sex as what is ""reflected on the birth certificate or affidavit provided [to the school] upon initial enrollment"" — a provision that fails to account for the push by transgender activists to have a person's official birth certificate be legally changed to reflect their self-proclaimed gender identity.

Backlash against this ""style and form"" veto was swift and fierce. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal group that fights for socially conservative causes, accused Noem of ""betrayal"" and caving to ""'woke' corporate ideology."" Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank that supported the bill, said Noem broke her word and accused her of ""standing with Joe Biden and the radical left against protecting women's sports.""

On Monday, Noem was interviewed by Fox News host Tucker Carlson about her decision, and Carlson confronted her directly, asking if she was ""caving to the NCAA"" and other business groups that had opposed the bill — a charge that the governor vigorously denied.



The email from Noem's office attempted to clarify her position. ""Governor Noem has long stood for fairness in women's sports. The reason why should be obvious: guys and girls are fundamentally different. Only girls should play girls' sports,"" Fury wrote.



He pointed to Noem's record on gender controversies in sports, citing her opposition to an attempt by the Trump administration's Department of Agriculture to eliminate ""boys"" and ""girls"" events in the 4-H youth rodeo.

H.B. 1217 is ""a trial lawyer's dream, offering all sorts of avenues for litigation that have nothing whatsoever to do with the issue at hand,"" Fury said. ""Furthermore, the bill picked a fight with the NCAA — a fight that renowned conservative legal experts advise Governor Noem that she will lose, especially considering South Dakota's unfriendly federal bench.""

The email did not name the ""renowned conservative legal experts"" Noem consulted. In response to an inquiry from TheBlaze, Fury said he would not share the names of the legal experts without their permission to do so. He did note that Noem's general counsel, Mark Miller, is a former board member of Americans United for Life who has ""brought to this conversation important lessons learned from the pro-life movement, namely that the Casey decision set the movement back for decades.""

Planned Parenthood vs. Casey was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1992 that upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion that was established in Roe vs. Wade (1973). Fury compared the movement to protect women's sports to the pro-life movement, telling TheBlaze, ""Given Justice Gorsuch's unfortunate Bostock decision just last year, we need to take the same careful approach with this issue.""

In Bostock v. Clayton County, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the majority opinion that said Title VII provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protect gay and transgender people from employment discrimination. The argument advanced by Noem's office is that anti-transgender discrimination litigation from the NCAA could lead to a Supreme Court decision similar to Bostock that applies Title IX sex discrimination protections to gender dysphoric men who identify as women, a court precedent that would strike down laws protecting women's sports nationwide.

""Governor Noem faced tremendous pressure from corporate bigwigs and the radical left alike to veto the bill. But she didn't do that,"" Fury claimed. ""Instead, she returned it to the legislature with suggested changes because she wants these fundamental protections to pass and to survive a legal challenge.""

""That's very disingenuous,"" Jon Schweppe, director of policy and government affairs at the American Principles Project, said, responding to Fury's email. In an interview with TheBlaze, Schweppe said the characterization of Noem's critics as ""uninformed"" was ""a little insulting.""

""The idea that we're being uninformed or that we are uninformed somehow, that's incredibly rich,"" Schweppe said, noting that APP legal scholars have analyzed the bill and worked ""to make sure that it stood up well to legal challenges.""

In a statement provided to TheBlaze, Alliance Defending Freedom general counsel Kristen Waggoner blasted the accusation that Noem's critics are trying to cancel her.

""ADF defends victims of cancel culture everyday. Exposing invented reasons and criticizing an elected official for caving to woke corporations is not cancel culture. It's accountability,"" Waggoner said. ""Cynically blaming cancel culture is what politicians do when there are no arguments left to justify a bad decision like forcing girls to compete against males. Gov. Noem gutted the bill for women AND girls. Stand up to the bully and join the other states who have passed the bill.""

The claim from Noem's office that her ""style and form"" revision is not a veto of H.B. 1217 doesn't persuade her critics.

""I just have to say, that's really not true,"" Schweppe told TheBlaze.

The South Dakota Constitution states: ""Bills returned shall be treated in the same manner as vetoed bills except that specific recommendations for change as to style or form may be approved by a majority vote of all the members of each house. If the Governor certifies that the bill conforms with the Governor's specific recommendations, the bill shall become law. If the Governor fails to certify the bill, it shall be returned to the Legislature as a vetoed bill.""

""The legislature would have to accept all of her changes wholesale, they they can't just pick and choose,"" Schweppe explained.

Several GOP state lawmakers who had supported the bill's passage were infuriated by Noem's action. They have been outspoken about how the ""style and form"" power is designed to fix things like grammatical errors and have accused Noem of abusing her power by fundamentally altering the language of the bill.

""I think just common sense is going to tell all of us that it's not style and form,"" state Rep. Rhonda Milstead, the bill's House sponsor, told KELO-TV. ""Style and form, if we go back to our English classes on what style and form is, has nothing to do with substance, which is what she did. She rewrote the bill, and that's not her job.""

""In my response to her style and form is that she gutted the bill,"" state Senate sponsor Sen. Maggie Sutton said. ""She took out a lot of the legality which leaves it almost meaningless. And to take out the collegiate part of the bill is a big concern of mine.""

Republican House Speaker Spencer Gosch, who supports the bill, added he has ""very grave concerns on constitutionality here, and my oath of office requires me to uphold what the Constitution says.""

Schweppe says the lawmakers' opposition to what Noem has done indicates they won't accept her changes, making her refusal to sign H.B. 1217 as written a de facto veto.

Noem's office indicated to TheBlaze that the governor will not certify the original bill if the legislature rejects her proposed revisions.

""If the legislature declines to accept her Style and Form, Governor Noem is proposing that they suspend the rules and pass her recommended changes as a new bill, or she can call them back into special session to accomplish the same goal with a simple majority,"" Fury said.

The South Dakota governor is not without conservative defenders. After Noem was interviewed on his program and defended herself, BlazeTV host Glenn Beck told her ""I think you're doing the exact right thing."" Conservative lawyer Brian Darling observed that signing H.B. 1217 into law might mean ""sacrificing South Dakota's ability to host events and participate fully in NCAA competition"" and praised Noem for ""acting like a responsible governor and not a 2024 presidential candidate.""

To win over skeptical conservatives, Noem held a news conference on Monday announcing a new coalition called ""Defend Title IX Now,"" a campaign supported by prominent athletes and other governors to push back against the NCAA's opposition to laws keeping female-identifying transgender athletes off women's sports teams.

""The purpose of this coalition is to gather states together to fend off the NCAA's pressure. We need enough states that the NCAA can't possibly bully us all — and then we can win,"" Fury said. ""Not just fight for the sake of fighting. We don't want any participation trophies. We're in it to win it. And we win by taking a smart approach.""

But the conservatives who support protections for women's sports say Noem could join a team that's already been formed, one consisting of several states that have already passed bills similar to H.B. 1217.

""We have two states that have passed bills, Idaho In Mississippi,"" Schweppe told TheBlaze. ""We have two more that are preparing to, they passed the legislature and are on the governor's desks in Tennessee and Arkansas. So South Dakota would have the opportunity to join a coalition by passing their bill. And then you'd have five states with bills protecting women's sports.

""That sounds like a coalition to me,"" he said.

Editor's Note: This article was updated on 3/24 at 6:32 p.m. to edit a quote from American Principles Project director of policy and government affairs Jon Schweppe. Mr. Schweppe contacted TheBlaze to clarify that he misspoke when he said APP legal scholars helped ""write"" H.B. 1217.

Gov. Kristi Noem vetos transgender sports bill and instead issues two executive orders to protect athletes,"South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristie Noem issued two executive orders meant to take the place of a transgender sports bill that the state's House of Representatives passed while rejecting her ""style and form"" revisions.

Noem made the announcement on Monday after being criticized by many on the right for trying to revise the Women's Fairness in Sports bill in order to avoid costly litigation in the future from transgender activists. Her critics said the revisions would effectively gut the protections intended for biologically female athletes.

""Only girls should play girls' sports. Given the legislature's failure to accept my proposed revisions to HB 1217, I am immediately signing two executive orders to address this issue: one to protect fairness in K-12 athletics, and another to do so in college athletics,"" said Noem.

""Additionally, I will be working with legislative leaders to schedule a special legislative session in late May or early June,"" she added. ""The special session will address this important issue, as well as others.""

Noem's revisions drew the ire of many conservatives who accused her of caving to the left. Her office responded by excoriating the ""uniformed cancel culture"" of her detractors in a scathing statement by Noem spokesperson Ian Fury.

""If conservative media would take 5 seconds to read past the knee-jerk headlines and actually understand Governor Noem's position, they'd come to a very different realization,"" he said.

During debate prior to the vote on Noem's revisions, South Dakota lawmakers accused her of abusing her executive power.

Noem previously defended her policies in an interview with talk radio host and TheBlaze founder Glenn Beck.

""I'm a small state. South Dakota is small,"" she said. ""We have to fight hard to even get any tournaments or games in the state of South Dakota. And I recognize the NCAA can come in and crush me, and can make an example out of me, and point to South Dakota and say, 'See, no other state better challenge us whatsoever.' So that's why I'm trying to be smart about this and build a coalition of athletes, of states, of governors, of attorneys generals, and show the NCAA that we're going to fight to make sure that only girls can play in girls' sports.""

North Carolina county bans Coca-Cola machines from government buildings — because company is too ‘left-wing’,"County commissioners in Surry County, North Carolina, voted recently to ban all Coca-Cola vending machines from government office buildings because they believe the company has gone too far left.

What are the details?

According to a May 28 report from WXII-TV, the move came in a 3-2 vote and was presented in response to Coca-Cola's blatant criticism of Georgia's voting reform legislation.

Following the state's announcement of its new voting laws, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in a statement, ""Our focus is now on supporting federal legislation that protects voting access and addresses voter suppression across the country. We all have a duty to protect everyone's right to vote, and we will continue to stand up for what is right in Georgia and across the U.S.""

County Commissioner Eddie Harris — the county's longest-serving commissioner — said in an official statement, ""The left wing in America, they defund, they boycott, they cancel, they tear down statues — all sorts of egregious actions. The expectation from them is the opposing political side will cower in the corner and we're supposed to accept that and it's supposed to be OK. And it's not OK.""

He added that it's high time to step up to ""left-wing"" politics.

Harris also revealed that he wrote a letter to Quincey, condemning the company for its biased stance.

""Millions of Americans believe that the last presidential election was not held in a fair manner and that more voter fraud will occur in the future if elections are not closely monitored and regulated,"" he wrote in the letter.

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola Consolidated told the station that the company has reached out to county commissioners in hopes of setting up a meeting to discuss the vote.

What else?

In April, Georgia Republicans said they also wanted Coca-Cola products removed from their offices.

Eight state House lawmakers that month wrote a joint letter addressed to Kevin Perry, president and CEO of the Georgia Beverage Association, and accused Coca-Cola of spreading disinformation about Georgia's new elections law and kowtowing to ""cancel culture.""

A portion of the letter read, ""Your company has made the conscious decision to perpetrate a national dialogue which seeks to intentionally mislead the citizens of Georgia and deepen a divide in our great State. We have the responsibility to all of Georgia not to engage in those misguided intentions nor continue to support corporations who choose to.""

The letter added, ""Given Coke's choice to cave to the pressure of an out of control cancel culture, we respectfully request all Coca-Cola Company products be removed from our office suite immediately. Should Coke chose to read the bill, share its true intentions and accept their role in the dissemination of mistruths, we would welcome a conversation to rebuild a working relationship.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-carolina-county-bans-coca-cola,2021-06-03
"North Dakota farmer arrested in Ukraine, accused of trying to assassinate a gov't official; his family says he is being railroaded to cover up other crimes","Two sisters in North Dakota spent Thanksgiving without their beloved brother this year — but not because of work obligations, health problems, or any other reasons that one might expect.

Rather, Kurt Groszhans, a self-described ""humble American investor"" and farmer from Ashley, North Dakota, is currently detained in Ukraine under suspicion that he attempted to assassinate the country's minister of agriculture.

But his family insists he is the victim of embezzlement and is now being railroaded to cover up the foreign government official's crimes. Now they are pleading for help from the American government to ensure that their brother is treated respectfully and granted a fair trial.

What are the details?

According to local news outlet, Inforum, Groszhans and a Ukrainian woman named Olena Bohach were arrested and placed in pretrial detention this week for allegedly seeking to arrange the assassination of Roman Leshchenko, the country's minister of agrarian policy and food.

Groszhans, whose family emigrated from Ukraine in 1910, started taking trips to the country in the early 2000s and eventually set up a farming company there. That's when he met and decided to go into business with Leshchenko, who at the time, according to Groszhans was just ""a middle-class entrepreneur in the agricultural sector.""

""He's just a good person, and he just has a passion for farming, and he just loved going back to the country where our ancestors came from,"" his sister Kimberly Groszhans told Inforum in an interview on Monday. ""He didn't do this.""

Groszhans himself claimed in a Medium post published in August that he is a ""deceived American investor."" He described how Leshchenko, who he appointed as the manager of his business, began embezzling funds from his company on his fourth day on the job. The Ukrainian, according to Groszhans, transferred the money into his family's account and also used Groszhans seeds on his family's land.

Groszhans eventually found out and started filing claims against Leshchenko. But while Groszhans was filing lawsuits, Leshchenko was rising to more powerful offices within the Ukrainian government, and eventually, to the office of agriculture minister.





Ukrainian Weekly reported that in the same week that Leshchenko was promoted to minister a lawsuit was filed in the Kyiv Commercial Court by Groszhans alleging Leshchenko had embezzled $430,000 from his company. Leshchenko is quoted in the report as saying he had repaid ""all debts to the American investor.""



In the Medium post, Groszhans says he was asked repeatedly when filing the claims, ""[Do you] understand who you are suing?""

What else?

Groszhans' sisters, Kimberly Groszhans and Kristi Magnusson, told TheBlaze in a phone conversation Friday that they had personally seen WhatsApp messages between their brother and Leshchenko on their brother's phone that indicated he was being threatened by the minister not to continue his legal pursuits.

They also said they have not been able to contact their brother or verify his health and safety since the arrest, neither have Ukrainian officials reported any further detail about where he is being held.

""We are worried about his safety,"" Kristi Magnusson said. It's suspected that his detainment conditions are less than ideal and they worry that a corrupt trial could hinder their brother's pursuit of justice.

The family first found out about his arrest through a friend of Groszhans' who lives in Ukraine. When that friend reached out informing them of Groszhans arrest, they didn't believe them. But when Groszhans didn't respond to message after message, it finally sunk in that their brother may actually be in trouble.

They responded by contacting congressional representatives in North Dakota and the U.S. Department of State. The sisters told TheBlaze that both North Dakota Sens. Kevin Cramer (R) and John Hoeven (R) have assured them that they have asked State Department officials to look into the situation and that they will keep the family abreast of any developments.

Sens. Cramer and Hoeven did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.

The State Department told TheBlaze in a statement, ""We are aware of reports of the detention of a U.S. citizen in Ukraine. We take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad, and are monitoring the situation. Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.""

What are the allegations?

According to Ukrinform, which is described as a Ukrainian multimedia outlet, the Department of Strategic Investigations of the National Police received reports of the attempted assassination plot in August and began investigating a Ukrainian woman and a U.S. citizen.

Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky announced the news in a Nov. 18 briefing, during which he called the U.S. citizen, later identified as Groszhans, the ""the main perpetrator of this crime.""

Monastyrsky alleged that Groszhans and Bohach met at a restaurant in July to discuss their criminal plans. There, he said, ""a $20,000 deposit was provided before the crime was committed, and the U.S. citizen was to leave Ukraine after that, and the crime was to be committed after he arrived in the United States.""

""Therefore, a decision was made to detain this person in accordance with Article 208 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine. The U.S. Embassy was informed [about the case], and only after that the victim, Roman Leshchenko, was informed that such a crime was being prepared against him,"" Monastyrsky added, according to the outlet.

Anything else?

Groszhans' sisters say the allegations laid out sound nothing their brother would ever do, but they feel powerless to defend him and don't know where to turn for help.

They have set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds to help with ""unexpected expenses due to the horrific situation our brother is going through"" and promise that ""all money will go towards these expenses to ensure his safety and return.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-dakota-farmer-arrested-in-ukraine,2021-11-26
North Dakota's Republican governor vetoes transgender sports bill,"The Republican governor of North Dakota on Wednesday vetoed a bill that would bar boy transgender athletes from playing on K-12 girls' sports teams, saying a state association that regulates high school activities is the best body to deal with transgender issues.

The bill, House Bill 1298, would have prohibited public elementary and secondary schools from ""knowingly"" allowing a student of the opposite sex to participate in a school-sponsored athletic team that is exclusively for females or exclusively for males. ""Sex"" is defined as ""an individual's biological sex and is based solely on an individual's reproductive biology and genetics at birth."" The bill has an exemption that would allow girls to play on boys' sports teams.

The bill also included an optional 2021-22 study to analyze the impact of these policies on student athletic events and directed findings from that study to be reported to the 2023 legislature.

The North Dakota bill is similar to bills introduced in 31 other states to prohibit transgender athletes from playing on sports teams that match their self-proclaimed gender. Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee have signed those bills into law. Supporters of these bills say they protect fairness in women's sports by preventing males from competition against girls. Critics and transgender advocates say the legislation discriminates against trans youth.

In his veto message, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) said there is no evidence to suggest girls' sports are in ""immediate danger"" of becoming unfair and asserted the bill ""would unnecessarily inject the state into a local issue by creating a ban with myriad unforeseen consequences.""

""To date there has not been a single recorded incident of a transgender girl attempting to play on a North Dakota girls' team,"" the governor wrote. He noted that the North Dakota High School Activities Association ""already has regulations in place for participation in sex-separated interscholastic contests by transgender athletes.""

""These regulations require transgender girls to undergo testosterone suppression treatment for gender transition for a full calendar year before they are eligible to compete in girls' sports,"" the governor said.

""The most responsive sports governance is the organization closest to the teams and athletes they govern. If a question should arise related to a transgender student and athletic competition, the NDHSAA, parents, child, their health care provider, their school and their coaches are in the best position to manage that unique situation, especially given the child's right to privacy.""

The bill now heads back to the state House. According to KXMB-TV reporter Maddie Biertempfel, Republicans have enough votes to overturn the governor's veto in the House but not in the state Senate.

Opponents of the bill including the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition and Tri-State Transgender issued a statement Wednesday applauding Burgum's veto.



""Governor Burgum's veto sends a loud message to other lawmakers across the country considering similar legislation: Stop the attacks on transgender youth. North Dakotans should be outraged that transgender youth, who already face higher levels of discrimination, were chosen to be the target of this hateful legislation,"" Tri-State Transgender president Katrina Koesterman said.

""We thank Governor Burgum for shutting down this harmful bill and for standing up to out-of-touch politicians on the fringe who have long histories of attacking North Dakota's LGBTQ+ community,"" Brandi Hardy, legislative coordinator of North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, added.



The North Dakota High School Activities Association told the Bismark Tribune it opposed the bill. The body's regulations on transgender athletes state that any transgender student who is not taking cross-sex hormones may play on sports teams according to that student's sex at birth.

However, a student transitioning from male to female may play on girls' sports teams if he has been taking testosterone suppressive hormones for at least one calendar year. A transgender athlete transitioning from female to male who is taking testosterone supplements may play on boys' sports teams but not on girls' teams under the current regulations.

Gov. Burgum also vetoed legislation that would prohibit state mask mandates, saying that ""to strip future governors and their state health officers of any low-cost tool that might be used to save lives and livelihoods in a future pandemic or other emergency would be both irresponsible and an unnecessary risk to future public health and well-being of North Dakota citizens.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-dakota-republican-governor-vetoes-transgender-sports-bill,2021-04-22
NPR ripped for now-deleted tweet noting 'disappointment' after Boston elected its first person of color as mayor. Why? Michelle Wu isn't black.,"Well, that was awkward.

Far-left leaning National Public Radio got an earful Tuesday after tweeting about Michelle Wu becoming the first woman and first person of color to take office as Boston's mayor.

What are the details?

And why would that be controversial? Because the second part of NPR's tweet noted the ""disappointment"" felt over the fact that black candidates weren't anywhere near Wu in the hunt for victory.

The now-deleted tweet read, ""Michelle Wu, an Asian American, is the first woman of color elected to lead the city. While many are hailing it as a turning point, others see it as a more of a disappointment that the three Black candidates couldn't even come close.""

And notable observers didn't take kindly to the tweet:

According to Independent Journal Review, the headline of NPR's related story initially read, ""Cheers and some letdown as 1st elected woman and person of color becomes Boston Mayor.""

But that all changed hours later, IJR said.

It seems NPR got the message that they were out of line loud and clear, and the outlet said it deleted the initial ""disappointment"" tweet and did a do-over: ""We realize we don't always get things right the first time, and our previous tweet/headline misrepresented the story. We deleted the previous tweet, which was causing harm, and have updated the story.""

The story's new headline reads, ""Why Boston will need to wait longer for its 1st elected Black mayor.""

However, the opening paragraph of the story still reads much the same as the problematic initial tweet: ""For the first time in its history, Boston is inaugurating a newly-elected mayor on Tuesday who is not a white man. Michelle Wu — who's Asian American — is the first woman and first person of color elected to lead the city. While many are hailing it as a major turning point, others see it as more of a disappointment that the three Black candidates in the race couldn't even come close.""

"NY store calls police to handle homeless man stealing socks. Cops arrive, confront suspect — and then pay for what he took.","The Dollar Tree in Mount Vernon, New York, called police over the weekend to handle a shoplifter, and police bodycam video showed the cops responding in a way that is earning them plaudits from their department and on social media.

What happened?

Two members of the Mount Vernon Police Department, identified only as Officers Cartwright and Velez in an MVPD Facebook post, responded to a call from the Dollar Tree saying a man was stealing socks from the store but had not left the premises.

Upon arriving, Cartwright and Velez confronted the suspect and discovered he was homeless. He admitted on video that he was in need of the socks he was pilfering, the MVPD said.

After patting down the man to make sure he had taken nothing else, Cartwright and Velez spoke with the store manager about the situation, and they all agreed that the best option for the situation would be just to buy the socks the man was attempting to steal.

And that is what Officer Cartwright did.

“You're a little light on some socks?"" Cartwright asked, after asking where the man was staying.

The man answered that he was just ""walking around.""

“All right, I'll tell you what,"" Cartwright continued. “I'll buy you a couple pairs of socks though, but you gotta stop stealing. Fair enough?""

""How much are they?"" the officer asked the check-out attendant. After learning they were only $1 per pair, he told the store to ring him up for $15 worth.

“Listen, I know how important it is to have a nice pair of socks, especially when you're out running around and, you know, you got nothing else going on, so we'll get you taken care of,"" Cartwright said. ""If you weren't honest, I wouldn't have bought them for you.""

According to the MVPD, the Dollar Tree manager authorized the cops not to arrest the suspect and also told the man that ""if he was in need, he could just tell her.""

Officer Velez also told the man that if he were in need of services, he could stop by the police department for help.

What did the police department say?

The MVPD praised their officers and their community in the Facebook post:



Mount Vernon is a fiercely hard working community that never gets the positive attention it needs. The community is proud and resilient and always keeps its head up and marches on towards a better tomorrow. These positive incidents happen every day in our city, not only with the police, but also with our other municipal employees and with our business partners.



The Officers of the Mount Vernon Police Department will continue to serve our community to the best of our abilities. Thank you to Officers Cartwright, Velez and to all the other Officers that have served proudly over the last year. Your hard work and dedication did not go unnoticed.

What was the community response?

Response to the MVPD's Facebook video was overwhelmingly positive:

""Thank you officers you guys make us proud to be citizens of this great city[.] Mount Vernon Strong and together we can continue to stay safe.""

""I love this so much! It really touched me. A friend just told me she saw it on ABC News and I went searching for the story online so I could show my 9 year old son. He was becoming disillusioned about the role of police officers lately. We just watched the clip together. I was so incredibly proud to show him what our Mount Vernon Police Officers are doing. Thank you Officers Cartright and Velez!! My son has a bit of renewed faith in police officers because of what you did. A little bit of kindness really goes a long way. Have a great day everyone!!""

""This is the kind of police interaction we need.""

""As my mom would say, 'it feels so good to catch you doing something good!' As an unintended by product of not taking just another arrest stat, the officer gave MVPD more good publicity than an army of publicists.""

""[T]his is what policing is about. Thank you.""

""Mt Vernon Police Dept is the Best . Thank you for showing humanity to this individual- your work is appropriate- I love this town.""

""MVPD = Most Valuable Police Department around! Good job MVPD. Kindness always wins.""

"NY Times writers hold 24-hour strike over wages, remote work rules – 1,100 union employees cite outlet's 'failure to bargain in good faith'","More than 1,100 union writers and other staff at the New York Times staged a 24-hour walkout on Thursday after the company failed to lock down a contract with the union by last week's deadline, Reuters reported.



NewsGuild of New York, a labor union for news professionals, pointed to the company's ""failure to bargain in good faith.""

After 20 months of deadlocked contract negotiating, the union set a new deadline for midnight on December 8 but failed to ""reach a fair deal"" with the Times regarding salaries, health insurance benefits, and return-to-work requirements.

""Their wage proposal still fails to meet the economic moment, lagging far behind both inflation and the average rate of wage gains in the U.S.,"" the union stated.

According to the NewsGuild, which represents more than 1,450 employees in the Times' newsroom, the newspaper's management team walked out of Wednesday's marathon bargaining session with five hours left before the deadline.

""Over 1,100 New York Times workers are now officially on work stoppage, the first of this scale at the company in 4 decades,"" NewsGuild posted on Twitter. ""It's never an easy decision to refuse to do work you love, but our members are willing to do what it takes to win a better newsroom for all. #GuildStrong!""

Union employees and supporters planned to picket and rally outside the New York Times building on Thursday afternoon. Staff encouraged others not to read the paper's articles or engage in any Times platforms, including the word game Wordle.

""We're asking readers to not engage in any @nytimes platforms tomorrow and stand with us on the digital picket line! Read local news. Listen to public radio. Make something from a cookbook. Break your Wordle streak,"" Amanda Hess, a writer at the Times, posted on Twitter.

""I'm walking out with 1,100 of my @NYTimesGuild colleagues for a fair and complete contract,"" wrote Michael Gold, a Times reporter. ""This contract is more than an investment in us: This is an investment in the future of @nytimes and an investment in the public that we serve.""

""There's something about this form that makes people act so ugly, but the NYT is not just journalists,"" Ida Bae Wells, a New York Times magazine reporter, posted on social media. ""We're striking for our lower paid colleagues, those who put out the paper, our security guards, our news assistants. That is the point of COLLECTIVE actions. We fight together.""

The New York Times addressed the one-day strike in a Thursday morning article, confirming that the contract between the newspaper and the union had expired in March 2021. After 40 bargaining sessions, the Times and NewsGuild continued to face several sticking points.

According to the Times, the union was unsatisfied with its proposed raises, return-to-work policy, and the employee performance rating system.

""White Guild members were more likely to get the top ratings,"" stated a study conducted by NewsGuild, ""while Black and Hispanic members were more likely to get the lowest two ratings.""

Following the report, the newspaper claimed that the managing editor, Marc Lacey, announced plans to update the rating system.

The Times reported that during the 24-hour walkout, nonunion writers and staff would continue to release news reports.

""Strikes typically happen when talks deadlock. That is not where we are today,"" said Joe Kahn, the executive editor of the Times. ""While the company and the NewsGuild remain apart on a number of issues, we continue to trade proposals and make progress toward an agreement.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ny-times-writers-strike-24-hours,2022-12-08
NYC Democrat DA under fire for downgrading 52% of felony cases to misdemeanors,"New York County Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg is in hot water following recent reports that he downgraded 52% of felony cases to misdemeanors in 2022 while New Yorkers continue to face surging crime rates, Fox News Digital reported.



According to data from the DA office website, 39% of felony charges were downgraded to misdemeanors in 2019. From 2013 to 2020, under District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., the percentage of downgraded cases never exceeded 40%.

Since taking office in January, Bragg's office has won only 51% of prosecuted felony charges, compared to Vance's 68% in 2019.

Bragg has declined to prosecute 35% more felony cases this year compared to 2019.

The DA's office blamed the impact of COVID and reforms to New York's discovery laws in 2019. Bragg's office also claimed that not every felony charge was correctly classified at the time of the arrests.

In a ""Day One"" memo to staff on January 3, Bragg instructed prosecutors to reduce felony charges for armed robberies and drug dealing. In addition, the memo stated that the DA's office would no longer prosecute many serious charges that were not also accompanied by a felony count.

""These policy changes not only will, in and of themselves, make us safer; they also will free up prosecutorial resources to focus on violent crime,"" Bragg claimed.

Meanwhile, the New York Police Department's latest crime statistics reported that overall crimes are up 27.6% this year. Compared to the same time last year, felony assaults are up 13.2%, rapes 10.1%, robberies 29.9%, and transit crimes 41.7%. Conversely, murders are down 13.8%, and shootings are down 14.8%.

Jeanine Pirro, a former Westchester County district attorney, slammed Bragg for his low conviction rate. Pirro stated that during her three terms as a Republican DA, her conviction rate was 94.8%.

""That's an office where we take crime seriously. We're passionate about it. ... And 84% of all defendants of those were convicted of the highest count,"" Pirro said on Fox News' ""The Five.""

Pirro's co-host Harold Ford Jr., a Democrat and former Tennessee congressman, also blamed Bragg for making Manhattan residents feel unsafe.

""[Democrats] will not enjoy this [voter registration] advantage if we continue to take in the lackadaisical and irresponsible way as we go about talking about these issues,"" said Ford. ""I know Alvin Bragg and I like him personally. I would much rather have him – or for that matter, anyone in that office – sit back after a year and say what's working and what's not working.""

A spokesperson for Bragg's office, Danielle Filson, told the New York Post, ""The fact is, we have prosecuted 459 more felonies this year compared to last and we have three times as many gun convictions so far this year compared to all of 2019. … We will continue prosecuting violence drivers and prioritizing safety and fairness in every case.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-democrat-da-under-fire-for-downgrading-52-of-felony-cases-to-misdemeanors,2022-11-29
VIDEO: Tourists attack hostess after she asks for proof of COVID vaccination,"A trio of tourists visiting New York City from Texas reportedly attacked a hostess at a well-known restaurant after they were asked to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination in order to dine inside.

Cell phone video obtained by WNBC-TV appears to show the group of individuals — all three of them women — assaulting a Carmine's employee at around 5 p.m. Thursday evening.

In the video, the assailants can be seen punching and slapping the restaurant employee in the face and body and nearly tipping over the hostess stand. One of the women allegedly ripped a necklace off the hostess' neck.

According to the outlet, tempers flared after the hostess, who has not been identified, questioned the legitimacy of the women's vaccination documents. Proof of vaccination to dine inside is now required under the city's new health mandate, which prohibits unvaccinated individuals from gathering indoors for any public activity.

Caught on Camera: NYC Hostess Attacked Over Vaccine Mandate by Texas Tourists www.youtube.com

Eventually, other employees at the restaurant came to break up the fight. In the video, one can be seen carrying one of the attackers away from the scuffle.

The hostess reportedly suffered pain and bruising after the attack but refused medical treatment, the New York Post reported.

""She's extremely shook up,"" noted Carmine's owner, Jeffrey Bank. ""It's inexcusable, ridiculous.""

According to the New York Daily News, the tourists — Kaeita Nkeenge Rankin, 44, Tyonnie Keshay Rankin, 21, and Sally Rechelle Lewis, 49 — were given desk appearance tickets for assault, then released.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Carmine's said, ""It's a shocking and tragic situation when one of our valued employees is assaulted for doing their job — as required by city policies — and trying to make a living.""

The restaurant now plans to post a security guard near the building entrance.

""My employees are freaked out,"" Bank added. ""It's not fair.""

The NYC Hospitality Alliance responded to the news by asking for tougher penalties against those who assault restaurant employees, given the increased risk placed on them by the new health mandate.

""We're calling on the city and state of New York to immediately increase penalties for assaulting restaurant workers in New York City in conjunction with enforcement of COVID-19 protocols,"" the group said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-hostess-attacked-vaccine-mandate,2021-09-17
NYC Mayor Eric Adams says NYPD would not repeat Uvalde police mistakes during school shooting,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams asserted Tuesday that in a school shooting event in his city, NYPD officers and other first responders would not hesitate to intervene, in contrast to the reported police response to the deadly mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last week.

""That is not going to happen in New York. We go in with an active shooter,"" Adams said Tuesday morning on ""Morning Joe.""

""Not only would the police go in with an active shooter, but the FDNY, EMS, they’re trained to go in with an active shooter,” he continued. “It appears as though this was treated more like a barricaded armed person or a hostage negotiation scenario instead of an active shooter.""

Adams also said that he intended to reach out to Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin to discuss what local leaders can do to address gun violence.

“I’m going to call him today, because this is a mayors’ battle,” Adams said. ""Mayors are being impacted by that.'



Police in Uvalde, Texas, have faced mounting criticism over their response to last week's shooting at Robb Elementary School, where 19 children and two teachers were murdered by a gunman.

At a press conference Friday, Texas Department of Public Safety Chief Steven McCraw told reporters that during the shooting, police had come to believe the gunman had barricaded himself in a classroom and was no longer an active shooter threat. Several officers had waited for backup in the school hallway as children were trapped in the classroom with the gunman.

Some of the children were speaking with police dispatchers over the phone and begging for police to rescue them. Instead, officers waited nearly an hour before the classroom was breached and the gunman incapacitated.



“Obviously, based on the information we have, there were children in that classroom that were still at risk,” McCraw said Friday. ""From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course, it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision. Period.”

ABC News reported Monday that the Uvalde Police Department and the Uvalde Independent School District police force have ceased to cooperate with the Texas Department of Public Safety's investigation into the massacre. The decision to end cooperation with the investigation came shortly after McCraw said that police had made the ""wrong decision,"" ABC News reported.

The Biden administration announced Sunday that the Department of Justice will open an investigation into the police response in Uvalde, in response to a request from Mayor McLaughlin. The department said the review ""will be fair, transparent, and independent.""

“The goal of the review is to provide an independent account of law enforcement actions and responses that day, and to identify lessons learned and best practices to help first responders prepare for and respond to active shooter events,” the Justice Department said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-shooting,2022-06-01
NYC mayor's race plunges into chaos after officials count sample ballots with actual ballots: 'Deeply troubling',"The race to determine the next mayor of New York City descended into further chaos Tuesday after election officials admitted they included test ballots in the official vote tallies.

What are the details?

As TheBlaze reported, confirming the winner of the Democratic primary — which essentially determines the successor of Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) in heavily Democratic New York City — was already expected to take weeks. Because of mail-in ballots and ranked-choice voting, the winner of the primary was expected to be revealed by mid-July at the earliest.

On Tuesday, officials released the first round of ranked-choice voting results, resulting in Eric Adams losing a significant portion of the nearly 10-point lead he won last week.

Adams' lead, in fact, shrank to fewer than 3%. ""The preliminary results that were initially posted had Adams with 51.1% of the vote and [Kathryn] Garcia with 48.9%, with 15,908 votes separating the two,"" WCBS-TV reported. Adams' campaign responded by highlighting ""irregularities"" within the vote count.

The Board of Elections then released a cryptic tweet revealing a ""discrepancy"" in the results without disclosing the exact details of the problem.

Board of Elections officials finally identified that ""discrepancy"" late Tuesday night: Sample ballots, about 135,000, had been tabulated in the official vote count, significantly skewing the ranked-choice voting results.

The NYCBOE said in a statement:

When the cast vote records were extracted for the first pull of [ranked-choice voting] results, it included both test and election night results, producing approximately 135,000 additional records. Board staff has removed all test ballot images from the system and will upload election night results, cross-referencing against election night reporting software for verification. The cast vote record will be re-generated and the RCV rounds will be re-tabulated.

The first round of ranked-choice voting results will now be published Wednesday, June 30.

What was the reaction?

Candidates with a chance to win the primary — Adams, Garcia, and Maya Wiley, who was closest to Adams after preliminary results on primary day — voiced their frustration over the problems.

""This error by the Board of Elections is not just failure to count votes properly today, it is the result of generations of failures that have gone unaddressed. Sadly it is impossible to be surprised,"" Wiley's campaign said. ""Last summer BOE mishandled tens of thousands of mail in ballots during the June 2020 primary. It has also been prone to complaints of patronage. Today, we have once again seen the mismanagement that has resulted in a lack of confidence in results, not because there is a flaw in our election laws, but because those who implement it have failed too many times.""

Garcia's campaign said, ""New Yorkers want free and fair elections, which is why we overwhelmingly voted to enact ranked choice voting. The BOE's release of incorrect ranked choice votes is deeply troubling and requires a much more transparent and complete explanation.""

Adams' campaign said, ""Today's mistake by the Board of Elections was unfortunate. It is critical that New Yorkers are confident in their electoral system, especially as we rank votes in a citywide election for the first time. We appreciate the Board's transparency and acknowledgment of their error. We look forward to the release of an accurate, updated simulation, and the timely conclusion of this critical process.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-mayor-s-race-plunges-into-chaos-after-officials-count-sample-ballots-with-actual-ballots-deeply-troubling,2021-06-30

The three suspects reportedly entered a high-end boutique on Broome Street and ""removed items from the display cases and racks,"" the NYPD said in a statement. The gang then ran out of the store and into the Charger.

""When officers attempted to conduct a lawful car stop, the vehicle refused to pull over and recklessly drove through traffic,"" the statement added.

The drama unfolded just outside of the Holland Tunnel.

In the video, the officers can be seen beating on the windows of the Charger and demanding its occupants exit the vehicle.

Authorities arrested Newark, New Jersey, residents 29-year-old Jahil Pamplin, 27-year-old Brianna Grier, and 29-year-old Janavia Marable and charged them with grand larceny, reckless endangerment, fleeing an officer, and resisting arrest.

The Daily Mail reported that officers arrested the trio in February for a burglary at the same shop. The suspects reportedly removed at least 26 handbags with an approximate total value of $50,000 during the February incident.

According to the Fair Lawn-Glen Rock Daily Voice, all three suspects have a criminal history. Pamplin served more than three years in a state prison for aggravated assault and weapons convictions, while Marable and Grier have previously been arrested and jailed for crimes.

""In one incident, Marable was charged with Macing a stranger after some kind of pre-dawn confrontation in Newark,"" the outlet reported. ""The following year, she was arrested for shoplifting nearly a dozen items from the Footlocker in the Short Hills mall, records show. The NYPD charged her, Grier and Pamplin with grand larceny, reckless endangerment, resisting arrest and eluding.""

NYC to grant 800K noncitizens right to vote; state GOP blasts bill as 'worst idea out of New York City Democrats ever',"New York City is poised to become the largest place in the country to grant noncitizens the right to vote in local elections, the Associated Press reported.

A city council measure that is expected to be ratified on Thursday with a veto-proof margin will allow legally documented, voting-age residents the ability to cast ballots in elections for mayor, city council, and other municipal offices.

Under the legislation, noncitizens will not be able to vote in federal elections that determine the president or members of Congress or state elections that determine the governor or state lawmakers.

At present, the legislation would affect more than 800,000 residents of the city who, though they are not citizens, are legal green card holders or have the right to work in the United States.

The AP reported that ""little stands in the way of the effort becoming law,"" given its broad support within the city council and its passive support from Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. The mayor has raised concerns about the bill's legality and argued that it will undermine the “value of citizenship,"" but has said he will not veto it.

Progressive voting rights and immigration activists have lauded the effort as inclusive and fair to people who reside in the city legally, pay taxes, and send their children to school.

Republicans in the city have vowed to launch a legal challenge to the measure if it is signed into law.

“We are here today pledging action against perhaps the worst idea out of New York City Democrats ever — that’s giving noncitizens the right to vote in local elections,” state GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy said during a press conference last week, according to the New York Post.

“We will pursue every legal action to see that this dangerous law is struck down,"" he declared, adding, “Besides being bad policy, it’s unconstitutional, it’s dangerous and un-American.”

Another Republican, councilman Joseph Borelli, argued the bill is in violation of the state's constitution.

“The people in this building are doing something against the state constitution,” he said. “The truth is, this will influence our elections, and the people who are registered to vote, the 5.6 million registered voters, ought to have a say in this.”

The measure serves as a flashpoint in a growing debate over voting rights in America. As Democrats seek to expand voting to noncitizens, who just so happen to typically support Democratic candidates, Republicans across the country fight to conserve the value of citizenship.



Last year, voters in Alabama, Colorado, and Florida ratified measures stipulating that only U.S. citizens could vote. Similar measures have been adopted in Arizona and North Dakota.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-to-allow-noncitizens-to-vote,2021-12-07
"NYC veterans vow to sue city if Memorial Day parade is barred, point out Black Lives Matter protests and cannabis event were permitted: 'Slap in the face'","A veterans' group is threatening to sue New York City if they are not permitted to hold its annual Memorial Day parade. The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization was denied a permit for the parade, and the group is highlighting a double standard. American military service members are barred from marching in a patriotic parade, yet Black Lives Matter protesters were not only allowed, but encouraged, to hold protests throughout the city for the last year.

This year's Memorial Day parade would be the 102nd running of the distinguished procession to celebrate American service members. This year's parade was specifically going to honor Gulf War veterans since it is the conflict's 30th anniversary.

The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization, an association of 16 local veterans' groups that has sponsored the annual event for decades, filed a request for a parade permit with the New York Police Department on Feb. 27, according to Staten Island Live. The vets' group estimated that approximately 1,000 participants would ""march down Forest Avenue from Hart Boulevard to Greenleaf Avenue, a 18-block stretch of the leafy commercial street in West Brighton,"" the New York Post reported. However, the NYPD denied their request to hold the parade.



The Memorial Day parade was denied because of Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's executive order signed last year restricting public events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization points out that Black Lives Matter protests, which have at times escalated into violent riots, have been allowed since May 28, 2020, in reaction to the death of George Floyd.

Last June, thousands gathered in June for a black transgender lives rally in Brooklyn.



De Blasio even participated with a group that did not practice social distancing when they painted ""Black Lives Matter"" on a Manhattan street.

Last July, the far-left de Blasio argued that Black Lives Matter rallies were permitted while other events were not, ""This is a historic moment of change. We have to respect that but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we're used to, the parades, the fairs — we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.""

The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization note that the Big Apple hosted the New York City Cannabis Parade on May 1. About 200 weed enthusiasts marched down Broadway with a giant inflatable marijuana joint. The Cannabis Parade organizers received a permit from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and rally spokesman Stu Zakim gloated, ""We had a police escort the whole way, they shut traffic down, all that stuff.""

The marijuana event was not only allowed by New York City, but also had high-ranking government officials in attendance, including Democratic New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Attorney General Letitia James.





The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization plans to sue the city over the decision to prohibit veterans from participating in the Memorial Day parade.

""Under the equal protection clause, it's unconstitutional for the city to pick and choose between groups like this,"" attorney Brendan Lantry, who is working pro bono for the Staten Island vets, said. ""There's a clear double standard going on here.""

""All we ask for is fairness under the law,"" John Haynes, CEO of the USIVO, said.

""It's a slap in the face,"" Jamie Gonzalez, a Marine infantryman who saw combat during Operation Desert Storm, said. ""For many of us, a parade is a form of closure. We gather together and support each other.""

""I'm incensed,"" Ted Cohen, an 82-year-old retired Air Force reservist, said. ""It's pathetic.""

""We have accommodated hundreds of marches, protests and other gatherings even without permits,"" NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said. ""Any group where the event is planned, the NYPD was made aware and it was conducted peacefully has been accommodated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-veterans-memorial-day-parade,2021-05-09
Social media erupts after cancel culture claims career of 47-year NY Times journalist,"The New York Times fired science and health reporter Donald McNeil Jr. after it was reported that he used a racial epithet in front of students on an educational trip to Peru in 2019.

Initially, the Times reprimanded McNeil over the incident but it was hit with criticism from those who said it was not taking the incident seriously enough. On Friday, McNeil was fired after 47 years with the company.

Social media erupted after he released a statement about the incident and apologized while explaining the innocuous circumstances of his use of the epithet.

""On a 2019 New York Times trip for Peru for high school students, I was asked at dinner by a student whether I thought a classmate of hers should have been suspended for a video she had made as a 12-year-old in which she used a racial slur,"" he explained.

""To understand what was in the video, I asked if she had called someone else the slur or whether she was rapping or quoting a book title. In asking the question, I used the slur itself,"" he continued.

""I should not have done that,"" McNeil wrote.

""Originally, I thought the context in which I used this ugly word could be defended. I now realize that it cannot. It is deeply offensive and hurtful. The fact that I even thought I could defend it itself showed extraordinarily bad judgement. For that I apologize,"" he continued.

""To the students on the trip, I also extend my sincerest apology. But my apology needs to be broader than that. My lapse of judgement has hurt my colleagues in Science, the hundreds of people who trusted me to work with them closely during this pandemic, the team at 'The Daily' that turned to me during this frightening year, and the whole institution, which put its confidence in me and expected better,"" he added.

""So for offending my colleagues — and for anything I've done to hurt The Times, which is an institution I love and whose mission I believe in and try to serve — I am sorry,"" McNeil concluded. ""I let you all down.""

Many on social media were outraged that a journalist with a celebrated 47-year career was undone by using a racial slur in an unintentionally offensive manner.

""This reads like a confession procured by the Khmer Rouge. It's both ridiculous and terrifying,"" replied Andrew Sullivan.

""A culture that lacks grace is both punitive and miserable. Does intent matter? Does forgiveness exist?"" asked David French.

""It is now official NYT policy that for some words, intent does not matter, and it only takes one strike to sink a 47-year career,"" said Reason editor-at-large Matt Welch.

""This reads like a Bolshevik at his own show trial admitting he'd betrayed the revolution even though he never meant to betray the revolution because he loves the revolution,"" said Peter Savodnik of Vanity Fair.

NYU prof fired after his students complained they couldn't hack it warns not to 'coddle students for sake of tuition',"New York University students successfully petitioned to have a chemistry professor fired last month because they found his pre-med course too challenging. That professor is now speaking out about students' inability to ""take responsibility for failure"" and the danger of appeasing juvenile demands to be coddled.

Fired for expecting competency

84-year-old Maitland Jones Jr. is a professor of chemistry. Prior to teaching at NYU for fifteen years, he taught at Princeton University from 1964 until 2007, where he worked on over 200 papers, monographs, and books. According to Princeton's Office of the Dean of Faculty, the lab in which he experimented ""was an incubator of scientific and cultural exchange at all levels.""

Jones has a reputation as an academic who ""teaches the very knowledge he creates"" and whose classes, at least at Princeton, received rave reviews. As recently as 2017, he was celebrated as one of the ""Coolest Professors at NYU.""

The New York Times reported that last spring, 82 of his 350 undergraduate students signed a petition against Jones, claiming that his ""high-stakes course"" was too hard, going so far as to personally blame Jones for their poor test scores.



The petition said, ""We urge you to realize that a class with such a high percentage of withdrawals and low grades has failed to make students' learning and wellbeing a priority and reflects poorly on the chemistry department as well as the institution as a whole.""

According to the Guardian, the petition did not explicitly demand for Jones to be fired. Nevertheless, NYU deans terminated Jones' contract in August ahead of the fall semester.

Jones later wrote that the ""deans never revealed the contents of the petition to me so I was unable to refute it in any way. After several months of silence on their part, on Aug. 2 the deans fired me over the objections of the chemistry department. The administration summarily dismissed the grievance I filed.""

Paramjit Arora, a fellow chemist and colleague of Jones', told the New York Times, ""The deans are obviously going for some bottom line, and they want happy students who are saying great things about the university so more people apply and the U.S. News rankings keep going higher.""

Jones stated that while his ""reputation as a chemist and educator has not been seriously damaged,"" barring ""fair-minded support from departmental and university leadership,"" teachers will no longer be able to ""transfer their knowledge and experience to the next generation of students and teachers.""

Appeasing the complainers

The New York Times noted that extra to firing Jones, NYU officials tried to appease his former students, enabling them to withdraw from his class retroactively — in what Mark E. Tuckerman, the chemistry department's chairman referred to as a ""one-time exception"" — while also offering to review their grades.

Marc A. Walters, director of undergraduate studies, wrote to Jones ahead of his termination, indicating that NYU would ""extend a gentle but firm hand to the students and those who pay the tuition bills.""

Jones seized on this remark among others in a recent opinion piece he penned for the Boston Globe.

The veteran academic suggested that such interventions on behalf of students unwilling to confront their test score-illuminated shortcomings have a ""chilling effect ... on teaching overall and especially on untenured professors.""

Jones suggested that untenured faculty won't dare to ""give real grades"" and risk their careers ""at the peril of complaining students and deans who seem willing to turn students into nothing more than tuition-paying clients.""

The problem, in Jones' estimation, is not just the confrontation-adverse administrators who he indicated think of students chiefly as clients. The students complaining have also themselves to blame.

In his op-ed, Jones claimed that, during the pandemic when in-person classes were interrupted, he ""commissioned and paid for a series of 52 videos to substitute for canceled in-person lectures. Students rarely watched them. They performed abysmally on exams that would have seemed too easy only a few years ago.""

Despite failing to prepare and execute, many students who evidenced their need for help didn't seek it, certainly not by attending zoomed office hours.

Zacharia Benslimane, a Ph.D. student at Harvard who previously worked as a teaching assistant in Jones' course, told NYU, ""I have noticed that many of the students who consistently complained about the class did not use the resources we afforded to them.""

The incompetence amongst students was not, however, universal, just as the signers of the petition did not come close to achieving a majority.

Jones reported that while single digit scores became common ""and we even had zeros on exams ... 60 percent of my students still got As and Bs this past semester.""

While underperformers bottomed out, top students were allegedly performing better than ever.

'Tough love'

Concerning the underperformers, Jones wrote, ""Everyone hits limits at some point, and it is a vital life skill to use 'failure' to overcome and improve. Failure should become a class 'teachable moment.'""



The pandemic may have exacerbated the problem of incompetence and the refusal to address it, but, according to Jones, the problem goes back at least a decade.

""About 10 years ago, I noticed that students were increasingly misreading exam questions,"" Jones wrote. ""My careful attention to the wording or problems did not help much. Exam scores began to decline, as did attendance in the traditional large lecture section of the course.""

The solution, argued Jones, isn't appeasement but ""tough love.""

""Deans must learn to not coddle students for the sake of tuition ... They must join the community in times of conflict to generate those teachable moments,"" wrote Jones.

In addition to adults remaining resolute in upholding high standards, Jones emphasized that students ""need to develop the ability to take responsibility for failure. If they continue to deflect blame, they will never grow.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyu-prof-fired-because-his-students-couldnt-hack-it-calls-for-tough-love-and-warns-not-to-coddle-students-for-sake-of-tuition,2022-10-23
NYU 'anti-racist' survey asks students to identify as one or more of at least 30 genders,"New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development asked students to identify as one of at least 30 genders in a survey to ""help build a more affirming environment.""

The survey was created by Steinhard's Office of Equity, Belonging, and Community Action and sent to students in February in order to ""inform the School's policies, promote anti-racist practice, and help build a more affirming School environment for all,"" according to an email obtained by TheBlaze.

""This survey was designed by my office to understand everyone's experiences and sense of belonging at the school,"" said Director of Equity Initiatives Maria Ramirez in a Feb. 3 Facebook video. ""The survey is completely confidential, and we'll be using the data to inform our equity work in hopes of making Steinhardt a better place for everyone, especially our more vulnerable peers.""





Screenshots from the survey depicting a question asking students ""with which gender(s) do you identify?"" was first shared by David Reaboi on Twitter and later obtained by TheBlaze. The question has at least 30 responses ranging from ""agender"" to ""polygender"" and asks students to ""select all that apply.""

Other questions ask students to rate how they feel about statements like, ""Senior leadership shows a visible commitment to fair racial/social representation,"" with responses ranging from ""Strongly Do Not Believe"" to ""Strongly Believe"" or ""Unsure/Do Not Know."" Students were asked if within the last three or six months they've ""heard/witnessed an NYU Steinhardt community member use a slur, epithet, or other disparaging statement"" and how often.



Students were also asked to identify which ""equity issues"" are predominant in the NYU Steinhardt community, including hunger/food insecurity, mental health, racial bias/racism, childcare and parental leave, privilege, ability bias, economic disadvantage, religious intolerance, cliques/favoritism, linguistic discrimination, and homophobia.

The survey has a note on pronouns, clarifying that ""When we say 'I, me, my' we refer to you and all of the identities you hold such as your gender identity/expression, race/ethnicity, skin color, sexuality, citizenship status, education level, age, and position on campus.""

""The Office of Equity, Belonging, and Community Action designed the survey in response to your requests for greater community transparency and collective goal setting, and with the purpose of understanding our community's experiences and assessing our members' sense of belonging,"" the survey states at the beginning.

""All responses will be kept strictly confidential. We will use responses to inform our School's equity agenda, shift policy and promote anti-racist practice, and help build a warmer and more affirming School environment for everyone, especially for more vulnerable community members.""

Obama wants Americans to 'reimagine policing' as Democrats demand abolition of police departments,"Former President Barack Obama wants Americans to ""reimagine policing"" after two new incidents propelled the issue of police tactics and officer-involved fatal shootings back into national headlines.

What is the background?

Over the weekend, news broke that an Army officer had filed a lawsuit against police officers in Windsor, Virginia, after they ""drew their guns, pointed them at him and used a slang term to suggest he was facing execution before pepper-spraying him and knocking him to the ground"" during a traffic stop in December, the Associated Press reported.

One of those police officers, Joe Gutierrez, was fired Monday.

Meanwhile, 20-year-old Daunte Wright was shot and killed by police on Sunday in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. Law enforcement said the officer who killed Wright did so accidentally, discharging her firearm when she meant to draw her Taser.

That officer has since resigned.

What did Obama say?

Obama said Wright's untimely death is the impetus for Americans to ""reimagine policing and public safety.""

Our hearts are heavy over yet another shooting of a Black man, Daunte Wright, at the hands of police. The fact that this could happen even as the city of Minneapolis is going through the trial of Derek Chauvin and reliving the heart-wrenching murder of George Floyd indicates not just how important it is to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but also just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country.



Michelle and I grieve alongside the Wright family for their loss. We empathize with the pain that Black mothers, fathers, and children are feeling after yet another senseless tragedy. And we will continue to work with all fair-minded Americans to confront historical inequities and bring about nationwide changes that are so long overdue.

What are other Democrats saying?

Far-left Democrats agree with Obama.

Recycling the ""defund the police"" narrative that gained momentum after George Floyd's death last year — only to fizzle out when violent crime skyrocketed in major U.S. cities — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), among others, are calling for radical policing reforms.

""Daunte Wright's killing was not a random, disconnected 'accident' — it was the repeated outcome of an indefensible system that grants impunity for state violence, rewards it w/ endlessly growing budgets at the cost of community investment, & targets those who question that order,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Cameras, chokehold bans, 'retraining' funds, and similar reform measures do not ultimately solve what is a systemic problem. That system will find a way — killings happen on camera, people are killed in other ways, retraining grows $ while often substituting for deeper measures.""

""It wasn't an accident. Policing in our country is inherently & intentionally racist. Daunte Wright was met with aggression & violence,"" Tlaib said. ""I am done with those who condone government funded murder. No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can't be reformed.""

Moderate Democrats, however, disagree with their colleagues.

Reps. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) specifically attributed anti-police rhetoric for significant losses that Democrats saw in 2020, which almost caused them to lose their majority in the House.

Peters predicted in February that Democrats will lose badly in 2022 if they employ similar campaign messages, and Spanberger, in a post-2020 election conference call, agreed.

""If we run this race again we will get f***ing torn apart again in 2022,"" Spanberger predicted last November.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-americans-reimagine-policing-democrats-abolition-of-police,2021-04-14
"Obama task force member says police officers are responsible for spike in violent crime, not 'defund the police'","Violent crime has spiked in major cities nationwide in 2021, unfortunately coming on the heels of a year that was also characterized by higher-than-normal violent crime rates. So who is to blame? According to activist Brittany Packnett Cunningham, law enforcement is responsible for skyrocketing crime rates.

Cunningham's comments are particularly eyebrow-raising because she is an influential voice who sat on former President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing and Missouri Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon's Ferguson Commission.

What did Cunningham claim?

Cunningham, who is also an MSNBC contributor, argued Monday on MSNBC that the ""defund the police"" movement is not responsible for rising crime rates. Instead, she claimed police officers are at fault.

The context of Cunningham's argument was a question from show host Stephanie Ruhle about the implications of the ""defund the police"" movement considering skyrocketing violent crime rates has become the primary issue in the New York City mayoral election.

Cunningham built her argument on the fact that police departments have not been defunded, but have, in fact, had their funding increased since 2020. In reality, cities are pumping more cash into law enforcement to battle violent crime and a shortage of police officers. Cunningham failed to mention that fact, instead outright suggesting that more funding, plus increased crime rates, means police officers are responsible.

""I think that there are a lot of police unions and GOP operatives that would like for us to believe that this recent crime wave has everything to do with this idea of defunding the police. But guess what... The police haven't been defunded,"" Cunningham said.

""If you actually look at the 50 largest cities' law enforcement spending, as a share of the general expenditure in each of those cities, actually rose slightly from 13.6% to 13.7%. And many of the cities that have talked about removing that money, like Minneapolis and Seattle, they've actually paused or slowed how they were thinking about moving that money,"" she continued.

""This rise in crime is not the fault of the movement,"" Cunningham claimed. ""It's actually the fault of the police and this has been our point all along.""

The solution to rising crime, according to Cunningham, is both moving money from police departments as well as enacting progressive policies.



""Why should we keep funding systems and institutions that keep rendering themselves ineffective?"" she asked. ""We should be talking about gun control, livable wages, fair housing, education. That's where we should be moving the money to ensure truly safe streets.""



How bad is the officer shortage?

The spike in violent crime is happening concurrently with record police officer resignations and retirements.

The shortage is so bad, in fact, that Atlanta, for example, ""remains more than 400 officers under its authorized level, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

The New York Times captured the gravity of the situation, ""A survey of about 200 police departments indicates that retirements were up by 45 percent and resignations by 18 percent in the period between April 2020 and April 2021, when compared with the preceding 12 months.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-task-force-member-police-crime-spike,2021-06-22
AOC receives brutal reality check after claiming GOP critics 'are mad they can’t date me' and have 'deranged sexual frustrations',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) triggered a social media storm on New Year's Eve after she claimed that her Republican critics are ""mad they can’t date me"" and accused them of ""projecting their sexual frustrations"" onto her boyfriend.

What is the background?

Ocasio-Cortez faced backlash late last week after she was caught vacationing in Florida while her constituents in New York City battled skyrocketing COVID-19 cases.

National Review reported:

Ocasio-Cortez was spotted dining in Miami Beach, Fla., on Thursday, according to a tip received by National Review , on the same day that her native New York City reported a record number of Covid-19 cases.



Photos obtained by National Review show Ocasio-Cortez seated outside Doraku Sushi and Izakaya in Miami Beach Thursday afternoon, raising a cocktail in one and checking her phone in another.



How did AOC respond?

The New York Democrat responded by claiming her GOP critics are ""creepy weirdos"" who need therapy to address their ""deranged sexual frustrations.""

""If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Ya creepy weirdos.""

""It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general,"" she added. ""These people clearly need therapy, won’t do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. It’s really weird.""

What was the response?

Ocasio-Cortez was hit with a reality check.

No, critics were not condemning her trip to Florida because they want to date her. Instead, Ocasio-Cortez's trip to Florida seemingly exposed her hypocrisy, critics alleged. Critics also noted that her response to the backlash was ""insanely narcissistic.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-gop-critics-date-accusations,2022-01-02
Ohio Senate candidate Mike Gibbons says middle-class Americans don't pay 'any kind of fair share' of income taxes,"Mike Gibbons, who is currently the leading Republican Senate candidate from Ohio, finds himself in hot water for previously saying that the American middle-class doesn't pay ""any kind of fair share"" of the country's income taxes.

Gibbons, a millionaire investment banker turned politician, made the comments in a September episode of ""The Landscape"" podcast at a media event in 2021.

Gibbons said, ""The top 20% of earners in the United States pay 82% of federal income tax — and, if you do the math, and 45% to 50% don't pay any income tax, you can see the middle class is not really paying any kind of a fair share, depending on how you want to define it.""

The Associated Press reported that Gibbons's comments could ""take on new resonance"" after United States Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) — who leads the Senate Republicans' campaign apparatus — debuted a policy strategy that called to raise taxes on Americans who currently don't earn enough money to pay federal income taxes. The tax hike would increase taxes on millions of Americans.

In the video where Gibbons makes this comment, the candidate is sitting in front of a campaign backdrop and condemns Democrats for spreading an ""absolutely false"" narrative suggesting that ""the middle class is getting screwed and the wealthy, the elite, are cheating everybody.""

Gibbons suggested that the Democrats use this rhetoric because they ""need the middle class to win an election.""

He also went on to say that he doesn't mind the utilization of a ""progressive tax system structure"" but went on to say that wealthy Americans already pay a lot in taxes.

Gibbons's comments garnered considerable ire online.

Steve Cortes — a former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump and Newsmax host — lambasted Gibbons as a ""gazillionaire who made a fortune doing business with the Chinese Communists.""

Nan Whaley — the former Democratic Mayor of Dayton who is currently running in Ohio's Democratic gubernatorial primary — said, ""This is exactly why we need to elect more leaders from the middle-class.""

Riley Moore — the State Treasurer of West Virginia — said, ""Ohio, please don't elect this man. He will continue failed policies that have been destroying the middle class of this great country.""

A spokesperson for Gibbons's campaign told TheBlaze that ""Mike Gibbons does not support tax increases on any Americans – and never has.""

""Mike is a businessman, not a career politician and he understands economics and how to implement smart ideas and strategies that will benefit all Americans,"" the spokesperson continued. ""As a conservative Mike has pledged that he will not raise taxes and will put forth pro-growth, America First policies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ohio-senate-candidate-mike-gibbons-says-middle-class-americans-don-t-pay-any-kind-of-fair-share-of-income-taxes,2022-04-09
"Amid historic heat wave, Los Angeles TV news anchor tweets that 'power just went out' in newsroom. Oil & Gas Workers Association issues perfect response.","California's historic heat wave pushed temperatures to all-time record highs across the state Tuesday, including in San Jose (109 degrees) and Sacramento (116 degrees), according to the Weather Channel.

The mercury wasn't nearly as high in Los Angeles on Tuesday ( 93 degrees) after topping out at 101 degrees Sunday. But according to Marc Brown — anchor for KABC-TV news in Los Angeles — the power still went out at the station Tuesday night:

The loss of power likely didn't come as a big surprise. Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom asked state residents to curtail electricity usage Tuesday to ease the strain on power grids:

Newsom's video appeal was met with a fair amount of mockery, particularly from commenters who didn't believe the governor was suffering much under the heat compared to others.

In the same way, Brown's tweet about the power going out at KABC-TV attracted some sarcasm — but the comment that got the most attention came from the Oil & Gas Workers Association:

""Get somebody to bring you 5 gallons of wind turbine,"" the Oil & Gas Workers Association quipped back.

Interestingly, days after California's statewide power grid emergency declaration — and facing the potential of rolling blackouts — the state activated four gas-powered emergency generators.

How did folks react?

Other commenters, as you might expect, loved the response from the Oil & Gas Workers Association:

""Oh my gosh, @ogwausa, you won at Twitter,"" one commenter reacted.

""This tweet wins,"" another user declared.

""That had to be the best reply,"" another commenter said. ""The media is just as complicit in this disaster perpetuated by the alleged administration[s] in Washington and Sacramento. I wonder if ABC's backup generators are run on windmills and solar panels?""

""Basic incompetence,"" another user wrote. ""California has all the resources it needs, they just have to execute smarter. Have [U.S. Rep.] Eric Swalwell [D-Calif.] head over [to] the wind turbine farm, lay down one of his notorious potent vigorous farts, and get those turbines spinning.

Lawmaker unveils bill to protect from 'malicious prosecution' in cases of self-defense: 'Kyle's law',"An Oklahoma lawmaker unveiled new legislation this week meant to protect people from ""malicious prosecution"" in cases where they use self-defense.

News of the legislation came just days after 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and two other serious felonies. Rittenhouse was charged by prosecutors less than two days after he alleged he fired on protesters in Kenosha in self-defense last August. A jury of Rittenhouse's peers ultimately agreed that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.

What are the details?

Oklahoma state Sen. Nathan Dahm (R) announced on Tuesday plans to file SB 1120 to protect Oklahomans and ensure that using self-defense does not result in being criminally charged and taken to trial for ""political reasons.""

The bill, which is also called ""Kyle's law,"" would permit ""victims of malicious prosecution would be able to receive compensation for expenses and damages.""

If the bill becomes law, Oklahomans would be awarded ""fair and just compensation"" if they are charged with murder, yet found not guilty because it was determined they acted in self-defense. In such cases, the state would be obligated to ""reimburse the defendant for all reasonable costs, including loss of wages, legal fees incurred, and other expenses involved in their defense,"" a press release explained.

The press release explained further:

SB 1120 further states that in order to support a claim of malicious prosecution, the claimant must establish that the prosecution was instituted or instigated by the prosecutor and was without probable cause; that the prosecution had legally and finally been terminated in favor of the claimant; and that as a result of the criminal prosecution, the claimant sustained injury.



Malice may be established if the motive for the prosecution was something other than a desire to bring an offender to justice, or that it was one with ill will or hatred, or willfully done in a wanton or oppressive manner and in conscious disregard of the claimant's rights. Under the legislation, a prosecutor may be held personally liable to a claimant if malicious prosecution is established.



What did Dahm say?

In his statement, Dahm said lawmakers have a duty to protect their constituents from politically motivated prosecution.

""Kyle Rittenhouse should never have been charged. The video evidence from early on showed it was lawful self-defense,"" Dahm said.

""It is our duty to protect the rights of the people we represent, and the right to self-defense is paramount. This bill will ensure that what happened to Kyle Rittenhouse cannot happen to the people of Oklahoma,"" he explained.

Anything else?

After Rittenhouse was acquitted, commentators and politicians suggested the entire criminal case against Rittenhouse was politically motivated. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D) even floated an investigation into the Kenosha prosecutors who tried Rittenhouse.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oklahoma-lawmaker-files-kyles-law,2021-11-27
Oklahoma Republican's bill would ban critical race theory from being taught in school,"An Oklahoma state lawmaker is seeking to ban teaching ""divisive concepts"" from critical race theory in state schools, pushing for a law that would permit teachers to be fired for doing so.

State Sen. Shane Jett (R) is the author of Senate Bill 803, legislation that would explicitly prohibit the teaching of critical race theory and its components in the state of Oklahoma. In an interview with TheBlaze Wednesday, Jett said that while proponents of critical race theory promise to improve race relations, what's being taught in schools actually creates a racial divide.

""It's teaching divisive concepts and ideology to young people,"" Jett told TheBlaze. ""It is Marxist in origin and it's designed to cause children to, instead of looking at what makes us unique and special and American, it causes them to pit themselves against each other based on the color of their skin.""

Jett's bill prohibits Oklahoma public schools and public charter schools, starting from kindergarten to high school, from ""teaching, instructing or training"" any student to believe in ""divisive concepts.""

Divisive concepts as defined in the legislation would, for example, promote the idea that ""one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex"" or that ""the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist."" Schools would not be allowed to teach that ""an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously"" or that ""an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex.""

Other ""divisive concepts"" include the idea that ""an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex,"" or that ""meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist or were created by a particular race to oppress another race.""

""The fundamental equality that is part of the American ideal is what we're trying to underscore here,"" Jett said.

Opponents of the bill accuse Jett of wanting to silence conversations about race in public schools.

""It was racially insensitive I thought. It was not a well-written bill; it seems like it said we don't care and we are going to say these things,"" Democratic state Sen. George Young said in an interview with KFOR.

""You are going to penalize teachers that teach the truth,"" he charged.

Shannon Fleck, executive director of the Oklahoma Conference of Churches, told KFOR that ""race is an active issue"" for people of color in Oklahoma.

""It's offensive to all people in Oklahoma that conversations about racism are so divisive that they shouldn't be happening. That's the opposite of how to solve problems in our country and in our state,"" she said.

Jett, a Cherokee American, strongly objected to critics who say his bill would punish teachers for discussing racial issues in schools.

""My wife is from Brazil, a third of her family down in Brazil would be considered people of color, and racism isn't something that we tolerate,"" Jett said. ""I'm a Cherokee Indian. My mom is Cherokee, my dad is Irish. And so we talk about things that happen in the past honestly, engaged, hard-hitting. How do we fix it? How do we make sure it doesn't happen in the future?""

But critical race theory, in Jett's view, teaches some American children that they are oppressed and that their classmates with a different skin color are the oppressors.

""Instead of teaching equality and harmony and celebrating our progress in American history, this experiment in freedom, they are instead telling children to forget that. The very foundation of the American government is flawed, is racist. And if you're white, you are by definition a racist and you don't even know it. And if you're a person of color, then you are oppressed and you've been victimized. And it's by the other side of the classroom who are white, they have done it and their ancestors,"" Jett said.

""They are literally teaching animosity,"" he continued, characterizing the tenets of critical race theory as child abuse. ""The bill basically says you can no longer do this. You cannot abuse public school kids at taxpayers' expense and try to get them to distrust each other, distrust American history and then completely rewrite our history.""

By introducing his bill, Jett said he wants to have a dialogue and honest debate about race in America ""in the context of truth and not in the context of a Marxist ideology that completely ignores the tremendous progress that this society has made.""

Critical Race Theory



Jett's legislation is a direct repudiation of popular concepts in academia collectively known as critical race theory. CRT is a worldview that claims most laws and systems in America were historically rooted in the racist oppression of black people and other marginalized groups. It began as a legal movement in the 1970s in response to perceptions that progress made by the civil rights movement was insufficient. Among its influences are Marxism, post-modernism, radical feminism, and other schools of leftist political and cultural thought.

As defined by University of Alabama law professor Richard Delgado and his wife Jean Stefancic in their book, ""Critical Race Theory: An Introduction,"" CRT is ""a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship among race, racism, and power.""

""Unlike traditional civil rights, which embraces incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law,"" they wrote.

According to this worldview, racism in the United States is structural. America's laws, institutions, and cultural representations are viewed to work together in ways that perpetuate racial inequity, or the unequal distribution of society's benefits or burdens based on skin color. ""White privilege"" is the historical and contemporary advantage supposedly shared by people with a fair skin color, their access to society's benefits and shielding from society's burdens. American national values like individualism, individual responsibility, meritocracy, fairness, or equal treatment are said to ignore the realities of structural racism and tell a lie that anyone in this country can make whatever they want of themselves, regardless of what they look like or where they come from.

This worldview has found widespread acceptance in academia and became mainstream in American politics and news media following racial unrest nationwide after the death of George Floyd in police custody and subsequent violent protests by the Black Lives Matter movement.

The New York Times' controversial ""1619 Project,"" which sought to reframe American history ""understanding 1619,"" the year the first African slaves were brought to America, ""as our true founding,"" is one example of critical race theory's widespread influence.

Another recent example is the controversy involving Coca-Cola, in which an employee claimed racial sensitivity training used a course called ""Confronting Racism"" that taught employees ""to be less white."" The training stated that ""To be less white is to:"" ""be less oppressive,"" ""be less arrogant,"" ""be less certain,"" ""be less defensive,"" ""be less ignorant,"" ""be more humble,"" ""listen,"" ""believe,"" ""break with apathy,"" and to ""break with white solidarity.""

Aspects and assumptions of ""whiteness,"" as explained by a publication from the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture that went viral on social media, include ideas like ""self-reliance,"" ""the nuclear family,"" emphasis on the scientific method, ""the primacy of Western (Greek, Roman) and Judeo-Christian tradition,"" the Protestant work ethic, ""Christianity,"" ""rigid time schedules,"" and more.

This is all derivative of critical race theory.

Believers, proponents, and defenders of CRT argue the worldview helps identify areas where racial inequities exist and give policy makers and educators the tools to correct longstanding injustices.

""It's an approach to grappling with a history of white supremacy that rejects the belief that what's in the past is in the past, and that the laws and systems that grow from that past are detached from it,"" scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw told Time last September. Crenshaw is one of the founding scholars of critical race theory.

But principles of CRT have been applied to make claims of structural oppression of other groups based on sexuality, gender, class, and disability.

""What critical race theory has done is lift up the racial gaze of America,"" said John Powell, the director of the Othering & Belonging Institute at the UC Berkeley. ""It doesn't stay within law, it basically says 'look critically at any text or perspective and try to understand different perspectives that are sometimes drowned out.'""

Teaching CRT in schools

Critical race theory is not only taught at the university level. A survey taken after George Floyd's death found that 81% of U.S. teachers support Black Lives Matter, with public schools in response seeking ways to ""revamp"" their history curriculums to focus on racial equity. Several U.S. schools had adopted curricula that uses the New York Times' 1619 Project to teach American history with a focus on the legacy of slavery.

The public school system in Buffalo, New York, for example, has adopted a ""woke"" curriculum that involves showing kindergarteners a dramatized video of dead black children speaking to them from the grave about the dangers of being killed by ""racist police and state-sanctioned violence.""

The mainstream promotion of critical race theory among the progressive left has inspired pushback from conservatives like Jett and other critics who say the theory distorts American history and promotes racist thinking. Former President Donald Trump denounced CRT as a ""Marxist doctrine"" that teaches that ""America is a wicked and racist nation, that even young children are complicit in oppression."" In an executive order, Trump banned the use of critical race theory as a part of diversity training in the federal government. President Joe Biden has since reversed Trump's policy.

Jett's bill would not ban discussions of racism, or significant historic events like the institution of slavery or the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, the single worst incident of racial violence in America. Instead, he hopes that school discussions on racial issues will occur as an honest dialogue about how people were wronged in the past, the progress America has made to correct those wrongs, and how America can continue to repudiate racism in the future instead of a blanket worldview that claims racism is inherent in white people.

""We are making tremendous progress,"" Jett told TheBlaze. ""I can see it in my military unit. I served 11 years as a Navy intelligence officer in the United States Navy. We were the complete spectrum of the rainbow, but guess what? We weren't looking at the color of our skin. What we were looking at is making sure our warfighters overseas had the material that they needed, the information they needed so they could get home to their families, American families.""

He observed that the prevalence of discussions about critical race theory in America is itself evidence that America has made racial progress and that people are willing to have this debate.

""We are looking to have an honest conversation. We're looking to make this a more perfect union, right? But what they promise and what they deliver are completely two different things. They say we're gonna have a great discussion, we're going to improve. But then when you start drilling down to what they're actually teaching, they're ignoring or even whitewashing, dare I say, our history and then telling us that we are fundamentally racist for being the color that we were born and that people of color are victims of those who are white.""

Senate Bill 803 has been assigned to the Education Committee in the state Senate, and while the bill has been endorsed by state House Speaker Charles McCall (R), Jett indicated that some Republican leaders on the committee were hesitant to advance his legislation.

""There's a reluctance to take a stand on this because we get called a racist for wanting to have an honest dialogue,"" Jett said. ""I felt like someone needed to do something, and so I did.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oklahoma-republican-ban-critical-race-theory-from-schools,2021-02-24
Ilhan Omar's office claims ads from pro-Israel group are putting her 'life at risk' by 'baselessly' quoting from her statements,"Leftist Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) has had no problem likening the United States to Hamas and the Taliban or accusing Israel of committing ""unthinkable atrocities"" and horrible human rights abuses.

But if pro-Israel groups hit back, her modus operandi appears to be to get testy and accuse them of putting her life in danger.

What happened?

In June, Omar upset a large number of people by equating the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban.

Omar claimed in a tweet that the U.S., Israel, Hamas, and the Taliban have all committed ""unthinkable atrocities"" and human rights abuses.

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity,"" she said as the world was still dealing with the repercussions of thousands of Hamas rocket attacks on Israel in May.

The tweet included a clip of Omar questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken on how those who perpetrate human rights abuses — including, she said, Hamas, the Taliban, and Israeli security forces — will be held accountable.

Even a dozen of her fellow Democratic lawmakers came out to condemn her statements. After the dustup, reports surfaced that the rift between Omar and congressional Democrats was more significant than previously reported, with some Democratic lawmakers reportedly calling her an ""anti-Semite"" privately.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, also known as AIPAC, began running an ad recently that goes directly after the lawmaker's attacks on the United States and Israel.

And Omar did not take kindly to AIPAC's criticisms, Fox News reported.



Her spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, hopped on Twitter Wednesday to claim the group's attack ads — which responded directly to the congresswoman's statements — were ""Islamophobic"" and to accuse the group of endangering Omar's life.

""The language AIPAC uses in paid ads to smear and vilify [Rep. Omar] is virtually identical to the language used in death threats she gets,"" Slevin said in a post that included a screenshot of an AIPAC ad that took issue with Omar's statements. ""Make no mistake: AIPAC is putting Rep. Omar's life at risk with repeated Islamophobic attack ads.""

""It shouldn't have to be stated, but baselessly linking Muslim-Americans to terrorism is *the* textbook example of Islamophobia and is routinely used to silence advocacy for Palestinian human rights,"" he continued.

Fellow ""Squad"" member and radical leftist Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) responded to Slevin's post with a tweet of her own: ""I am so sick of this s**t.""

Image source: Twitter/@RashidaTlaib screenshot

AIPAC replied to Slevin's attack by saying, ""Your baseless attack on us can't deflect from [Omar's] attack on America and Israel.""



""It is outrageous for Rep. Omar to put the U.S. and Israel on the same level as the Taliban and Hamas,"" the group added. ""There is no moral equivalence between democratic allies and the terrorists who target them.""

AIPAC told Fox News it stands by the ad.



""The ad concerning Representative Omar is completely fair and accurate,"" an AIPAC spokesperson said. ""It is not a personal attack and highlights her outrageous statement putting the United States and Israel on the same level as the Taliban and Hamas.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/omar-aipac-ad-life-in-danger,2021-08-12
Oregon forces all schools — elementary and up — to put 'menstrual products' in boys' bathrooms with 'instructions on how to use' them,"Every public school in Oregon — including elementary institutions — will soon be required to provide tampons and other feminine products in boys' bathrooms with ""instructions on how to use"" them.

The controversial requirement is in accordance with the state's new Menstrual Dignity Act, signed into law by Democratic Gov. Kate Brown last year, which mandates that menstrual products be made available in ""every student bathroom.""



Following the bill's passage, the Oregon Department of Education developed and distributed a ""Medical Dignity for Students"" toolkit to aid local districts and set forth a phased plan for districts to meet the law's standards and requirements.

Effective immediately, each school is required to have menstrual product dispensers in at least two bathrooms. But by June 2023, dispensers are required in every student bathroom, KGW-TV reported. The department emphasized that schools must ""consider all-gender access to the products.""

Sasha Grenier, a sexual health specialist with the department, said, ""This new program will help students participate actively in classes and school activities by alleviating some of the economic strain and experiences of shame that are often barriers for menstruating people accessing their education.""

Michela Bedard, executive director of Portland-based advocacy group PERIOD, added in a press release that ""this is a progressive policy, but also a bipartisan one ... because menstruation does not discriminate from race, class or political affiliation.""

Apparently, menstruation does not discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity, either. The state's resources for abiding by the law are littered with inclusive phrases such as ""students who menstruate"" and ""menstruating and non-menstruating students."" The department argues the law promotes ""menstrual equity.""

The toolkit goes on to say the new law aims to ""affirm the right to menstrual dignity for transgender, intersex, nonbinary, and two-spirit students.""

Portland Public Schools is reportedly excited to begin its planned implementation of the every bathroom requirement.

In a recent statement, the district announced that it had made feminine products available in ""female and all-gender restrooms"" and added that the products would be provided in ""all remaining restrooms, including boys' bathrooms,"" by the start of the next school year.

The progressive law, however, is facing a fair amount of pushback, as well.

In a recent column, Family Research Council president Tony Perkins blasted the ""absurd"" law, noting that local taxpayers would be on the hook for thousands of new tampon dispensers, which are expected to cost roughly $400 a machine.

He added that in most cases, all the equity-forward measure will accomplish is giving school janitors more to clean up as young boys undoubtedly take advantage of the new and unusual prank materials.

""Obviously, state leaders didn't bother to consult their counterparts in Illinois, where a similar move has literally opened the floodgates to expensive plumbing issues and mischief,"" Perkins wrote. ""Case in point: campuses like Loyola University, where janitors are dealing with all kinds of pranks, tampering, and vandalism.

Sanitary pads ""would end up on the mirrors, in the sinks, down the toilet, and completely thrown out,"" one students' group complained, according to Perkins.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oregon-schools-menstrual-products-for-boys,2022-05-04
"PA Governor-elect Josh Shapiro charges former Democratic political consultant with 'wide scale' ballot fraud – more than 1,000 signatures allegedly forged","Current Pennsylvania Attorney General and Democrat Governor-elect Josh Shapiro arrested a former political consultant on Wednesday for allegedly forging ballot signatures in the state's 2019 Democratic primary races.



Rasheen Crews, a Democratic campaign consultant, was hired by multiple candidates to assist in gathering the required number of signatures for nomination petitions to run in the Democratic primary races in 2019.

According to an investigation launched by the office of the attorney general in September 2019, Crews was charged with the ""wide scale forgery of signatures"" on his clients' nomination petitions.

The investigation involved several of Crews' clients, including five candidates running for the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, three running for Philadelphia Municipal Court, and three running in both elections.

Crews allegedly enlisted individuals to assist in his petition work by having them write names and addresses and forge signatures on multiple petitions. He is then accused of having the petitions notarized and filed with the Pennsylvania Department of State.

Shapiro, who has been critical of Republicans who have questioned election integrity and repeatedly denied voter fraud in Pennsylvania, said in a Wednesday statement that Crews' arrest is ""an important reminder that interfering with the integrity of our elections is a serious crime.""

""By soliciting and organizing the wide scale forgery of signatures, the defendant undermined the democratic process and Philadelphians' right to a free and fair election,"" Shapiro said. ""My office is dedicated to upholding the integrity of the election process across the Commonwealth, to ensure everyone can participate in Pennsylvania's future.""

The investigation discovered that more than 1,000 of the signatures were allegedly duplicates. The office of the attorney general found that many of the names and addresses were repeated on several petition pages, while other pages appeared to be photocopied. Additionally, some individuals listed claimed they never signed the petitions.

All of Crews' clients denied knowledge of the forgery scheme. As a result of the petitions' questionable authenticity, some candidates withdrew from the election.

Crews was charged with criminal solicitation to commit forgery and theft by failure to make required disposition.

'We're mad as hell': Parents of jailed Marine demand justice after military throws their son in the brig for 'speaking truth to power' against the Biden admin,"The parents of imprisoned Marine Corps Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller demanded justice from the Biden administration and the U.S. Military on Wednesday after their son was thrown into the brig for daring to publicly criticize the administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Stu Scheller Sr. and Cathy Scheller told Fox News host Tucker Carlson they're ""mad as hell"" about the military's treatment of their son, a 17-year Marine veteran, and are asking the American people to urge accountability on his behalf.

While the specific charges on which Scheller is being held have not been publicly revealed, the service member's parents believe it is the result of his breaking silence in violation of a gag order placed on him in recent weeks.

""Probably a week or two ago, or maybe it was a week ago, they put him under a gag order. They took away his right to post, to talk on social media, to email, to text,"" Stu Scheller Sr. said. ""He shared it with America. And he knew this weekend when he posted again and he broke his silence that they were probably going to arrest him on Monday. So, he is a very intelligent man. He understands what's going to happen to him.""

""His crime was speaking truth to power, and power couldn't handle it,"" Scheller went on to say.

He added: ""While he broke chain of command, [Defense Secretary Lloyd] Austin, [Gen. Mark] Milley, [Gen. Kenneth] McKenzie, they broke the chain of trust and confidence in the American people.""

Military leaders slammed by parents of imprisoned Marine www.youtube.com

""We're mad as hell,"" he exclaimed.

""I'm asking the American people to find your voice. Stand up, demand accountability of your congresspeople,"" Schelley Sr. pleaded. ""Ask for Lt. [Col.] Scheller to be freed. In my opinion, of course, I'm Dad, so it's probably not fair, but I think he should receive his pension after 17 years of fighting for this country. I think he and his family should have their health benefits and VA benefits for the rest of their lives for the sacrifices he's made.""

Scheller began garnering attention on social media last month after he posted a series of videos critical of the U.S. military leadership's handling of the withdrawal process from Afghanistan, including their abandonment of Bagram Airfield before evacuation efforts were complete.

In a statement issued this week, the Marine Corps confirmed that Scheller has, in fact, been detained ""in pre-trial confinement in the Regional Brig for Marine Corps Installations East aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune pending an Article 32 preliminary hearing.""

On Wednesday, Scheller's parents claimed that their son is being held in solitary confinement and has been granted minimal contact with the outside world.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/parents-of-jailed-marine-schelley-demand-justice,2021-09-30
Man asks popular Christian pastor if porn has broken his future marriage. Pastor issues a heartfelt and damning response about dangers of pornography.,"Pastor John Piper, minister and founder of Desiring God, detailed the damage that pornography inflicts on a marriage in a no-holds-barred response to a young man trying to overcome his compulsion to view pornography.

What are the details?

In a viral Sunday podcast, Piper tackled one man's struggle with pornography.

The man, a listener named Ben, told Piper, ""Beginning as a 10-year-old, I became addicted to porn videos. It was my primary battle for the next seven years.""

""There have been wonderful victories along the way, but I also know these videos are unrealistic and perverse,"" he added. ""God's design for sex must be a lot different than what I've seen. But what I have seen is the only model I know. As I look forward to marriage, I fear that what I watched has already patterned my expectations. What advice do you have for me? Is there any hope that I will experience loving, godly, healthy intimacy in marriage? And what can I do now to ensure it?""

Piper's response

Pulling no punches, Piper responded that Ben's ""wonderful victories"" simply aren't enough, and that God's mercy via a ""cluster of miracles"" taking place in Ben and his future wife is Ben's only hope — but Ben is solely on the hook for pursuing those miracles.

""One of my concerns in even addressing Ben's question or talking to him directly in this way is that I can't tell from his question whether he has gotten victory over this or not, because he says, 'There have been wonderful victories along the way.' That doesn't sound like ... the pornographic videos are behind him, but that he keeps returning to them, perhaps with less frequency,"" Piper insists. ""That's not going to do. You can't set your sights that low.""

He continues, ""Here's my suggested path toward hope, Ben. First, humble yourself by admitting that, for the rest of your life, those seven years of poisoning your mind are going to have consequences that you are responsible for and that will require unusual self-abasement in relation to your sexual expectations and your wife.""

Piper also implores his female listeners who are considering marriage at any point in their lives and emphasizes the importance of confronting their future partners about pornography.

""And you should insist on victory, never to look at pornography — not simply infrequent exposure,"" he adds. ""Too many people today think that pornography is just inevitable; it's a given, and marriages should just cope, just adapt to it. I think that's like saying, 'Poison is inevitable, and I'm just going to get used to taking poison.'""

Piper says that Christians' bodies are not their own, but belong to God.

""If you are a Christian, your perversely distorted brain belongs to God,"" he says. ""He bought you. He knew what he was buying. He bought you, body and soul, by his blood. You are not your own. He bought you so that he could indwell you. And the one who indwells you is explicitly called holy. And that is your calling: Be holy, because you are bought to be holy and indwell by the Holy One.""

Piper explains that it is up to Ben to speak frankly to a future partner about his past misgivings and indiscretions and be willing to be open and vulnerable to what comes with that.

""She will need to know all about this ahead of time so that she can decide if she's going to take a risk on you,"" he warns. ""Don't you dare hide this from her, spring it on her after you're married, and know then that there's no way out. That would be very disingenuous, dishonest, evil of you to do that.""

Trust and a dedication to brutal honesty, he says, will only further build intimacy in a relationship.

""I think it would be fair to say that every mature, healthy woman in marriage wants to enjoy her husband and wants to be enjoyed by her husband, but not used by him,"" Piper says. ""So, what's the difference between your wife being enjoyed by you and being used by you? I'll put it in one sentence as best I can, and then mention three ways to make it a reality.""



Three ways to cherish a person

Piper writes, ""A woman will feel properly enjoyed by her husband, rather than used, if she can tell that he is delighting in her body and her person as one. If physical enjoying and personal cherishing are united, it will be crystal clear when and how the husband is enjoying her body.""

""But,"" he warns, ""it needs to be made clear that in this enjoyment he is cherishing her person. In other words, it's pretty obvious to a woman when he's enjoying her body. It may not be as obvious to her that he is cherishing her person.""

Those ways include using words, eye contact, and a dedication to protecting and preserving the sacred intimacy that only God can build through trust, honesty, and respect.

""He may not be a poet, but he can say to her in the moment, 'I love you. I want no other. My eyes and my hands go after no other with the desire to do what we are doing now. You are precious to me. I cherish you,'"" Piper says.

He continues, ""Don't either of you give the impression that, as you move toward the height of delight, you lose personal contact and float into some dream world abstracted from the person in your arms. Open your eyes. Look as deeply into your spouse's eyes as you can, down into the very soul, and say with your eyes, 'You, you only, you only and forever — you.'""

Piper adds, ""Finally, and this is true for everyone, but especially, Ben, for people with your background. Through all the communication and experimentation, build that beautiful garden of pleasure with a hedge around it made out of her glad desires and permissions.""

He concludes, ""So, set your face, Ben, in these next years to pursue holiness and purity and deep transformation, and there will be hope for you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pastor-john-piper-pornography-damage-to-marriage,2021-02-01
Lead actress of 'Home Improvement' defends Tim Allen over resurfaced clip showing him lifting kilt on set,"Patricia Richardson, lead actress of the 1990s hit sitcom ""Home Improvement,"" defended her co-star, Tim Allen, this week after an old video clip surfaced, purportedly showing Allen flashing Richardson.

What is the background?

Richardson's comments are particularly noteworthy after Pamela Anderson, who played a minor role on ""Home Improvement,"" alleged that Allen flashed her before the filming of the show's pilot episode.

Variety reported on Anderson's allegations, which are featured in her forthcoming memoir, set to be released next week. Anderson wrote:

On the first day of filming, I walked out of my dressing room, and Tim was in the hallway in his robe. He opened his robe and flashed me quickly — completely naked underneath. He said it was only fair, because he had seen me naked. Now we’re even. I laughed uncomfortably.

Allen has denied the accusations.

""No, it never happened. I would never do such a thing,"" he told Variety.

What did Richardson say?

After Anderson's allegations were published, TMZ obtained video of a ""Home Improvement"" blooper reel.

The clip shows Richardson's character, ""Jill Taylor,"" and Allen's, ""Tim Taylor,"" standing in the living room set of the show. Allen's character is wearing a kilt when he appears to flash Richardson, who responds, ""Hangs long, I just wish it was shorter."" Both characters then laughed.

The clip was used to perhaps give credence to Anderson's accusations against Allen. But Richardson quickly shut down any hint of impropriety.

""People ask me what was under the kilt when he flashed me, he was well dressed under there, I was just shocked that he lifted the kilt, not by a man in boxer shorts,"" Richardson told TMZ.

Anything else?

Anderson responded to Allen's denial this week by doubling down on her accusation.

""This true story is just one of many surreal and uncomfortable situations I learned to navigate,"" Anderson said in a statement. ""My book goes into how it made me feel over the course of my life and, in this case, my career. I have no ill will toward Tim. But like the rest, it should never have happened.""

Paul Pelosi attack video released,"The video from last year's hammer attack on Paul Pelosi was released to the public on Friday. The police bodycam video shows the husband of Nancy Pelosi in his San Francisco home being brutally attacked by a man with a hammer.

Paul Pelosi, 82, was attacked with a hammer in the early hours of Oct. 28.

Suspect David DePape reportedly broke into the Pelosi home in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Heights. He allegedly asked, ""Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?"" At the time, the former speaker of the House was in Washington, D.C.

DePape purportedly detained Paul Pelosi. However, Pelosi was reportedly able to go to the bathroom, where his phone was charging, and he called 911.

Police dispatcher Heather Grives allegedly informed police officers that the reporting person of the incident at the Pelosi residence told her, ""There is a male in the home and that he is going to wait for his wife. However, he stated that he doesn't know who the male is but that his name is 'David 'and that he is a friend.""

At 2:27 a.m., police reportedly arrived at the Pelosi home for a ""priority well-being check.""

The newly-released police bodycam footage shows two officers approach the Pelosi residence. An officer knocks on the front door. A few seconds later, the door opens. DePape and Pelosi are holding a hammer.



Pelosi, dressed in a button-down shirt and underwear, warmly greeted the officers, ""Hey guys. How are ya?""

A police officer asked, ""What's going on man?""

DePape responded, ""Everything's good.""

Pelosi was seemingly smiling. He appeared to be holding a beverage in his left hand.

The officer instructed DePape to ""drop the hammer,"" but he replied, ""Nope.""

Pelosi and DePape can be seen struggling over the hammer, then the suspect wrestled it away. Pelosi attempted to flee to another room, but the suspect lunged and violently swung the hammer at Pelosi.

Police officers jumped into action and a struggle ensued. The shaky video shows all of the men on the floor of the home.

Police attempted to detain the suspect while Pelosi was motionless on the ground.

As an officer was attempting to handcuff DePape, the cop shouted, ""Give me your f***ing hand!""

Pelosi can be heard moaning in pain in the background.

WARNING: Graphic video

San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stephen M. Murphy ordered the San Francisco District Attorney's Office to release police body camera video, audio from police interviews with alleged attacker David DePape, 911 calls, home surveillance video, and other investigative material.



A coalition of news organizations requested the materials be released in the name of transparency. DePape's lawyers argued that the release of the materials would ""irreparably damage"" his right to a fair trial.

DePape, 42, lived in a school bus in Berkeley, according to the New York Post. The bus sits in the yard of the home of his ex-lover – San Francisco pro-nudist activist Gypsy Taub. DePape was allegedly a hemp jewelry maker who grew up in British Columbia, Canada.



DePape was hit with state charges of attempted murder, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, and threats against a public official and their family.

Federal prosecutors charged DePape with attempted kidnapping and assault with intent to retaliate against a federal official by threatening or injuring a family member.

DePape has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

"Report: Pelosi claimed to oppose gerrymandering, then funneled $300k to a Democratic gerrymandering group","Despite publicly voicing opposition to partisan gerrymandering, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) recently funneled $300,000 into the coffers of a Democratic gerrymandering group, the Washington Free Beacon reported Monday.

What are the details?

According to Federal Election Commission records, the money was moved from Pelosi's leadership political action committee, PAC to the Future, to the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in two separate transactions of $200,000 and $100,000 late last year.

The payments stand in direct contrast to past statements the House speaker has made. In 2019, in response to a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the practice, Pelosi claimed that partisan gerrymandering efforts ""compromise the integrity of our democracy.""

She added: ""This ruling greenlights the unjust and deeply dangerous practice of gerrymandering, which robs Americans of their right to have an equal voice in their government,"" suggesting that with the ruling, ""traditionally underserved communities, especially communities of color, risk losing the representation and resources they rightfully deserve.""

But now, as the country is fast approaching its once-a-decade redistricting process during which new congressional and state district lines are drawn, Pelosi is supporting the very practice she once decried.

What else?

The NDRC, run by former Obama administration attorney general Eric Holder, is a prominent group at the center of left-wing gerrymandering efforts, according to the Free Beacon. But that is not especially obvious based on how the group advertises itself online and in its public statements.

The group publicly portrays itself as an anti-gerrymandering organization, dedicated to undoing the damage that Republicans have done over the last decade.

On its website, the group states, ""There's no other way to put it. Since 2011, Republicans gerrymandered the country more aggressively than at any time in our history. The result? Your vote might not count the way you think it does. It's wrong — and we're here to fix it.""

However, the group does also admit it exists to execute ""a comprehensive redistricting strategy that shifts the redistricting power, creating fair districts where Democrats can compete.""

The fact is, both parties gerrymander to gain a competitive advantage, though Republicans have done it more effectively of late. And especially since 2010, when Republicans swept the country in a Tea Party wave, winning a large swath of state legislative seats and governor races across the country.

Anything else?

In addition to contributions from Pelosi's PAC, the group has also received a large contribution from George Soros's Democracy PAC.

According to the New York Times, Holder's group was born out of a quiet huddle held at the White House in 2017, just days before former President Obama exited office, during which Obama discussed future redistricting plans with a small cohort of Democratic Party leaders.

Present with Obama at the meeting was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe — and Pelosi.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-donates-to-democratic-gerrymandering-group,2021-02-22
Pelosi stops mid-speech after Republican laughs at claim 'Build Back Better' bill will reduce the debt,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) snapped back at a member of Congress who laughed at her claim during her floor speech that President Joe Biden's multitrillion-dollar spending proposal would reduce the debt.

On Friday, Pelosi spoke in the House of Representatives, extolling the claimed benefits of the Democrats' $1.75 trillion spending proposal for Biden's ""Build Back Better"" agenda.

""It will be one of the most significant legislative undertakings that any of us have ever been part of,"" Pelosi said.

The bill, which is still under negotiation in the U.S. Senate, will expand the social safety net and enact several climate policies supported by progressives. Originally intended to be a $3.5 trillion bill that included free college tuition, paid family leave, expanding Medicare and Medicaid, and much more, Democrats were forced to compromise because moderate lawmakers like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) are concerned about rising economic inflation.

Despite cuts to the bill, Pelosi asserted Friday that it will be bigger and more impactful than the Affordable Care Act, the transformative health care law enacted under President Barack Obama.

""So if you're talking about how we want to have immediate and enduring difference for the workers and families, creating jobs, securing middle class tax cuts, lowering costs for families, and making the wealthiest pay their fair share, all the while contributing to reducing the national debt,"" Pelosi said.

She then stopped speaking as someone else in the House apparently let out a guffaw.

""Did I hear a laugh over there?"" she asked.

""Did I hear a laugh from those who added $2 trillion in tax cuts for the richest people in America, 83% of it going to the top 1%?"" she fired back.

""This is paid for and more than paid for,"" she claimed.

In reality, the funding for this $1.75 trillion bill is a point of contention in the negotiations. Some Democrats want to add a massive tax cut for the wealthy into the bill by changing the cap on state and local tax deductions. These so-called SALT tax deductions were capped at $10,000 by the 2017 tax reform law passed under President Donald Trump.



House Democrats put forward a proposal last week to increase the SALT cap to $72,500 through 2031, which would lower government revenues by an estimated $50 billion per year through 2025.

Ironically, Pelosi claimed that the ""Build Back Better"" bill would not increase the deficit at the same time Democrats are arguing for a tax cut for the rich that would not be paid for. And she called out a Republican for apparently laughing at that contradiction.

Isn't that funny?

'People really listen whenever he speaks': Former drug dealer who served hard time now working to mentor at-risk youth in his community,"A Florida man who served two decades in prison for non-violent drug offenses is now working to keep young people in his community from following in his footsteps.

Hassan Hills, 42, of Pensacola, Florida, has begun a nonprofit called Youths Left Behind designed to support young people whose parents have been incarcerated.

""Out of all of the thousands of people in federal prison, I made it out,"" Hills said, ""and I always told myself that if I ever got out, I will come back to the communities that I once destroyed and try to build them from within by working with our young people.""

Hills says he knows how to help them because he was once among them.

""I myself was in the juvenile facility growing up, and when I went there, I saw the eyes of the children, the need for some mentorship,"" Hills said.

Hills' mom served time in a New Jersey prison for crack cocaine. When she was released and moved Hills and his siblings to Pensacola for a fresh start, Hills began selling drugs on his own to help his mother stay afloat.

""I had to do what I had to do in order to put food on the table and provide for me and my family,"" he said, according to Colin Warren-Hicks of the Pensacola News Journal. ""What started off as just something to provide for my family led to a heart of greed, and I got addicted ... What most people don't understand is that it's an addiction. The money, the fame, the adrenaline that you get, it's an addiction.""

In late 2001 when he was 20, after two felony convictions as a juvenile, Hills was found guilty of federal drug trafficking charges and sentenced to life in prison. Things looked bleak.

However, Hills was one of 330 prisoners who had their sentences commuted by former President Barack Obama before he left office. Then, when former President Donald Trump signed revisions to the Fair Sentencing Act, Hills qualified and applied for reduced sentencing.

His motion for early release was granted, and Hills was released on Feb. 5, 2021.

Shortly after his release, Hills reached out to the man who once worked hard to put him away: former police officer and current Escambia County Sheriff Chip Simmons. Hills wanted Simmons' help in establishing a mentorship problem for at-risk kids.

""He feels like he owes the community a debt, and he has set out to repay that debt,"" Simmons said. ""I'm glad to be able to help him in any way that I can, and I'm just super proud of him.""

Hills now spends much of his time volunteering at places like AMIkids Pensacola – Escambia Boys Base and the Academy of Growth and Development, meeting with mainly teenage boys who need strong guidance.

Together, he and Simmons often speak about the evils of drug trafficking and the importance of making good choices for the future.

""Our objective at Youths Left Behind is to aid and assist youth who've been affected by a parent, guardian or loved one caught up in the system of mass incarceration, drug addiction and to provide comprehensive mentorship,"" Hills said.

""People really listen whenever he speaks,"" Simmons said.

Pete Buttigieg's husband Chasten leads children in pledge of allegiance to LGBTQ flag,"A video clip of Chasten Buttigieg – the husband of Pete Buttigieg – leading children in a pledge to the LGBTQ flag has resurfaced and recently gone viral on social media.

Chasten was a guest counselor at the Iowa Safe Schools' Pride Camp in July 2019.

The husband of President Joe Biden's transportation secretary is seen on video leading children in a pledge to the rainbow flag – which is a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer pride.

Log Cabin Republicans of Richmond – the ""city's first and only group dedicated to representing LGBTQ conservatives and straight allies who support fairness, freedom, and equality for all Americans"" – shared the controversial clip on Twitter.

""I pledge my heart to the rainbow of the not-so-typical gay camp,"" Chasten says in the same cadence as when reciting the American Pledge of Allegiance. ""One camp, full of pride, indivisible, with affirmation and equal rights for all.""

Then Chasten waves the LGBTQ flag above the heads of the teens – who put their rights hands over their hearts in the same manner as when pledging allegiance to the United States of America.

Culture Catch – a website that covers music, literature, film, art, and theater – reported that Chasten also participated in an activity of dressing potatoes up as drag queens at the camp with the minors.



That stage also included Chasten's visit to an LGBTQI camp for teens where he revealed: ""I went to a high school of 1500 kids, and nobody was out. It was extremely unsafe to be out . . . . I didn't even know anybody who may have been remotely gay."" If only he had had someone like Mayor Pete running for political office back then, life would have been so much easier. The campers concurred, and then they all got out their potatoes for Drag-tato Day and let loose with the makeup on the spuds. Chasten, too.

The video clip is from the ""Mayor Pete"" documentary that was released by Amazon Prime in November 2021 and followed Pete Buttigieg's failed presidential run in 2020.

The synopsis of the documentary:

Directed by Jesse Moss, ""Mayor Pete"" will take viewers inside Buttigieg’s headline-generating campaign to be the youngest U.S. President, providing an unprecedented intimacy with the candidate, his husband Chasten, and their team. The Amazon Studios documentary will show the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. during the earliest days of the campaign, through his unlikely, triumphant victory in Iowa and beyond — revealing what goes on inside a campaign for the highest office in the land, and how it changes the lives of those involved in it.

The movie review website Slant – whose writers ""have appeared on MSNBC, BBC, CNN, and NPR, and have written for the New York Times, the Village Voice, the Notebook, Reverse Shot, the Brooklyn Rail, Time Out New York, and other prominent publications"" – wrote a review of the documentary with the headline: ""'Mayor Pete' Pledges Sycophantic Allegiance to Personality Over Politics.""

The review claims that the documentary provides a ""cognitively dissonant portrait of U.S. politics"" and ""the film's approach is completely subsumed by the importance of the Mayor Pete persona as the means and ends of the candidacy, and particularly the relevance of Buttigieg’s status as the first openly gay candidate seeking a major party's nomination."" The site gave ""Mayor Pete"" one and a half stars out of four.

""Mayor Pete"" has a 54% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 4.5 rating out of a possible 10 on IMDb.

Pete Buttigieg says taxing folks for every mile they drive is an option for funding infrastructure plan,"Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg suggested Friday that implementing a mileage tax on American drivers could be a possibility as the Biden administration considers ways to pay for their anticipated multi-trillion-dollar ""green"" infrastructure plan.

What are the details?

Buttigieg is calling for ""a generational investment in infrastructure,"" but has offered few details regarding how it might be financed, as the Associated Press noted earlier this week.

The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was asked about the possibility of a mileage tax as an option during an interview on CNBC, and he replied, ""So, I think that shows a lot of promise,"" explaining:

""If we believe in that so-called 'user pays principle' — the idea that part of how we pay for roads is you pay based on how much you drive — the gas tax used to be the obvious way to do it, it's not anymore. So a so-called Vehicle Miles Traveled tax or mileage tax, whatever you want to call it, could be a way to do it.""

Implementing a mileage tax would involve installing every vehicle on the roadway with a distance-tracking device, which raises both privacy and tampering concerns.

Proponents of such a plan argue that it is more fair than a fuel tax because even electric cars are taxed under the scheme. But such a tax hits the poor the hardest, and opponents from both right and left came out swinging against Buttigieg to make that point.

""Truly brilliant way to completely screw over lower income and middle class Americans!"" Meghan McCain, co-host of ""The View,"" tweeted. ""And every single person living in a rural area who has to drive far to get places! Just brilliant Pete, truly.""



Fox News host Laura Ingraham said of Buttigieg's comments, ""Once again, Biden & Secretary 'Pete' hurting the poor and middle class most with 'miles travelled' tax.""

Progressive journalist Walker Bragman tweeted, ""We should be 'funding' public infrastructure by taxing the wealthiest Americans. Pete Buttigieg's first big idea as transportation secretary is funding it with a mileage tax, which basically means people who use the roads more pay more. Regressive McKinsey brain.""

Someone else argued, ""I don't think he's thought this out very well. Housing costs in Nashville is causing ppl to move miles away to find affordable housing. This would hit those who could ill afford it hard as there is NO public transportation to take advantage of. This would hit rural areas hard.""

But the transportation secretary had some defenders. One person tweeted, ""Excellent idea! The more you drive, the more you pay. Seems like a fair proposal to me. The haters don't have an alternative and they'd rather see China racing us by apparently...""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pete-buttigieg-says-taxing-folks-for-every-mile-they-drive-is-option-for-funding-infrastructure-plan,2021-03-26
Peter Doocy leaves new WH press secretary stumped with single question he is forced to ask three times,"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy left White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stumbling on her first official day behind the lectern after Jen Psaki's departure.

The topic? Inflation and President Joe Biden's claim that raising corporate taxes will help the ongoing economic crisis.

What happened?

Referring to a tweet that Biden published last week, Doocy lobbed a softball question at Jean-Pierre, ""How does raising taxes on corporations reduce inflation?""

But the new press secretary appeared unaware that such a tweet from Biden existed, asking if Doocy was, in fact, referring to a specific tweet.

When Doocy informed her that Biden's official Twitter account made such a connection between corporate taxes and inflation last week, Jean-Pierre stumbled her way through recycling Democratic talking points about taxes and corporations paying their ""fair share.""

Look, you know, we have talked about — we have talked about this this past year, about making sure that the wealthiest among us are paying their fair share. And that is important to do. And that is something that, you know, the president has been, you know, working on every day when we talk about inflation and lowering costs. And so it’s very important that, you know, as we’re seeing costs rise, as we’re talking about how to, you know — you know, build an America that is safe, that’s equal for everyone, and doesn’t leave anyone behind, that is an important part of that as well.

05/16/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Because Jean-Pierre did not answer the question, Doocy then asked again, ""But how does raising taxes on corporations lower the cost of gas, the cost of a used car, the cost of food for everyday Americans?""

This time Jean-Pierre invoked climate change and collective bargaining rights while injecting several mentions of a ""fairer tax code,"" but she still did not answer the question.

""Look, it is — you know, by not — if — without having a fairer tax code, which is what I’m talking about, then all — every — like manufacturing workers, cops — you know, it’s not fair for them to have to pay higher taxes than the folks that — who are — who are — who are not paying taxes at all or barely have,"" Jean-Pierre added.

Doocy then asked his question a third time and included criticism from Jeff Bezos. But Jean-Pierre, again, refused to answer the question and instead attacked Bezos and regurgitated debunked talking points about deficit reduction.

""It’s not a huge mystery why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth — right? — opposes an economic agenda that is for the middle class, that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul — right? — and that’s what we’re talking about; that’s why we’re talking about lowering inflation here — and adds to the historic deficit reduction the president is achieving by asking the richest taxpayers and corporations to pay their fair share. That is what we’re talking about,"" she said.

Anything else?

Larry Summers, who has been highly critical of the Biden administration amid the inflation crisis, explained Monday that he actually agrees with Biden that hiking corporate taxes would positively impact inflation.

""I think @JeffBezos is mostly wrong in his recent attack on the @JoeBiden Admin,"" Summers declared. ""It is perfectly reasonable to believe, as I do and @POTUS asserts, that we should raise taxes to reduce demand to contain inflation and that the increases should be as progressive as possible.""

He added, ""I say this even though I have argued vigorously that excessively expansionary macro policy from the @federalreserve and the government have contributed to inflation. I have rejected rhetoric about inflation caused by corporate gouging as preposterous.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-stumps-jean-pierre-inflation,2022-05-17
Piers Morgan calls to end ‘trans sport insanity’ before it ends up killing women,"British commentator and former CNN host Piers Morgan castigated the idea of biological males competing in women's sports as transgender women after a special forces combat veteran demolished a biologically female MMA fighter during a Friday match.

What are the details?

In a blistering op-ed published in the Daily Mail, Morgan pointed to Friday's fight in which transgender fighter Alana McLaughlin, 38, used a ""powerful chokehold"" on a fellow MMA fighter who happened to be a biological female.

McLaughlin, a special forces combat veteran, defeated 32-year-old Celine Provost after placing her in a match-winning chokehold on Friday. The Friday match was McLaughlin's debut as a MMA fighter. McLaughlin easily ended the fight just three minutes and 32 seconds into the second round.

""It made me sick to watch a once-male special forces combat veteran beat up a woman on TV,"" he wrote. ""It's time to stop this trans sport insanity before women start being killed.""

McLaughlin, who took up MMA training earlier in 2021, fought against Provost, who has competed in the extreme sport for at least a decade, but as Morgan pointed out, Provost simply ""couldn't compete with the overwhelming physical strength of her opponent.""

Instead, Provost was barely able to leave a mark on McLaughlin, who was once a muscle-bound special forces operative.

""At this point let me be clear: McLaughlin was a war hero, rising through Army ranks to become a special forces medical sergeant who went to serve in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of an elite, 12-man team,"" Morgan wrote. ""There, she helped save many lives as she treated IED casualties in a highly dangerous combat zone. I have huge respect for her military service, during which she was awarded eight distinguished service medals.""

A conflicted history

McLaughlin, who grew up in South Carolina, has said that her mother — who had a strongly religious background — disowned McLaughlin once she heard that her son would soon be her daughter.

She told the Guardian in a Wednesday interview that a neighbor's son raped her when she was just 5 years old after having been subjected to what she referred to as ""masculine time"" with the neighbor's sons.

In the years following the incident, McLaughlin's family reportedly sent her to various conversion therapies to change her outlook on sexuality and gender. It didn't take, McLaughlin said, and she ended up begging her parents for gender reassignment surgery from a young age.

Before shipping out to Afghanistan, McLaughlin told her mother during a particularly heated phone call, ""Maybe I should just go get myself killed at war.""

McLaughlin's mother reportedly snapped, ""Maybe you should.""

Elsewhere in the interview, McLaughlin said, ""My whole life I was a runt. I was undersized, I was bullied, I was raped, I was beaten, like I did not have an easy time. The story of my life has been trying to physically resist people that were larger and stronger and more skilled than me.""

'Sickening to watch'

Morgan continued, ""Regardless of her military record or personal struggles growing up, none of this justifies what happened on Friday night. I found the bout sickening to watch.""

""It was obvious very quickly that McLaughlin was too strong, and equally obvious that this strength came from the 33 years she spent as a biological man,"" Morgan continued. ""As I've said before, the restrictive hormone treatment that sports authorities make transgender women do before they can compete in women's sport does not reduce muscle density or power.""

Calling the disparity ""potentially deadly,"" Morgan added that such practices would end up killing women one day.

Morgan, who added that he's always supported trans rights to fairness and equality, said that while transgender men and women deserve fair treatment across the board, allowing mixed biological sexes to compete against one another in contact sports such as MMA will only lead to danger for biological women.

""If you're in any doubt about how unfair this all is, let me take you through a brief history of what's happened when male athletes have transitioned to be women and then competed against women born with female bodies,"" he wrote. ""In 2017, American sprinter CeCe Telfer was ranked 390th among male NCAA Division II athletes in 400m hurdles. In 2018, Telfer transitioned, and in 2019, Telfer was national NCAA Division II women's 400m champion.""

He also pointed to New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, who qualified for women's tournaments and in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Hannah Mouncey, an Australian handball player who dominated on the country's women's team after scoring zero goals in 22 appearances for the men's team, and more as examples of unfairness in competition.

""We've already seen the same unfairness manifest itself with the first transgender MMA fighter, Fallon Fox, who served in the US Navy then transitioned, became an MMA fighter, and won all but one fights,"" Morgan noted. ""In one of them, she fractured a woman's skull. I fear worse is to come.""

""[McLaughlin is] a girl born with the massive physical advantage of a male body,"" Morgan concluded. ""Yet now she's deliberately participating in a grotesquely unbalanced physical environment for other women. It's unfair, unequal, and in the case of combat sport, incredibly dangerous. But the real crime going on here is against women's sport.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/piers-morgan-calls-to-end-trans-sport-insanity-before-it-ends-up-killing-women,2021-09-13
Police forces struggle to recruit as crime continues to rise,"As major cities across the country are seeing staggering rises in crime rates, those same cities are facing unprecedented difficulty in recruiting police officers to combat the surge of criminal activity.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, while non-violent crime decreased during the pandemic, the murder rate rose nearly 30% in 2020 and the rate of assaults went up 10%.

Nearly every big city in America has a similar story. According to NYPD statistics, crime in New York City increased by 30.5% between July 2021 and July 2022.

And while Americans are reeling from violent crime spikes, police departments are struggling to fill their ranks. The Associated Press reports that Los Angeles is down more than 650 officers from its pre-pandemic levels. Seattle recently announced $2 million in hiring bonuses and benefits to entice recruits.

“We’re getting more calls for service and there are fewer people to answer them,” said Philadelphia Police spokesperson Eric Gripp. “This isn’t just an issue in Philadelphia. Departments all over are down and recruitment has been difficult.”

Experts are uncertain of what is driving the current trend in crime rates, though many point to the social disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts have, however, shot down one popular theory about rising crime rates. According to the AP, widely cited theories that “violent crime is worse in places that changed policing tactics in the wake of protests over Floyd’s murder don’t bear out.” Violent crime has increased in communities of all political affiliations, regardless of their approach to policing.

Whatever the cause, the issues are not just limited to big cities; even small-town American is feeling the pain. “We’re trying to get out to certain job fairs and recruitment days … we’re eight people down so trying to find a qualified candidate is very hard right now,” said Lt. Robert Marra of the Vernon Police Department in Connecticut.

Many police officers have reached a breaking point regarding the current situation. Recently, police officers and other officials in the town of Kenly, North Carolina, submitted mass resignation letters, citing stress, a hostile work environment, and an inability to continue the department's long-term betterment projects.

This affects response times. “You may be lucky if you get an officer two, three, four hours down the line,"" John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-forces-struggle-to-recruit-as-crime-continues-to-rise,2022-08-09
Police officer who was filmed pepper-spraying a black Army officer after holding him at gunpoint loses his job,"A Windsor, Virginia, police officer is out of a job after he was filmed pepper-spraying a uniformed black Army officer after he held him at gunpoint.

What's a brief history here?

The incident took place during a December traffic stop that took place at what appeared to be an area gas station.

Following the incident, 2nd Lt. Caron Nazario sued two Virginia police officers for violating his rights, and Gov. Ralph Northam (D) called for an independent investigation into the cops' treatment of the military officer.

What are the details?

According to a Monday report from Insider, former Officer Joe Gutierrez — one of two law enforcement officials on the scene — lost his job in connection with the incident.

In his lawsuit, Nazario said that Gutierrez and Officer Daniel Crocker violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights during the incident, which saw the officers scream at him to exit his vehicle, point their guns at him, pepper-spray him, and knock him to the ground.

In bodycam footage, Nazario can be heard saying that he is ""honestly afraid"" to get out of his car.

Gutierrez responds, ""Yeah, you should be.""

After Nazario fails to open his door and exit the vehicle, Gutierrez pepper-sprays Nazario.

AP News reported that the Town of Windsor said in a statement that it ""joined calls from election officials, including Gov. Ralph Northam, in requesting an investigation by Virginia State Police into the December 2020 encounter"" in which two Windsor officers were accused of drawing their service weapons, pointing them at Nazario, and ""using a slang term to suggest he was facing execution.""

It is not known at the time of this writing whether Crocker has, or will, face suspension or termination.

What else?

In an incident report, Crocker wrote that he believed Nazario was ""eluding police"" and considered the incident to be a ""high-risk traffic stop.""

Crocker had radioed he was pulling Nazario's vehicle over for not having a license plate, but his bodycam showed there was a cardboard license plate typically used on new cars posted in the rear window.

Attorney Jonathan Arthur told the Associated Press that Nazario was not attempting to elude the officer, but was trying to stop his vehicle at a well-lit location.

In a Sunday statement, Windsor officials said that an internal investigation was launched at the time into the use of force and that it had determined that department policy was not followed.

Officials said that disciplinary action was taken and Gutierrez had since been fired.

""The Town of Windsor prides itself in its small-town charm and the community-wide respect of its police department,"" the statement said. ""Due to this, we are saddened for events like this to cast our community in a negative light. Rather than deflect criticism, we have addressed these matters with our personnel administratively, we are reaching out to community stakeholders to engage in dialogue, and commit ourselves to additional discussions in the future.""

In a Saturday statement, Northam said, ""Our commonwealth has done important work on police reform, but we must keep working to ensure Virginians are safe during interactions with police, the enforcement of laws is fair and equitable, and people are held accountable.""

Polish Pastor Artur Pawlowski kicks out inspector and police,"Pastor Artur Pawlowski went viral earlier this month for kicking a health inspector and police out of his church in Alberta, Canada. He infamously screaming at them, ""Out of this property you Nazis! Gestapo is not allowed here! Out, Nazi! Out! Nazis are not welcome here! Do not come back here you Nazi psychopaths!"" Pawlowski, who became known worldwide as the ""Polish pastor,"" kicked out a health inspector and a group of Calgary police officers again when they came to his church on Saturday to confront him over COVID-19 restrictions.

""And they did it again! Today, the Gestapo Attacked our Church Again,"" Pawlowski wrote on Twitter about the latest harassment by Canadian authorities. ""History is being repeated in front of our eyes! Another sad day for Freedom and democracy!""

Pawlowski shared a video of the tense confrontation with law enforcement in Canada where he stood his ground once again. The public health inspector hands Pawlowski a court order that she claims grants them access into the church, but he immediately responds, ""I'm not really interested in what you have to say.""

""I do not cooperate with Gestapo,"" Pawlowski tells the health inspector. ""I do not talk to the Nazis. You came in your uniforms like thugs. That's what you are. Brownshirts of Adolf Hitler. You are Nazi Gestapo, communist, fascists. I do not cooperate with Nazis. Talk to my lawyer. You are not allowed here, you are not welcomed here, and I'm not going to cooperate with Gestapo like you, okay? So is that fair enough for you?""

""You see, this is what the Gestapo is doing,"" the Polish pastor says. ""You're coming to the place of worship to intimidate and to harass.""

Then Pawlowski informs the health inspector that they can make an appointment for another day when there are no church services.

The Polish pastor then launches into a loud rant, and labels the police as ""Gestapo"" again as he did in the first incident that was recorded on video and garnered millions of views on social media websites.

""You are sick, that's what you are!"" Pawlowski screamed at the police, who he described as ""wicked evil people."" ""And rightfully so you change your uniforms to black, because you are exactly acting like the Gestapo of old.""

""If Canadians will not rise up and stand up, if they will not come to their senses while there is still time, while there is a time to wake up and push this evil, there will be absolutely no, no rights whatsoever,"" Pawlowski continued. ""If they can get away with this, they're going to come anywhere else.""

""And, you know, that's what people do not understand,"" Pawlowski, who was originally from Poland and is determined to warn the world about the dangers of authoritarian governments, said ""They think that this is some kind of a game. Do you think they are here for your health, seriously?""

""They could come any day of the week,"" he continued after the police departed. ""No, they want to do it during the church service because they have a purpose, they have an agenda. If you're not seeing it then you're plain either stupid, blind, and deaf.""

""Either you're going to keep pushing as hard as you can or you'll be swallowed by those people,"" Pawlowski said. ""They're going to keep coming, keep taking your rights, one after another. Destroying you by thousands of cuts. One cut at a time.""

Pawlowski, who has refused to stop church services during the pandemic, called the second visit by Canadian authorities ""sickening.""

Just 61% of Dems think US is the greatest nation,"A Wall Street Journal poll of registered voters found that while a huge proportion of Republicans think that the U.S. is the greatest nation on earth and that individuals who work diligently will probably get ahead in America, a much smaller proportion of Democrats hold those views.

A whopping 91% of Republicans agree that the U.S. is the greatest nation, but just 61% of Democrats share that sentiment.

And while 85% of Republicans believe that hard workers will likely get ahead in the U.S., just 53% of Democrats hold that view.

But while 55% of Democrats believe that the present generation will do better than the preceding generation, just 34% of Republicans have that opinion.

Among Republicans, 61% often feel as though they are the individuals who elites in the U.S. look down on, but only 40% of Democrats share that sentiment.

The poll was carried out last month from August 17-25 by Impact Research and Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, according to the outlet.

""People who complain about not getting ahead often aren't willing to put the time and effort in, and they're looking for the easy way out,"" GOP poll participant Melinda O'Neil said, according to the Journal. ""You can’t expect people to give you things,"" she noted. ""You have to earn it. A lot of that is just showing up.""

""There are so many socioeconomic differences in the country,"" said Chelsea Carter, a Democrat who took part in the poll. ""It really depends where you were born on the strata,"" she said. ""When you really look at what has given you a leg up, it is people who were able to support and supplement my life in a way that isn't fair,"" she remarked, pointing to how she had the opportunity to go to private college and get assistance with student loans from her parents.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-democrats-america-greatest-nation,2022-09-22
"Poll: Most Americans think MLB and other corporations shouldn't go woke, support Georgia voting law","Findings from a new poll suggest Major League Baseball's decision to pull the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta is not popular with Americans and that when informed about Georgia's new election laws, most people actually support the reforms.

The survey, commissioned by The Daily Wire in partnership with SurveyMonkey, interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,026 Americans. It found that 64% of respondents, including self-identified baseball fans, Delta Air Lines customers, and Coca-Cola buyers, said they are ""less likely to support"" companies and organizations that are outspoken about political controversies.

An overwhelming majority of 70% of respondents agreed with the statement: ""Corporations and sports teams should generally stay out of politics.""

MLB generated controversy last week when it announced it would move the annual All-Star Game out of Atlanta in protest of new election reforms signed into law by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R). Critics of the Georgia law, which requires voters to submit identification with absentee ballots along with other provisions that expand early voting, have claimed it will suppress the minority vote and compared it to racist ""Jim Crow"" laws previously enacted in the segregationist South.

Many false claims were made about the reforms before they became law, which prompted major corporations like Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola to speak out against the bill.

The Daily Wire polled Americans on provisions of Georgia's new election laws (using paraphrased descriptions of the law from news reports) and found that several are actually popular.

A full 78% of respondents, including a majority of self-identified Democrats, MLB fans, non-white Americans, and all age groups support Georgia's voter ID requirements for absentee voting. And 63% of respondents, including 48% of Democrats, support restrictions on providing gifts, including refreshments, to voters near polling stations and waiting in line to vote. Another 67% of respondents, including a majority of Democrats and minorities, support Georgia's new regulations on ballot drop boxes.

According to the poll, support for the Georgia law grew significantly after respondents were informed about what it actually does. At first, 42% of respondents said they supported Georgia's elections laws while 38% said they were opposed. After reading summaries of the law's provisions, 71% of respondents said they were ""more supportive"" of the election reforms.

Additionally, support for MLB's decision fell after people learned what Georgia's law does.

While at first 55% of Americans said they support MLB's decision to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, over half — 54% — said they were ""less supportive"" of the league's decision after becoming informed about the Georgia law.

The poll's results also suggest there is eroding trust in the media.

The poll found 58% of respondents, including a majority of MLB fans, said politicians and some in the media are negatively exaggerating about the Georgia law. And 42% said politicians and reporters were ""being fair and accurate"" with their criticisms.

Lastly, most Americans said MLB's motives for moving the All-Star Game were driven by ""politics and publicity,"" rather than sincerely held beliefs about the right to vote, as MLB claimed. The poll found 67% of respondents, including nearly half of those who initially supported the league's decision, said the league's motivation was based on ""politics and publicity"" rather than a ""genuine concern for voters in Georgia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-most-americans-think-mlb-and-other-corporations-shouldnt-go-woke-support-georgia-voting-law,2021-04-07
Poll: Only 16% of Americans say US democracy is working,"Most Americans are feeling pessimistic about the state of democracy in their country, according to a new poll conducted by the Associated Press.

Only 16% of Americans surveyed said that democracy is working well or extremely well in the United States, a sentiment shared by individuals of all political persuasions. Almost half of Americans, 45%, think that democracy isn't functioning properly. A little more than a third, 38%, say democracy is working only somewhat well.

According to the Associated Press, the poll's findings are ""broadly consistent with how Americans graded democracy before the election,"" however there was a noticeable partisan swing in views about democracy since the 2020 election.

Last October, 68% of self-identified Republicans said democracy was working at least somewhat well. After the election, though, only 36% of Republicans felt that way. Conversely, in October, just 37% of Democrats believed democracy was working at least somewhat well, but after Joe Biden won the election, that number increased to 70%.

In other words, when Donald Trump was president, most Republicans believed democracy was at least partially working, while most Democrats disagreed, and after Joe Biden won, most Republicans thought democracy wasn't working, but Democrats were more optimistic.

Roughly two-thirds of Americans say Joe Biden is the legitimately elected president, but only one-third of Republicans believe the election was legitimate, according to the survey.

The Associated Press report blames former President Donald Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen for at least in part eroding Republicans trust in the election:

But Democrats and the mainstream media are not without blame either.

In the wake of the 2016 election and Trump's surprise win, many Democrats advanced claims that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton. The mainstream media in 2017 spread a misleading story that ""Russian government cyber actors"" attempted to hack the 2016 election results. A poll conducted in 2018 found that 67% of Democrats believed that ""Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald Trump elected."" Further, the 2018 Georgia Democratic candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams, never conceded the election to her Republican opponent Brian Kemp, the legitimately elected governor, whom Abrams accused of engaging in voter suppression tactics to win.

Both political parties have criticized the electoral system in America when it was politically convenient to do so. Perhaps that's why so many Americans have doubts about their democracy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-only-16-of-americans-say-u-s-democracy-is-working,2021-02-08
"Republicans lack confidence in election officials, new poll","Nearly half of Republican voters see a time coming where Americans will ""have take the law into their own hands,"" according to a new poll. The new poll also punctuates a lack of election confidence and the stark differences between Republicans and Democrats as to what are the most important issues at the current moment.

The new George Washington University poll conducted by YouGov between June 4 and June 23 asked 1,753 registered voters if a time will come when ""patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands."" The poll found that 47% of Republicans agreed that there would be a time when patriotic Americans will have to take the law into their own hands. Only 9% of Democrats foresaw a situation in the country where they would need to take the law into their own hands.

The concerning poll also discovered that 55% of Republicans supported the possible use of force to preserve the ""traditional American way of life,"" compared to 15% of Democrats.

The YouGov poll results showed only 44% of Republicans have a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust in their state election administrators, versus 76% of Democrats. In states that Biden won in the 2020 election, a paltry 24% of Republicans have trust in their state election administrators. In states where Biden won, Democrats have a whoppinig 95% trust in state election officials.

The GW Politics poll found that a mere 20% of Republicans were confident in the 2020 election results, while 90% of Democrats believe the 2020 presidential election results. When asked about their confidence in the 2022 midterm elections, a startling 28% of Republicans were confident, way down from the same question before the 2020 election where 46% of Republicans were confident.

The survey found that 82% of Republicans agreed with the statement: ""It is hard to trust the results of elections when so many people will vote for anyone who offers a handout.""

The poll also highlighted the vast differences in what issues Democrats prioritize versus what Republicans see as pressing matters.



61% of Republicans and 94% of Democrats see addressing the pandemic as very or somewhat important

43% of Republicans and 92% of Democrats say addressing race in this country is very or somewhat important

Poll shows strong support for voter ID and easier early voting,"A strong majority of Americans continues to support voter ID requirements even as Democrats and mainstream media reports attack Republican-led efforts to strengthen voter ID laws as ""voter suppression,"" according to a new poll.

On Monday, Monmouth University published the results of a survey that shows an overwhelming 80% of Americans support requiring voters to show a photo I.D. in order to vote.

The poll also found that most Americans support easier access to early voting. Americans are divided on expanding vote-by-mail, though a majority would support establishing federal guidelines for both mail-in voting and voting early.

From Monmouth:

A large majority (71%) of the public feels in-person early voting should generally be made easier. Just 16% say it should be made harder. Opinion is more divided on voting by mail – 50% say this should be made easier and 39% say it should be made harder. At the same time, fully 4 in 5 Americans (80%) support requiring voters to show photo identification in order to cast a ballot. Just 18% oppose this.



Easing in-person early voting access and requiring photo IDs both have bipartisan majority support. Approval of making early voting easier stands at 89% among Democrats, 68% among independents, and 56% among Republicans. Support for requiring a photo ID to vote stands at 62% among Democrats, 87% among independents, and 91% among Republicans. Only Democrats back making voting by mail easier to do, with 84% supporting this idea compared to just 40% of independents and 26% of Republicans.



More than 2 in 3 Americans (69%) support establishing national guidelines to allow vote-by-mail and in-person early voting in federal elections in every state. Just 25% oppose this idea. Support for establishing national voting guidelines on these issues comes from 92% of Democrats, 63% of independents, and 51% of Republicans.

""The poll contains some seemingly conflicting information on voter access. The bottom line seems to be that most Democrats and Republicans want to take the potential for election results to be questioned off the table. The problem, though, is they aren't likely to agree on how to get there,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

In recent months after the 2020 presidential election, which was unsuccessfully contested by former President Donald Trump, several Republican-controlled legislatures in various states have attempted to pass controversial laws they say would strengthen election security. Georgia, Florida, and Texas have each adopted high profile election reforms that critics say are partisan efforts intended to restrict the ability of non-white voters from accessing the ballot. Some Democrats and media pundits have gone so far as accusing Republicans in these states of implementing ""Jim Crow 2.0.""

Republicans counter that the unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots requested last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic had created a possibility for voter fraud and say new laws are necessary to protect the integrity of U.S. elections at a time when many Americans believe fraud was conducted.

Despite harsh media criticism, several of the measures implemented into law by Republican states are actually popular. The maligned Georgia law, for example, expanded early voting in the state and created a requirement for mail-in ballots to be accompanied with a form of photo I.D.

The controversy over election integrity has been inflamed by Trump's repeated claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent and that President Joe Biden's victory in several states was illegitimate. The Monmouth poll found that nearly one-third of survey respondents believe that Biden won due to voter fraud, while a majority of 61% of Americans think the election was fair and square.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone June 9-14, with 810 adults in the United States. The question results have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-shows-strong-support-for-voter-id-and-easier-early-voting,2021-06-21
"Pope Francis directly addresses Joe Biden's abortion position, says it contradicts Catholic teaching","Pope Francis implicitly criticized President Joe Biden this week for holding a position on abortion that contradicts church teaching and orthodox Christian theology.

Biden supports abortion rights despite being a professed Catholic. Teaching in the Catholic Church strongly condemns abortion, drawing from Christian tradition and instruction that dates back to the first century A.D.

What did Francis say?

Speaking with Univision in an extensive interview, Pope Francis questioned the morality of abortion and stated his position on the issue is ""nonnegotiable.""

""Is it fair to take a human life to solve a problem? Whatever it is? Is it fair to hire a hit man to eliminate a human life?"" Francis questioned.

Responding directly to the pro-abortion views of Catholics, Francis cautioned that clergy should not become overly involved in politics, but said Catholics who support abortion, like Biden, are holding an ""incoherencia,"" an inconsistent and contradictory view.

""I leave it to [President Biden's] conscience and that he speaks to his bishop, his pastor, his parish priest about that incoherencia,"" Francis said of Biden.

After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Biden blasted the decision as an ""extreme"" decision and miscarriage of justice.

What has Francis said before?

The issue of Catholic politicians supporting abortion reached a fever pitch two months after San Fransisco Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone barred House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from receiving Holy Communion in her home parish because she supports abortion.

Last September, the pontiff addressed the issue, stating explicitly that Holy Communion is reserved for church members ""in the community"" — and those who support abortion are ""out of the community.""

""This is the theology,"" Francis said. ""Then, those who are not in the community, cannot receive communion. ... Out of the community: Excommunicated, it’s a harsh word, but they don’t belong in the community, because they were not baptized, or because they are estranged from it.""

""Those people who are not in the community cannot take communion, because they are out of the community,"" he explained. ""It is not a punishment: Communion is linked to the community.""

Still, neither the Catholic bishop in Washington, D.C., nor the bishop in Biden's home parish in Delaware have barred him from communion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pope-francis-addresses-joe-biden-abortion,2022-07-14
Preschool teacher fired for OnlyFans content exposed by Lobs of TikTok,"A Massachusetts preschool teacher was reportedly fired from her job after the Libs of TikTok account revealed that she filmed adult content for OnlyFans in a school bathroom.

Preschool teacher Brenna Percy was allegedly fired this week after a topless photo was exposed by the Libs of TikTok account. The photo was allegedly taken in a bathroom at the Wolf Swamp Road School in Longmeadow, Massachusetts. Percy reportedly took the nude photo for OnlyFans — a subscription website on which users can pay to view adult content.

A photo purportedly shows Percy inside a school bathroom with her shirt lifted up and her chest revealed. The photo has a caption that reads: ""Naughty at work."" The photo also has a shushing face emoji.



Someone from Libs of TikTok contacted school officials about the adult content filmed on school grounds.

After seeing the nude photo, a school secretary allegedly told Libs of TikTok, ""My jaw is on my desk.""

On Wednesday, the school superintendent said Percy ""no longer works for Longmeadow Public Schools.""

Percy is no longer listed in the faculty section of the Wolf Swamp Road School website.

In November, two Arizona teachers were canned from their teaching jobs after filming pornographic content on school grounds.

Married couple Samantha and Dillon Peer were fired for posting adult content on OnlyFans. Some of the sexually explicit material was recorded in Samantha's middle school classroom.

Samantha said she was forced to start an OnlyFans account because the couple could not support two children on their teachers' salaries.

""My children are the most important thing to me, and I'm already spending countless hours outside of my contract time on extra school activities, and I don't think it's fair that I have to sacrifice my own children's time because our professional salary did not pay enough,"" Samantha wrote on social media.

Samantha had her OnlyFans account suspended, according to Fox News. OnlyFans prohibits sexual content from being filmed in public places. Publishing adult content recorded in public places can result in a permanent ban from OnlyFans.

Biden says battling inflation is his chief economic priority,"As Americans continue to get soaked by soaring inflation, President Joe Biden continues to describe inflation as his number one economic priority.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data on Friday which shows that inflation continues to fly high.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.0 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in April,"" according to the BLS. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.""

""The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981,"" the report said.

Americans have been facing skyrocketing gas prices — as of Friday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas has reached $4.986.

During a speech at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday, Biden reiterated that combatting inflation is his ""top economic priority.""

The White House has been pointing toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine as one of the main culprit's behind high inflation, and during his speech on Friday, Biden continued that practice by making a comment about Russian President Vladimir ""Putin's tax on both food and gas.""

President Biden Delivers Remarks at the Port of Los Angeles youtu.be

Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, and the U.S. has banned the importation of Russian oil and other products.

""I call on Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month, and get it to my desk, so we can lower the price of goods,"" Biden said in a statement about the consumer price index on Friday. ""And, I call on Congress to pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and complement the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring inflation down.""



Roaring inflation, which has been dramatically eroding the purchasing power of Americans' money, could pose a serious problem for Democrats during the 2022 election cycle.



A Trafalgar Group survey of likely general election voters found that 59.9% thought that the president's ""policies and spending"" are the top causes for increasing inflation in America, compared to 31.6% who viewed the Russian conflict with Ukraine as the chief reason for rising inflation.

President Jimmy Carter blasts election integrity bills backed by Georgia Republicans,"Former President Jimmy Carter is speaking out against efforts by Georgia Republicans to restrict absentee voting and introduce other election reforms in the wake of the controversial 2020 election.

On Monday, the Georgia Senate passed sweeping legislation ending no-excuse absentee voting and limiting weekend voting. The state legislature is also considering measures that would strengthen voter ID requirements for absentee voters, limit the number of available ballot drop boxes and require those drop boxes to be inside early voting locations, ban nonprofits from funding elections, and more.

Democrats are opposed to these policies, accusing Republicans of using false claims about election fraud as a pretext to pass laws that will make it harder for minorities and other disadvantaged classes of people to vote. Republicans counter that these laws would ensure safe, fair, and free elections and would restore confidence in the integrity of Georgia elections after former President Donald Trump and his legal team claimed there was a ""national conspiracy"" of voter fraud and the election in Georgia, which Joe Biden won, was illegitimate.

Carter, who was president from 1977 to 1981, expressed his disappointment in the Republican efforts in a statement released Tuesday.



""While states must safeguard the integrity of the election process to prevent fraud, this should not be at the expense of voters' access to the polls,"" Carter said.

""Now, as our state legislators seek to turn back the clock through legislation that will restrict access to voting for many Georgians, I am disheartened, saddened, and angry,"" he continued. ""Many of the proposed changes are reactions to allegations of fraud for which no evidence was produced—allegations that were, in fact, refuted through various audits, recounts, and other measures. The proposed changes appear to be rooted in partisan interests, not in the interests of all Georgia voters.""

He further criticized arguments from Republicans that ""selectively referenced a report prepared by a 2005 commission that I co-chaired with former Secretary of State James Baker."" The report examined mail-in voting practices and recommended that more studies be done before voting by mail was adopted universally, citing some concerns about bad practices.

""In the 16 years since the report's release, vote-by-mail practices have progressed significantly as new technologies have been developed,"" Carter said. ""In light of these advances, I believe that voting by mail can be conducted in a manner that ensures election integrity. This is just one of several ways to expand access to the voting process for voters across the state, regardless of political affiliation.

""We must not promote confidence among one segment of the electorate by restricting the participation of others,"" he said in conclusion.

The Georgia bill passed Monday restricts absentee voting to senior citizens over age 65, those who have a physical disability, or those who are out of town on Election Day. The bill would also require absentee voters to present a driver's license or other form of valid ID to receive their ballot. If signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp (R), the law would effectively repeal a 2005 law supported by Republicans that permitted no-excuse absentee voting in Georgia.

About 5 million voters turned out in Georgia in the 2020 election, with approximately 1.3 million people voting remotely. President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by 12,000 votes. The state conducted two recounts and several audits confirming Biden's victory.

Republicans in other states are advancing similar legislation. In Iowa on Monday, Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed into law a measure backed by state Republicans that would shorten the early voting period from 29 to 20 days and close the polls one hour earlier on Election Day, from 9 p.m. to 8 p.m.

""It's our duty and responsibility to protect the integrity of every election,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""This legislation strengthens uniformity by providing Iowa's election officials with consistent parameters for Election Day, absentee voting, database maintenance, as well as other clear appeals process for local county auditors.""

"WH press secretary confronted over Biden's travel ban hypocrisy, dodges question","As President Joe Biden moves to impose new coronavirus-related travel restrictions, some are noting the president's apparent hypocrisy considering that he called former President Donald Trump's travel restrictions ""xenophobic.""

President Biden on Monday will formally reinstate COVID-19 travel restrictions on non-U.S. travelers from Brazil, Ireland, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and 26 other European countries. On Sunday, Reuters reported that South Africa would be added to the list of restricted countries because of concerns over a new variant of COVID-19 that has appeared in that country.



The new executive orders reverse a Jan. 18 decision by former President Trump to lift the restrictions on Brazil and Europe. It also appears to reverse a position previously held by Biden on Trump's travel restrictions.

In February 2020, when Trump introduced bans on travel from China and six African countries as a safety measure against the spread of coronavirus, then-candidate Biden criticized the policy as ""xenophobia"" and ""fear-mongering.""

During Monday's White House press briefing, Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked the president's press secretary, Jen Psaki, about the travel ban and Biden's apparent change of position.

""When President Trump was imposing travel restrictions in March, specifically on China, then-candidate Biden called it 'xenophobic' and 'fear-mongering.' Now President Biden is putting travel restrictions on people coming in from other countries, what word do we use to describe that?"" Doocy asked.

""I don't think that's quite a fair articulation,"" Psaki dodged. Redirecting the question, she said that Biden felt Trump's ban on travel from some foreign countries with majority-Muslim populations that were previously designated by the Obama administration as ""areas of concern"" for terrorism was ""xenophobic.""

""The president has been clear that he felt the Muslim Ban was xenophobic. He overturned the Muslim ban. He also though has supported ... travel restrictions in order to keep the American people safe to ensure that we are getting the pandemic under control. That's been part of his policy,"" Psaki said. ""But he was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time and more recently the importance of having a multi-faceted approach.""

Psaki of course failed to address Doocy's question, which was specifically about Biden's previous response to Trump's travel restrictions on China. Doocy did not ask about the so-called ""Muslim ban.""

Members of the Biden administration weren't the only ones to change their tune on coronavirus travel bans. The mainstream media, as documented by Hot Air's Jazz Shaw, is covering the two presidents very differently.

A headline from NBC News, for example, stated: ""Biden to reinstate Covid travel restrictions Trump rescinded, impose new ban on South Africa.""

Last February when Trump imposed his travel restrictions, NBC News covered the story with the headline: ""Civil rights groups condemn Trump's travel-ban expansion to six African countries.""

Prince Harry rips 1st Amendment as 'bonkers' — and more than a few Americans get plenty annoyed: 'Show some utter respect',"Fresh on the heels of boldly commanding top podcaster — and MMA fighter — Joe Rogan to ""just stay out of it"" in regard to Rogan suggesting that young people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine, Prince Harry's outspoken mouth is getting him in trouble again.

What did he say this time?

The Duke of Sussex — who recently left his royal family behind in England for the sunnier environs of southern California, since which he's nabbed a considerable windfall through deals with American companies like Netflix and Spotify, the Daily Mail reported — was conversing on Dax Shepard's podcast Thursday when the subject of paparazzi taking photos of celebrities' children came up.

""I don't want to start, sort of, going down the First Amendment route because that's a huge subject and one in which I don't understand because I've only been here for a short period of time, but you can find a loophole in anything,"" Harry said, adding that ""laws were created to protect people.""

The prince added, ""I believe we live in an age now where you've got certain elements of the media redefining to us what privacy means. There's a massive conflict of interest. And then you've got social media platforms, trying to redefine what free speech means. ... And we're living in this world where we've almost, like, the laws have been completely flipped by the very people that need them flipped so they can make more money, and they can capitalize off our pain, grief, and this sort of general self-destructive mode that is happening in the moment.""

And soon Harry delivered the shot heard 'round the world: ""I've got so much I want to say about the First Amendment. I still don't understand it, but it is bonkers."" (In fairness, Shepard agreed: ""It is bonkers."")

The prince's comments can be heard in context after the 39-minute mark of the podcast.

How did folks react?

To put it mildly, a number of Americans didn't much care for Harry's commentary on the Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to freely express themselves, practice whatever religions they choose — or none at all — and to assemble and petition the government.

To say nothing of the fact that the prince is a guest here, making a load of cash here, and enjoying a lifestyle here protected by U.S. laws — and on top of that admitting that ""I still don't understand"" the First Amendment, yet summoning the arrogance to dismiss it as ""bonkers"" — a number of notable U.S. citizens fired back hard.

""We fought a war in 1776 so we don't have to care what you say or think,"" Meghan McCain of ""The View"" said in reaction to Harry's comments. ""That being said, you have chosen to seek refuge from your homeland here and thrive because all of what our country has to offer and one of the biggest things is the 1st Amendment — show some utter respect.""

Others shared McCain's sentiments:

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas quipped in rather understated fashion that it's ""nice"" that Harry ""can say that.""

GOP U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, also of the Lone Star State, noted that Harry "" just doubled the size of my Independence Day party.""

Megyn Kelly reminded him that it's ""'b

""Don't let the door knob hit you, Windsor,"" Fox News' host Laura Ingraham tweeted.

Author Nick Adams — who's from Australia and says in his Twitter bio that he's ""American by choice"" — declared that ""Prince Harry should go back to the UK!""

Even fellow Brits got into the act. Former Brexit leader Nigel Farage observed that ""for Prince Harry to condemn the USA's First Amendment shows he has lost the plot. Soon he will not be wanted on either side of the pond.""

Dan Wootton of the UK's GBNews tweeted that ""the First Amendment is one of the biggest reasons why the USA is a bastion of free speech and freedom of expression. The fact Prince Harry doesn't like it because he thinks rich privileged folk deserve more rights than everyone else says a lot!""

Speaking of, Harry and Meghan just added more to their already considerable coffers with a new partnership with Proctor and Gamble, Yahoo Finance reported Sunday.

Anything else?

According to the Daily Mail, Harry also criticized Prince Charles, Prince Philip, and the queen during the podcast and complained he had suffered ""genetic pain,"" which led to royal aides demanding that give up his royal titles.

During the 2020 election cycle, Harry and Meghan issued a video widely interpreted as a campaign ad for then-candidate Joe Biden.

When asked for his reaction to the couple weighing in on the race at the time, then-President Donald Trump said, ""I'm not a fan of hers, and I would say this — and she probably has heard that — but I wish a lot of luck to Harry, 'cause he's gonna need it.""

Harry and Meghan also were famously interviewed by Oprah Winfrey recently, during which they alleged racism within the Royal Family.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/prince-harry-rips-1st-amendment-as-bonkers-and-more-than-a-few-americans-get-plenty-annoyed-show-some-utter-respect,2021-05-17
"Privacy, labor groups urge action to stop Amazon’s purchase of iRobot","A group of more than two dozen pro-privacy and worker organizations wrote an open letter to U.S. antitrust enforcers urging them to stop Amazon.com from buying iRobot Corp, maker of the robotic vacuum cleaner Roomba.

In the letter, the groups argued that the deal would give Amazon too much power in the market for smart-home devices. ""By selling the Roomba brand at or near a loss via the Prime subscription, the company can access more personal consumer data to buttress its anti-competitive advantages online,"" the groups wrote.

Amazon already owns Alexa and Ring. The $1.7 billion deal purchase of iRobot, which was announced in August, is the tech giant’s latest push into smart-home devices. Almost a third of U.S. houses currently have at least one Amazon device.

“Amazon seeks to unduly expand its market power by eliminating a competitor through acquisition, rather than through organic growth,” the letter reads. “The company also aims to minimize fair competition by exploiting consumer data not accessible to other market participants.”

The deal is being reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The review allegedly covers “questions over whether the deal will illegally increase Amazon’s market share in the connected device market and the retail market,” according to Gizmodo.

The FTC currently has a separate antitrust probe of Amazon underway. That probe is looking into the sign-up and cancellation processes for Amazon’s Prime program.

Amazon also has caught the attention of Congress for its privacy practices. In a letter to the company in June, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said Ring was capturing “significant amounts of audio on private and public property adjacent to dwellings with Ring doorbells,” putting the right to “assemble, move, and converse without being tracked” at risk. Markey asked the company to adjust the doorbell’s settings so audio wouldn’t be recorded by default.

“There is no more private space than the home,” the advocacy groups wrote in their recent letter. “Yet with this acquisition, Amazon stands to gain access to extremely intimate facts about our most private spaces that are not available through other means, or to other competitors.”

Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment, reports Reuters and Gizmodo.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/privacy-labor-groups-urge-action-to-stop-amazons-purchase-of-irobot,2022-09-12
Pro-family group's policy director gets Twitter suspension for supporting ban on chemical castration of children,"The policy director for a pro-family advocacy group received a temporary Twitter ban after he called for South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) to support legislation that would prohibit the medical castration of children.

""Now we hope that governors will likewise be emboldened to continue the fight against the evil gender ideology being forced on America's children by joining Arkansas and Tennessee in banning the chemical castration and surgical mutilation of minors suffering from gender dysphoria,"" Jon Schweppe, the policy director for the American Principles Project, tweeted Tuesday.

Schweppe's tweet came in response to Noem's push for the state legislature to pass a bill that would prevent transgender women from competing in women's sports on both the K-12 and collegiate levels, according to a press release from the APP.

Earlier this year, Arkansas passed legislation that would outlaw the use of experimental genital mutilation procedures and hormone treatment for individuals under the age of 18, the Federalist reported.

The APP announced Schweppe's Twitter suspension Wednesday, taking screenshots of the platform's announcement that Schweppe's tweet had violated the platform's rules of use.

""BREAKING: APP Director of Policy and Government Affairs @JonSchweppe had his Twitter account temporarily suspended. For what exactly? Calling on governors to ban the chemical castration and surgical mutilation of children,"" APP tweeted.

Twitter claimed that Schweppe violated the rules regarding ""hateful conduct.""

The rules state that an individual on Twitter may not ""promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.""

Schweppe appealed his suspension; however, Twitter denied his request, determining that he had committed a violation of the platform's rules.

The APP posted a screenshot of Twitter's denial of Schweppe's appeal to restore his account and asked if Twitter supported the chemical castration of children in response to the platform's refusal to restore his account.

Schweppe has voiced his support for a legislative solution to Big Tech censorship issues, outlining what he believes is a small-government solution to an assault on free speech.

Schweppe wrote an op-ed published in February in which he advocated for clearly defining the difference between an online publisher and a platform. He articulated that once these lines have been clearly defined, only publishers should be granted ""special immunity from civil liability.""

""The open forum is presenting itself as a digital version of the public square. The publisher is not, and therefore it is reasonable for it to assume some legal responsibility for its content,"" he wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-family-groups-policy-director-gets-twitter-suspension-for-supporting-ban-on-chemical-castration-of-children,2021-12-16
"College professors caught on hot mic gloating about teaching Marxism, social justice to students","Two professors at Roosevelt University in Illinois, who also serve on the school board for a local high school, were caught on a hot mic recently gloating about how they promote Marxist ideology to their college students.

The leftist educators, Gina Harris and Ralph Martire, were joining a February school board meeting for Oak Park and River Forest High School via Zoom when they began candidly discussing their ""social justice"" and Marxist advocacy, West Cook News reported.

""I mean, it's all social justice, all day, every day. I get to talk about the things I love all the time. All day [at my day classes], all night of my night classes,"" Harris said gleefully about her time teaching at the university. ""I'm really living the life over here.""



Harris, who reportedly teaches ""middle school theory and practice"" to future educators at Roosevelt, called social justice ""a part of everything"" and a ""foundation.""

""Yeah. I always flip out the kids that take my master's class on fiscal policy and public budgets within the first three or four classes are devoted to philosophy of social justice and how you organize society. We don't talk about one, you know, budgetary item,"" added Martire, who teaches public policy and public administration at the university.

""They're like, oh, man. Professor Martire, this is a really weird way to teach a budget,"" he said with a smile.

Shortly after, he added: ""If you don't understand your values, you can't allocate resources among public priorities that are scarce, but all needed. Right?""

'All social justice all the time': Socialist OPRF school board members caught gloating on Zoom www.youtube.com

At that point, someone on the call let them know that their voices could be heard through the microphone in the high school's auditorium.

""We're cool with that,"" Harris responded.

TheBlaze reached out to the university as well as the two professors for comment, but did not receive a reply in time for publication.



On its website, Roosevelt University describes itself as ""a national leader in educating socially conscious citizens for active and dedicated lives as leaders in their professions and their communities.""

According to his university bio page, Martire additionally serves as the executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a progressive think tank ""committed to ensuring that state, federal and local workforce, education, fiscal, economic and budget policies are fair and just, and to promoting opportunity for all, regardless of race, ethnicity or income class.""

He was also appointed by Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker to serve on his Budget and Innovation Committee, and in the past served on the Equity and Excellence in Education Commission, established during the Obama administration.

West Cook News reported that Harris, who also works as a teacher at Emerson Elementary in Maywood, Illinois, described herself as ""a restorative justice practitioner and peacemaker"" during her campaign to become a member of the school board.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professors-hot-mic-marxism-social-justice,2021-04-30
Progressive prosecutor Andrew Warren sues Gov. Ron DeSantis over suspension – ‘DeSantis went too far’,"Andrew Warren, a Florida prosecutor and Democrat, was suspended earlier this month for announcing that he refused to prosecute cases that violated his political beliefs. On Tuesday, Warren filed a lawsuit against DeSantis for allegedly violating his First Amendment rights, the Associated Press reported.



The prosecutor was elected in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. DeSantis suspended Warren from office, accusing him of “neglect of duty” when Warren stated that he would not uphold the laws of the state in cases of abortion and child sex-change operations.

The Florida governor declared that prosecutors are allowed to use their discretion when deciding whether or not to prosecute a case but that a “blanket refusal” to pursue any cases involving abortion or gender reassignment surgery for children violates the oath of office.

Warren pushed back during a press conference the day after his suspension was announced, stating, “Just based on the governor’s track record with unconstitutional orders, I have a feeling that this is going to be just as unconstitutional.”

In Warren’s lawsuit, he stated that there was no legal justification for DeSantis to remove him from his position and that he should be reinstated. Instead, the prosecutor alleged that the suspension was nothing more than political retaliation for speaking out against the governor’s policies.

“DeSantis went too far. Employing the powers of his esteemed office as a weapon to suppress criticism and promote cronyism,” the lawsuit read.

Warren argued that “the First Amendment still applies even though DeSantis is the Governor of Florida and that the Constitution of the State of Florida means what the courts say it means, not whatever DeSantis needs it to mean to silence his critics, promote his loyalists, and subvert the will of the voters.”

Several examples of Warren’s political statements were cited in the case. One example stated, “We do not support the use of scarce criminal justice and law enforcement resources on criminalization of doctors who offer medically necessary, safe gender-affirming care to trans youth, parents who safeguard their child’s health and wellbeing by seeking out such treatments, or any individuals who use facilities aligned with their gender identity.”

One statement that did not make its way into the lawsuit was a joint letter by Fair and Just Prosecution that Warren signed in June. A group of prosecutors signed the statement, and it read, “We decline to use our offices’ resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions.”

In response to the lawsuit, DeSantis’ communications director, Taryn Fenske, said, “It’s not surprising Warren, who was suspended for refusing to follow the law, would file a legally baseless lawsuit challenging his suspension.”

The Associated Press reported that DeSantis’ team seemed unfazed by the lawsuit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/progressive-prosecutor-warren-sues-desantis,2022-08-17
"Progressives demand Biden erase student debt so they can go back to school; say marriage, kids are 'luxuries' they can't afford without gov't help","While on the campaign trail last year, President Joe Biden made a promise to cancel $10,000 in federal student loan debt. At the time, the front-runner was just trying to keep pace with a Democratic primary field that treated billions of dollars like monopoly money.

Nonetheless, many hopeful progressives believed the Democratic president would indeed erase the debt by executive fiat within his first 100 days. But that time period came and went and only a handful of Americans experienced any debt relief.

Now some progressive Americans are reminding him that they haven't forgotten.

In a BuzzFeed News article published Tuesday, 35 readers provided feedback to a public response form about what $10,000 in student loan debt forgiveness would mean for them. Some of the results were shocking.

A surprising number of responders lamented the burden that taking out loans for school has laid on them — while simultaneously pledging to return to school if the debt is forgiven (emphasis added):

""Anything knocked off is welcome. I have about $8,000 I am in default on, so this for me would mean receiving a tax return and the capability to go back to school and get my next degree . I would be very thankful and grateful.""

. I would be very thankful and grateful."" "" I'd be able to go back to grad school , get a higher-paying job, and start saving up money for a house or land. With $10,000 forgiven, I wouldn't be putting half of my paycheck into debt each month and would meet all my other financial goals so much faster.""

, get a higher-paying job, and start saving up money for a house or land. With $10,000 forgiven, I wouldn't be putting half of my paycheck into debt each month and would meet all my other financial goals so much faster."" ""I owe about $50,000... I want to be able to work around the globe and with a doctorate in international comparative information, I'll have the credentials to assist communities and work with others to help all students achieve their maximum potential. [But] I have extreme anxiety about getting my doctorate because I already owe so much money.""

Most spoke of debt forgiveness without any mention of the potentially negative consequences large-scale debt cancellation could have.

One responder claimed that homeownership, marriage, and children were unaffordable ""luxuries"" given their debt situation despite the fact that marriage is proven to be an economically advantageous decision (emphasis added):

""I owe about $90K for an undergraduate degree and work in public education. With what I make, I'll basically never get this paid off. I'm almost 35 and have accepted that things like homeownership, marriage, and children aren't in the cards for me.They are luxuries I literally can't afford. $10K would mean I *might* see my debt to income ratio even out enough before my 10-year-old Chevy with 130K miles on it kicks the bucket. That's it. That's my dream now. Not vacations, family, etc. Just a reliable, mid-priced sedan.""

Others spoke in nihilistic terms (emphasis added):

""Because of grad school, I'll probably most likely be dead before my loans are paid off . $10K is nothing. I'm 44. They are not getting paid off anytime soon, and the promise of higher income with an MBA never materialized.""

. $10K is nothing. I'm 44. They are not getting paid off anytime soon, and the promise of higher income with an MBA never materialized."" ""I have $180K in loans, and I don't think I'll ever get out of debt. I make a good living, but, due to my debt, I live paycheck to paycheck and still have to borrow from my parents, and I'm 37. I feel like the only way out of this is full student loan debt forgiveness or getting hit by a bus.""

Another responder blamed her debt situation on being part of a minority class.

""I am Latina and ... I attended one of the colleges involved in the college admissions scandal. When I read how much these wealthy families paid to get their children into the school, my blood boiled. It is not fair that I had to drown myself in debt to get half as far as individuals who are privileged.""

One responder did make the political point that, as a voter, she should expect politicians to come through on their lofty promises at least some of the time.

""It would mean a modicum of trust [for] the officials I elected. Every election season, we vote on the premise of promises and daring declarations. Every post-election season, we watch those dreams defer. I have lost trust. I'd like a little of that back.""

It is estimated that more than 40 million Americans have federal student loan debt totaling more than $1.7 trillion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/progressives-demand-biden-erase-student-debt,2021-06-23
Prominent BLM activist indicted on federal fraud charges. She preemptively blamed 'white supremacy.',"Monica Cannon-Grant, a prominent Black Lives Matter activist in Boston, was indicted Tuesday on fraud charges by a federal grand jury.

Cannon-Grant and her husband, Clark Grant, founded the nonprofit Violence in Boston, and Cannon-Grant is a well-known BLM activist who rose to prominence in the Boston area after George Floyd's death in 2020.

What are the details?

Cannon-Grant and her husband were charged in an 18-count federal indictment. They are accused of defrauding donors, lying on a mortgage application, and illegally collecting pandemic-related unemployment funds.

In total, the indictment alleges that Cannon-Grant and Grant ""raised more than $1 million in grants and donations for people in need, but took a substantial amount of it for themselves,"" the Boston Globe reported.

They allegedly concealed the true nature of transactions all while paying for gas, restaurants, personal travel and hotel reservations, nail salon appointments, auto repairs, and ride-share services with charitable donations, the indictment alleges.



Prosecutors say the defendants ""presented themselves as uncompensated VIB Directors to donors and other charitable institutions"" when in reality they ""exercised exclusive control over VIB financial accounts, used VIB funds to pay for personal expenditures from 2017 through early 2021"" and ""diverted VIB monies to themselves through cash withdrawals, cashed checks, wire transfers to their personal bank accounts, and debit purchases, among other methods.""

In one shocking incident, prosecutors claim Cannon-Grant applied for and then received a $10,400 grant from a Massachusetts department store on behalf of Violence in Boston in 2017. She told the department store she would use the money ""to purchase meals for needy children in the Boston Public school system."" However, prosecutors claim she used more than $3,000 to cover her rent, and she never disclosed to VIB directors that she had received the grant in the first place.

According to the indictment, Cannon-Grant even defrauded the Suffolk County district attorney's office.

In 2020, the Boston Globe Magazine named Cannon-Grant as a Bostonian of the Year. In 2021, Boston Magazine named Cannon-Grant as one of the most powerful people in Boston.

What did Cannon-Grant say?

After being arrested at her home on Tuesday, a judge released Cannon-Grant on her own recognizance. She will be arraigned next week.

Her lawyer, Robert Goldstein, released a statement to the Boston Globe saying ""we are extremely disappointed the government rushed to judgment here.""

VIB and Monica have been fully cooperating and their production of records remains ongoing. Drawing conclusions from an incomplete factual record does not represent the fair and fully informed process a citizen deserves from its government, especially someone like Monica who has worked tirelessly on behalf of her community. We remain fully confident Monica will be vindicated when a complete factual record emerges.

However, Cannon-Grant addressed the federal investigation in a podcast episode recorded earlier this month — and she blamed ""white supremacy"" for the probe.

In fact, she said that other black activists had ""partnered with white supremacy"" to bring her down. She also claimed that people were jealous of her success.

""The moment funding started coming in and the world started seeing us doing the work, which prompted awards and accolades, it was, 'I want what she got. She don't deserve it,'"" Cannon-Grant said.

""This is what happens when you're successful,"" she added. ""This is what happens when you don't accept mediocrity. This is what happens when you're successful and nobody can explain your success because it's not theirs to explain.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/prominent-blm-activist-indicted-on-federal-fraud-charges-she-preemptively-blamed-white-supremacy,2022-03-16
"Proposed New York map shakes up House races, deals blow to Democrats","A court-appointed official in New York has released a redrawn map of the state's congressional districts that undoes a Democratic gerrymander and significantly improves the ability of Republicans to compete in the upcoming midterm elections. The fair map also creates an awkward situation for incumbent House Democrats, some of whom may now be forced to face each other in primary elections.

New York Democrats had initially adopted a congressional district map that aggressively gerrymandered district lines so that Republicans would lose at least three seats in the House of Representatives. The Democratic Party had sought to offset gains Republicans made in red states that could threaten the Democratic House majority after the midterm elections this November. But in April, New York's highest court declared the Democratic map unconstitutional, ruling it violated an amendment to the state's constitution adopted in 2014 to end partisan gerrymandering.



The court appointed a special master, Carnegie Mellon political scientist Jonathan Cervas, to draw a fair map. Cervas released his proposal on Monday, which includes eight competitive districts compared to the mere three that he estimated existed under the Democratic proposal.

Cervas' map also attempts to fully compact as many counties into congressional districts as possible, resulting in just 15 split counties compared to 34 split counties on the Democrats' map.

The new proposal would shake up several House races. Democrats had targeted Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican that represents the Staten Island area, by adding a heavily-Democratic neighborhood of Brooklyn into her district to increase their odds of flipping the seat. The new map undoes part of that change, keeping Malliotakis' district a swing district.

Two powerful House Democrats, Reps. Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney, may face each other in a primary as their districts compromising the Upper East Side and Upper West Side of Manhattan were consolidated into one district under the new proposal. Both are senior Democrats who lead the House Judiciary and Oversight committees respectively.

There could be another showdown between freshmen Democratic Reps. Mondaire Jones and Jamaal Bowman, whose districts would partially overlap.

Districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi and Antonio Delgado, as well as Republican Rep. Andrew Garbarino, would each become more competitive than they currently are.



The draft map was released Monday so that the public may comment before the final map is due Friday. Axios reported that Democrats expect the map will not change significantly between now and then.

New York's congressional primary elections are scheduled for Aug. 23.

Protesters demand Boston change name of historic Faneuil Hall,"Social justice protesters gathered outside Boston City Hall Wednesday demanding that the city rename Faneuil Hall, a historic pre-Revolutionary War landmark that is a popular destination for tourists.

Activists say Faneuil Hall's namesake, Peter Faneuil, was a slave owner and human trafficker.

A group called the New Democracy Coalition organized Wednesday's protest, where activists carried signs that read, ""Repair and Reconciliation Change the Name"" and marched from city hall to the main Faneuil brick visitor center, the Boston Globe reported.

Demonstrators shouted ""change the name"" as they marched.

“We are calling upon our city leadership to act with decisiveness in addressing the deep and persistent anti-Black racism that exists in Boston,” Rev. Kevin Peterson, the New Democracy Coalition founder, said in a statement. “We must challenge ourselves to create [a] Boston that reflects our desire for a just and fair city.”

Upon reaching Faneuil Hall, the protesters began singing and Rev. John Gibbons of the Arlington Street Church in Boston delivered an address.

“I am here now, because this is the time for white allies and accomplices to clearly say that our collective future depends on a Boston that speaks honestly about our history, while also proclaiming that our future will be unlike our past,” Gibbons said, according to the Globe.

“This name, Faneuil, shackles us to our past and locks us from our future. Today let us pray in the name of all those known and unknown who once were scorned on the auction block here that we will break the shackles that bind us still and that we will forge a new vision of the beloved community as yet we must become in one voice together. Let us all say amen.”

Faneuil Hall was gifted to the city of Boston in 1742 by Peter Faneuil, a wealthy merchant who had made his fortune shipping goods in the Atlantic's ""triangular trade"" routes. Faneuil traded a wide variety of goods including, but not limited to, fish, rum, molasses, sugar, manufactured goods, and timber, according to Boston National Historical Park.

Many of the goods Faneuil traded were produced by slave labor, such as molasses, sugar, and rum imported from the West Indies. Historians say Faneuil's business was not directly involved in the slave trade, but he participated in it and owned slaves. On at least one occasion Faneuil directed one of his captains to purchase an enslaved person ""for the use of my house,"" according to historical documents.

Faneuil died in 1743, a year after his namesake marketplace was constructed and donated to the city of Boston. A Boston News-Letter correspondent described him at the time as ""a gentleman possessed of a very ample fortune, and a most generous spirit…whose hospitality to all, and a secret unbounded charity to the poor, made…his death a general loss… to the inhabitants.""

After his funeral, Bostonians voted to name the landmark after Faneuil as a testament in thankfulness for his generosity.



A spokesman for Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said it is ""critical to acknowledge and address the role of slavery in our nation’s founding and the deep inequities that remain today.""

""As we work to build an equitable Boston for everyone, the city is committed to advancing racial justice and learning from our past and right wrongs,” Wu's office said.

In a separate statement, City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson said she supports the protest and will work to change Faneuil Hall's name.

”There is no reason why, in 2022, a famous tourist attraction and business center in the City of Boston should be named after someone who grew rich by buying and selling enslaved Africans, and even at the time of his death, still owned five human beings,” she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/protesters-demand-boston-change-name-of-historic-faneuil-hall,2022-08-10
"Psaki confronted over 'really terrible' polls for Biden, so she blames unvaccinated Americans: 'No question'","The White House is blaming President Joe Biden's dismal approval ratings on Americans not vaccinated against COVID-19.

What is the background?

New polls released last week showed that Biden's approval ratings continue to tank. A Quinnipiac University poll, for example, found Biden's approval rating to be just 38%. Biden's average numbers, according to RealClearPolitics, currently stand at 52% disapproval and just 43.3% approval.

Biden's spiraling approval has been compounded by self-inflicted mistakes — including the ongoing border crisis, numerous unsuccessful legislative battles on Capitol Hill, and the botched Afghanistan withdrawal — while economic woes related to the pandemic have not improved under Biden's leadership.

In fact, the September jobs report, released on Friday, showed just 194,000 jobs were added in September, far fewer than the 500,000 that economists expected. The report was so bad that CNBC hosts were unable to hide their shock over the dismal report.

What did the WH say?

During a press briefing at the White House on Friday, press secretary Jen Psaki was confronted over Biden's ""really terrible"" approval ratings.

Agence France-Presse reporter Sebastian Smith asked, ""What do you make of these really terrible polls? Are they that he's doing something wrong? Is it just the communication? Or is it he's doing unpopular things that have to be done?""

In response, Psaki partially blamed unvaccinated Americans for the president's woes.

""Well, look, I would say that this is a really tough time in our country. We're still battling COVID, and a lot of people thought we'd be through it, including us,"" Psaki began.

""And we — because of the rise of the delta variant, because of the fact that even though it was a vaccine that was approved under a Republican administration, even though we now have full FDA approval, and even though it's widely available across the country, we still have a quarter of the country who have, less than that, 20% of the country who've decided not to get vaccinated,"" Psaki continued.

""No question that's having an impact,"" she declared.

Psaki later added the White House is focused on ""getting the pandemic under control"" and returning to ""a version of normal"" life.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/psaki-biden-approval-unvaccinated-americans-no-question,2021-10-10
Psaki declares that Republicans oppose Biden's massive spending plan because 'they're rooting for inflation',"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has claimed that Republicans are opposing President Biden's spending proposal because they are ""rooting for inflation.""

""Q: Why, when Americans are seeing higher prices, are Republicans united against a bill to lower core costs on prescription drugs, health care, child care, and elder care? A: They're rooting for inflation,"" Psaki tweeted.

She made the comment while retweeting a post that included quotes from GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who is the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""You can see what's going to happen next. We're going to continue to have inflation, and then interest rates will go up,"" Scott said, according to the Wall Street Journal. ""This is a gold mine for us.""

Democrats hope to ram through the massive spending proposal, which they claim would actually alleviate the nation's inflation problem.



""The best way to address inflation is to pass a bill that creates jobs, reduces bottlenecks, and is totally paid for by making sure the wealthy pay their fair share. That's just what we're doing with the Build Back Better Act,"" a tweet posted last week on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's official account reads.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported significant increases in the consumer price index.

""The all items index rose 6.2 percent for the 12 months ending October, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1990,"" BLS noted. ""The energy index rose 30.0 percent over the last 12 months, and the food index increased 5.3 percent.""

Psaki recently noted that the Biden administration believes that rising fuel prices bolster the argument for a shift toward clean energy.

""Look, our view is that the rise in gas prices over the longterm makes an even stronger case for doubling down our investment and our focus on clean energy options so that we are not relying on the fluctuations and OPEC ... "" Psaki said during a press briefing.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who has been a roadblock in Democrats' efforts to pass the president's spending proposal, has sounded the alarm about inflation and the financial hardship it causes.



""By all accounts, the threat posed by record inflation to the American people is not ""transitory"" and is instead getting worse. From the grocery store to the gas pump, Americans know the inflation tax is real and DC can no longer ignore the economic pain Americans feel every day,"" declared a tweet posted last week on Manchin's account.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/psaki-claims-that-republicans-oppose-biden-s-massive-spending-proposal-because-they-re-rooting-for-inflation,2021-11-17
"Canadian province pushes COVID-19 vaccines by requiring them to buy alcohol, weed — and appointments quadruple","One Canadian province recently turned up the pressure on residents to get the COVID-19 vaccine by requiring the shot in order to purchase some very popular merriments.

During a news conference last Thursday, Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé announced that starting Jan. 18, residents will need to show proof of vaccination to buy alcohol and cannabis from government-operated retailers.

The strict measure was reportedly a part of the province's latest attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus using its vaccine passport system, which will soon require a booster shot to be considered up-to-date.

""If the unvaccinated aren't happy with this situation, there is a very simple solution at your disposal,"" the minister suggested. ""It is to get vaccinated. It's free.""

Dubé said he hoped the aggressive measure would further incentivize vaccination at a time when 50% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated despite representing only 10% of the population.

The strong-armed government approach appeared to be immediately effective. Just one day after the announcement, Dubé reported that the daily average for first dose appointment requests quadrupled, shooting up from roughly 1,500 before the announcement to 6,000 on Thursday, the Montreal Gazette reported.

The minister also reportedly warned that its vaccine passport program would soon be expanded to require proof of vaccination in order to enter other non-essential businesses, such as personal care services, though he didn't go into specific detail.

""By limiting the places they can go, we're limiting their contacts,"" he said, adding, ""If you don't want to get vaccinated, stay home.""

The health minister's comments echoed a sentiment recently offered by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said his health strategy effectively amounts to ""pissing off"" the unvaccinated until they get the shots.

""The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And so, we're going to continue doing so, until the end. That's the strategy,"" Macron told the French newspaper, Le Parisien.

In Quebec, residents are presently required to present proof of vaccination before entering health care facilities, indoor sports venues, movie theaters, bars, and nightclubs, Complex reported. Though some adults, as well as children under the age of 13, are exempt.

The province also has put in place a curfew that runs from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in attempt to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/quebec-covid-vaccines-alcohol-cannabis,2022-01-10
CNN writer asks what impact $44 billion could have on 'climate crisis',"CNN writer Rachel Ramirez issued a tweet on Monday in which she posed the question: ""What could $44 billion have done for the climate crisis?""

Billionaire business titan Elon Musk has reached a deal to purchase the social media platform. Twitter announced the deal on Monday and noted that the price would be around $44 billion.



The company ""entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Elon Musk, for $54.20 per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $44 billion,"" Twitter's press release noted. ""Upon completion of the transaction, Twitter will become a privately held company.""

Musk is the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, a company known for its popular electric vehicles — climate alarmists frequently advocate for transitioning away from gas-powered vehicles and toward the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.

In response to Ramirez's question about what kind of impact $44 billion could have on the climate issue, Chris Tomlinson of Breitbart tweeted that the money would have ""Made climate change hustlers more wealthy.""

Tim Young tweeted that the money could have ""Padded the pockets of the grifters manipulating the narrative on it to scare people.""

""Free speech is more important than fake climate crisis,"" someone else tweeted.

Self-described progressive Rep. Jesús García (D-Ill.) has taken issue with Musk shelling out billions to buy the social media giant and suggested that the money could be better spent in another way.



""There's so many better uses for that money, other than buying a social media company. He could help solve world hunger, could help save local newspapers, or literally help to build bridges or schools,"" the lawmaker tweeted, along with the link to a piece on The Verge discussing ways Musk could spend the money. ""If @ElonMusk can’t pay his fair share in taxes, why should he be allowed to spend $44 Billion on a vanity project boondoggle to silence his critics? #TaxTheRich,"" García tweeted.

Musk has indicated that he plans to make Twitter into a forum that allows people to engage in free speech.



""By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people,"" Musk tweeted on Tuesday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rachel-ramirez-elon-musk-climate,2022-04-27
Racism outcry after one of Canada's biggest cities says COVID-19 vaccine appointments 'now available for Black and other racialized populations',"Numerous cries of racism ensued after Hamilton, Ontario — one of Canada's biggest cities — announced over the weekend that COVID-19 vaccine appointments are ""now available for Black and other racialized populations/people of colour.""

""COVID-19 vaccine appointments are now available for Black and other racialized populations/people of colour ages 18+ who live in postal codes L9C, L8W, L8L, L8N and L9K at the COVID-19 vaccine clinic at FIRSTONTARIO CENTRE, Friday to Sunday this coming week,"" the announcement read.

Interestingly, the city — which is about an hour southwest of Toronto and an hour west of Niagara Falls, New York — added in a subsequent tweet that ""proof of address must be shown when arriving for an appointment if eligibility is due to a hot spot address.""

What are the details?

The CBC reported that the plan came about after the group advising public health pressured the agency to ""prioritize racialized, disabled and low-income residents.""

And even though less than a quarter of the city's total population consists of people of color, the station said members of racialized communities account for nearly half of all COVID-19 cases in Hamilton.

What was the reaction?

"Rand Paul calls Anthony Fauci a mafia don after Vanity Fair expose, resurfaces old video of immunity","The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has fallen more than 90% in a little over two months as coronavirus hospitalizations plummet to the lowest levels since the early days of the pandemic. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) isn't ready to let Dr. Anthony Fauci forget about his behavior during the pandemic, which he believes is similar to actions taken by a mafia boss.

On Friday night, Paul made an appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle"" to give his reaction to the explosive Vanity Fair report that claims Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins strongly pushed back against anyone who went against the narrative that COVID-19 originated from a wet market in Wuhan, China. Vanity Fair reports that evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom was suppressed for thinking that COVID-19 originated in a lab and leaked out.

""This is more like what you'd see from a mafia don than from a government bureaucrat or scientist,"" Paul said of Fauci's behavior. ""If you disagree with him, they come down on you hard, and they try to suppress anybody with a different opinion.""

""It's really alarming, they will do anything,"" Paul told host Laura Ingraham.



Paul hypothesized that the top medical bureaucrats thought, ""Let's do everything we can to try to suppress his opinion.""

The Republican senator from Kentucky mentioned damning emails that surfaced in December that show Collins instructing Fauci to carry out a ""quick and devastating"" takedown of an open letter published in 2020 that argued that COVID-19 lockdowns were counterproductive. The letter known as the Great Barrington Declaration was authored by three epidemiologists: Martin Kulldorff, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Harvard University, Sunetra Gupta, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Oxford University, and Jay Bhattacharya, MD, Ph.D., a professor and public health policy expert at Stanford University. Collins disparaged the three accomplished epidemiologists as ""fringe"" in an email.

Paul noted that the ""three famous epidemiologists"" had been suppressed.

""But one of the interesting things about this exposé is it also shows the harm of what government contractors do,"" Paul continued. ""We knew they did this in other areas, but we didn't know it was happening in science.""

Paul also shared a video on Twitter of Fauci touting immunity as superior to a vaccine when it comes to the flu.

In 2004, Fauci was on C-SPAN's ""Washington Journal"" program, when a 67-year-old caller from Minnesota asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases if she should get a flu shot if she already had the flu.

Fauci responded, ""Well it's very difficult to figure out just on that base of information, what's gone on with the caller. There are some people who have bad reactions to, in vaccination, even if it's a killed vaccination. It is possible since the flu vaccine virus is grown in eggs, then you may have an allergy to one of those components, and what you were feeling was actually an allergic reaction.""

Host Peter Slen asked if the woman should get a vaccination against the flu, to which Fauci replied, ""Well no.""

""If she got the flu for fourteen days, she's as protected as anybody can be, because the best vaccination is to get infected yourself,"" Fauci stressed. ""If she really has the flu, if she really has the flu, she definitely doesn’t need a flu vaccine.""

Fauci declared that the woman ""doesn't need"" the vaccination since ""the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself.""

Of the resurfaced footage, Paul wrote: ""Hmmm…Once upon a time Anthony Fauci could tell the truth…What happened?""

Last month, Paul declared that he believes that over 95% of Americans have either ""antibodies to the virus or antibodies to the vaccine,"" which he credits for why COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are down.

""That’s why we are doing better with this,"" Paul said. ""We have developed immunity either from having the disease or being vaccinated, and that’s why we are doing better, in addition to the fact that the virus has mutated to a less virulent or less deadly form.""

Paul then called Fauci a ""menace.""

""But he won't admit it because he’s so caught up in putting stickers on your floor, putting masks on your face, putting goggles on you,"" Paul exclaimed. ""The guy is a menace, and he has not been right really about anything since the start of this.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-anthony-fauci-immunity-vanity-fair,2022-04-02
"Sen. Rand Paul blasts Dr. Fauci over damning NIH letter, says Biden should 'absolutely' fire Fauci","Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) blasted Dr. Anthony Fauci Sunday, responding directly to a National Institutes of Health letter that seemingly admits to risky gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

What is the background?

Throughout the pandemic, Fauci has denied the NIH funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan bio lab. But the NIH letter, released last week, seemed to indicate that the NIH did, in fact, fund risky research.

At the very least, the NIH letter suggested Fauci has been less than forthcoming about what exactly happened with NIH funds given to EcoHealth Alliance.

Vanity Fair explained the significance of the letter:

[T]he NIH letter—coming after months of congressional demands for more information—seemed to underscore that America's premier science institute has been less than forthcoming about risky research it has funded and failed to properly monitor. Instead of helping to lead a search for COVID-19's origins, with the pandemic now firmly in its 19th month, the NIH has circled the wagons, defending its grant system and scientific judgment against a rising tide of questions.

What did Paul say?

Paul responded to the NIH letter revelations in an interview with Axios, saying Fauci should ""absolutely"" be fired.

""The thing is, is just for a lack of judgement, if nothing else,"" Paul explained. ""You know, he's probably never going to admit that he lied. He's going to continue to dissemble and try to work around the truth and massage the truth.""

And if President Joe Biden does not fire Fauci, which seems highly unlikely, Paul said Congress should take action to hold Fauci accountable for his apparent lack of candor.

""We're calling for an investigation and hearings on this. We've been calling for that for months,"" Paul said. ""But you're right. There's been a great deal of resistance on the Democrat side, but would we not want to know the origin of the virus, and to know if it came from a lab, particularly since this research still goes on?""

How did Fauci respond?

Fauci was asked about Paul's comments over the weekend during an interview on ABC's ""This Week."" Fauci, however, toed his narrative line, saying Paul is wrong and that he has been completely honest about NIH funding of Wuhan research projects.

""Well, I obviously totally disagree with Sen. Paul. He's absolutely incorrect. Neither I nor Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, lied or misled about what we've done,"" Fauci said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-blasts-fauci-damning-nih-letter,2021-10-25
"Rand Paul turns the tables on Chuck Schumer, demands his impeachment by applying standard Dems use against Trump","Republican Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) declared Sunday that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) should be impeached if the standard Democrats are applying against former President Donald Trump is applied equally to all politicians in positions of leadership.

What is the background?

Last spring, as the Supreme Court was preparing to hear oral arguments in a monumental case that could have significantly impacted abortion rights in the U.S., Schumer spoke out against Supreme Court Associated Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh using inflammatory language.

""I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,"" Schumer said at a pro-abortion rally. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

In response, Supreme Court Chief Justice spoke out against Schumer in a rare and extraordinary statement, condemning the New York Democrat for ""dangerous"" rhetoric.

Roberts said, in part:

Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All members of the court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.

What did Paul say?



Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Paul said that if Congress applied Democrats' impeachment standard fairly, Schumer should also be impeached and put on trial by the Senate.

Trump's second impeachment trial begins on Tuesday. The House impeached him last month for ""incitement of insurrection,"" claiming Trump's allegations of a ""rigged"" or ""stolen"" election incited the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

""If we're going to criminalize speech, and somehow impeach everybody who says, 'Go fight to hear your voices heard,' I mean really we ought to impeach Chuck Schumer then,"" Paul said.

""He went to the Supreme Court, stood in front of the Supreme Court and said specifically, 'Hey Gorsuch, Hey Kavanaugh, you've unleashed a whirlwind. And you're going to pay the price,'"" Paul continued. ""This inflammatory wording, this violent rhetoric of Chuck Schumer was so bad that the chief justice, who rarely says anything publicly, immediately said this kind of language is dangerous as a mob tried to invade the Supreme Court.""

But, Paul continued, Democrats won't hold Schumer or other Democratic lawmakers accountable for their inflammatory rhetoric, citing Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).

""If people want to hold President Trump accountable for language, there has to be a consistent standard and to my mind it's a partisan farce because they're not doing anything to Chuck Schumer, not doing anything to Rep. Omar, not doing anything to Maxine Waters. It's just not fair. It's just partisan politics under a different name,"" Paul said.

The Kentucky senator went on to predict that Trump's defense team will use the words of Democratic lawmakers against them during Trump's Senate trial.

""If you're going to criminalize his speech, you have to do it with the same standard. You can't just criminalize Republican speech and ignore all the Democrats who have incited violence,"" Paul said.

""The thing is we can't just have a double standard. Both parties have to be treated the same,"" he continued. ""I think if Democrats had any bit of self-reflection, they would be saying this is a really terrible idea.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-demands-chuck-schumer-impeachment,2021-02-07
"Biden announces deal on $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan, but it could easily collapse","President Joe Biden announced Thursday that Republican and Democratic negotiators have come to a deal on an infrastructure package, telling reporters that both sides made ""serious compromises"" before coming to an agreement.

""We have a deal,"" the president declared after a briefing with lawmakers on a bipartisan $1.2 trillion plan endorsed by 21 senators in both parties.

Negotiations on the plan were led by Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who agreed to more than $550 billion in new spending on so-called ""hard infrastructure"" — roads, bridges, and other projects traditionally associated with the idea of infrastructure improvements. Other ""human infrastructure"" provisions of Biden's original $4 trillion plan including components of the Green New Deal, free community college tuition, child care, and a national paid leave program would be relegated to a second bill.



""We made serious compromises on both ends. ... Republicans and this group did not want to go along with many of my family plan issues, the child care tax credits, the human infrastructure that I talk about,"" President Biden said.

""We'll see what happens in the reconciliation bill and the budget process, if we get some compromise there,"" he added. ""And if we can't, see if I can attract all the Democrats to a position. But they're going to move on a dual track.""

According to a fact sheet published by the White House, the bipartisan agreement would spend $312 billion on transportation, including $109 billion for roads, bridges, and major projects, $49 billion for public transportation, and $66 billion for passenger and freight rail. Billions of dollars would also be spent on safety, airports, ports and waterways, electric buses and transit, and electric vehicle infrastructure like charging stations.

The legislation also would spend $65 billion for broadband internet, $55 billion for water infrastructure, $73 billion for power infrastructure, and $47 billion for resilience to the effects of climate change.

A sticking point for Republican negotiators was funding for the plan. President Biden wanted to increase corporate taxes to pay for the package while GOP senators staunchly refused to revisit the tax reform bill signed into law by President Donald Trump. Biden in turn rejected GOP proposals to raise the gas tax or enact fees for electric vehicles.

The compromise will be partially paid for by redirecting unspent funds from the most recent coronavirus stimulus bill and the unemployment insurance relief funds, which Biden had initially opposed. Other funding mechanisms include allowing states to sell or purchase unused toll credits, extending expiring customs user fees, 5G auctions proceedings, the strategic petroleum reserve sale, and public-private partnerships, the White House said.

""This is roads and bridges but also lots of other kind of infrastructure, including broad system and the water system and rail system. It's all good for the economy. More efficiency in the economy, more economic growth,"" said Sen. Portman after Biden finished speaking.

While Biden's endorsement of the plan is significant, it is not a guarantee that the bill will pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has promised to bring up the bipartisan bill when the Senate goes into session in July, but he's emphasized that it will be ""tied together"" with a second package that includes progressive priorities no Republican will support.

Democrats will attempt to pass the second infrastructure bill using budget reconciliation to circumvent a filibuster attempt by Republicans and pass the bill without GOP support. This is an attempt to appease progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who say the compromise bill is too small and won't vote for it without guarantees that their priorities will pass too.



House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has likewise made clear that the bipartisan compromise is dead unless the Senate passes the reconciliation bill.

""There ain't no infrastructure bill without the reconciliation bill,"" she reportedly told Democrats Thursday.



Schumer is conscious of the pressure progressives are exerting on the Senate.

""All parties understand, we won't get enough votes to pass either unless we have enough votes to pass both,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday.

However, the infrastructure deal falls apart if Democrats cannot get every member of their conference to support the reconciliation package. That means moderates like Sinema or Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) will be threatened with the failure of the bipartisan compromise if they don't vote for the more extreme bill.

That threat goes both ways, of course. If Manchin or another moderate tells the progressives he won't support the reconciliation bill unless the bipartisan compromise is passed first, neither bill will advance.

Manchin has not committed to supporting the reconciliation bill, which would cost $6 trillion, telling reporters he needs to see what's in it before he makes his decision.

""I know what's in this plan, and we have the responsibility and obligation to make sure that all the Congress on both sides know what's in this plan. To say that one's being held hostage, that doesn't seem to be fair to me,"" Manchin said.

Then there are the Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not yet made up his mind about the compromise bill. Ten Republican votes are needed to overcome a filibuster attempt by any member of the Senate and while Biden may have a deal, it is unclear if he currently has that support.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-biden-announces-deal-on-infrastructure-but-progressives-could-upset-it,2021-06-24
Black Lives Matter activist threatens 'all hell is gonna break loose' if 'George Floyd's murderer is not sentenced',"A Black Lives Matter activist with a huge social media following threatened that ""all hell is gonna break loose"" if former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ""is not sentenced"" for the death of George Floyd, the Daily Wire reported.

Maya Echols — a model with nearly a half-million TikTok followers — made her statement in video that she apparently took down, the outlet said. But the clip has been preserved for posterity:

""If George Floyd's murderer is not sentenced, just know that all hell is gonna break loose,"" Echols said. ""Don't be surprised when buildings are on fire. Just sayin'.""

What's the background?

Chauvin's high-profile murder trial began last week and is expected to last a month.

He's accused of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter in connection with Floyd's death. Video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes during the course of his arrest went viral last May, resulting in nationwide outrage, protests, rioting, and destruction that lasted all summer.

According to the Associated Press, there is concern as to whether Chauvin can get a fair trial with pressure on jurors and ""with some potentially fearing the consequences to the city and country should they reach a verdict others oppose.""

More from the AP:

A high fence installed around the courthouse for the trial is a daily reminder for jurors of security concerns. On some days, protesters gathered just beyond it, holding signs that read, ""Convict Derek Chauvin"" and ""The World Is Watching.""



Jurors are well aware that Floyd's death led to months of protests in Minneapolis and cities nationwide. They're aware, too, that thieves took advantage of demonstrations to break into, ransack and sometimes burn down stores. [...]



Numerous people expressed unease about serving on the panel for Chauvin's trial during the more than two weeks of jury selection. At least one who became teary-eyed was excused, as were others who were visibly unnerved.



Others displayed no such apprehension. A Black man in his 30s who was ultimately put on the jury wrote on a questionnaire that the Chauvin trial was the biggest case of his lifetime. And he added: ""I would love to be a part of it.""

'I don't care if the whole city burned down'

Echols certainly isn't alone in her sentiments. Days after Floyd's death — when nationwide riots were in full swing — Ashley Gantt, a Black Lives Matter leader in Rochester, New York, spoke in front of a crowd and the media and declared she didn't ""care if the whole city burned down.""

""If there was looting, if there was things on fire, that is not what is important. What is important is why these things happen,"" Gantt said, before telling reporters that they're responsible ""to make sure that's the story that's heard.""

She appeared to justify violence given that civil rights laws were passed after the rioting that broke out after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.

""I am just tired of you guys not putting the correct narrative out there,"" Gantt added. ""I don't care if the whole city burned down. We need justice. And that is the story that needs to be told.""

Ashley Gantt: 'I don't care if the whole city burned down. We need justice.' youtu.be

The Daily Wire said Gantt later tried to soften her words, saying that ""of course"" she does not want the city set on fire, but she does want people to understand that when it comes to ""sustainable change, sometimes we have to do whatever it takes to get it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-black-lives-matter-activist-threatens-all-hell-is-gonna-break-loose-if-george-floyds-murderer-is-not-sentenced,2021-04-06
'Where's Joe?': House Republicans mock photo of first lady Jill Biden 'prepping' for G7 summit — and leftists hit back hard,"House Republicans wasted no time mocking a photo of first lady Jill Biden ""prepping for the G7"" summit that appeared on her official Twitter page Wednesday:

And what did the House GOP wonder in response?



""Where's Joe?"" they asked.

It's a fair question, especially given longstanding chatter about what many say is the diminished cognitive state of her husband, President Joe Biden.

Jill Biden has been a constant presence at Joe Biden's side since before the election, and questions have come up regarding how much she's helping her husband get through his public appearances.

On Wednesday she told Biden to ""pay attention"" as she spoke to American service members stationed in the United Kingdom. While sympathetic news outlets passed it off as a joke between the couple, the photo of her ""prepping for the G7"" may have been a bit much for Republican House members.

After all, why would a first lady, who's not elected and has no authority, prep for a summit of world leaders?

What was the reaction?

As you might expect, leftists hit back at the GOP House members' ""Where's Joe?"" dig and didn't let up:

""Not trolling on Twitter like a child,"" one commenter shot back. ""I know that much.""

""I guess the notion of a woman doing something other than keeping house without her husband isn't comfortable for you,"" another user quipped.

""Any INTELLIGENT woman would want to know what will be discussed at the Global meeting of the World,"" another commenter offered. ""Could you imagine someone of her stature walking in and just standing there 'to look pretty' as if she were a prop!""

""Seriously? Advertising your misogynistic attitudes is not a good look,"" another user said. ""But go ahead, it's why you've lost the majority of the educated women's vote….""

Sandy Hook families’ attorney boasts Remington’s $73m settlement ‘opens path’ to going after other gunmakers,"Gun manufacturer Remington Arms has reached a settlement worth $73 million with the families of victims killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, multiple outlets reported on Tuesday.

In the agreement, the now-bankrupt gunmaker's four insurers all agreed to pay the full amount of coverage available to the families of five children and four adults who were killed in the massacre.

In all, 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people — including 20 children between the ages of six and seven years old — in Newton, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, using an AR-15 made by Remington Arms. Following the heinous act, Lanza turned the gun on himself and committed suicide.

According to the New York Times, the agreement is the largest such settlement involving a gunmaker and the relatives of mass shooting victims.

The attorney for the families, Josh Koskoff, celebrated the settlement in a press release Tuesday, declaring that the landmark case opens the path to future lawsuits against gunmakers whose products are used in mass casualty incidents.

""These nine families have shared a single goal from the very beginning: to do whatever they could to help prevent the next Sandy Hook. It is hard to imagine an outcome that better accomplishes that goal,"" said Josh Koskoff.

""This victory should serve as a wake-up call not only to the gun industry but also the insurance and banking companies that prop it up,"" he added. ""For the gun industry, it’s time to stop recklessly marketing all guns to all people for all uses and instead ask how marketing can lower risk rather than court it. For the insurance and banking industries, it’s time to recognize the financial cost of underwriting companies that elevate profit by escalating risk. Our hope is that this victory will be the first boulder in the avalanche that forces that change.""

In their case, the families and their attorneys contended that Remington violated Connecticut law and fair trade practices by promoting illegal behavior and specifically marketing their firearms to violence-prone young men.

The legal strategy was considered groundbreaking since it appeared to successfully circumvent a longstanding law, known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which protects firearm manufacturers from litigation after violent incidents involving their products.

""Driven by profit goals set by parent company Cerberus, Remington changed its previously sober approach to marketing firearms in favor of an aggressive, multi-media campaign that pushed sales of AR-15s through product placement in first-person shooter videogames and by touting the AR-15’s effectiveness as a killing machine,"" lawyers stated in the press release.



In addition to the financial settlement, Remington agreed to release thousands of pages of internal company documents, including marketing plans for the weapon used in the shooting.

Remington has not commented publicly on the settlement and has not yet returned requests for comment from major media publications.

"Rep. Dan Crenshaw tells United Airlines to 'just shut up' on voting rights access, points to ID policy for flying","United Airlines became the latest major corporation to weigh in on voter rights policies on Monday, after a slew of companies issued statements condemning Georgia's recent election reform law.

But Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) wasn't having it, and showed the airline its own ID policy before telling them to ""just shut up.""

What are the details?

Last month, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed sweeping election reforms into law for his state, which included the requirement of absentee ballots being verified with a photo identification.

The legislation outraged Democrats, who called the reforms voter suppression, and several companies reacted by condemning the measure. Major League Baseball even punished the state last week by pulling its 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta.

Not to be left out of the woke corporate pandering parade, United Airlines issued a statement Monday that read:

Our mission is to connect people and united the world. We believe that one of the most effective ways to do this is to engage in the democratic process, which begins with voting — a civic duty. America's democracy is stronger when we're all engaged, and every vote is properly counted.



Some have questioned the integrity of the nation's election systems and are using it to justify stricter voting procedures, even though numerous studies have found zero credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in U.S. elections. Legislation that infringes on the right to vote of fellow Americans is wrong. We believe that leaders in both parties should work to protect the rights of eligible voters by making it easier and more convenient for them to cast a ballot and have it counted.

In reaction, Crenshaw replied on Twitter with a quote that read, ""Travelers 18 years of age or older are required to have a valid, current U.S. federal or state-issued photo ID that contains name, date of birth, gender, expiration date and a tamper-resistant feature for travel.""

He went on to explain, ""That's your policy, United. Pandering hypocrites. Just shut up.""

What else?

Crenshaw was not alone in blasting United's statement, with several folks taking issue with its declared ""mission.""

The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway reacted to United by tweeting, ""Your mission should NEVER be to oppose free and fair elections. Ever. What a vile and disgusting thing for you to do. It should be to fly me safely. Get back on mission and away from interfering with free and fair elections. Signed, Premier Gold member.""

But others defended United, with reporter Andrew Feinberg telling Crenshaw, ""That's @TSA's requirement, Congressman. Are you suggesting @United is somehow 'pandering' by complying with federal regulations governing air travel?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-dan-crenshaw-points-to-id-policy-for-flying-after-united-airlines-statement-on-voting-access,2021-04-06
'Replaced by the robot': Humans bested by AI in Colorado State Fair fine art competition,"Under the category ""Digital Arts / Digitally-Manipulated Photography"" at this year's Colorado State Fair's fine arts competition, Jason Allen entered a piece entitled ""Théâtre D’opéra Spatial"" and took home the first-place prize. Although Allen regarded the way in which he constructed his winning piece as integral to the statement he sought to make, his method and statement were not well received by all.

One Twitter user lamented Allen's success, reported the Verge, claiming ""We're watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.""

The trouble with Allen's work, at least according to some critics, was not its quality but rather the method of its creation: Allen used an artificial intelligence to generate the image.

The particular program Allen utilized to produce the work is called the Midjourney Bot: an AI-powered tool that can construct a visual interpretation of a textual description. It is one of a growing number of such programs and sites.

The program is used in this way: a user types ""/image"" into the chat box. This creates a prompt field wherein the user can insert a textual description of things, people, places, abstract concepts, and interactions between some or all of the above. The program, relying upon AI, then generates an image, which can be further edited and refined.

Here is an example of a pair of images that Twitter user Eroteme Art claims to have generated using the prompt ""It Was Clear, We Had Drifted Apart.""

There are myriads styles, textures, and looks achievable with this technology.

The work below from Twitter user Radiant Descent, like Allen's prize-winning piece, is painterly and coherent.

The independent research lab behind this image generator claims to be set on ""exploring new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.""

Although it remains in beta mode, Midjourney has already cultivated a significant community, with over 32,000 members in its Reddit group. Despite earlier short-termed beta releases, founder David Holz announced on July 26 that it had been made available to the public.

Allen regards AI, particularly Holz's Midjourney, as a powerful tool that artists ought to embrace. He stressed that Midjourney still involves creativity and meaningful human input. ""I made the prompt, I fine tuned it for many weeks, curated all the images,"" he said, noting that the work underwent nearly 900 iterations.

According to Vice, Allen took to the Midjourney Discord server on August 30 and wrote: ""How interesting is it to see how all these people on Twitter who are against AI-generated art are the first ones to throw the human under the bus by discrediting the human element! Does this seem hypocritical to you guys?""

Allen suggested that behind the hypocrisy and animosity is fear. ""Artists are scared,"" he said. ""They're worried that they're going to be replaced by the robot."" He likened the backlash against his submission to the opposition raised to other technologies, such as photography, when they were were first introduced.

Notwithstanding claims that Allen cheated, the fair's General Manager Scott Stoller said the entry satisfied the judging guidelines.

Stoller noted that the debate that has been prompted by Allen's victory may impact the parameters and guidelines in subsequent contests. ""I think this is a conversation that we'll have with the art community after this year's fair.""

The use of AI-generated imagery presents additional issues moving forward, and not just for the Colorado State Fair.

Concept artists and book cover designers may soon find themselves struggling to find work, particularly the latter if self-published authors turn to AI image generators moving forward. RJ Palmer, an artist who worked on the film Detective Pikachu, told Kotaku that he ""could easily envision a scenario where using AI a single artist or art director could take the place of 5-10 entry level artists.""

AI-generated images also raise questions regarding copyrights. If an individual or a company wants to avoid paying for a copyrighted image, they could alternatively have an AI like Midjourney create a knock-off version. ""These platforms are washing machines of intellectual property,"" said established artist Jon Juárez.

The sword cuts both ways. While such generators can be used to circumnavigate copyrights, their productions may prove difficult to copyright. The U.S. Copyright Office ruled in February that ""human authorship is a prerequisite to copyright protection.""

Though creatives like Jason Allen may continue to win and awe with AI-generated images, there remains social and legal uncertainty about whether the winning images are their intellectual property.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/replaced-by-the-robot-humans-bested-by-ai-in-colorado-state-fair-fine-art-competition,2022-09-01
"Report details grisly assassination of Haiti president Jovenel Moïse: Shot 12 times, eye torn out as son was handcuffed, daughter in hiding","A new report details the grisly fatal injuries late Haiti President Jovenel Moïse sustained during the Wednesday assassination.

What's a brief history here?

Following the killing, a total of four suspects were fatally shot by Haitian security personnel, and two other suspects were found and taken into custody.

Haiti's interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph immediately declared a national ""state of siege"" and announced he is in charge of the impoverished nation as he called for an international investigation into the president's slaying.

What are the details?

The Latin Times on Thursday reported that Moïse was shot a total of 12 times — including through his forehead, nipples, hip, and abdomen — and that his left eye was torn out.

Moïse's body was discovered riddled with bullets from a high-caliber firearm after the Wednesday attack in which his wife was also shot multiple times.

Moïse's son was reportedly handcuffed along with a maid during the incident, and his daughter fled and hid in the family's home. According to the report, the two were unharmed as assailants stormed the residence declaring a ""DEA operation."" The suspects, according to reports, spoke Spanish and English and are believed to be foreigners.

In a statement, Carl Henry Destin — deputy justice of the peace in Pétion-Ville — said that investigators discovered the grisly scene inside the president's home.

""The president's office and bedroom were ransacked,"" Destin said. ""We found him lying on his back, blue pants, a white shirt stained with blood, his mouth open, his left eye gouged out.""

Destin added that the president's wife, Martine, suffered gunshot wounds to the legs, arm, torso, and hand. She was flown to Miami for emergency surgery and is reportedly in stable condition at the time of this reporting.

Haitian U.S. Ambassador Bocchit Edmond said that the siege on the president's home was a ""well-orchestrated commando attack"" and that it was clear that the attackers had ""internal help.""

Edmond added, ""The most important thing is we need to continue with the investigations and look and identify those who financed them, those who paid them to commit this horrible act.""

""We do hope that the national police will continue to hunt them down because possibly there were more than six [suspects],"" Edmond saidsaid. ""We are trying to see how we can make sure that those are caught and identified and be brought to justice.""

Authorities have yet to announce the suspects' identifies or a possible motive behind the killing, France24 reported.

President Joe Biden condemned the assassination as ""horrific"" and vowed to assist the country in any possible way.

Moïse's violent death is the latest incident of in a string of horrific, ongoing attacks in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, reportedly perpetuated by at least 95 armed gangs carrying out acts of arson, assault, murder, shootings, and more.

In February, mass protests erupted across the country with demonstrators calling into question the legitimacy of Moïse's presidency. The nation missed its 2018 election, as Moïse said the country was too unstable to hold free and fair elections at the time, and he continued serving as president.

Later in February, Moïse said that security foiled an attempt on his life.

""I thank my head of security at the palace,"" he said at the time. ""The goal of these people was to make an attempt on my life. ... That plan was aborted.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-details-grisly-assassination-of-haiti-president-jovenel-moise,2021-07-08
Report: Georgia prosecutor 'increasingly likely' to open criminal investigation into President Trump,"A top Georgia prosecutor is reportedly considering whether to open a criminal investigation into President Donald Trump's alleged ""attempts to overturn the results of the state's 2020 election,"" the New York Times reported. In fact, the Times reported that a criminal probe into Trump has become ""increasingly likely.""

According to the report, the central concern of a possible investigation would be Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) earlier this month in which Trump allegedly demanded that Georgia officials overturn Joe Biden's victory there.

The controversial phone call was cited in the new article of impeachment against Trump, which House Democrats passed this week.

From the New York Times:

The new Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, is already weighing whether to proceed, and among the options she is considering is the hiring of a special assistant from outside to oversee the investigation, according to people familiar with her office's deliberations.



At the same time, David Worley, the lone Democrat on Georgia's five-member election board, said this week that he would ask the board to make a referral to the Fulton County district attorney by next month.

Although Trump's supporters have defended his call with Raffensperger, others have claimed the call is evidence that Trump committed a crime.

In fact, Slate claimed that Trump broke federal and state laws, citing one federal law that prohibits one from ""knowingly and willfully...attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a State of a fair and impartially conducted election process, by...the procurement, casting, or tabulation of ballots that are known by the person to be materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent under the laws of the State in which the election is held.""

Indeed, a former U.S. Attorney in Georgia, Michael J. Moore, told the Times that, in his legal opinion, there was ""a clear attempt to influence the conduct of the secretary of state, and to commit election fraud, or to solicit the commission of election fraud"" by Trump in his phone conversation with Raffensperger.

""If you took the fact out that he is the president of the United States and look at the conduct of the call, it tracks the communication you might see in any drug case or organized crime case,"" Moore explained. ""It's full of threatening undertone and strong-arm tactics.""

What about impeachment?

The House voted to impeach Trump for a second time this week, charging him with ""incitement of insurrection.""

The impeachment article claims Trump's rhetoric about the election, that it was ""stolen"" or ""rigged,"" incited the deadly violence on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, the same day a joint-session of Congress convened to certify Biden's Electoral College victory.

The impeachment resolution was approved by a vote of 232-197. Every Democrat supported the resolution, and they were joined by 10 Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the third-highest ranking House Republican.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-georgia-trump-criminal-probe,2021-01-16
"Report: Meghan Markle is eyeing presidential campaign, talking to top Democrats","Just one week after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went public with steamy allegations against the British royal family, new reports suggest that Markle could use notoriety from her interview with Oprah Winfrey to springboard a presidential campaign.

What are the details?

The Daily Mail reported Sunday that a senior figure in the Labour Party — whom the paper described as ""a veteran of Tony Blair's Downing Street administration with strong links to Washington"" — said Markle is networking with top Democrats with the aim of building a future presidential campaign and fundraising apparatus.

""The Blairite, internationalist and Democratic party networks are buzzing with talk about Meghan's political ambitions and potential backers,"" the source said.

The source further explained that Markle is looking to run as early as 2024, citing the fact that President Joe Biden will be 82 years old by then, according to the Daily Mail.

However, Markle would have to battle Democratic Party stars like Vice President Kamala Harris if she wants a legitimate shot at the White House.

Interestingly, if Markle managed to ascend to the White House in 2024, she would become the first woman to become president. Hillary Clinton was the first presidential nominee of a major political party in 2016, but she lost to Donald Trump.

What happened before?

After Markle and Prince Harry urged Americans to ""reject hate speech"" and participate in the 2020 election, Vanity Fair reported last year that Markle has political ambitions that include the White House.

""One of the reasons she was so keen not to give up her American citizenship was so she had the option to go into politics. I think if Meghan and Harry ever gave up their titles she would seriously consider running for president,"" a ""close friend"" of Markle said.

However, at the time, other sources close to Markle denied the rumors.

""While there's no denying she is interested and engaged in politics as a topic, she harbors no ambition to enter a career in politics herself,"" a ""well-placed"" source told Vanity Fair.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-meghan-markle-eyeing-presidential-campaign,2021-03-14
"Reporter confronts Psaki with two easy questions about COVID testing plan, but she refuses to answer them multiple times","White House press secretary Jen Psaki became visibly frustrated Tuesday when a reporter confronted her about a story that claimed the Biden administration rejected a plan to mass-produce and distribute at-home COVID-19 tests.

What is the background?

Vanity Fair reported just days before Christmas that experts approached the Biden administration in October with a plan to mass-produce and distribute at-home COVID tests ahead of the holiday season. But the plan was ultimately rejected, the report claimed.

President Joe Biden later denied his administration had rejected the plan, as medical experts criticized his administration for not increasing testing capacity. Still, Biden announced last week the government had purchased an additional 500 million COVID tests — for a total 1 billion tests — and on Tuesday soft-launched a government website to begin distribution of the tests.

Senate Democrats have even criticized Biden for his failure to adequately enact a plan to expand COVID test access.

What happened with Psaki?

During the White House press briefing, New York Post reporter Steven Neslon asked Psaki two softball questions about the Vanity Fair report: Who participated in the October meeting, and was Biden informed of the plan before it was allegedly rejected?

But Psaki did not answer either question. Instead, she blamed market forces for no early testing distribution plan and mentioned what Biden has done since then.

""The issue at the time, which was a very small part of the conversation, was that the market had not expanded enough to, at that moment in time, be able to launch the website we’re launching tomorrow,"" she said. ""And the president, you know, used the Defense Production Act, invested $3 billion to expand it, quadrupled the size of our testing capacity, and now we’ve ordered 1 billion doses. So, we see that as— our COVID team and the members who participated saw that as a very constructive meeting, a good meeting, a lot of which we’ve worked to implement.""

Nelson, sensing Psaki's question-dodging, responded by asking Psaki how Biden can ""shut down the virus"" like he promised if he is not being briefed on new ideas to improve the government's pandemic response. Nelson then asked his original two questions again.

""How can President Biden shut down the virus if he’s, you know, not being briefed on these ideas? I mean, that’s my question,"" Nelson responded. ""So, I’m wondering: Who were the advisers, and was President Biden briefed on this idea at the time?""

Psaki claimed she answered the questions, but again blamed market capacity and cited Biden's investment in the DPA.

Nelson then tried again, but Psaki had none of it.

""I hear what you’re saying, but that’s not the question I asked. The question I asked was: Which —"" Nelson said before being cut off.

""Do you have another question? I think I’ve answered your question,"" Psaki said. ""Again, I’ve answered your question. If you have another one, I’m happy to answer it. Otherwise, I’m going to move on to the next person.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-confronts-psaki-easy-questions-covid-testing-plan-she-refuses-to-answer,2022-01-19
"Republicans object after Sen. Leahy announces he, not Chief Justice Roberts, will preside over impeachment trial","As the Senate prepares to conduct an impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump, Republicans are criticizing the procedural development — that Chief Justice John Roberts will not preside over the trial.

Instead, Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) will preside over the trial. Leahy, the most senior Democrat in the chamber, announced Monday he will hold the gavel and pledged to deliver ""impartial justice.""

""The president pro tempore has historically presided over Senate impeachment trials of non-presidents. When presiding over an impeachment trial, the president pro tempore takes an additional special oath to do impartial justice according to the Constitution and its laws. It is an oath that I take extraordinarily seriously,"" Leahy said.

""I consider holding the office of the president pro tempore and the responsibilities that come with it to be one of the highest honors and most serious responsibilities of my career. When I preside over the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, I will not waver from my constitutional and sworn obligations to administer the trial with fairness, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws.""

The Hill reports that the procedures for the trial are currently being negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

""Leaders have been negotiating all process issues about the trial, and all along we have deferred to them for any announcements about this and all other process matters,"" a spokesman for Leahy told The Hill.

Several Republican senators have spoken out against the decision to have Leahy preside, given that he's previously voted to convict Trump the first time the Senate impeached the former president. Some have raised constitutional objections.

""There's only one constitutional process for impeachment and it is of the president, not a president,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). ""It requires the chief justice to preside.""



Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution states:

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Leahy's statement explains there is historical precedent for having the Senate president pro tempore preside over impeachment trials as a ""neutral arbiter"" for impeachment cases that do not involve a U.S. president. Because Trump is no longer the president, the logic goes that Chief Justice Roberts is not lawfully obligated to preside over the trial. And because what the Senate is doing is unprecedented, there's plenty of room for the Senate to interpret its own rules.

However, that does not preclude Republicans from complaining. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told The Hill that having Leahy preside over the trial ""really undermines the legitimacy.""

""The Constitution requires that the chief justice preside over the impeachment trial of a president but that's not what we're doing. To me that's indicative of the fact that we're in uncharted waters,"" he said.

""I just think it looks very petty and vindictive and I understand there are a lot of people who are mad but the process itself already looks like a railroad job,"" Cornyn added.

""If the chief justice doesn't preside, I think it's an illegitimate hearing and really goes to show that it's not really constitutional to impeach someone who's not president,"" said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).

Leahy defended his role in the process, claiming that it's not his job to present evidence for or against Trump but to simply ensure that procedures are followed and that the trial is civil.

""I have presided over hundreds of hours in my time in the Senate. I don't think anybody has ever suggested I was anything but impartial in those hundreds of hours,"" Leahy said.

""I don't think there's any senator who over the 40-plus years I've been here that would say that I am anything but impartial in voting on procedure.""

Republicans underperformed in Arizona – governor and Senate race too early to call with votes still being counted,"Republicans anticipated a massive red wave in Arizona that should have secured easy victories for gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake (R) and senatorial candidate Blake Masters (R). However, as of midnight EST on election night, the races in Arizona were too early to call with many votes left to count.



Lake trailed opponent Katie Hobbs by roughly 13 percentage points with 50% of the votes counted, according to the Associated Press' most recent reporting. The news outlet reported that Democratic incumbent Senator Mark Kelly held a 17-point lead over Masters.

During an election night speech, Lake addressed a crowd of supporters and stated, ""Guess what? We are going to win this.""

""It's early,"" Lake continued. ""If we have to take this fight through, we will. If it takes hours or days, we will.""

Lake noted that the last three drops of election results showed her up over 80%.

Hobbs released a statement on Election Day that read, ""As we eagerly await finding out who won each of Arizona's incredibly important races, I have every confidence that the counties administering this election conducted a free and fair election, and their results will be accurate. But they will take time, so we need to prepare for a long evening and a few more days of counting.""

Arizona's Election Day issues

Arizona saw an overwhelming voter turnout on Election Day, despite early issues with malfunctioning tabulators.

Hobbs assured voters that ""every eligible vote will be counted.""

""At most of the polling places, there's at least one tabulator working where they're having these issues,"" Hobbs added. ""Every single voter can be confident that their vote will count.""

Hobbs noted that at least 45,000 Maricopa County residents had voted by 9 a.m. local time.

Lake addressed the press on Tuesday afternoon about the Election Day issues.

""Do you think what's happening here in Maricopa County is normal?"" Lake asked reporters. ""We have had problems after problems.""

""I'm just embarrassed for Arizona that we're still having these problems, guys. But we will turn things around when I win. We are going to reform elections and make sure that we have honest, transparent elections that every Arizonan feels confident in,"" Lake added.

Blake Masters stated on Twitter, ""We can win — we *will* win — despite all this nonsense in Maricopa. But We The People have to make it happen. GET YOUR VOTE IN, the future of our country depends on it!""

Mark Kelly did not address the public about the malfunctioning tabulators on Tuesday. However, in an MSNBC interview last week, Kelly noted that he is prepared for Masters to question the results of the midterm elections.

Kelly argued that Masters' questioning of Arizona's election system is ""dangerous for our democracy.""

Lake's and Masters' campaigns filed an emergency lawsuit Tuesday evening to extend the voting hours from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. in Maricopa County.

Rescue dogs rescued of plane crash on Wisconsin golf course,"Rescue dogs were rescued a second time when a plane made a miraculous crash landing in Wisconsin.

An airplane was transporting 53 rescue dogs from New Orleans, Louisiana, to shelters in southeastern Wisconsin. However, the twin-engine turboprop airplane was forced to make a crash landing on the greens of the Western Lakes Golf Club in Pewaukee, Wisconsin.

ABC News reported, ""The plane went through trees, losing both its wings, before it belly-landed on the course.""

Matthew Haerter, assistant chief at Lake Country Fire and Rescue, praised the pilot for doing the best they could with the ""relatively catastrophic landing."" Haerter said, ""This could have turned out so much worse.""

All three people on the plane, as well as the 53 rescue dogs onboard, survived. All of the humans and some of the dogs suffered minor injuries. The Humane Animal Welfare Society of Waukesha County took in 21 of the dogs that needed medical treatment.

Many of the first responders to the crash formed an immediate and tight bond with the rescue dogs. The Elmbrook Humane Society said the first responders received ""first dibs"" on adopting the rescued rescue dogs.

""We normally don't let people adopt until we have them up on our website because we want to give anybody as fair of a chance as possible,"" Stephanie Deswarte, a front desk manager for the shelter, told ABC News. ""But since they were obviously in the thick of it, and they did such a great job trying to help with the whole crazy situation, that we gave all first responders first dibs, so to speak, to adopt before they went up on the website.""

Two first responders and an employee at the golf course have already adopted three puppies named ""Charlie Brown,"" ""Linus,"" and ""Sally.""

""As soon as I found out all of them were okay, my first thought was that, one of them is coming home with me. So this is my little Lucky,"" said firefighter Elle Steitzer.

Paramedic Amber Christian said of her adopted canine, ""He just kind of fell out of the sky in front of me, so here he is.""

Deputy fire chief Tony Wasielewski went down to the Humane Animal Welfare Society to adopt a dog named ""Marley.""

""When they let her in the door she bypassed my wife, ran to me, jumped kind of into my arms, gave me kisses. I started to tear up a little bit and I said, 'Oh boy, I guess we got a dog,'"" Wasielewski told WISN.

The Humane Animal Welfare Society has raised more than $8,000 to pay for ""unforeseen medical and other costs"" from the crash.

Haerter said, ""I think all of us collectively have a soft spot in our heart, especially for dogs that have been rescued.""

Deswarter added, ""We have never had something quite like this happen before. It was a miracle that everybody really was OK.""

Local authorities have not revealed the cause of the plane crash. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating the incident.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rescue-dogs-airplane-crash-golf-course,2022-11-20
Court rules black man enslaved by South Carolina restaurant manager is owed more than $500K,"A federal court has ruled that a South Carolina restaurant manager who forced a black man with intellectual disabilities to work in excess of 100 hours a week without pay owes more than $500,000 to the man he effectively enslaved.

The Post and Courier reported last week that the defendant, Bobby Paul Edwards, has been ordered to pay John Christopher Smith, a 43-year-old black man, $546,000 in restitution.

Edwards is currently serving a 10-year sentence on one count of forced labor for coercing Smith to work extensive hours for no pay at J&J Cafeteria in Conway, South Carolina, between 2009 and 2014, according to a Department of Justice press release.

In his original sentencing in November 2019, Edwards was ordered to pay Smith $273,000 in restitution, a figure that covered the minimum wages and overtime pay he had been previously denied. But after federal prosecutors appealed citing the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Fourth Circuit ruled that Smith is entitled to more money since there was considerable delay in his being paid.

""When an employer fails to pay those amounts, the employee suffers losses, which includes the loss of the use of that money during the period of delay. So fully compensating the employee requires accounting for losses from the delay,"" the court wrote in its decision, adding, ""These additional losses could, in part, be compensated by interest.""

""We therefore vacate the award of restitution and remand for its recalculation,"" the court stated.

After the case was sent back to district court for a decision on how much more Smith would be owed, the court decided to double the amount.



Edwards' enslavement of Smith began when Edwards took on management responsibilities at the restaurant where Smith served as a buffet cook, according to court documents. Smith had worked at the restaurant since 1990, when at 12 years of age he started washing dishes and busing tables.

""Edwards effected this forced labor by taking advantage of Jack's intellectual disability and keeping Jack isolated from his family, threatening to have him arrested, and verbally abusing him,"" the court stated.

""His control over Jack also involved physical abuse,"" the court added, recalling incidents in which Edwards ""dipped metal tongs into hot grease and pressed them to Jack's neck"" and ""whipped him with his belt, beat him with kitchen pans, and punched him with his fists.""

The abusive treatment finally came to an end in 2014, when a relative of an employee alerted authorities to the situation and the South Carolina Department of Social Services intervened.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/restaurant-owner-owes-enslaved-black-worker-500k,2021-05-03
Rita Moreno caves to cancel culture after initially defending Lin-Manuel Miranda from woke mob,"Entertainment icon Rita Moreno caved to cancel culture on Thursday after initially defending ""Hamilton"" star Lin-Manuel Miranda from woke mob attacks.

Miranda was criticized by many on the left for having light-skinned minorities instead of dark-skinned minorities at the forefront of his highly anticipated movie, ""In The Heights.""

Moreno initially defended Miranda in a statement decrying cancel culture on the ""Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert.

""You can never do right, it seems. This is the man who literally has brought Latino-ness and Puerto Rican-ness to America. I couldn't do it. I would love to say I did, but I couldn't. Lin-Manuel has done that really singlehandedly!"" said Moreno to great applause from the audience.



""I'm simply saying, can't you just wait a while and leave it alone? There's a lot of people who are puertorriqueño, who are also from Guatemala, who are dark, and who are also fair. We are all colors in Puerto Rico. This is how it is and it would be so nice if they hadn't come up with that and left it alone, for now. They're really attacking the wrong person,"" she explained.

On Thursday, she reversed course.

""I'm incredibly disappointed with myself. While making a statement in defense of Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Colbert Show last night, I was clearly dismissive of black lives that matter in our Latin community. It is so easy to forget how celebration for some is lament for others,"" she tweeted.

""In addition to applauding Lin for his wonderful movie version of In The Heights, let me add my appreciation for his sensitivity and resolve to be more inclusive of the Afro-Latino community going forward. See, you CAN teach this old dog new tricks,"" she added in a second tweet.

Miranda also rushed to apologize to the woke mob and promised to improve in future projects.

Moreno is best known for her Academy Award winning performance in the 1961 musical film ""West Side Story.""

"Rittenhouse Judge Bruce Schroeder receives hundreds of menacing emails during trial, wishing murder of his children and more: Report","Judge Bruce Schroeder has reportedly received hundreds of disturbing messages throughout the Kyle Rittenhouse trial — many of them accusing him of being racist and some of of them advocating for violence against his children.

What are the details?

In messages obtained by the Daily Mail, malcontents have been threatening to effect payback against Schroeder's children if Rittenhouse is found not guilty of murder charges in connection to the Kenosha riots of 2020.

The Kenosha County Courthouse received the messages, sent via email, letter, and fax, and were viewed by the Daily Mail.

One emailer said that Schroeder, who has been presiding over the Rittenhouse case in Kenosha, Wisconsin, wore a ""white robe of the Klan"" under his ""black robes of justice.""

One message, which included wishes of violence against Schroder's children, stated the hope that Schroder's children one day become ""victims to the most heinous homicide known to man so he feels the pain.""

The profane message added, ""[W]e will call his kids not victims but bitches.""

Another promised that Rittenhouse ""won't live long"" if he is acquitted.

""We are watching. Enjoy your term, judge, it's going to be your LAST,"" another person wrote. ""If I ever meet you in person, I fully intend to spit directly into your face, regardless the cost. You're disgusting.""

Another mailer wrote, ""Wow way to name a white skinhead hot head to be a judge. No wonder they burn [sic] down your city.""

According to the outlet, Schroeder has vowed to ""deal with"" his harassers, and said, ""I wouldn't want to be those people.""

The report added that a police car is stationed outside Schroeder's home guarding him 24 hours per day.

What else?

Schroeder on Monday handed the case over to the jury with a message to deliver a fair verdict following their deliberations.

“The time has now come where the great burden of reaching a just, fair, and conscientious decision in this case will be placed totally with you,"" Schroeder told the jury. ""You will not be swayed by sympathy, passion, prejudice, or political beliefs. You will disregard any impressions that you may have, which you may believe are my opinion on the guilt or innocence of the defendant ... You will disregard the claims or opinions of any person, news media, or social networking site. You will pay no heed to the opinions of anyone — even the president of the United States, or the president before him.""

“The founders of our country gave you, and you alone, the power and the duty to decide this case,"" Schroeder added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rittenhouse-judge-bruce-schroeder-threats,2021-11-16
Liberals demand new judge in Rittenhouse case after his phone rings during trial with patriotic ringtone,"While many of the developments of the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse appeared to go south for the prosecution Wednesday, some on the left demanded a new judge after his phone rang during the trial and revealed a patriotic ringtone.

Rittenhouse is on trial for shooting three protesters during political unrest in August 2020 in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Two of the three protesters died.

On Wednesday Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder berated the assistant district attorney for Kenosha County in what many saw as a sign that the case was possibly headed towards a dismissal by mistrial.

In response, many on the left latched on to the idea that the judge's ringtone was evidence that he was biased in favor of Rittenhouse.

Among those were the former White House photographer during the Obama administration, Pete Souza, who tweeted, ""Mistrial. Assign a new judge.""

The incident was captured by some on video and circulated on social media.

""Schroeder doesn't seem to care about maintaining even a veneer of fairness. He's outright performing for the Fox News lemmings,"" said Democratic activist Lindy Li.

""Apparently, the judge in the Rittenhouse case has Lee Greenwood as his ringtone. That's literally the MAGA national anthem. Can't we just jump ahead to the appeal?"" tweeted writer Bryan Behar.

""Laying odds Rittenhouse defies justice with his white privilege card. Which, to his amazing luck, is accepted by the white judge with the Trump Rally opening song as his ringtone,"" said one critic.

""'God Bless the USA' is the opening song played at every Trump rally. Lee Greenwood literally sang it at Trump's inauguration. It is the ringtone of the judge in the Kyle Rittenhouse murder trial,"" tweeted author Mikel Jollett.

""The judge's ringtone this afternoon is the cherry on this turd of a trial,"" read one tweet.

Kyle Rittenhouse judge slams 'vast amount' of 'irresponsible and sloppy journalism' surrounding case,"The judge presiding over the highly anticipated Kyle Rittenhouse homicide trial recently criticized what he called a ""vast amount"" of ""irresponsible and sloppy journalism"" covering the events surrounding the case.

What are the details?

While speaking with potential jurors during the jury selection process on Monday, Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder said that those selected for the task may need to disregard much of what they have heard in the media about the case.

""This case has become very political. It was involved in the politics of the last election year,"" Schroeder said in the court session, adding, ""To this day, you can go out and read things from all across the political spectrum about this case, most of which is written by people who know nothing.""

""The price we pay for having a free press is a lot of irresponsible and sloppy journalism,"" he continued, adding that his charge ""is not an attack on the media"" but a reality check for potential jurors about the need for a fair and impartial trial.

Schroeder said that he has read some things about the case that have been ""perfect,"" but noted that most of the reporting has either been ""sloppy"" or ""deliberately biased.""

""It can be frightening,"" he added while urging jury candidates to abandon their presuppositions and focus solely on the evidence presented at trial. He reminded them that the right to a fair trial is an important right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

What's the background?

The news comes only days after Schroeder ruled that the men Rittenhouse, 18, fatally shot or wounded on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, can't be referred to as ""victims"" by prosecutors — but can be called ""rioters"" and ""looters.""

Rittenhouse — then 17 — allegedly took a gun to riots in the city in order to defend local businesses against looting and ransacking in the wake of a white police officer's shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man. During the mayhem, Rittenhouse shot three men, killing two.

Rittenhouse was charged with multiple felonies, including first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree reckless homicide, and first-degree reckless endangering safety. If convicted, he could serve a mandatory life sentence in prison.

Rittenhouse's defense team has insisted he was acting in self-defense, and videos of the shootings from that night appear to back up his claims. He later told reporters he doesn't regret taking a gun to protests on the night of the shootings, saying he ""would've died"" if he hadn't.

By Monday evening, 20 jurors had been selected, and now the trial is set to be heard.

"RNC accuses presidential debate commission of bias, withdraws from process","Any Republican who wants to run for president will be required to sign a pledge that they will only appear in party-sanctioned primary and general election debates after the Republican National Committee voted unanimously Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Republicans have for years complained that the nonprofit and self-described nonpartisan debate commission has been biased towards Democrats. Now the RNC has followed through on threats to pull Republican candidates out of the debate process. At a meeting in Tennessee, party leadership passed a resolution that reads in part: ""Any presidential primary candidate who does not agree in writing, or who participates in any debate that is not a sanctioned debate, shall not be eligible to participate in any further sanctioned debates.”

The Wall Street Journal reports that the RNC will form a working group to sanction debates based on input from presidential campaigns on the timing, frequency, format, media outlet, candidate qualifications, and whatever is in the ""best interest of the Republican Party,"" among other considerations.

“Debates are an important part of the democratic process, and the RNC is committed to free and fair debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates is biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms to help ensure fair debates including hosting debates before voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for candidates on the debate stage,"" RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.

""Today, the RNC voted to withdraw from the biased CPD, and we are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,” she added.



The RNC's decision to withdraw comes after former President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign made several complaints about the debate process and the moderators selected by the CPD in the last election.

During the first debate between Trump and Joe Biden, for instance, moderator Chris Wallace singled out Trump with a question asking him to condemn ""white supremacists and right-wing militia,"" even though Trump had already done so publicly. The former Fox News host did not ask Biden about Antifa and did not push back when Biden later claimed during the debate that the radical anarchist group ""is an idea, not an organization.""

The Trump campaign also lodged complaints about the CPD's decision to switch the second debate to a virtual format because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and about the planned moderator, then-CSPAN anchor Steve Scully, because he had once interned in Biden's senate office as a college student. The second debate was ultimately canceled because an agreement on the format could not be reached.

Before the third 2020 debate, Trump's team loudly objected to the exclusion of foreign policy as a topic, alleging that the topics selected by moderator Kristen Welker were picked so that Trump could not attack Biden over his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in foreign countries.

But Republican and conservative complaints about presidential debates moderated by liberal-leaning journalists existed well before Trump. The second debate between then-candidate Mitt Romney and former President Barack Obama in 2012 became controversial after CNN moderator Candy Crowley came to Obama's defense after Romney claimed he had hesitated to call the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi an act of terror. At one point, it appeared as if Romney was debating Crowley and Obama at the same time. The late conservative talk radio legend Rush Limbaugh called the episode ""an act of journalistic terror.""

The RNC's statement made several accusations of bias against the CPD, which was formed in 1987 and sponsors general election debates between the major candidates for president and vice president every four years.

Republicans charged that the CPD showed bias by:

Waiting until 26 states had begun early voting before hosting the first presidential debate in 2020.

Making unilateral changes to previously agreed-upon debate formats and conditions, in some cases without even notifying the candidates.

Selecting a moderator in 2020 who had once worked for Joe Biden.

Failing to maintain the organization’s strict nonpartisanship, with a majority of its Board Members publicly disparaging the Republican-nominee.

In response to the RNC's announcement, Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison accused Republicans gross moral corruption.

""Typical CYA… you didn’t pass a party platform… your leader praises Putin… your members hang out at cocaine orgies… actively trying to destroy Medicare, ACA & Social Security… rampant voter suppression ... can fully understand why you don’t want a debate,"" Harrison tweeted.

The RNC's statement emphasized, ""we are not walking away from debates. We are walking away from the CPD.""

RNC vows to play offense with 'most litigious' election cycle yet – launches 73 lawsuits in 20 states,"During the 2022 midterm election cycle, the Republican National Committee has already launched 73 lawsuits on election integrity issues in 20 states. On Monday, an RNC spokesperson told Fox News that Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel plans to make this election cycle the ""most litigious.""



The aggressive legal approach aims to challenge Democratic secretaries of state and election laws that disproportionately favor the Democratic candidates. The RNC also plans to intervene in cases brought against Republican states by the Biden administration.

The political committee is proactively protecting the rights of poll watchers to monitor vote counting and challenging the illegal counting of mismarked ballots.

The RNC filed a lawsuit against New York and Vermont for attempting to pass a law that would allow 900,000 non-citizens to vote in upcoming elections. In June, the New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of the committee, and the voting law was stopped.

The committee also successfully blocked Pennsylvania from counting absentee ballots without dates, which went against state law and a Supreme Court ruling.

Michigan Democrat Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson lost a legal battle against the RNC last week after she imposed illegal restrictions on poll challengers.

""Jocelyn Benson not only disregarded Michigan election law in issuing this guidance, she also violated the rights of political parties and poll challengers to fully ensure transparency and promote confidence that Michigan elections are run fairly and lawfully,"" McDaniel said in a statement.

RNC spokesperson Gates McGavick stated that the lawsuits resulted from a ""multimillion-dollar investment into building an election integrity operations infrastructure that draws on its legal, political, data and communications resources.""

McGavick said the committee is also prepared to fight legal battles that may result from close races in November's midterm elections. He noted that the RNC's ""aggressive pre-election litigation efforts in many states have been successful in ensuring the rules of the road are clear ahead of time.""

Election Transparency Initiative executive director Michael Bars told Fox News Digital, ""After the shortcomings of the last election, a proactive and pre-emptive legal strategy is critical to the election integrity voters deserve in 2022, 2024, and beyond.""

Bars applauded the RNC for listening to the voters and making ""significant strides"" within the last two years to ""restore voters' faith in fair and secure elections.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rnc-vows-to-play-offense-with-most-litigious-election-cycle-yet-launches-73-lawsuits-in-20-states,2022-10-25
Dem Rep. Khanna admits Democrats 'don't want' small businesses that pay less than $15 minimum wage,"California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna essentially argued Sunday that Democrats believe no jobs are better than ""underpaying"" jobs — those that pay less than $15 per hour.

What happened?

During an appearance on CNN's ""Inside Politics,"" host Abby Phillip asked Khanna whether Democrats should be pushing for an increased federal minimum wage as the pandemic continues to adversely impact the American economy. Phillip noted that millions of Americans remain out of work, particularly in retail and service industries that are more likely to pay employees the minimum wage.

Khanna claimed now is the right time by citing Amazon and Target — two massive companies that have set their minimum wages at $15 per hour — and even alleged that increasing the minimum wage creates jobs.

Phillip responded by again asking about small businesses, not large corporations that can generally afford to pay higher wages.

""I'm wondering, what is your plan for smaller businesses?"" she asked. ""How does this, in your view, affect mom and pop businesses who are just struggling to keep their doors open, keep workers on the payroll right now?""



Shockingly, Khanna said small businesses should not keep their doors open if they do not pay employees the wage that Democrats are demanding.

""Well, they shouldn't be doing it by paying people low wages,"" Khanna replied. ""We don't want low-wage businesses. I think most successful small businesses can pay a fair wage.""

""I love small businesses. I'm all for it. But I don't want small businesses that are underpaying employees,"" Khanna went on to say. ""It's fair for people to make what they're producing and I think $15 is very reasonable in this country.""

Rep. Ro Khanna on CNN Inside Politics with Abby Phillip www.youtube.com

Later, when asked if progressive Democrats should compromise on raising the minimum wage to pass the next stimulus, Khanna said moderates should be the ones who compromise.

How many jobs are at stake?

Despite Khanna's claims, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2019 that raising the minimum wage would potentially cost millions of jobs.

In an average week in 2025, the $15 option would boost the wages of 17 million workers who would otherwise earn less than $15 per hour. Another 10 million workers otherwise earning slightly more than $15 per hour might see their wages rise as well. But 1.3 million other workers would become jobless, according to CBO's median estimate. There is a two-thirds chance that the change in employment would be between about zero and a decrease of 3.7 million workers. The number of people with annual income below the poverty threshold in 2025 would fall by 1.3 million.

(UPDATED) Tweet attributed to far-left activist Robert Reich said Democrats should have given Kyrsten Sinema the 'backs of their hands' over filibuster,"UPDATE, 3:11 p.m. EST: Robert Reich on Thursday afternoon said on Twitter he deleted his ""backs of their hands"" tweet the night before ""because it was widely misinterpreted and distorted by conservative media. 'Back of the hand' is an idiom for rebuke. I wholeheartedly condemn violence against women.""

But not everyone appears to be buying Reich's explanation:

""Hate to tell you this, tough guy, but the comments I read before you deleted the tweet weren't coming from 'conservative media.' It was women, many of them progressives, who didn't appreciate your 'idiom' with its origins squarely tied to physical violence,"" editor JD Rucker wrote. ""Delete your account.""

A pair of commenters posted the following observations:

And apparently prior to Reich posting his follow-up tweet, one Twitter user shared a prediction about it: ""He'll issue a retraction attacking conservatives for not being smart enough to recognize irony, an exaggeration, something something — but he hates that a woman got in his way.""

Original story below

Far-left activist Robert Reich — who was secretary of labor under former President Bill Clinton — apparently posted and then deleted a tweet saying Democrats should have given U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) the ""backs of their hands"" over her support for the filibuster.

Sinema — along with Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia — voted against a rule change that would have lowered the Senate's 60-vote threshold to 50 so that Democrats could avoid the filibuster and push through voting rights legislation. Democrats and Republicans are tied 50-50 in the Senate, and Vice President Kamala Harris is poised to break voting ties to push through Democratic legislation.

What did the tweet say?

The tweet attributed to Reich stated: ""Tonight, Republican senators lined up to shake Kyrsten Sinema's hand. Democratic senators should have given her the backs of their hands.""

While the tweet was not on Reich's timeline Thursday morning, scores of users have been posting images of it:

A Google search Thursday morning for ""robert reich twitter"" showed the tweet in the search results:

Image source: Google

But the resulting message after clicking on the displayed tweet indicates the ""page doesn't exist.""

Image source: Twitter

Reich as of Thursday morning does not appear to have offered an explanation on Twitter for the post about Sinema.

Neither Reich nor Sinema by early Thursday afternoon replied to requests for comment from TheBlaze regarding the tweet.

How have folks reacted to the tweet?

It's quite apparent from glancing at tweets directed to Reich that many users are unhappy with him over words that seem to advocate violence toward Sinema.

Conservative commentator and radio host Jason Rantz told Reich ""and yet the only one you recommended people physically abuse was the one female Democrat.""

Author and comedian Tim Young called Reich a ""very tiny 'man'"" who ""supports violence against women... not shocking at all.""

Others were equally appalled:

""So beating women is A-OK with you?"" another commenter asked Reich.

""And this is your response? WOW. Big tough guy huh? Does it work? You knock women around if you don’t get your way?"" another user asked Reich. ""Nah, you tell others to do it..typical Dem getting someone else to do your dirty work.""

""And you encouraged beating women because they don’t fall in line with what you expect of them,"" another commenter said. ""You, Bobby, are a POS.""

""Nice message before you deleted it...."" another user wrote to Reich apparently with tongue firmly in cheek. ""Your cult will have to cheat harder I guess.""

""Tonight, the former secretary of labor thinks a woman should get back handed for exercising her vote in a way he disagrees with,"" another commenter said . ""What a scumbag.""

Attacks against Sinema

Sinema has been repeatedly attacked for going against the Democratic Party line. Late-night TV host Stephen Colbert this week blasted Sinema as an ""anti-Democratic tool."" And leftist protesters have confronted her everywhere from inside a bathroom to aboard an airplane — and even at a wedding she was officiating.

Anything else?

Less than a year ago, Reich accused the Republican Party of becoming a ""white supremacist cult"" and said in a YouTube video that there's ""no compromising with the GOP cult"" and that the party has become ""conspiracy-fueled"" and ""hate-filled.""

In October 2020, he called for a post-election ""Truth and Reconciliation Commission"" to censor speech and name and shame every public figure who supported then-President Donald Trump.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/robert-reich-democrats-kyrsten-sinema-backs-of-their-hands-filibuster,2022-01-20
"Roland Martin chastises Biden, Democrats, says they must 'engage in war' with Republicans before midterms — and DNC chairman agrees: 'A good road map'","After journalist Roland Martin said during an MSNBC interview that President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party must be ""willing to engage in war"" with Republicans as the midterm elections approach, Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison called Martin's outburst ""a good road map.""

What are the details?

Tiffany Cross — host of MSNBC's ""The Cross Connection"" — focused on Democratic prospects this fall during her Saturday program. In one segment, she sat with Harrison in the studio, and he blamed the media for reporting on ""the Democrats in disarray"" instead of what he called the party's successes.

With that, Cross said, ""Let's talk about the fascists on the other side"" and pointed Harrison to a heated take Martin expressed earlier in the program.

""We look at the minutiae of politics, and most Americans are not doing that,"" Cross told Harrison. ""And there are still a lot of people who feel disconnected from the party or maybe even disappointed in the party. Fair enough. I want you to take a listen. We had Roland Martin on at the beginning of the show ... he had a lot to say about what he thinks Democrats should be doing. I want you to take a listen to get your thoughts.""

The screen then flipped to a snippet showing Martin chastising Biden and the Democrats — and then saying how they should handle the GOP.

""You’ve gotta have President Joe Biden stop being scared of Senator Joe Manchin and go make the argument in West Virginia and go to the red parts of Mississippi and Alabama and say, 'This is what we have done, and these folks voted against it, and this is how we have delivered,'"" Martin said. ""They’ve got to be willing to engage in war. You cannot play fair with people who don’t play fair. There are no rules. The other side has shown that they will do whatever is necessary in order to win. So you’ve gotta say, 'America, when they didn’t care about you, we did.'""

How did Harrison react?

When the screen flipped back to Cross in the studio with Harrison, she asked the DNC chair, ""What are your thoughts? I felt like that was a good road map.""

Harrison replied, ""Well, it is a good road map.""

Gov. Ron DeSantis says he would sign ban on minors getting trans surgeries,"Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis proclaimed that he would be willing to sign legislation banning minors from getting trans surgeries.

In an interview with the Daily Caller, DeSantis was asked if he supports a ban on youths getting gender reassignment surgery.

""I'm very much opposed to chemical castration of minors, I honestly didn't know this existed until a few years ago,"" the Republican governor of Florida responded. ""That would be something I would sign for sure.""

In February, Florida lawmakers introduced the Youth Gender and Sexual Identity Act, which proposed criminal penalties for health care practitioners who provide gender reassignment surgical procedures and medical treatments to children. The House bill died in a Professions & Public Health Subcommittee on April 30.

On June 1, DeSantis signed SB 1028 into law, creating the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act,"" which bans transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports in an effort to preserve ""fair opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their strength, skills, and abilities in athletic competition.""

""The bill that we're doing today will ensure fairness for women athletes for years to come in the state of Florida,"" DeSantis said at the time of signing the bill into law. ""It says that athletic teams or sports that are designated for females are open to females. And we're going to go based off biology.""



""It's discrimination against our women athletes to force them to participate against male athletes,"" DeSantis said. ""It needs to be a level playing field, and it needs to be fair, and it should all be based on biology, not based on ideology.""



""Well, look, it's discrimination against our women athletes to force them to participate against male athletes,"" he said this week. ""Selina (Soule) from Connecticut came in; she missed New England regionals for track by two places, and both of the people who beat her were biological males. And so if she had had a level playing field, she would have not only advanced to regionals, she would have won that track meet.""

The Alliance Defending Freedom filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights in 2019 on behalf of three female high school athletes, including Soule, who lost sports competitions to biological males.

DeSantis signed the bill despite threats from ""woke"" organizations such as the NCAA.



""I remember the NCAA put out a statement saying any state that enacts this, we're not going to hold events there,"" DeSantis recalled. ""So I called the speaker of the House in Florida and I said, 'Did you hear what they said?' And he's like, 'Yeah.' I said, 'We definitely got to get this done.' You can't be cowed by these organizations, or particularly by woke corporations, from doing the right thing.""

""We have to protect our girls. It is discriminatory to force them to compete against biological males,"" he continued. ""If the price of having a tournament is that I have to deny equal opportunity to hundreds of thousands of young girl and women athletes throughout Florida, I am much more willing to stand with the girls. And to hell with these events.""

""If corporations want to come in and try to bully us around, they are going to go nowhere. It's going to be like hitting their head against a brick wall,"" DeSantis said.

DeSantis also blasted fellow Republican governors who are reluctant to sign similar legislation.

""I think it's just corporate pressure; I think the corporations have gotten very woke; they tend to genuflect before whatever the most recent left-wing cause is,"" DeSantis told the Daily Caller on Tuesday. ""They just don't like getting the blowback; they don't want to be the subject of a social media mob or things like that.""

""And so I think that they have taken that posture, but you can't let them — like some woke corporation, you're going to turn over the reins of government to them and let them set the policy? That ain't happening in Florida, and so we're not gonna be deterred by that,"" DeSantis declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ron-desantis-ban-minors-transgender-surgery,2021-06-11
Ron DeSantis slams systemic racism and critical race theory,"Gov. Ron DeSantis left no doubt on his position on the hot button issues of systemic racism and critical race theory. The Republican governor of Florida dismissed systemic racism, while also ripping critical race theory.

DeSantis made the remarks during a Fox News town hall that aired Thursday night and was moderated by Laura Ingraham. The ""Red State Trailblazers"" town hall featured Republican governors who opened up their states, including DeSantis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts.

Ingraham asked DeSantis if he believed that the United States is a systemically racist country, to which he unabashedly replied, ""Well, it's a bunch of horse manure. I mean, give me a break.""

""This country has had more opportunity for more people than any country in the history of the world and it doesn't matter where you trace your ancestry from,"" DeSantis said during the town hall. ""We've had people that have been able to succeed.""

DeSantis then lampooned critical race theory.

""And here's the problem with things like critical race theory that they're peddling,"" DeSantis said. ""They're basically saying all our institutions are bankrupt, and they're, they're illegitimate. How do you have a society if everything in your society is illegitimate?""



Last month, DeSantis pledged to purge critical race theory from Florida public schools because the CRT ideology isn't worth ""one red cent of taxpayer money.""

""Let me be clear, there's no room in our classrooms for things like critical race theory,"" DeSantis said. ""Teaching kids to hate their country and to hate each other is not worth one red cent of taxpayer money. So we will invest in actual, solid, true curriculum and we will be a leader in the development and implementation of a world class civics education.""

Also during the town hall, DeSantis was asked about protecting biological females by banning transgender athletes in sports.



""I have a 4-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old daughter, and they're very athletic,"" he said. ""And we want to have opportunities for our girls. They deserve an even playing field. And that's what we're doing.""

DeSantis vowed to sign the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, which would prohibit males from competing on women's school sports teams.

The Florida governor was proud of banning vaccine passports in his state.

""I'm proud to be the first I think, elected official in the country, certainly statewide or governor to say, we're not having vaccine passports in the State of Florida,"" DeSantis said. ""And not just saying government can't make you, private businesses can't make you. Because here's the thing, you have a right to participate in society, without them asking you to divulge this type of health information, but just to go to a movie, just to go to a ballgame.""

Earlier this week, former President Donald Trump expressed interest in running again in 2024, and he would ""certainly"" consider DeSantis as his running mate.

""He is a friend of mine. Certainly, Ron would be considered,"" Trump replied. ""I endorsed Ron, and after I endorsed him, he took off like a rocket ship. He's done a great job as governor. They like that. I'm just saying what I read and you read. They love that ticket.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ron-desantis-systemic-racism-critical-race-theory,2021-04-30
"Commanders' Ron Rivera fines coach Jack Del Rio $100,000 for 'extremely hurtful' comments about Jan. 6 rioting and BLM protests","The head coach of the Washington Commanders professional football team fined the team's defensive coach over what he called ""extremely hurtful"" comments comparing the rioting on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol and violent protests by Black Lives Matter.

Coach Ron Rivera posted his statement about defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio on the team's official Twitter account on Friday.

""This morning, I met with Coach Del Rio to express how disappointed I am in his comments on Wednesday. His comments do not reflect the organization’s views and are extremely hurtful to our great community here in the DMV,"" said Rivera in the statement, referring to the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia.



""As we saw last night in the hearings, what happened on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an act of domestic terrorism. A group of citizens attempted to overturn the results of a free and fair election, and as a result, lives were lost and the Capitol building was damaged,"" he explained.



""Coach Del Rio did apologize for his comments on Wednesday, and he understands the distinction between the events of that dark day and peaceful protests, which are a hallmark of our democracy,"" he added.

He want on to say that although Del Rio has the constitutional right to free speech, his words ""hurt a lot of people"" in the community and said the team would not ""tolerate"" anyone equating the Jan. 6 rioting to that of BLM.

""After reflecting on the situation and circumstances,"" I have decided to fine Coach Del Rio $100,000, which the team will donate to the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund. I feel strongly that after our conversation this morning, he will have a greater understanding for the impact of his language and the values that our team stands for.""

Del Rio had clarified comments he made on Twitter during a briefing with the media and then later apologized for his comments.

""I made comments earlier in referencing the attack that took place on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. Referencing that situation as a dust-up was irresponsible and negligent and I am sorry,"" wrote Del Rio in part.

""I stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. I say that while also expressing my support as an American citizen for peaceful protest in our country. I have fully supported all peaceful protest in America,"" he added.

The Commanders also made a statement in support of LGBTQ advocacy for Pride Month.

""I never would have thought I would have been placed in a situation where I have to choose between my Christian faith and my dream job,"" 19-year-old Kersey said Wednesday in a Facebook post. ""I am grateful for the opportunity that I was given to be a police officer. I do not take that honor and responsibility lightly. However, my integrity and Christian beliefs are at the core of who I am, and I will not abandon them,"" he added.

Kersey's career in law enforcement was cut short following a brief Facebook post on January 2, 2023, the Daily Signal reported. In the post, he expressed a widely-held religious belief that marriage, designed by God, does not include homosexual unions.

""God designed marriage. Marriage refers to Christ and the church,"" Kersey said in the post. ""That's why there is no such thing as homosexual marriage,"" the post concluded.

The next day, Kersey's supervisor requested he remove the post; Kersey refused, and was warned he could be terminated if he did not comply, according to the Daily Signal's reporting. Shortly after that, Maj. Bradwick L. Sherrod ordered him to ""return everything he had that belonged to the city,"" and Kersey was placed on paid administrative leave while the city investigated, the outlet also reported.

After a week's worth of leave, Kersey faced a ""Sophie's Choice"" situation. He could either keep his job or keep silent on social media about his religious beliefs. Though he was told he would not be fired, he would also not be permitted to share his ""interpretation or opinion of Scripture if it was deemed offensive,"" the outlet continued.

Department leadership formalized its position in a letter to Kersey dated January 13, which was obtained by the Daily Signal. In the letter, Port Wentworth Police Department's Major Sherrod says, in part, ""After reviewing your Podcast and social media platforms. . .we did not find sufficient evidence to establish a violation of any policies. . . However, the posts, podcasts, and so forth found and considered in our investigation likely offensive to protected classes . . . please be reminded that if any post on any of your social media platforms, or any other statement or action, renders you unable to perform, and to be seen as able to perform, your job in a fair an equitable manner, you could be terminated.""

The Port Wentworth Police Department did not respond to Blaze Media's request for comment in time for publication.

"Sen. Marco Rubio: Capitol violence was the result of media bias, Big Tech censorship, and lies from President Trump","In a video message posted Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) forcefully condemned the violence that took place in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday while calling out the hypocrisy of the left and legacy media, which throughout last year downplayed violent riots in American cities as ""peaceful protests"" for racial justice.

""The events that we saw this week should sicken every one of us. Mob violence of the kind that you see in third world countries happened not just in America, but in your Capitol building. I don't care what hat they wear, I don't care what banner they're carrying, riots should be rejected by everyone every single time,"" Rubio said in his video statement.

On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Trump supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., to protest the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress, which officially made Joe Biden president-elect. An initially peaceful protest turned into mob violence after some of the protesters led the crowd to lay siege on the Capitol. Police officers were assaulted, government property was damaged by the trespassers, and offices in the Capitol were ransacked as the mob ran wild. One woman was fatally shot by Capitol Police and three other members of the mob died of medical complications during the incident. A Capitol Police officer who was violently beaten by rioters wielding a fire extinguisher later died of his injuries.



News media headlines about the incident called it a ""riot,"" a ""siege,"" or even an ""insurrection.""

Without making excuses for the violence this week, Rubio accused the media and the left of engaging in hypocrisy for being quick to condemn the riot by Trump supporters but slow to do so for mob violence at Black Lives Matter protests throughout last year.

""Now are the left hypocrites? Absolutely,"" Rubio said. ""I remember what they now are calling 'insurrection,' they were justifying just this summer. They called it 'the language of the unheard' when rioters were burning cities. Is the mainstream media, especially places like CNN and MSNBC outrageously biased? Of course, 100%. I remember one of the CNN hosts last summer on the air saying something like, 'tell me where it says protests need to be polite and peaceful.'""

Rubio was referring to CNN host Chris Cuomo, who after violence and looting by BLM and Antifa last June, said on the air, ""show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.""

""This kind of blatant bias, this double standard, that's one of the reasons why so many Americans have sought political shelter in divisive political movements and in conspiracy theories that offer them the promise of fighting back against it,"" Rubio asserted.



""But here's what I want you to hear right now,"" he said. ""We can't allow our anger about all of that stuff to turn us into them.""

""Remember what President Nixon said at the White House as he was leaving after his downfall, one of the lessons he said, 'Others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them. And then you destroy yourself.'

""We can't destroy ourselves,"" he continued.

Rubio went on to give his opinion on what led to the violence that shocked and horrified Americans this week. He accused the media, Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, and the Democratic Party of eroding the confidence of millions of Americans in the integrity of the election.

He also said, without naming President Trump specifically, that politicians lied when they said that Vice President Mike Pence had the power to overturn the election, which he did not. Trump repeatedly and incorrectly claimed that Pence had the power to reject slates of electors from states whose results were disputed by the Trump campaign.

Now, how do we explain what we saw, how could this happen here in America?



It kind of begins with millions of Americans who voted for President Trump. They saw the nonstop bias and double standard of the legacy media. They see how social media companies covered up stories negative to Joe Biden. They saw how state officials mutilated election integrity laws to help the Democrats. And the result is you have millions of people who are convinced that the election wasn't fair and that the outcome wasn't' t legitimate. Millions of people. And they wanted something done about it.



And of those millions of people, tens of thousands of them came to Washington D.C. this week demanding that action be taken, that we do something. Ninety-nine percent of the people who came here had nothing to do with that mob. Nothing. But one percent of tens of thousands of people is a lot of people. It's enough to inflict damage on buildings, and it's enough to do even more damage to our country.



Now that we're looking at what's going on and learning more about it, there are growing signs that many of those in that mob were believers in a ridiculous conspiracy theory. And others were lied to by politicians that were telling them that the vice president had the power to change the election results.



The result is that now four people have died. Police officers were seriously injured. And our country was embarrassed before the entire world.

Rubio called on the Republican Party to take a moment for ""honest reflection,"" noting that when President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the GOP controlled the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. Four years later, they've lost control of all three.

""We need to reflect on why this has happened, because this country needs a viable and attractive alternative to the agenda of the radical left,"" Rubio pleaded.

""We shouldn't and we can't go back to the party of 2012, a party that frankly was out of touch with the unheard voices of millions of working Americans,"" he continued.

""We must continue to fight for working Americans, not for corporations. We welcome legal immigrants, but we have to enforce our laws. We have to take the threat of China seriously. We have to investigate what went wrong in the last election and fix our election laws so people can have faith and confidence in them. We must continue to call out the media bias instead of being bullied by them. And we must oppose political correctness, social media censorship, identity politics, and this cult of wokeness.

""And we can do all these things without indulging the darkest instincts or inciting the most destructive impulses, and without the rhetoric and behavior that keeps the millions of Americans who agree with us from joining us in this fight.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rubio-capitol-violence-media-tech-trump,2021-01-08
"Rules 'for white people' posted at barricaded entrance of George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, the 'sacred space' where he died","Remember George Floyd Square in Minneapolis? The ""autonomous zone"" of several barricaded blocks where Floyd died last May that the city has allowed to exist — and that's now controlled by thuggish, left-wing militants?

Well, if you're itching to pay a visit to George Floyd Square anytime soon — and you happen to be white — you'll need to pay heed to the rules governing the ""sacred space for community, public grief, and protest.""

What are the details?

Jorge Ventura, a field reporter for the Daily Caller, took video outside George Floyd Square and posted it Wednesday to Twitter. And besides the traffic barricades and other objects spread across the street, Ventura spotted a sign spelling out guidelines for the square:

It offers three general rules to everyone who enters as an ""invited guest"":



""Enter with reverence, humility, and openness.""

""Care for each other by wearing a mask and ask others to wear a mask.""

""Honor the space as a place to connect and grieve as caring humans.""

Fair enough.

But if you're white...

However, the longest and most detailed part of the sign is preceded by a heading that reads, ""For White people in particular."" And the rules are as follows:

""Decenter yourself and come to listen, learn, mourn, and witness. Remember you are here to support, not to be supported.""

""Be mindful of whether your volume, pace, and movements are supporting or undermining your efforts to decenter yourself.""

""Seek to contribute to the energy of the space, rather than drain it. Bring your own processing to other white folks so that you will not harm [black, indigenous, and people of color].""

""Consider if you want or need to take photos and post them. Do not take photos of other people without their consent.""

""If you witness white folks doing problematic things, speak up with compassion to take the burden [off of] Black folks and our siblings of color whenever appropriate. Seek to engage rather than escalate, so that it can be a learning moment rather than a disruption.""

How did people react?

Some observers saw nothing wrong with the rules for whites, while others had more than a few problems with them:

""I wonder how everyone would react if any sign.. anywhere.. for anything.. said, 'For black people in particular,'"" one commenter wondered.

""How about as a 'white' American I'll just do whatever the hell I want within the confines of the law in any public space?"" another user noted. ""No woke pandering here. The people that cave to this idiocy are worse than the ones who demand it.""

""The U.S. has truly lost it,"" another user declared. ""It's incredible to watch.""

""The most f***ed up part of all of this is that so many white 'allies' submit to this garbage,"" another commenter asserted. ""The tables have turned, and honestly it's like 2% of the population feeding us this garbage. Black, white, Asian, whatever, rational humans need to object to this.""

Here's Ventura's clip of his moment at the George Floyd Square's barricade:

Anything else?

TheBlaze in March took note of NewsNation correspondent Brian Entin's rather unsettling encounter with a pair of militants who showed up while he was on camera just outside the Floyd memorial and told him to leave in no uncertain terms.

""You're gonna be in a bad situation in a second,"" one of them told Entin.

After a short exchange that included Entin explaining that he's a media member, the militant shot back, ""I don't give a f*** who you are."" Entin took the hint and departed.

Russia threatens countries helping to arm Ukraine: 'Legitimate targets' for Russian attacks,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that any countries providing military equipment to aid Ukraine in its fight against the Russian incursion would be considered ""legitimate targets"" for any Russian strikes.

What are the details?

In a statement, Lavrov told the RT television channel that any cargo containing foreign supplies that Russia believes to include military equipment will be ""fair game.""

""We clearly said that any cargo moving into the Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game,"" he said. ""This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from the Ukrainian soil.""

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov made similar comments last week, the Financial Times reported.

At the time, Ryabkov said that ""pumping up [Ukraine] with weapons from a whole range of countries"" was ""not just a dangerous move,"" but ""something that turns these convoys into legitimate military targets.""

According to the Times of Israel, he added that Moscow had previously warned “about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defense systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on.”

What else?



Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday delivered remarks about the ongoing invasion during a jam-packed outdoor concert in Moscow.

According to reports, the slogan ""For a world without Nazism"" appeared on the stage on which Putin spoke.

Of the ongoing invasion — which the Russian president previously referred to as a ""special military operation"" — Putin reportedly said, ""It is precisely to save people from this suffering, from this genocide that is the main, main reason, motive and goal of the military operation that we launched in the Donbass and Ukraine.""

""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost,"" he was said to have added. ""And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-threatens-countries-helping-to-arm-ukraine-legitimate-targets-for-russian-attacks,2022-03-18
Russian figure skating prodigy who failed drug test is allowed to compete at Olympics,"Kamila Valieva — the 15-year-old Russian figure skating prodigy who became the subject of controversy last week over a failed drug test — will be allowed to compete in the women's individual figure skating competition at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

What are the details?

Valieva's hopes for another gold medal for her country were in question after reports surfaced that she tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned heart medication, while competing at the European championship in Estonia in December 2021.

But in a preliminary ruling issued Monday, the Ad Hoc Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport determined that Valieva, who is the clear favorite to win the women's individual gold, should not be subject to a provisional suspension ahead of a full investigation primarily because, as a 15-year-old, she is a ""protected person"" under the World Anti-Doping Code.

Under the current rules, younger athletes are not subject to the same standards for evidence and punishment as adult athletes.

""The panel considered that preventing the athlete to compete at the Olympics would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances,"" the CAS said in the ruling.

It also added that ""there were serious issues of untimely notification of the results of the Athlete’s anti-doping test that was performed in December 2021 which impinged upon the Athlete’s ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit.""

Trimetazidine is included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of banned substances because it can aid an athlete's endurance through increase blood flow efficiency.



What else?

In response to the ruling, the International Olympic Committee declared that ""in the interest of fairness to all athletes"" there will be no medal ceremony if Valieva places in the top three, ESPN reported.

The IOC added that it will ""organize dignified medal ceremonies once the case of Ms. Valieva has been concluded.''

The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee blasted the ruling in a statement, saying it was ""disappointed by the message this decision sends.""

""It is the collective responsibility of the entire Olympic community to protect the integrity of sports and to hold our athletes, coaches, and all involved to the highest of standards,"" CEO Sarah Hirshland said. ""Athletes have the right to know they are competing on a level playing field. Unfortunately, today that right is being denied. This appears to be another chapter in the systemic and pervasive disregard for clean sports by Russia.""

""We know this case is not yet closed, and we call on everyone in the Olympic Movement to continue to fight for clean sport on behalf of athletes around the world,"" Hirshland added.

Anything else?

Valieva's failed drug test prior to the Beijing Games was of particular interest due to Russia's sordid and notable history of doping. The country's widespread performance-enhancing drug operation at the 2014 Winter Olympics led to the country being banned from the past three Olympic Games, including this year's.

In each of those Games, however, Russian athletes have been allowed to compete under the Russian Olympic Committee banner.

Valieva's failed test also garnered considerable attention because the teenager, though only 15, is already considered by many to be the best figure skater ever. She already holds nine world records and has won every event she has ever competed in.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-figure-skater-valieva-allowed-to-compete,2022-02-14
Sacha Baron Cohen demands YouTube follow leftist playbook and ban President Trump: 'Do the right thing',"Rabid far-left actor Sacha Baron Cohen of ""Borat"" infamy has demanded that YouTube go along with the progressive crowd and ban President Donald Trump — just like Facebook, Twitter and other online entities.

""Virtually every social media company has removed Trump…EXCEPT YouTube,"" Cohen tweeted Monday. ""Trump's YouTube channel is STILL showing videos of his election lies to MILLIONS of people!""

He then pressed his followers to retweet his post and tell Google — which owns YouTube — to ""do the right thing!"" Cohen added a hashtag that read ""BanTrumpSaveDemocracy.""

Just days ago Cohen called Trump's bans from Facebook and Twitter the ""most important moment in the history of social media.""

""The world's largest platforms have banned the world's biggest purveyor of lies, conspiracies and hate,"" he added. ""To every Facebook and Twitter employee, user and advocate who fought for this--the entire world thanks you!""

Hollywood mob hops to it

Indeed, fellow left-wing celebrities took to Cohen's appeal like joyous puppies and did as they were told:

How did folks react?

As you might guess, Cohen has a fair number of admirers among his 760,000 Twitter followers — but certainly not all commenters on his post were aligned with his way of thinking:

""Do you like censorship?"" one user asked. ""If you do your comedy might also be next.""

You Nazi moron! F*** your censorship! We should call for the banning of your unfunny BS you call art,"" another user exclaimed. ""You suck!

""An artist that's for censorship,"" another commenter said. ""Wow.""

""You are ... absolutely clueless on what Democracy means,"" another user declared. ""Amazing that more s**ts comes out of your mouth than your ass.""

"Sacramento homeowner fined $573,000 for working on old cars in his backyard","A retired homeowner in Sacramento, California, has been ordered to pay a whopping $573,000 in city code violation fines stemming largely from his penchant for working on old cars in his backyard, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Dan Altstatt, 83, recently lost his legal effort to challenge the fines when an appeals court judge ruled the city of Sacramento acted justly in imposing the penalties.

In his challenge, Altstatt argued the city's code enforcement actions infringed upon his constitutional rights as property owner and contended that the city's fines are excessive. He added that he is unable to pay the fines and would become ""homeless and penniless"" if his house was seized as a result.

But Judge Louis Mauro ultimately found Altstatt's arguments to be lacking, calling them ""unfocused and difficult to discern."" The judge also cited as precedent a 2000 San Francisco case in which courts ruled $663,000 in fees for continued code violations were not constitutionally excessive.

According to the Bee, Altstatt's case dates all the way back to 2014 when he brought a van and other vehicles into his backyard, triggering a code enforcement penalty.

In a blog post published in April, the city clarified that it began receiving complaints from neighbors about Altstatt's ""accumulation of junk and debris"" on the property, which included fruit from fallen trees as well as ""inoperable vehicles.""

City officials sent him a notice and ""order to abate the nuisances"" but when Altstatt refused to comply, they sued. In the meantime, the city was levying $250 per day fines on Altstatt that eventually amounted to more that $500,000.

In searches of Altstatt's property over the years, the city claimed that it discovered multiple violations of unlawful storage of excessive junk including ""metal objects, propane tanks, broken appliances, automotive parts, gasoline canisters, liquid cleansers and solvents, paint cans, and boxes full of miscellaneous trash and plastic waste.""

Altstatt has since removed the vehicles and cleared the junk, but he argues that the city has no right to exercise such control over his private property.

In an email to the Bee, he said, ""That the city can charge such exorbitant and unreasonable fees for having things in the backyard is beyond belief. I don’t know how they are able to do this. It is perplexing how disputed allegations of so-called 'junk and debris' in a person’s backyard can escalate to the point where the city owns your property.""

He subsequently told the outlet that he is prepared to appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court and take it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.

The city seems unflinching in its position against the homeowner. Yet, Tim Swanson, the city's media and communications manager, did claim in a follow-up statement that ""the City of Sacramento remains open to working with Mr. Altstatt and to resolving this issue in a fair and just way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sacramento-fines-homeowner-working-on-cars,2022-06-02
Justice Samuel Alito rips into liberals decrying 'shadow docket' decisions by the Supreme Court,"Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito pushed back forcefully at critics decrying the recent ""shadow docket"" decisions of the highest court in the land.

Alito made the comments during a lecture on the ""emergency docket"" at the University of Notre Dame on Thursday.

Critics cite three controversial cases where the Supreme Court made emergency rulings with many of the liberal justices on the court issuing vitriolic statements of dissent.

""Our decisions in these three emergency matters have been criticized by those who think we should have decided them the other way, and I have no trouble with fair criticism of the substance of those decisions,"" Alito said.

""My complaint concerns all the media and political talk about our sinister shadow docket,"" he continued. ""The truth of the matter is that there was nothing new or shadowy about the procedures we followed in those cases — it's hard to see how we could handle most emergency matters any differently.""

Among those decisions were the ban on abortion in Texas, a decision allowing Trump-era immigration restrictions to continue, and the end of the eviction moratorium.

Alito pointed out that those cases came before the court as emergency motions.

""The Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have a lot of power, but here's the power they do not have: They do not have the power to make the world stand still while litigation takes place,"" Alito said.

He argued that the unreasonable criticism made it appear as if ""a dangerous cabal is deciding important issues in a novel, secretive, improper way in the middle of the night, hidden from public view, without waiting for the lower courts to consider the issues.""

Alito went through numerous arguments against the court and dismantled each one, adding that the strategy was being used in an attempt to influence the court.

""This portrayal feeds unprecedented efforts to intimidate the court or damage it as an independent institution,"" he argued.

Alito's comments mirror recent arguments defending the court made by other Supreme Court justices, including Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

California County agrees to add ballot measure considering secession from liberal state: 'Up to and including secession',"Voters from one of California's most populous counties will have the opportunity this November to vote on whether their county should consider seceding from California.

What are the details?

The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors voted 4-0 on Wednesday to include the secession measure on the November ballot, the Associated Press reported.

Importantly, the measure does not directly ask voters whether San Bernardino County should secede from California, but whether county officials should consider secession as a means for the county to obtain what officials believe are the state and federal resources it deserves.

The ballot measure reads:

Do the citizens of San Bernardino County want the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors to study all options to obtain its fair share of state and federal resources, up to and including secession?

San Bernardino County is the largest county by land size in the contiguous United States at more than 20,000 square miles, making it larger than Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode Island — combined.

Despite its large size and population of nearly 2.2 million people — making it California's fifth-most populous county — San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert disclosed that a recent study showed that, in terms of per-capita revenue received from the state and federal governments, San Bernardino County ranks 36th out of 56.

That means counties with fewer than 200,000 people receive more state and federal dollars than San Bernardino County.

The vote, then, is really about increasing pressure on officials to ensure that San Bernardino receives its ""fair share"" of the pie.

""It's a question we're going to put to our residents. Do they want to include all options to go after, fight for their fair share of taxpayer dollars?"" Supervisor Curt Hagman said.

""I do think we have to look at anything we can do to enhance services for our residents,"" Supervisor Joe Baca Jr. agreed. ""I’m not in favor of seceding. I’m proud to be from California. I love California.""

Would it join another state?

At the board meeting, Supervisor Dawn Rowe suggested San Bernardino County could join Arizona or Nevada, noting the expenses associated with maintaining an entire state.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-bernardino-county-secession-ballot-measure,2022-08-05
San Fran liberal outraged at her city's Democratic leadership exposes bankruptcy of the progressive agenda in viral critique,"A San Francisco resident went viral over the weekend after she published a lengthy Twitter thread dressing down her city's liberal leadership over living conditions in the city.

Surprisingly, the woman who posted the blaring criticism is herself a liberal and registered Democrat.

What did she say?

Michelle Tandler has been a registered Democrat for 18 years. She grew up in a progressive family. She attended a progressive school. Her social circle is mostly progressives.

But if the current state of San Francisco is a representation of the progressive worldview, Tandler made clear Sunday she no longer wants to be associated with progressive liberal politics.

""Here is what confuses me about San Francisco. We have the most liberal, left-wing government & population in the country. We have a $13B budget. And we have 8,000 people sleeping in the rain this week. Can someone please explain this to me?"" Tandler wrote on Twitter.

""What do progressives stand for, exactly? I thought it was about making things more fair. About standing up for the little guy. About human rights, equality (equity?), compassion. San Francisco (to me) looks like the least compassionate city on the planet,"" she said. ""The slums of Mumbai look cleaner than the streets of downtown SF. ... We have thousands of people wandering around — looking like they are on the brink of death. ... [I]f this what Progressive stands for — I want the opposite.""

According to Tandler, the progressive vernacular — replete with phrases like ""harm reduction,"" ""housing first,"" ""criminal justice,"" ""social justice,"" ""equity"" — appears to be nothing more than a smoke show covering up the ""most deranged city on the planet.""



Tandler admitted that she is ""starting to develop a seriously dark view"" of the progressive leaders in charge of San Francisco because they have ""absolute power"" while ironically denouncing ""broken"" systems.

The San Francisco native even wants to know: ""What would San Francisco look like if Republicans were in charge?"" After all, Tandler explained, ""Progressives tend to blame Republicans for almost everything. Yet here we are — not a Republican in sight.""

Despite the monumental humanitarian crises plaguing San Francisco, Tandler observed that city progressives appear more interested in solving social issues than saving lives.

""We probably have more 'Black Lives Matter' signs up than any city in the nation. 40% of our homeless people are Black. Do their lives matter...? Or is this just about virtue signaling and moral grandstanding?"" Tandler asked.

Tandler's rant against San Francisco and progressive leaders went on, but two tweets summed up the crux of her problem.

""One of my friends recently woke up to find a homeless person sleeping on the front step of her multi-million dollar home. I asked her what she did. 'We closed the blinds.' I think this is such a metaphor for what's going on here. San Francisco is turning its head,"" Tandler wrote.

""San Franciscans believe they are righteous because they pledge allegiance to the righteous tribe — Democrats. They believe they are moral because they believe in higher taxes. They believe they are virtuous because they believe in big Government,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-fran-liberal-outraged-at-her-citys-democratic-leadership-exposes-bankruptcy-of-the-progressive-agenda-in-viral-critique,2021-12-28
San Francisco businesses threatening to not pay taxes unless officials clean up city,"Small business owners in San Francisco’s Castro District are demanding city officials take action to address the growing issues of crime, drug use, and homelessness in the area.

The Castro Merchants Association sent a letter to San Francisco city officials saying members of the group plan to stop paying taxes if the city doesn't do more to address the issues.

In the letter, the association said people who are living on the streets “regularly experience psychotic episodes” and have vandalized storefronts and harassed business owners, employees, residents and tourists, reports The San Francisco Chronicle.

“Our community is struggling to recover from lost business revenue, from burglaries and never-ending vandalism/graffiti (often committed by unhoused persons) and we implore you to take action,” stated the letter.

""Every day we wake up and have to help people on the street. We have to clean up feces on the street. We have to clear our people from doorways, so we can open our businesses. It's not fair,"" said Terrance Alan, co-president of the association and owner of Flore Dispensary and Cafe Flore.

According to The Chronicle, the group asked the city to “designate 35 of the city’s shelter beds for the neighborhood’s homeless population, create a comprehensive plan on how to offer services to individuals who repeatedly decline help, and provide monthly metrics on how many people in the community have been offered services and shelter.”

Dave Karraker, co-president of the association, said if the association’s demands are not met, the association may ask store owners to stop paying taxes and other city fees.

“If the city can’t provide the basic services for them to become a successful business, then what are we paying for?” Karraker told The Chronicle. “You can’t have a vibrant, successful business corridor when you have people passed out high on drugs, littering your sidewalk. These people need to get help.”

San Francisco’s Department of Public Health (DPH) responded to the group with a statement of its own. The department acknowledged the association’s concerns and said it is working to address them, though there are difficulties in meeting the demands.

""Clinical teams are trained in assessing individuals for involuntary holds. However, California state law sets a very high threshold for these holds, and often that threshold is not met, even when it looks to the public like an individual needs help,"" read the DPH statement.

Businesses throughout San Francisco have seen a dramatic rise in burglaries and vandalism since 2019, reports The Chronicle.

San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus takes down 'we'll convert your children' music video after group says it received 'threats of harm',"The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus set a music video to private after the group said it received ""threats of harm"" over the song that repeats the lines ""we'll convert your children"" and ""we're coming for your children"" numerous times.

Chorus director Chris Verdugo told Yahoo Life the tune — ""A Message from the Gay Community"" — is ""satirical.""

What's the background?

The SFGMC posted the video on its YouTube page July 1. It begins with one singer introducing the tune by saying, ""As we celebrate Pride and progress we've made over these past years, there's still work to be done. So to those of you out there who are still working against equal rights, we have a message for you.""

Then the singing begins:

You think we're sinful

You fight against our rights

You say we all lead lives you can't respect

But you're just frightened

You think that we'll corrupt your kids

If our agenda goes unchecked

Funny, just this once, you're correct



We'll convert your children

Happens bit by bit

Quietly and subtly

And you will barely notice it

You can keep them from disco

Warn about San Francisco

Make 'em wear pleated pants

We don't care

We'll convert your children

We'll make them tolerant and fair

The full chorus also sings:

We're coming for them

We're coming for your children

We're coming for them

We're coming for them

We're coming for your children

For your children

While the original clip is not viewable, it has been posted elsewhere:

'Threats of harm'

Yahoo Life wrote that ""not everyone got the joke"" and said that after the video ""went viral"" it ""was then lambasted by conservative media for its child-focused theme, even prompting death threats against the vocalists ..."" The ""conservative media"" link is for TheBlaze's Wednesday story; the ""lambasted"" link is for Rod Dreher's piece in the American Conservative.

Verdugo told Yahoo Life that it was a ""difficult decision"" to set the video to private ""because we are an organization whose mission really is both artistic but also activist. We are the first gay men's chorus on the planet. … We are a social justice organization … so it's very difficult for us to decide to take down that video. But the soloists — who are not in the chorus but, in their own right, rising Broadway stars, have received death threats.""

Yahoo Life also reported that ""critics have used various Twitter accounts to take screenshots of the chorus, numbered the individuals and created spreadsheets, harassing them, even at their places of work.""

""All over a satirical piece of music,"" Verdugo said, according to the outlet.

The SFGMC on Thursday issued a statement on the issue that reads, in part:

The far-right conservative media found our ""Message..."" video and have taken it as their cause. This has all happened in the last 24 hours and it continues to pick up steam. They have taken the lyrics out of context to support a narrative that suits their intolerant and hateful needs. It is obvious the tongue-in-cheek humor is lost on many. As a result, we have seen the user comments on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram become increasingly alarming. Emails to individuals and the chorus office are vitriolic – including threats of harm.



We feel the first action we must take to keep everyone involved with the chorus and the making of this video safe is to turn the video to private. We are communicating with law-enforcement both locally and nationally. We will not be threatened and we follow legal steps to act on those threats. We will always accept others who may hold different values, but when violence is their choice of expression, since 1969 we have not backed down. After decades of children being indoctrinated and taught intolerance for anyone who is ""other,"" from using the Bible as a weapon to reparative therapy, it's our turn. We have dedicated ourselves to being role models, teaching, and spreading the message of love, tolerance and celebration through our music.



Our second action is to work to control the narrative. The video is being illegally copied and placed on YouTube, Instagram and other websites. Others have the right to follow Fair Use laws, but that is not what is happening here. Therefore, our social media and marketing staff are working around the clock to alert moderators at YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and to file DMCA's (take down of websites featuring stolen content). So far, this has been very successful.

Interesting conclusion

Verdugo told Yahoo Life he didn't think the song would elicit the degree of negative reaction it did.

""It's a lightning rod,"" he acknowledged to the outlet, in regard to what Yahoo Life said were ""the risks of referencing anything gay and child-related in the same breath.""

However, Verdugo also told the outlet that the song ""came from a very innocent place. We weren't trying to antagonize anyone … we never thought it would — and perhaps that's on us.""

At least one child drag queen likes the song

Remember child drag queen Desmond Is Amazing? The kid made many headlines over the past few years in relation to his drag pursuits.

Well, Desmond happens to love the SFGMC's song and said so on Facebook:

Pushback



Despite the SFGMC's vehement defense of the song, not everyone is buying it.

Becket Adams, a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner, took issue with the response of gay men's chorus and let them have it:

Dreher in his piece noted that ""what these smart-asses in San Francisco did was make a satirical song and video that would win them plaudits in their own circles by making fun of normies ... the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus said the quiet part out loud. Sure, they say in the video that they're talking about converting them into being 'tolerant and fair,' but that is not at all how it will be received. ...""

He added, ""The contempt these men show towards parents who don't think like them is at the heart of this. The taunting that says, whatever your religious beliefs, we are going to steal the hearts and minds of your children, and there is nothing you hicks can do to stop us. It gives the game away. It gives the game away for them, and for all their corporate allies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-francisco-gay-mens-chorus-pulls-video-threats,2021-07-09
Sarah Huckabee Sanders undergoes surgery for thyroid cancer,"Republican Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that she had her thryroid and some lymph nodes extracted on Friday after learning earlier this month that she had thyroid cancer.

""During a check-up earlier this month, my doctor ordered a biopsy on an area of concern in my neck and the test revealed that I had thyroid cancer,"" Sanders said in a statement on Friday. ""Today, I underwent a successful surgery to remove my thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes and by the grace of God I am now cancer-free. I want to thank the Arkansas doctors and nurses for their world-class care, as well as my family and friends for their love, prayers, and support. I look forward to returning to the campaign trail soon. This experience has been a reminder that whatever battle you may be facing, don't lose heart. As governor, I will never quit fighting for the people of our great state.""

Sanders, who is the daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, served as White House press secretary during a portion of former President Donald Trump's tenure in office. Trump has endorsed her for governor.

""Sarah is currently recovering from surgery in which we removed her thyroid gland and some of the surrounding lymph nodes in her neck,"" Dr. John Sims said in a statement. ""The surgery went extremely well, and I expect her to be back on her feet even within the next 24 hours. This is a Stage I papillary thyroid carcinoma which is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has an excellent prognosis. While she will need adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine, as well as continued long term follow up, I think it's fair to say she's now cancer free, and I don't anticipate any of this slowing her down.""



In a statement, Chris Jones, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate running against Sanders during the 2022 contest, and his family offered their well-wishes for Sanders.

""Our hearts go out to you, Sarah. Our family is thinking of you and praying for you and your family. It's truly a blessing that you caught this cancer early and were able to receive world-class treatment so quickly. From one family of Arkansans to another, we send you hope, love, and healing,"" the Jones family said in the statement. ""Our family has been on this journey before and, while it's not easy, we know personally the power of prayer, the healing hand of God, and the strength that comes from being surrounded by community. May you have an abundance of all in this season. We wish you a successful recovery. God bless.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sarah-huckabee-sanders-thyroid-cancer,2022-09-17
Scarlett Johansson says actors should stick to acting and stop making political statements,"Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson rejected the public compulsion to seek political statements from celebrities and said that actors should stick to acting instead.

Johansson made the comments during an interview with ""The Gentlewoman,"" a British magazine.

""I don't think actors have obligations to have a public role in society,"" said the star of the popular Avengers superhero movie franchise.

""Some people want to, but the idea that you're obligated to because you're in the public eye is unfair. You didn't choose to be a politician, you're an actor,"" she explained.

Johansson has faced her fair share of woke criticism in her career. She was accused of ""whitewashing"" in 2017 when she took on the lead role in ""Ghost In The Shell,"" a classic Japanese anime story. Later in 2018 she crossed the transgender lobby when she took the role of a transgender man in the movie, ""Rub and Tug."" She initially defended her decision but eventually withdrew from that film after public outrage.

She went on in the Gentlewoman interview to exhort other actors to stick to acting.

""Your job is to reflect our experience to ourselves; your job is to be a mirror for an audience, to be able to have an empathetic experience through art. That is what your job is,"" Johansson continued.

""Whatever my political views are, all that stuff, I feel most successful when people can sit in a theatre or at home and disappear into a story or a performance and see pieces of themselves, or are able to connect with themselves through this experience of watching this performance or story or interaction between actors or whatever it is,"" she added.

""And they're affected by it and they're thinking about it, and they feel something. You know? They have an emotional reaction to it – good, bad, uncomfortable, validating, whatever,"" Johansson explained.

""That's my job,"" she said. ""The other stuff is not my job.""

Johansson is starring in the latest Marvel superhero movie, ""Black Widow,"" which was scheduled be released in movie theaters and on Disney's streaming service on May 1, but was pushed back to July 9.

Here's the trailer from her latest movie:

Rep. Adam Schiff admits Americans and allies are 'unlikely' to be evacuated from Afghanistan by Aug. 31 deadline,"Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California said Monday that the Biden administration was ""unlikely"" to be able to evacuate Americans and allies from Afghanistan by the Aug. 31 deadline.

Schiff, who is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that there were too many people left to evacuate after the Taliban takeover.

""I think it's possible but I think it's very unlikely,"" Schiff said after a classified intelligence briefing.

""Given the number of Americans who still need to be evacuated, the number of [Special Immigrant Visas], the number of others who are members of the Afghan press, civil society leaders, women leaders. It's hard for me to imagine all of that can be accomplished between now and the end of the month,"" he continued.

""It's hard for me to see that being complete by the end of the month,"" Schiff added later.

The crisis in Afghanistan has worsened by the day as some Americans are reportedly being beaten by Taliban militants as they try to make their way to the airport in Kabul in an attempt to escape the country.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki angrily denied that Americans had been ""stranded"" in Afghanistan but videos and reports on social media continued to undermine that claim.

The Taliban on Monday warned President Joe Biden that there would be serious consequences if he ordered troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond the deadline.



Schiff expressed his worry that the airport was an attractive target for other terrorist groups.

""I think the threat to the airport is very real and very substantial and this has been a concern of mine for, for some days now that this would make a very attractive target for ISIS,"" he added.

He also appeared to support the claim from Biden that nobody expected the Afghan government to fall so quickly to the Taliban.

""The intelligence agencies assessments of the Afghan government's ability to maintain itself became increasingly pessimistic over the course of the last six months,"" said Schiff.

""And there were any number of warnings that the Taliban might take over,"" he added. ""And some that included the potential of a very rapid takeover. At the same time, though, I think it's also fair to say that no one predicted such a rapid collapse, a rapid and complete collapse of Afghan government and forces.""

He went on to say that there will be many meetings to investigate the intelligence that led to the unexpectedly quick fall of Afghanistan into the hands of the Taliban.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the U.S. evacuated 10,400 personnel out of Afghanistan on Sunday, and another 5,900 people on the same day.

"School boards just removed two acclaimed books from curriculums: 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for racism; 'Maus' — about the Holocaust — for nudity, profanity. Right or wrong?","Two acclaimed books were removed from curriculums by two school boards this month.

The Mukilteo School Board in Washington state unanimously approved a resolution Monday to remove ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" from the required reading list for ninth-grade English/Language Arts, KING-TV reported.

And the McMinn County Board of Education in Tennessee voted unanimously Jan. 10 to remove ""Maus"" — a graphic novel about the Holocaust — from the district's curriculum, NBC News reported.

Why were the books removed?

As for ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" KING said at least one parent raised concerns that Harper Lee's classic novel is racially insensitive. Interestingly the station emphasized that the novel ""remains on the district-approved list and is not banned.""

District spokesperson Diane Bradford said in a separate KING story that ""if a teacher really wants to continue to teach it in their classroom that would be their option because it would remain on the approved novels list. Students who find the material offensive can opt out.""

""To Kill a Mockingbird"" focuses on a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the Jim Crow-era south. The classic novel won a Pulitzer Prize and has been studied in schools ever since its 1960 publication.

However, the school board received a request to remove the book from the curriculum since the ""N-word"" appears over 50 times ""with no context about its negative connotations,"" KING reported, adding that the complaint also says ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" marginalizes characters of color and celebrates ""white saviorhood.""

Superintendent Alison Brynelson supported the novel's removal from the required curriculum, the station said, citing the Jan. 24 school board agenda.

The Instructional Materials Committee — which consists of about 20 teachers, librarians, administrators, and parents — recommended the change, KING said. And while about 63% voted to remove the book from the required reading list, 68% voted to not remove the book from the approved novels list, the station added.

As for ""Maus,"" the sticking points were eight instances of profanity and an image of a nude woman, NBC News said.

Cartoonist Art Spiegelman's graphic novel is about his Jewish parents' experiences in Nazi concentration camps, the network noted, adding that the school district was looking to use the 1992 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel as an ""anchor text"" for eighth graders studying the Holocaust.

Board member Jonathan Pierce described himself as ""probably the biggest sinner and crudest person in this room"" but said the book didn't meet his ""standard,"" which he described as, ""Can I lay that in front of a child?"" NBC News said.

Pierce added that children ""need"" to know about the Holocaust and the ""suppression of certain ethnicities. It's not acceptable today. We've got to accept people for who and what they are. I’m just an old country school board member, and I think in our policy it says the decision stops with this board,"" the network reported.

The nude image in ""Maus"" depicts the dead body of Spiegelman's mother, who took her own life in 1968 at age 56, NBC News added.

Board member Tony Allman brought up Spiegelman's freelance cartoon work for ""Playboy"" and said, ""You can look at his history, and we’re letting him do graphics in books for students in elementary school. If I had a child in the eighth grade, this ain’t happening,"" the network said.

NBC News said another board member asked if vulgarities could be stripped from the graphic novel for student use, but a district lawyer said such an action could go beyond the ""fair use umbrella"" and suggested contacting the author for permission.

Spiegelman called the removal of his book ""Orwellian,"" the network said, citing a CNBC report.

But Christopher F. Rufo posted a thread on Twitter about the ""Maus"" controversy and provided images purportedly of McMinn school board minutes. In one image, board member Mike Cochran offers a detailed, nuanced argument for removing ""Maus."" In a second image, board member Rob Shamblin asks ""if ['Maus' has] been removed, it could be added back if there's no better alternative, I assume? I don't know what it's going to take to find an alternative."" Sharon Brown, school board chair, replies that ""it would probably mean we would have to move on to another module.""

Right or wrong?

Are both school boards right about their decisions? Are they both wrong? Is ""Maus"" legitimately problematic for young readers' eyes? Or is it actually ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rightfully on the outs? Or does it all come down to sociopolitical views and regional biases?

One Twitter commenter called the ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" removal ""absurd,"" adding that ""art should be challenging, forcing the reader to think."" But one Mukilteo district teacher in favor of removing the novel said students shouldn't have to “endure embarrassing and offensive language,” and a student added that ""it’s hurtful and it’s harmful"" to be forced to ""sit in that classroom and read derogatory terms.""

Fair media coverage?

It's worth noting that news organizations appear to be reporting the removal of ""Maus"" a bit differently — and with different energy — than the removal of ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""

A Google search Thursday afternoon for ""maus banned"" returned 22,300 items under the ""news"" subcategory. And nearly all the news stories on the first page, sorted by relevance, use a form of the word ""ban"" in their headlines.

Conversely, a Google search Thursday afternoon for ""to kill a mockingbird banned"" returned far fewer items — 8,040 — under the ""news"" subcategory. And hardly any of the news stories on the first page, sorted by relevance, use a form of the word ""ban"" in their headlines.

"Schumer: House to hand Senate impeachment article Monday; 'make no mistake,' a trial will happen","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will transmit the single article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced Friday.

Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, said in no uncertain terms that there will be an impeachment trial and a Senate vote on whether to convict Trump, whose term as president ended Wednesday when President Joe Biden was inaugurated.

""Make no mistake: A trial will be held in the United States Senate, and there will be a vote on whether to convict the president,"" Schumer said.

Schumer dismissed arguments advanced by some Republican lawmakers and legal experts that an impeachment trial for a former civil officer is unconstitutional once said officer has left office.

""It makes no sense whatsoever that a president or any official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then be permitted to resign so as to avoid accountability and a vote to disbar them from future office,"" Schumer argued. ""Makes no sense.""

Senate Democrats and Republicans are in the midst of negotiations on when the impeachment trial should start, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pushing for the trial to be delayed until February, according to multiple reports.

On Thursday, Politico's Playbook email reported that lawmakers were privately discussing a three-day impeachment trial for Trump, which would be the fastest of any trial for a president in U.S. history. However, Republicans want their impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers to have adequate time to prepare for the trial, which is why McConnell is reportedly asking for a delay.

""Senate Republicans are strongly united behind the principle that the institution of the Senate, the office of the presidency, and former President Trump himself all deserve a full and fair process that respects his rights and the serious factual, legal, and constitutional questions at stake,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""Given the unprecedented speed of the House's process, our proposed timeline for the initial phases includes a modest and reasonable amount of additional time for both sides to assemble their arguments before the Senate would begin to hear them.""

At least some Democrats are open to the possibility of delaying the impeachment trial.

Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told CNN on Friday that Democrats may be open to a quid pro quo where Republicans work to confirm Biden's Cabinet nominees before the trial starts, giving Trump's legal team time to mount a defense.

""I think Democrats will be open to considering a delay that allows former President Trump time to assemble his legal team and his defense for the impeachment trial if we are making progress on confirming the very talented, seasoned, and diverse team that President Joe Biden has nominated to serve in his cabinet,"" Coons said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/schumer-impeachment-trial-will-happen,2021-01-22
"Schumer says Senate will vote on ending the filibuster, puts pressure on Manchin to change his mind","Senate Democrats are ramping up pressure on Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) to support a change in Senate rules that would end the 60-vote filibuster requirement to pass a sweeping federal overhaul of U.S. elections and President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" agenda.



Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that a group of lawmakers would be meeting with Manchin to discuss options for killing the filibuster. He told CNN that Democrats were in discussions with the moderate holdouts throughout the holidays, lobbying them to change their position on the filibuster so they can ram through their agenda this year before the midterm elections in November.

""The bottom line is this: They must allow us to pass these two vital pieces of legislation, even if not a single Republican joins us,"" Schumer said, according to Reuters.

On Monday, the Democratic leader sent a letter to his colleagues announcing that the Senate will ""debate and consider changes to Senate rules"" if Republicans invoke the filibuster to block a Democratic election overhaul bill. The Freedom to Vote Act would override election integrity measures enacted by various Republican-controlled state legislatures, automatically register citizens to vote, and significantly expand early and mail-in voting.

Democrats say these reforms are necessary to protect the right to vote and democracy in America. Republicans say the bill would weaken voter ID laws, create new opportunities for election fraud, and unconstitutionally revoke the power of states to determine their own election laws. The Senate GOP conference is united in opposition to the bill, depriving Democrats of the 60 votes they need to overcome a legislative filibuster.

""Over the coming weeks, the Senate will once again consider how to perfect this union and confront the historic challenges facing our democracy,"" Schumer wrote in his letter. ""We hope our Republican colleagues change course and work with us. But if they do not, the Senate will debate and consider changes to Senate rules on or before January 17, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to protect the foundation of our democracy: free and fair elections.""

Schumer's letter referred to the upcoming anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, linking the effort by former President Donald Trump to have Congress invalidate Biden's electoral victory in several states to the violence on that day and subsequent efforts by GOP-majority state legislatures to tighten election rules.



""Make no mistake about it: this week Senate Democrats will make clear that what happened on January 6th and the one-sided, partisan actions being taken by Republican-led state legislatures across the country are directly linked, and we can and must take strong action to stop this anti-democratic march,"" Schumer wrote.

He directly called for an end to the legislative filibuster, declaring, ""The weaponization of rules once meant to short-circuit obstruction have been hijacked to guarantee obstruction.""

It's a far cry from Schumer's position in 2005, when he denounced attempts to end the filibuster as a ""doomsday for democracy.""

In 2005, Schumer Said Eliminating the Filibuster Would “Be A Doomsday For Democracy” www.youtube.com

Schumer may hem and haw about the filibuster as much as he likes, but as long as Democrats require 51 votes to change the Senate's rules, Democrats are at the mercy of both Manchin and Sinema, who have each repeatedly reiterated their opposition to killing the filibuster.

Speaking with reporters Tuesday, Manchin softly criticized the idea of creating a one-time exception to the filibuster to pass the election overhaul bill.



""Any time there's a carve-out, you eat the whole turkey. There's nothing left,"" Manchin said.

He went on to say he supports the goal of the Freedom to Vote act, but also wants to preserve the institution of the Senate.



""I just believe that a bedrock of democracy is voting and we have to do what we can in order to preserve that. But let's just see. Conversations are still ongoing,"" he added.

Manchin did say Democrats have discussed several options for changing the filibuster, including changing the way senators may invoke a filibuster or requiring that the opposition continuously hold the floor with speeches to keep a filibuster going, as seen in the 1939 film ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.""



""The need for us to protect democracy as we know it and the Senate as it has operated for 232 years are extremely, extremely high bars that we must be very careful if we're willing to cross those. So I'm talking, I'm not agreeing to any of this to an extent. I want to talk and see all the options we have open,"" he said.

Scientist who signed influential statement condemning lab-leak 'conspiracy theory' now calls for 'thorough investigation' into COVID-19 origins,"One of the leading voices in the scientific community who was among the first to come out strongly against the coronavirus lab-leak hypothesis, calling it a ""conspiracy theory"", now says a thorough investigation into the origins of COVID-19 is needed.

Dr. Peter Palese, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, was one of the 27 prominent public health scientists who signed a February 19, 2020 statement denouncing ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" The statement was published in the Lancet, a highly respected medical journal. It was organized by EcoHealth Alliance president Peter Daszak, who drafted the statement to condemn the lab-leak hypothesis and recruited several of the scientists who signed it.

EcoHealth Alliance receives millions of dollars in research grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) under director Dr. Anthony Fauci's leadership. Between 2014 and 2019, Daszak's nonprofit funneled $600,000 of those grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology — the lab at the center of the lab-leak hypothesis — to study bat coronaviruses.

Daszak's Lancet statement proclaimed that individuals questioning the supposed natural origin of COVID-19 were creating ""fear, rumours, and prejudice."" This became the dominant media narrative throughout 2020 and big tech social media companies took action to deplatform all dissenting opinions, labeling claims that contradicted the ""science"" as ""misinformation."" A bombshell Vanity Fair exposé on the investigation of the origins of COVID-19 noted that the Lancet statement ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

But now there is renewed interest in the lab-leak hypothesis as scientists have been unable to find evidence conclusively proving that the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurred naturally. Many of the people who last year attempted to stamp out discussion of this ""conspiracy theory"" are now reconsidering their opinions, including top White House health adviser Fauci.

Dr. Palese can be counted among those reevaluating their opinions.

""I believe a thorough investigation about the origin of the Covid-19 virus is needed,"" he told the Daily Mail. ""A lot of disturbing information has surfaced since the Lancet letter I signed, so I want to see answers covering all questions.""

Another signatory of the letter reached by the Daily Mail, Dr. Jeremy Farrar — director of the London-based nonprofit Wellcome Trust — said that while it is still ""most likely"" the virus came from an animal ""'there are other possibilities which cannot be completely ruled out and retaining an open mind is critical.""

Farrar is one of the scientists that was in communication with Dr. Fauci in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Emails belonging to Fauci that were made public through a records request by BuzzFeed News and the Washington Post reveal that on Feb. 1, 2020 Farrar organized a conference call that Fauci participated in discussing the origins of the coronavirus. Notes on the content of the call sent in further emails were redacted, but what is evident from Fauci's emails and by the public behavior of those involved is that since the call there was an organized messaging campaign to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis.

The fact that Palese, Farrar, Fauci, and others now acknowledge that the lab-leak hypothesis shouldn't be ruled out, even if it is unlikely, demands the question, why did they work so hard to condemn it as a conspiracy theory? Why didn't they push back against censorship by social media companies? Who will be held accountable for harms done if the lab-leak hypothesis proves true?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientist-who-signed-influential-statement-condemning-lab-leak-conspiracy-theory-now-calls-for-thorough-investigation-into-covid-19-origins,2021-06-05
SCOTUS rejects bid to revive Bill Cosby's prosecution,"On Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) rejected a bid from prosecutors to review the overturning of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction.

During the summer of 2021, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the 2018 sexual assault conviction of the famed actor.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also barred future prosecutions on the charges upon which Cosby was previously convicted.

In 2018, Cosby — who is currently 84-years old — was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison, but the conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial violation of the comedian’s due process rights, CNN reported.

Jennifer Bonjean, a lawyer representing Cosby, praised SCOTUS’ decision to uphold the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision.

She said, “Under the unique facts of the case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that [the former district attorney] had made an unconditional promise of non-prosecution, and that Cosby had relied on that promise to his detriment, namely foregoing his Fifth Amendment guarantees and testifying at four days of depositions, and that as a matter of fundamental fairness, the promise should be enforced.”

In 2005, when Andrea Constand alleged that Cosby had “drugged and sexually molested” her, prosecutors stuck a deal with Cosby’s legal team that he would not face criminal charges so long as he sat for a deposition in a civil case filed by Constand.

Over a decade later, prosecutors said they “did not feel bound by this decision, and decided to prosecute Cosby notwithstanding that prior undertaking.”

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court subsequently found that the previous deal offered to Cosby removed the possibility of prosecution “for all time.”

At the time of this ruling, Cosby’s publicist praised the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justices “for following the rules of law and protecting the Constitutional Rights of ALL American Citizens.”

The publicist said, “Mr. Cosby’s Constitutional Rights were a ‘reprehensible bait and switch’ by Kevin Steele, Judge Steve T. O’Neill and their cohorts. This is truly a victory for Mr. Cosby but it shows that cheating will never get you far in life and the corruption that lies within Montgomery County District’s Attorney Office has been brought to the center stage of the world.”

SCOTUS opted to uphold the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision by declining prosecutors’ request to hear their case and reinstate Cosby’s conviction, Fox News reported.

Cosby originally had vowed to serve the entirety of his sentence and maintain his innocence.

In his first interview from prison, Cosby said, “When I come up for parole, they’re not going to hear me say that I have remorse. I was there. I don’t care what group of people come along and talk about this when they weren’t there. They don’t know.”

"In huge boon to GOP election security efforts, SCOTUS upholds Arizona voting rules","The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld two Republican-backed voting rules in Arizona, providing a boon to ongoing Republican efforts in other states to pass laws aimed at ensuring the integrity of elections.

What happened?

In a 6-3 decision, the top court determined that two Arizona voting rules — one requiring that provisional ballots be tossed if submitted at the wrong precinct and another making it a felony for third parties to collect and submit another person's ballot — do not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The case landed before the high court after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the voting rules disproportionately burdened minority voters, thus violating the law. But in Thursday's decision, the court's band of conservative justices overturned the lower court's ruling.

""Arizona's out-of-precinct policy and HB 2023 do not violate [Section 2] of the VRA,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority opinion. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.

In general, the court found that Arizona law ""makes it quite easy for residents to vote,"" and when restrictions are applied, the state goes out of its way to alleviate any substantive burdens to voting. Any burdens that remain are commonplace and not discriminatory, the court concluded.

""Having to identify one's own polling place and then travel there to vote does not exceed the 'usual burdens of voting,'"" Alito argued. ""On the contrary, these tasks are quintessential examples of the usual burdens of voting.""

He added elsewhere that the ""mere fact there is some disparity in impact does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote.""

Besides, states have a legitimate interest in guarding against fraudulent activity, the justice added.

""Fraud can affect the outcome of a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight,"" he wrote. ""Fraud can also undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.""

Dissenting from the majority were liberal Justices Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor.

Why does it matter?

The court's decision comes as Republican-controlled state legislatures across the country consider new laws to tighten election security. In response, Democrats have argued that the new measures are nothing more than voter suppression tactics.

President Joe Biden's Justice Department has even filed a lawsuit against the state of Georgia over such reforms. But the Supreme Court's Thursday ruling may foreshadow the DOJ's defeat.

On Thursday, the president called the ruling a ""broad assault against voting rights.""

""In a span of just eight years, the Court has now done severe damage to two of the most important provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 – a law that took years of struggle and strife to secure,"" Biden added.

On the other hand, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who appealed the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court, celebrated the ruling as ""a win for election integrity safeguards in Arizona and across the country.""

""Fair elections are the cornerstone of our republic, and they start with rational laws that protect both the right to vote and the accuracy of the results,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-upholds-arizona-voting-rules,2021-07-01
"Seattle police won't enforce certain traffic violations any longer over racism, equity concerns. But some cops fear new rules will embolden criminals.","While Seattle police no longer will enforce certain non-criminal traffic violations due to racism and equity concerns, officers told conservative commentator Jason Rantz that the new policies will embolden lawbreakers to commit more serious crimes.

What are the details?

Interim Chief Adrian Diaz announced Friday that the following violations no longer can be the sole reason officers pull over folks, Rantz noted in a piece for KTTH-AM:

Expired or missing vehicle registration;

Issues with display of registration plates;

Items hanging from rear-view mirror and cracks in windshield (though actual visual obstructions such as snow, fog, non-transparent material, or shattered windshields will be enforced); and

Bicycle helmet violations.

""We know there are concerns [that] these violations disproportionately fall on those who are unable to meet financial demands,” Diaz wrote, according to Rantz's piece.

However, folks still can be cited for the aforementioned violations if officers pull them over for more serious reasons, Rantz reported.

Believe it or not, Seattle Inspector General Lisa Judge in a May 2021 memo called for a total ban on low-level traffic stops, KTTH reported, adding that she claimed police pose a risk to black drivers they pull over.

“Police and community are destined to continue the same cycle of traffic stops gone wrong,” Judge wrote, according to the station. “To that end, the issue of what and how conduct should be policed is perhaps as important as other root causes, such as institutional racism and subconscious bias. For safety of both officers and the public and for racial fairness, SPD should seek to eliminate routine traffic stops for civil and non-dangerous violations.”

The police union successfully pushed back against Judge's radical demands, Rantz said, yet fears remain that such proposals aren't necessarily dead but just delayed.

And even though the move was modified to eliminate only certain low-level traffic stops, Rantz wrote that those very stops — e.g., expired registrations, issues with tags — can signal more serious criminal activity afoot.

'Catastrophic impacts' to public safety

“If we stopped conducting traffic stops for all traffic violations in the city, doing so would have catastrophic impacts to our community’s public safety interests,” Seattle Police Officers Guild President Mike Solan told Rantz on his KTTH radio show. “Moreover, if you were to compare today’s decision to what Inspector Judge first publicly said in May, today’s decision is a reasonable approach. Having said this, this decision will still have negative impacts to our community’s public safety interests and still supports the preposterous notion that police still engage in bias policing with traffic stops.”

Rantz reported that a source with ""close knowledge of the negotiations around these policies"" said that the Seattle Police Officers Guild vigorously fought against no longer enforcing all traffic stops for minor violations, arguing that the outcome would be a ""lawless free-for-all.""

Emboldening criminals

One officer told Rantz that policies removing officers' enforcement parameters will only lead to trouble.

""Auto theft is off the rails, and they switch plates all the time, or take them off and make fake temporary tags,” the officer noted to Rantz in regard to taking problematic vehicle plates off the enforcement list.

A second officer told Rantz of much scarier possible scenarios.

“Right off the top of my head, anybody who has kidnapped a child and takes their license plates off … or they have a matching vehicle for a bank robbery, and they’ve taken the license plates off … we’re not going to be able to stop them,” the officer noted to Rantz. “And the criminals already take the license plates off of stolen cars to go commit other crimes like armed robberies and carjackings.”

More from Rantz's KTTH piece:

What’s worse, thanks to statewide police reform bills, police can only detain suspects with probable cause. The previous standard was reasonable suspicion. For example, if an officer suspects a car is stolen due to missing registration, a suspicious-looking driver, and even a bullet hole in a windshield, they couldn’t detain the motorist because it wouldn’t meet probable cause.

“I can’t tell you how many gangsters have cars that were shot up three weeks ago but [have] nothing to do with a current crime,” a third officer told Rantz.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/seattle-police-wont-enforce-certain-traffic-violations-any-longer-racism-equity,2022-01-18
Biden admin invents 'Securities and Environment Commission' out of thin air to force climate agenda on US businesses,"The Securities and Exchange Commission — a government agency established in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash to protect investors and maintain fair markets — may soon become a key player in imposing President Biden's climate agenda.

In a 3-to-1 vote last week, unelected Democratic bureaucrats who serve as the agency's commissioners voted without authorization from Congress to impose sweeping new rules that require all publicly traded companies to disclose how their business affects ""climate change.""

According to a press release issued by the SEC, the proposed rules would require businesses to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions along with any and all information relevant to ""climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations, or financial condition.""

In a lengthy statement of dissent, the SEC's lone Republican commissioner, Hester Peirce, quipped that with the move, the agency essentially re-invented itself as the ""Securities and Environment Commission"" without any say from the American people.

Peirce emphatically argued that the new rules will hamstring businesses with unnecessary and burdensome regulations that will ultimately harm investors and the economy. And besides that, she asserted, the SEC has no authority to enact such rules, seeing as Congress never gave the agency such broad power.

""Congress gave us an important mission — protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and fostering fair, orderly, and efficient markets — and granted us sufficient regulatory authority to achieve that mission,"" she wrote. ""This proposal steps outside our statutory limits by using the disclosure framework to achieve objectives that are not ours to pursue.""

Despite the clear overreach, Democrats in Washington appear happy to support the move since the rules fit with the party's aggressive approach to the climate. Many, too, likely see pressuring corporations as an effective step in accomplishing their goals.

In short, the new rules aim to expose companies' track records in keeping with progressives' climate change agenda in hopes that investors will pressure the companies to adopt more environmentally friendly policies and practices.

""It will make it possible for all interested stakeholders, including shareholders, to then push companies to take real action,"" climate change activist Bill Weihl, formerly of Google and Facebook, told the New York Times.

Speaking with CNBC, Washington-based climate change think tank director Claire Healy celebrated the possibility that carbon-intensive companies may ""lose out over time"" as pressure mounts and investors are encouraged to divest.

Conservatives, however, have raised the alarm over the proposed rules, noting among other things that they would carry with them an exorbitant cost. Part of that cost would result from the need to hire third-party regulators to gather all the climate-related data the new rules require.

""No longer can a company simply disclose in free form how it imagines climate regulations or bad weather might conceivably affect its business,"" author and political commentator Steve Milloy wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Examiner. ""Instead, companies will be required to have independent certified auditors, think climate accountants, attest to the veracity of the new corporate disclosures.""

""In general, this rule will be as costly and burdensome on all businesses as the impact of Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley,"" TheBlaze's Daniel Horowitz warned.

Though Milloy, for his part, seemed confident that the Supreme Court would immediately strike down the rules should they be finalized.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sec-proposes-new-climate-disclosure-rules,2022-03-28
Biden's energy secretary doesn't deny tax hikes to pay for massive infrastructure plan will 'hit the middle class hard',"Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm didn't deny claims over the weekend that tax hikes associated with the Biden administration's more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan could have a ruinous economic effect on middle-class Americans.

During an interview on Sunday, CNN host Jake Tapper confronted the energy secretary on the issue, citing concerns among Republicans and moderate congressional Democrats about the economic impact of raising taxes.

In the lead-up to his question, Tapper specifically referred to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial that asserted the taxes would ""hit the middle class hard — in the value of their 401(k)s, the size of their pay packets, and what they pay for goods and services."" He added that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the tax increases ""dangerously misguided.""

To pay for the massive spending package — which goes far beyond funding highways, bridges, and roads to finance a laundry list of progressive political priorities — the administration has proposed the largest tax hike in almost three decades. One of the major changes getting media attention is a proposed increase of the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.

Biden Energy Sec Doesn't Deny Biden's Tax Hikes Will “Hit The Middle Class Hard"" When Confronted youtu.be

In response, Granholm remarkably didn't raise an objection to the specific claim. Rather, she dodged the question by claiming the administration's corporate tax rate figure is ""fair"" and a ""reasonable middle.""



""You recall that just a few years ago the tax rate for corporate taxes was 35%,"" Granholm said. ""When Donald Trump passed his corporate and tax cuts for the wealthy package, he dropped it to a point that nobody was even asking for, which was 21%. So what Joe Biden is saying is, let's put it to a reasonable middle. Let's put us in line with other industrial nations, which is 28%.""

The energy secretary then hit back at criticisms by saying, ""If you don't like this, then come and tell us how you would pay for it.""

""Of the polling that's been done out there on this, more people support paying for infrastructure rather than racking up deficits than not, and that includes Republicans,"" she argued. ""People know that you can't just continue to spend without paying for it. And so what Joe Biden wants to do is to do it in a fair way.""

Earlier in the interview, Granholm made it clear that the administration would be perfectly happy to move the legislation through Congress without a single Republican vote, much like Democrats did with Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

"Security guard shot, killed during robbery of TV news crew","A former police officer turned security guard was gunned down while protecting a TV news crew in Oakland, California. Kevin Nishita succumbed to his gunshot injuries and passed away. A reward is being offered for information that leads to the arrest of the gunman.

On Nov. 24, a KRON-TV news team was covering the aftermath of a smash-and-grab robbery where 12 thieves raided a clothing store. At 12:20 p.m., an assailant allegedly attempted to steal KRON's camera equipment. Nishita — who was providing security for the TV news crew — attempted to protect the KRON employees, but a gunman shot the security guard.

Nishita was shot in the lower abdomen, and rushed to the Highland Hospital. He was in critical condition and needed emergency surgery. Sadly, Nishita passed away at 4:39 a.m. on Saturday.



An onlooker was hit by bullet shrapnel, according to the Oakland Police Department. He was taken to a hospital, and is listed in stable condition.

The Oakland Police Department released a photo of the suspect's vehicle: a 2004–2008 Acura TL, white, 4-door, with a sunroof and no front license plate.

A reward of $32,500 is being offered to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest of the shooter. KRON and its parent company, Nexstar Media Inc.; Nishita's employer, Star Protection Agency; and the Oakland Police Department donated to the reward fund.

Investigators with Oakland Police Department's Homicide Section are asking anyone with information to contact them at (510) 238-3426.



Nishita leaves behind a wife, two children, and three grandchildren.

Prior to working as a security guard, Nishita served as a police officer at the Oakland Housing Authority, Hayward Police, San Jose Police, and the Colma Police departments.

Tributes poured in from police departments in the area.

""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of retired Sergeant Kevin Nishita. On 11/24/21, Kevin was shot while providing security as an armed guard in Oakland. He was rushed to a local hospital for medical attention and succumbed to his injuries this morning,"" the Colma Police Department said on social media.

The San Jose Police Department released a statement on the murder of one of their former officers.

It is with great sadness and broken hearts that we are sharing the news of the passing of former San José Police Officer Kevin Nishita #3740. On November 24, 2021, Kevin was working a security detail for a local news crew in the City of Oakland when he was shot during an attempted robbery. He was taken to a local hospital with a life-threatening injury, he remained in critical condition until today when he succumbed to his injury.

Kevin was employed by the City of San José as a Police Officer from 2001-2012. During his time with us he worked as a Gang Investigations detective as well as working our Gaming/Vice Unit. In addition to his Police assignments, Kevin also spent some time representing his peers as a director with the San José Police Officers Association. In 2012 he joined the Colma Police Department.



San José Chief of Police Anthony Mata said, ""We are heartbroken and mourning the passing of retired Colma Police Department Sergeant Kevin Nishita. Kevin was part of our San José Police family for eleven years wearing the San José Police patch with great pride.""

""His contagious smile, passion to serve others, and an unmatched work ethic embodied the best of all of us,"" Mata continued. ""As a patrol officer, gang detective, and as a person, Kevin modeled bravery, kindness, and dedication helping make San José a better place for everyone.""

""We must work together and stay committed to stop senseless violence and the loss of precious life and hold those committing these acts accountable,"" he added.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Nishita family during this difficult time as we honor Kevin's memory. Our flags will remain at half-staff until his funeral,"" Mata concluded. ""Our sincerest condolences to the Nishita family, he leaves behind a wife, children, and grandchildren. He touched many of us and will not be forgotten by those us who still called him friend at the San José Police Department. Godspeed.""

KRON employees reacted to the tragic shooting death by praising Nishita.

""Words cannot express my heartbreak. Kevin Nishita was a good man who took his job seriously. He kept me and my colleagues safe. He did not deserve this. He and his family will be forever in my prayers,"" said KRON reporter Maureen Kelly.

Sen. Josh Hawley says  'Biden's entire defense and foreign policy team must resign',"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in a tweet Wednesday that President Joe Biden is responsible for ""the worst foreign policy debacle since Vietnam"" and that the president's defense and foreign policy team needs to resign.

""This is the worst foreign policy debacle since Vietnam, due to Joe Biden. He has lost the confidence of the American people and the ability to lead. Biden's entire defense and foreign policy team must resign, and there must be a full congressional inquiry,"" the Republican lawmaker tweeted.

""In the immediate term, we must focus on getting Americans trapped in Afghanistan out safely. That should be our top priority,"" he said in another tweet.

The Taliban has swiftly taken over Afghanistan and the U.S. is currently scrambling to evacuate American citizens and others from the country.



Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said during a Wednesday press briefing that the swift collapse of the Afghan army and government had not been anticipated.

""There was nothing that I or anyone else saw that indicated a collapse of this army and this government in 11 days,"" he said.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that a ""fair amount"" of the defense materials supplied to Afghanistan by the U.S. have fallen into the Taliban's hands.

President Biden indicated during an ABC News interview that there was not a way for the U.S. to withdraw ""without chaos ensuing."" Biden remarked that ""the idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens.""

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are requesting a classified briefing or call next week with the Gang of Eight regarding various aspects of the situation in Afghanistan.

In a letter to President Biden, the Republican congressional leaders said that they want to learn about ""The number and location of U.S. persons currently located in Afghanistan, and the methodology to determine such a number and location."" They also want to be briefed on ""the Administration's plan to evacuate U.S. persons outside of Kabul who cannot travel safely to the city,"" and other similar issues.

Sen. Kennedy says President Biden 'oughta hide his head in a bag' over botched Afghanistan withdrawal,"Sen. John Kennedy issued a video statement on Tuesday in which he blasted ""stunning incompetence"" as the U.S. seeks to pull out from Afghanistan.

""President Biden chose to withdraw from Afghanistan, but there's no reason it had to be so chaotic,"" he said.

The Republican lawmaker from Louisiana described it as the ""biggest terrorist victory since 9/11"" and said that ""jihadists who wanna hurt this country and its people all over the world are reinvigorated today.""

""This was humiliating. It was an embarrassment. The president oughta hide his head in a bag,"" Kennedy declared.

As the U.S. seeks to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban has been rapidly taking over the country.



National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that a ""fair amount"" of the defense materials America gave Afghanistan have fallen into the Taliban's hands.

Kennedy is only one of the chorus of Republican voices decrying the president over the debacle unfolding in Afghanistan.

Nikki Haley, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., said during an interview on Fox News that Biden ""failed miserably"" and ""humiliated America.""

""In just a few hours, literally, Biden destroyed the progress, the relationships, and everything we had done the last 20 years in Afghanistan,"" Haley said.

""Thousands of Americans are stranded in Afghanistan with terrorists hunting them down,"" Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York tweeted Tuesday.

""I think it's fair to say that President Biden and his merry band of woke-aristas have broken a lotta plates in their first 10 months. That's why his poll numbers are going down like a fat guy on a seesaw. Everything from Afghanistan, to inflation, to the border crisis, to his handling of COVID,"" Kennedy said.

The Republican lawmaker has served as a senator from Louisiana since 2017.

""I think the president and his people just don't trust the American people to make their own decisions,"" Kennedy said. ""President Biden and, and his woker friends think that they're smarter and more virtuous than the American people, that the American people can't manage their lives without these edicts from Washington.""

President Biden's job approval rating is underwater in some polls, like The Economist/YouGov and Politico-Morning Consult, though other polls paint a less grim picture of public sentiment, like a CNN poll conducted by SSRS that indicated 50% approve and 49% disapprove of Biden's handling of his job.

Less than one year into a four-year term, the Biden administration has already faced heavy criticism on a multitude of fronts.

Former President Donald Trump issued a statement on Wednesday in which he asked if people miss him yet.

Senate Democrats introduce bill make DC a state and effectively expand their Senate majority,"Senate Democrats on Wednesday reintroduced a bill to make Washington, D.C., a state, an effort supported by President Joe Biden.

The legislation reintroduced today was first drafted and proposed in 2013. It would give citizens of the District of Columbia full authority over local issues and grant them full representation in Congress, the Hill reported.

""This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue; it's an American issue because the lack of fair representation for D.C. residents is clearly inconsistent with the values on which this country was founded,"" Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), the bill's sponsor, said.

Proponents for D.C. statehood argue that the city's population of 712,000 residents is larger than small states like Vermont or Wyoming and comparable to others including Deleware and Alaska. They note that D.C. residents pay the highest per-capita federal income taxes in the U.S., that the city receives between 25% and 30% of its budget from the federal government, and that the only representation the district has in Congress is the non-voting Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton. The issue at hand is D.C. residents in support of statehood believe they are being taxed without representation.

Opponents of D.C. statehood raise constitutional concerns before discussing the merits of whether D.C. should be a state. The Department of Justice has previously advised Congress that it lacks the power to grant D.C. statehood. Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that Congress retains the power ""to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of Government of the United States."" The District of Columbia was founded after Maryland and Virginia ceded territory to the federal government that was accepted by Congress for the purpose of creating the nation's capital. The creation of a state government, critics say, would interfere with Congress' exclusive powers over the District.

The response to that argument from D.C. statehood advocates such as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is that the Constitution sets a maximum size for the District, ""ten miles square,"" but does not prohibit Congress from shrinking that area. ""Creating the new state will require a simple reduction in the size of the federal district to an unpopulated area which includes the US Capitol, the National Mall, museums, some federal office buildings, the White House, the Supreme Court, and major national monuments,"" a pro-statehood website set up by Mayor Bowser states.

Regardless of the constitutional questions, it is unlikely the bill will pass, even in a 50-50 Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes. To overcome a filibuster, Democrats supporting the bill will need to win over at least 10 Republicans, who are not inclined to vote to admit two new likely Democratic senators representing D.C. into the chamber, strengthening the Democratic majority.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-democrats-dc-statehood-senate-majority,2021-01-27
Senate Democrats demand answers from Biden over critical COVID pandemic failure: 'Either knew or should have known',"A group of Senate Democrats wrote President Joe Biden's top COVID-19 pandemic adviser last week and demanded answers for obvious shortcomings in Biden's pandemic response.

The concerns outlined in the letter stand in stark contrast to Biden's October 2020 promise to ""shut down the virus.""

What does the letter say?

The group of Senate Democrats sent a letter to White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients on Thursday, demanding answers for the Biden administration's failure to take proactive steps to increase COVID testing.

The Democrats — Sens. Jacky Rosen (Nev.), Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Jon Ossoff (Ga.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) — demanded to know ""why the Administration failed to take more significant steps earlier to increase access to at-home tests.""

""Across America, there are lines for city blocks long to get COVID testing, signs in pharmacies saying they are out of rapid tests, hospitals operating under crisis standards of care, health care staff and first responders falling ill, and millions of people who are exhausted from the toll this pandemic has had,"" the letter states.

The letter goes on to say:

While we fully recognize the productive steps this Administration has taken to encourage vaccination, ensure ready access to vaccines, and increase options to treat the virus, far too many measures – such as increasing access to home-based testing – have been reactive, rather than proactive.



This Administration either knew or should have known that testing shortages were occurring across the country over the past several months, and with the full expectation that the virus would likely mutate into a new variant steps to increase testing access should have happened before the current wave hit, not several weeks into the surge, with resources still not available until later this month or beyond.



Last month, Vanity Fair reported that Biden rejected a plan in October that outlined how to mass produce and distribute at-home COVID-19 tests before Christmas. Biden, however, denied that his administration rejected the plan.

How did the White House respond?

A White House official told CNN that administration officials ""are in contact with our colleagues at the Hill about a range of issues related to our COVID-19 response, and share their goal of expanding access to free, at home testing.""

However, the official also downplayed the problem around lack of tests.

""While we are not where we would like to be with at home testing, neither are most countries due to unprecedented demand,"" the official said.

Last month, Biden announced a plan to distribute 500 million at-home COVID tests. Last week, he announced the government would procure another 500 million for a total of 1 billion tests. However, Americans will not be able to order the tests until later this week, and the tests should arrive one to two weeks after they are ordered.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-democrats-letter-biden-covid-tests,2022-01-16
"Senate report on Jan. 6 riot calls on Congress to fund the police, identifies security failures that led to attack","The United States Senate released its bipartisan report on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot Tuesday, highlighting the ""security, planning, and response failures"" of the U.S. Capitol Police and the Capitol Police Board along with ""critical breakdowns involving several federal agencies"" before and during the events of that day.

The report was put together by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Committee on Rules and Administration. It is the first and so far only bipartisan review of how rioters trespassed at the U.S. Capitol, ransacked government offices, stole property, assaulted and severely injured Capitol Police officers, and sought to stop a joint session of Congress from carrying out its constitutional duty to certify the Electoral College votes for president and vice president of the United States.

The Senate report made several recommendations, including to give the Capitol Police chief more authority to respond to crises, to give law enforcement better planning and equipment — with additional congressional funding — and to make intelligence sharing between federal agencies more efficient.

""The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an attack on democracy itself. Today's joint bipartisan congressional oversight report from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Rules Committee details the security and intelligence failures in the days leading up to the attack, the lack of preparedness at the Capitol, and the slow response as the attack unfolded,"" Homeland Security ranking member Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said. ""We make specific recommendations to address key failures in the Capitol Police Board structure and processes; ensure Capitol Police has the training and equipment necessary to complete its mission; update how the intelligence agencies assess and issue intelligence bulletins, particularly as it relates to social media; enhance communications between the chain of command at the Department of Defense; and ensure timely and effective cooperation and coordination amongst federal, state, and local law enforcement. We must address these failures and make the necessary reforms to ensure this never happens again.""

""Thanks to the heroic actions of U.S. Capitol Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, the National Guard and others — rioters on January 6th failed to achieve their goal of preventing the certification of a free and fair presidential election. The events of January 6th were horrific, and our bipartisan investigation identified many unacceptable, widespread breakdowns in security preparations and emergency response related to this attack,"" committee Chairman Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said. ""Our report offers critical recommendations to address these failures and strengthen security for the Capitol to prevent an attack of this nature from ever happening again.""

The report found that federal law enforcement agencies, namely the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, failed to warn of potential violence on Jan. 6 despite known online calls for violence at the Capitol on open-sources like social media platforms. These agencies did not find such online posts to be credible. The divisions of USCP responsible for collecting intelligence on possible threats likewise ""failed to fully incorporate this information into all of its internal assessments about January 6 and the Joint Session."" Failure to share information across various law enforcement agencies was a serious problem that led police to be caught off guard when Trump's supporters formed a mob and breached the Capitol.

USCP also did not appear to develop a plan for how officers would be staffed during the Joint Session and front-line officers were not given ""effective protective equipment or training"" to deal with a crowd as big as the one that gathered in support of former President Donald Trump.

""These operational failures were exacerbated by leadership's failure to clearly communicate during the attack,"" the report said.

The National Guard's failure to respond to the riot was blamed on ""opaque processes and a lack of emergency authority.""

""As the attack unfolded, [the Department of Defense] required time to approve the request and gather, equip, and instruct its personnel on the mission, which resulted in additional delays,"" the report explained.

The Senate report recommended that the chief of USCP be given the ability to directly request assistance from the D.C. National Guard in emergency situations without waddling through bureaucratic red tape. It also calls for Congress to increase funding for Capitol Police training, equipment, and staff needs, among several other recommendations.

""This report lays out necessary reforms including passing a law to change Capitol Police Board procedures and improving intelligence sharing. I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to implement the recommendations in this report that are needed to protect the Capitol and, in turn, our nation,"" Rules Committee Chairwoman Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said.

""These recommendations are based on an extensive fact-finding effort that included interviews with key decision makers, firsthand accounts from law enforcement personnel, and the review of thousands of documents,"" ranking member Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said. ""Our focus now should be on immediately implementing these recommendations. We owe it to the brave men and women who responded that day to do everything we can to prevent an attack like this from ever happening again, and in every instance ensure that the Capitol Police have the training and equipment that they need.""

Upon release, the report was criticized by CNN and other media outlets for neglecting to directly blame then-President Trump for stoking violence.

Senate takes step toward exempting news media from antitrust law,"Legislation that would permit media outlets to form a cartel to negotiate with Big Tech companies and force them to share ad revenue passed out of Senate committee with bipartisan support Thursday, though not without objection from several conservative lawmakers and even progressive groups.

The bill, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, would permit ""eligible"" media companies to band together and collectively bargain for payments from tech platforms like Google and Facebook that ""acquire, crawl and index"" their content. Supporters of the bill say it will be a lifeline to dying local newspapers and broadcasters who will be able to ""reap the revenue they deserve from the content their journalists create."" Critics warn it could hurt competition and empower a handful of large media conglomerates to collude and set up effective paywalls that limit access to news and information, especially content from independent journalists or blogs.

""We are at great risk of losing our news reporting, because while U.S. newspapers ad revenue plummeted $37 billion in 2008 to less than $9 billion in 2020, Google and Meta — also known as Facebook — became digital advertising titans raking in billions in ad dollars while taking news content,"" bill sponsor Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Thursday morning during markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

“This is not about content, this is simply about negotiating prices,” she added.



Those supporting the bill insist it will help small news companies earn money by having Big Tech platforms pay to host and share their content. They pointed to declining newspaper revenue and the fact that more than 360 newspapers have closed since just before the start of the pandemic, according to the New York Times, as evidence the news industry needs help to survive.

""Today’s markup and vote was a major step towards getting small and local news publishers the fair compensation they deserve for their content,” said News/Media Alliance President & CEO David Chavern in a statement. News/Media Alliance is a lobbying group representing major news conglomerates that has pushed for Congress to pass the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act.



Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who initially opposed the bill, joined those in support and enabled the bill to pass after the committee adopted an amendment he said would protect conservative media outlets from online censorship.



""I agree that Big Tech exercises a concentration of power that I think is unknown in the history of mankind. And that concentration of power is regularly used to trample on the little guy,"" Cruz said.

His amendment would prevent media organizations in the cartel from discriminating against other publications based on ""size"" or ""views expressed."" It would also prevent media and tech companies from forming an agreement governing how a platform ""displays, ranks, distributes, suppresses, promotes, throttles, labels, filters, or curates the content of the eligible digital journalism providers"" and social media users, the Daily Caller reported.



""This amendment protects against this antitrust liability being used as a shield for censorship,"" Cruz said.

But other conservative lawmakers opposed to the bill raised have concerns about creating exemptions to antitrust law for certain media companies.

""This is a bill that troubles me because it links the financial incentives of big tech platforms and the new industry by requiring tech platforms to share their monopoly rents with the news industry, with news publishers, making publishers more dependent on big tech, not less,"" Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said at the committee meeting.



""This bill retains the fundamental flaw of attempting to improve competition by sanctioning the formation of cartels, something that our antitrust laws go out of their way to prohibit — something that our antitrust laws prohibit with criminal penalties attached to them,"" he added. ""And here we are rushing in to create them. To authorize them. To sanction them. To condone them. This is really troubling, where does it stop? If we do it for this industry, why wouldn't we do it for others?""

""This is a bill that troubles me ..."" youtu.be

To other critics, including some on the left, a major flaw of the bill is that many local newspapers are actually owned by large conglomerates. A consequence of many newspapers failing is that those that remained have been consolidated and are owned by a handful of big news corporations like McLatchy, NewsCorp, and Gannett. These conglomerates are represented by News/Media Alliance.

“While the JCPA has undergone extensive rewrites, it is still an antitrust exemption, a legal maneuver that has a history of failing to achieve beneficial goals. Allowing the largest media conglomerates – like Alden Global Capital, Gannett, Sinclair Broadcast Group, and News Corp – to collude on the terms of access and value of their content will hurt competition and make our news landscape worse, not better,"" said Lisa Macpherson, a senior policy analyst at the progressive nonprofit Public Knowledge.

""In a bill that is supposedly meant to encourage local journalism, there is no accountability for how the money is spent. Facebook and Google will fund more stock buybacks and executive bonuses than journalists’ salaries. It also introduces a precedent of payment for simply linking to information on the internet,"" Macpherson added.



But the ""most alarming"" aspect of the legislation, according to R Street Institute fellow Josh Withrow, is the potential for Congress to create an implicit ""link tax"" — a payment the government would force tech platforms to make to publishers for sharing their content.

""The clever thing about the bill is that it never mentions this link taxes, copyright, or any specific means of revenue sharing at all. However, in practice, we know that's what the companies are after because they've been shaking down Big Tech for similar results abroad, most successfully in Australia,"" Withrow told TheBlaze via email.

""The antitrust exemption in the bill specifically allows the news publishers to 'withhold' their content from Google and Facebook, and in practice the only way that's enforceable is if they claim an expanded 'ancillary copyright' that would include ownership of the links and snippets that the companies show in their 'news' sections,"" he explained.

While the legislation does not explicitly create a link tax or alter copyright protections for news content, Withrow said courts may later interpret the law to create one.



""[Publishers would] have to claim this in court, but the argument would be that Congress wouldn't give them negotiating power that wasn't enforceable. In practice, there's a real danger that if the courts go their way this would probably create an expansion of copyright that wouldn't be narrowly limited to just news companies or Facebook and Google,"" Withrow said.

A realized link tax could cripple conservative media outlets and other websites or blogs that link to news stories reported elsewhere.

""The concern is that it would discourage linking back to original reporting, which would have obviously deleterious effects on the basic ethics of journalism. Not to mention that if the copyright was expanded beyond news sites, it would make sites like Wikipedia totally useless,"" he told TheBlaze.

""I worry that the cartel would exclude smaller conservative outlets as 'not real news,' and the only conservative-ish outlets that seem likely to profit much from the link tax would be Fox News and [the Wall Street Journal],"" he added.

"'Senseless, irrational, cowardice bulls**t': HS track coach refuses to make his athletes wear masks — and says he got fired for it","A New Hampshire high school track coach said he was fired after staunchly refusing to make his athletes wear face masks during competitions as recommended by the state athletic association.

What are the details?

On Thursday afternoon, Bradley Keyes was still listed under ""outdoor track"" on Pembroke Academy's website, but he noted on his own school track website that he was fired.

""I just think people haven't pushed back, and I decided it was time to push back,"" he told WBZ-TV in a subsequent interview.

Keyes added to the station that he ""didn't give [the school] any real choice. I backed them into a corner. What I wanted was to make a point. I was hoping the word would get out some, and maybe there would be enough reaction that down the road, maybe in a few weeks or later, some of the restrictions would be changed.""

Keyes, who is not a teacher at Pembroke, told WBZ that he believes face masks on his athletes are fine when they ride a bus together but not while they're outside competing.

""I wear a mask where I have to. I'll wear a mask when I go into stores or any private business that wants me to,"" he added to the station. ""Based on what I read, honestly I don't believe they do much good.""

'Senseless, irrational, cowardice bulls**t'



Keyes explained on his website that when he heard most other schools accepted the state mask guidelines and made them requirements, he emailed Pembroke's athletic director for confirmation — and was told that indeed masks would be required for all races in all meets.

In addition, Keyes said he learned that ""masks will be 'required' to be worn DURING ALL WORKOUTS on the track during training — but with a wink and nod, athletes are told they can pull them down around their chins!""

He considered quitting on the spot but then simply decided to refuse to follow the mask mandate. Keyes informed athletic director Fred Vezina of his decision in a blunt letter in which the coach called the mask requirement ""senseless, irrational, cowardice bulls**t.""

""I'll come straight to the point,"" he told Vezina. ""I will not put kids on the track and tell them to run any races while wearing masks.""



Keyes added to athletic director that ""I will not stand up in front of the kids and lie to them and tell them that these masks are doing anything worthwhile out in an open field with wind blowing and the sun shining.""

He added that the policy is ""insane"" that plays on ""irrational fears and going along with the sheep.""

""Show me the data on infections, hospitalizations, and deaths for 14-18 year old athletes…"" Keyes also wrote in his letter. ""I keep hearing that we're following the science. There is no science behind these restrictions. No, this is not about protecting the athletes, or even their families, it's all about covering bureaucratic asses. I will not try to convince these kids that what's being done to them is right, fair, thoughtful, or sensible.""

Keyes — who was in his fourth year as Pembroke's track coach, according to WBZ — ended his letter by saying, ""Fire me if you must.""

The station said it reached out to Pembroke Academy for comment but didn't received a response.

One of the school's track athletes, junior David Testerman, told WBZ he loves training with Keyes and agrees with him that wearing masks while running isn't the greatest idea.

""It gets you really tired ... it's gonna get up to 80 degrees soon, and it's gonna be really hard for us to keep doing what we live to do,"" Testerman noted to the station.

Sha'Carri Richardson won't be competing in the Tokyo Olympics,"Sha'Carri Richardson was not included on the Olympic roster shared Tuesday by USA Track and Field which indicates that the American athlete who tested positive for a urinary metabolite of THC will not be competing in the upcoming Tokyo Games.

THC is ""the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, marijuana, and hashish,"" according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).

The Associated Press reported that in response to being questioned about how the athlete is taking news, Richardson's agent said, ""We haven't spoken about it at all. It was actually not a topic we focused on.""

Richardson had snagged a slot in the Olympics by achieving a win in the women's 100 meters during trials in June, according to CNN.

However, her positive test nullified her victory at the trials along with the accompanying slot for Tokyo in the 100, according to the AP. The athlete's suspension is slated to conclude prior to the start of the relay events on Aug. 5, which left open the possibly that she could compete on the 4x100 relay team. But she was not offered a slot.

The AP reported that the USATF noted in a statement that it was ""incredibly sympathetic toward Sha'Carri Richardson's extenuating circumstances"" and ""fully agrees"" that international rules pertaining to marijuana should be reexamined.

""So while our heartfelt understanding lies with Sha'Carri, we must also maintain fairness for all of the athletes who attempted to realize their dreams by securing a place on the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Team,"" the statement noted.

"Six GOP senators vote for Jan. 6 commission, but 54-35 vote fails to overcome filibuster","Six Republican senators broke with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Friday and voted for legislation that would create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

The final vote for the commission was 54 senators in favor and 35 against, short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster from the Republican minority. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and Susan Collins (R-Maine) voted for the commission with all present Democrats.

Two Democratic senators were absent. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is retiring after his current term, missed the vote for a family commitment but would have voted ""yes,"" a spokesman told NBC News.

The bill, which was negotiated by House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and ranking member Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.), passed in the House last week by a vote of 252-175, with 35 Republicans joining Democrats in favor.

The bipartisan agreement would have created a commission with 10 members, five appointed by each party, that had the power to issue subpoenas with the agreement of both the Democratic chair and Republican vice-chair or a majority vote of the committee's members.

Republican leadership came out in opposition to the commission, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) claiming it would be ""duplicative"" and ""potentially counterproductive"" given ongoing bipartisan investigations into the events of Jan. 6 and criminal investigations conducted by U.S. law enforcement. Sen. McConnell echoed McCarthy's concerns, called it a ""purely political exercise,"" and lobbied his Republican colleagues to oppose the bill.

Democrats and the media excoriated Republicans for opposing the bill, accusing them of covering-up what happened on Jan. 6 out of fealty to Trump.

Several Republicans feared the commission could be used by Democrats to politically bludgeon the Republican Party as the 2022 midterm elections approach. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told supporters in a video that the purpose of the commission was to damage Republicans.

""The Democrats control committees in the House; they control committees in the Senate. They can do investigations. Some of them already are. We're going to learn from that. Capitol Police has already done its own commission about what went wrong that day. We've already learned from that,"" Rubio said. ""So there's plenty of attention already being paid to this — not to mention that the media, who doesn't stop talking about it, they're also looking at it. So everyone's looking at it. There's no cover-up.""

""They have this thing that says in order to issue a subpoena, you need both the Republican and the Democratic side, evenly divided, to agree with it. But that's not the point for politics; you don't actually need the subpoena. All you need is a story out there saying, 'Congressman so-and-so -- they want to subpoena him or her, but they can't because the Republicans are blocking it,'"" he explained.

""And then the stories are going to be, number one, it creates this impression that maybe Congressman so-and-so did something wrong -- why would they want to subpoena him? And number two, the story will be 'Republicans are covering up the investigation into Congressman so-and-so.'""

But the Republicans who voted for the commission said an independent probe was needed for the truth about what happened on Jan. 6 to come out.

Sen. Romney said Wednesday ""Republicans would be seen as not wanting to let the truth come out"" if they voted against the bill. ""I don't believe that's what's the motivation but I think that's the perception,"" he added.

Sen. Murkowski lambasted her GOP colleagues who opposed the bill.

""We just can't pretend that nothing bad happened, or that people just got too excitable. Something bad happened. And it's important to lay that out,"" she told reporters Thursday evening.

""To be making a decision for the short-term political gain at the expense of understanding and acknowledging what was in front of us, on January 6th, I think we need to look at that critically,"" she said.

After the vote, Sen. Cassidy released a statement explaining why he voted ""yes,"" saying an independent commission would have guaranteed Republicans have ""equal power"" over the investigation's proceedings.

""Without this commission, there will still be an investigation. But it will be a House select-committee set up by Speaker Pelosi — the nature of which will be entirely dictated by Democrats and would stretch on for years,"" Cassidy said.

""I am concerned about Speaker Pelosi's role regarding the lack of adequate security at the Capitol on the day of the vote certification. It's hard to believe that an investigation entirely run by Democrats would fully evaluate this concern. We can be more confident that the independent commission would thoroughly investigate this issue,"" he continued.

""The investigations will happen with or without Republicans,"" Cassidy said. ""To ensure the investigations are fair, impartial, and focused on the facts, Republicans need to be involved.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/six-gop-senators-vote-for-jan-6-commission,2021-05-28
Slack yanks service from FAIR,"Slack, a platform that some companies use to enable workers to communicate with each other, has yanked its service away from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization that advocates for decreasing the level of immigration into the U.S.

Fox News reported that a Slack spokesperson noted in a statement that utilizing the service ""to encourage or incite hatred or violence against groups or individuals violates our Acceptable Use Policy and Terms of Service, and is antithetical to our values and the very purpose of Slack.""

""When we learn of an organization using Slack for illegal, harmful or other prohibited purposes, we conduct an investigation and take appropriate action in accordance with our policy,"" the spokesperson said, according to the outlet. ""We suspended the account in question, which is affiliated with a known hate group, after determining that it violated our policy. The use of Slack by hate groups runs counter to everything we believe in at Slack and is not welcome on our platform.""



FAIR president Dan Stein told Fox News Digital that the organization supports secure borders and an end to unlawful immigration.

""FAIR is a mainstream organization by historical standards. Basically, we want border security, border control, stop illegal immigration,"" Stein said. ""And we're not anti-immigrant. We love immigrants, but we want it to be moderated and a reasonably enforceable limit annually. Is this rocket science?""

9 million small businesses — nearly one-third of all in US — fear they won’t survive 2021,"Three in ten small businesses — or 9 million out of the estimated 30 million in the United States — fear they won't survive in the coming year without additional government assistance, according to a survey recently published by the Federal Reserve.

What are the details?

The Small Business Credit Survey, which was conducted last September and October and released last week, showcased the incredible burden the coronavirus pandemic has placed on America's small businesses, as 88% of the businesses surveyed reported that sales had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.

Nearly one-third of respondents reportedly told surveyors that without further financial help or a return to normal sales, their businesses would likely close for good.

Among minority-owned businesses, things were markedly worse. While in total, 57% of firms said their financial condition was ""fair"" or ""poor,"" that figure shot up to 79% for Asian-owned firms, 77% for black-owned firms, and 66% for Hispanic-owned firms.

The percentage of small firms carrying debt also increased to 79% from 71% the year before, and those carrying a debt burden north of $100,000 increased from 31% to 44% in 2020.

Nearly all businesses surveyed said they expected to face at least one more pandemic-related challenge over the next year. However, the two challenges most firms expected were ""weak demand for products/services"" and ""government-mandated restrictions or closures.""

What else?

The bleak outlook among small business owners in the country expressed late last year was confirmed by another survey released this month, which tracks small business optimism.

The National Federation of Independent Business published its January survey on Tuesday. It found that small business confidence is at an eight-month low. Furthermore, the number of small business owners expecting better conditions through the middle of the year has hit its lowest level since 2013.

It's difficult to be optimistic about business, added Randy George, owner of the Red Hen Baking Company in Vermont, noting that his business hasn't been allowed to have indoor dining since last April.

""We do have a lot of people coming to the window and getting sandwiches to go, but, it's a window,"" George said.

Commenting on the survey, Bill Dunkelberg, head of the NFIB, told Marketplace that the news is not just bad for small businesses, but could end up dragging down the entire economy.

When businesses expect sales to decline, ""that's going to feed back into their capital spending plans, and their inventory investment plans, and their hiring plans,"" he said.

Social conservatives strongly praise new Fairness in Women's Sports bill proposed by Gov. Kristi Noem,"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) has released the draft text of a new version of the ""Fairness in Women's Sports"" legislation she rejected earlier this year. The new bill, which was sent to reporters Tuesday, would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex.

“This is about fairness. Every young woman deserves an equal playing field where she can achieve success, but common sense tells us that males have an unfair physical advantage over females in athletic competition. It is for those reasons that only girls should be competing in girls’ sports,” Noem said. “Women have fought long and hard for equal athletic opportunities, and South Dakota will defend them, but we have to do it in a smart way.”

Controversy erupted last March when Noem opposed a previous version of this legislation, H.B. 1217, on the grounds that the way the state House bill was written was ""unrealistic in the context of collegiate sports."" At the time, the governor argued that flaws in the bill's design would make South Dakota vulnerable to litigation from out of state organizations like the NCAA.

Social conservative groups that backed H.B. 1217 accused Noem of betrayal and of gutting the bill when she issued a ""style and form"" revision of the legislation and sent it back to the state legislature with changes. The legislature ultimately rejected Noem's changes, and she vetoed the bill.

In its place, Noem issued two executive orders on Mar. 29 designed to keep gender dysphoric males from competing against girls at the K-12 and collegiate level. The new legislation proposed by Noem would codify her executive orders.

“Only female athletes, based on their biological sex, shall participate in any team, sport, or athletic event designated as being for females, women, or girls,” the draft text says. Noem's proposal defines “biological sex” as “the sex listed on the student's official birth certificate issued at or near the time of the athlete’s birth.”

The bill would also give any athlete that ""suffers direct or indirect harm"" as a result of a school that violates the law the right to take legal action for relief.



“This legislation does not have the problematic provisions that were included in last year’s House Bill 1217,” the governor said. ""Those flawed provisions would have led to litigation for our state, as well as for the families of young South Dakota athletes – male and female alike.”

The new transgender sports bill appears to be winning over at least some of Noem's conservative critics.

""No exaggeration: It's probably the strongest bill I've seen to date. Especially with the birth certificate stuff and the private causes of action,"" Jon Schweppe, the director of Policy and Government Affairs for the American Principles Project, said.

In a statement, APP President Terry Schilling, who had sharply criticized Noem for opposing H.B. 1217, praised her new proposal as well.

""We're pleased that Gov. Noem is finally taking action in South Dakota to adequately protect female athletes. Our initial impression of her proposed legislation is that it is a strong measure to defend the integrity of women's sports from K-12 to college. We encourage state lawmakers to support it and officially make South Dakota the tenth state to enshrine protections for women's sports into law,"" Schilling said.



He added that it was ""unfortunate"" Noem waited nine months after the issue first came up in the South Dakota legislature to release this proposal, criticizing her executive orders as ""toothless.""



""Although it's good to see her correcting her mistake, she missed a golden opportunity to show leadership on this issue. We hope she will learn from this experience and choose to stand up to woke business interests and leftist institutions the next time a similar fight arises. She still has much work to do to gain back conservatives' trust,"" Schilling said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-conservatives-strongly-praise-new-fairness-in-womens-sports-bill-proposed-by-gov-kristi-noem,2021-12-14
Social media divided over viral video that shows 2 officers breaking up a mall fight between a white teen and black teen,"A New Jersey police department is under fire after their response to a mall fistfight between two teens.

Viral video documenting the incident has social media divided, with some wondering why two officers cuffed a black teen while the other teen, a white male — who, according to the video, appears to have physically instigated the fight — casually watched, even sitting on a nearby couch while viewing the spectacle.

What are the details?

The fight broke out at Bridgewater Commons mall in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, on Saturday, and video captured the two boys arguing.

The black teen, 14-year-old Z'Kye Husain, said that the fight began when he stood up to the as-yet identified white teen for bullying a younger boy.

""“He was kind of saying, like, ‘You’re a little kid, you’re my little pet,’ and stuff like that,” he told WNBC-TV.

The white teen was seen in the video shouting at Z'Kye, pointing his finger in his face as an increasingly agitated Z'Kye began pushing his hand away.

The white teen appeared to then shove Z'Kye, prompting the two to begin throwing punches at one another.

The white teen then tackled Z'Kye onto the nearby couch as he continued swinging.

Z'Kye, in response, swung at the white teen, striking him several times.

After several moments, two Bridgewater police officers intervened and yanked the two boys apart.

One of the officers pushed the white teen onto the couch and assisted her partner in cuffing the black teen — who was pinned face-down on the ground at that point — while the white teen watched. The male officer was seen holding the teen to the floor with his knee on the teen's mid-back as the female officer assisted, plying her knee on the teen's upper back.

The officers were able to cuff the black teen without any incident, and the teen did not fight back.

The white teen remained on the couch as officers scrambled to detain Z'Kye.

Z'Kye told WNBC that he remained calm because he knew that he'd have no problem following police orders.

""I was, like, calm because I knew not to be scared,"" he reasoned. ""Just stay calm and not move and do what they tell me to do.""

In a statement to NBC News, the mall announced that both teens have been banned from the shopping center for three years.

What has been the response?

Z'Kye's mother, Eboné, told the station that she can't fathom why it would take two police officers to restrain and cuff a teenage boy who was not resisting.

“It doesn’t take two cops to hold a 14-year-old boy down who’s not resisting, while the other boy is just kind of going free and still going off on my son. It just doesn’t make sense,” she said. “It’s not fair that we are constantly having to fear the cops. I’m just glad it happened where there were a whole bunch of eyes on the situation, ’cause I don’t know what would have happened.”

In a Monday statement on the incident, a spokesperson for the Bridgewater Police Department said, ""We recognize that this video has made members of our community upset and are calling for an internal affairs investigation.""

The post in its entirety read:

The Bridgewater Twp Police Department is aware of a video on social media of our officers stopping a fight in progress at the Bridgewater Commons Mall. We recognize that this video has made members of our community upset and are calling for an internal affairs investigation. The officers were able to respond quickly to this incident and stop it from escalating because of a tip we received from the community. We have requested that the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office assist us in this matter and are requesting patience as we strictly adhere to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Internal Affairs Directive. https://www.njoag.gov/iapp/ We appreciate the videos that we have already received from community members and ask that anyone who has a video of this incident please email it to tips@bridgewaterpd.com. The men and women of the Bridgewater Township Police Department are thankful for our community partners and look forward to continuing to build our positive relationships.





What did people say?

The department's Monday post received a plethora of attention, with a lengthy thread debate containing least 2,700 comments.

In response to the post, one angry Facebook user thundered, “The fact that one of your officers turned their back and their gun to someone who was just involved in a fight, allowing that person to STAND and approach the officers and the person they were fighting is justification for termination.”

""Before commenting let the investigation be done,"" another user reasoned. ""Commenting beforehand only shows ones own ignorance. TY Bridgewater PD for making Bridgewater one of the safest towns in the nation!!""

“We want an independent investigation,"" another user demanded, arguing that both teens ought to have been detained. ""If we are going to restrain youth, both should have been restrained. Blackness is not more threatening."" One user called for people to wait for the results of the investigation before forming an opinion.

""Thank you for hosting this discussion and undergoing the review,"" the user wrote. ""Your professionalism is key. If mistakes were found to be made, I have no doubt that the force will continue to develop as it had along with Bridgewater these decades.""

Another wrote, ""Your officers have done immeasurable damage to the students in our community. Their actions have proven that white privilege and racism exist in their community and that black children cannot trust the police to be fair. You should reach out to the school system to attempt to rectify this. Trust of the police must be earned. Actions speak louder than empty words so it won’t be easy. Very disappointed and disgusted with the officers and police department in general.""





What else?

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy (D) expressed concern over the video on Tuesday.

""Although an investigation is still gathering the facts about this incident, I’m deeply disturbed by what appears to be racially disparate treatment in this video,"" he tweeted. ""We’re committed to increasing trust between law enforcement and the people they serve.”

Z'Kye has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump in connection with the detainment.

""Z’Kye, an 8th grader, was noble to defend his friend from bullies; however, it is evident that officers immediately assumed that because of the color of Z’Kye’s skin, him acting nobly was not even in the realm of possibility. That video says it all,"" Crump said in a statement shared to social media. ""Z’Kye was no more of a threat to those officers than the white teen who fought with him. This is another example of the kind of racial bias that we need to root out of our system of policing. These officers need to be reprimanded and retrained to overcome the implicit bias that results in unequal — and often dangerous — treatment of black people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-media-divided-over-viral-video-that-shows-2-officers-breaking-up-a-mall-fight-between-a-white-teen-and-black-teen,2022-02-17
Soros-backed attorney who got rapist released thrown off case of victim's father,"On September 2, Republican Circuit Court Judge James Plowman kicked a George Soros-backed prosecutor off the case of a man convicted of disorderly conduct. Plowman reckoned Loudoun County commonwealth’s attorney Buta Biberaj's impartiality was dubious as it pertained to 48-year-old Scott Smith, the father arrested for expressing outrage in a school board meeting over the permissive LGBT policies that enabled a rapist to attack his daughter in a girls' washroom.

Biberaj, who fought for jail time and anger management for Smith, oversaw the case of the very rapist who attacked Smith's daughter. Her office recommended that the rapist, charged with forcible sodomy, be released with an ankle monitor and enrolled in a different school. Upon his release, the suspect is said to have sexually assaulted another child in a classroom.

The 48-year-old Smith, who seeks to appeal his conviction, will now have his case prosecuted by Stafford County commonwealth’s attorney Eric Olsen.



According to Smith's lawyer Bill Stanley, Biberaj was biased against his client, which would compromise the integrity of the trial. He and Smith filed a motion for Biberaj's recusal on October 22, 2021.



In his decision to appoint a special prosecutor in Smith's appeal, Plowman cited the need to protect the ""integrity of the Defendant's due process rights.""



Smith took comfort in Plowman's decision. He told Fox News Digital, ""From the beginning, Ms. Biberaj has sought to make an example of me for simply standing up to defend my daughter.""

""Biberaj has demonstrated a bias against me throughout the court proceedings,"" said Smith, ""and she has continued to fan the flames of those who would label parents like me who stand in protection of their kids against dangerous school policies as being 'domestic terrorists.'""

Stanley similarly lauded the decision, writing, ""The Court's Order today has corrected at least in some measure the injustice created by Ms. Biberaj's bias against [Smith], and has restored his hope for a fair trial on the remaining charge against him in his quest to protect his beloved daughter.""

Biberaj told WTOP, ""I'm surprised by the court's decision, since I was never given the opportunity to come back and have conversations about the disorderly conduct.""

Biberaj removed and disqualified

This is not the first time Biberaj has been kicked off a case by Plowman.

In June, when seeking a plea deal for serial burglary suspect Kevin Enrique Valle, Biberaj downplayed and omitted relevant details about Valle's criminal past, including recent charges against him in other jurisdictions. Biberaj allegedly attempted to gloss over the fact that Valle was accused of ""a possible 12 burglary crime spree spanning four counties over ten days.""

Plowman characterized Biberaj's assessment not only as ""entirely inaccurate"" but ""an overt misrepresentation by omission.""

The judge noted further that ""the Commonwealth is deliberately misleading the Court, and the public,"" writing ultimately, ""Biberaj ... is hereby REMOVED AND DISQUALIFIED from further prosecution as counsel of record in this matter.""

Extra to potentially misleading the public, there is some indication that Biberaj's progressive approach may be endangering the public. According to WTTG, since Biberaj's election in 2020, criminal indictments in the county have fallen dramatically by 67%, despite an increase in arrests.

In one instance, Biberaj's office released a man charged with brutally assaulting, strangling, and abducting his wife, Regina Redman Lollobrigido. After his release, he allegedly went on to savage and kill Regina with a hammer.

In addition to working to get criminals off, Biberaj also has worked with them. Last year, her office hired a registered sex offender, convicted of a child pornography charge, as a paralegal.

Scott's quest to protect his daughter

On May 28, 2021, Scott Smith's ninth-grade daughter was raped in a bathroom at Stone Bridge High School in Loudoun County, Virginia. The offender was a 15-year-old male wearing a dress, who had taken advantage of the school's transsexual policies. The school failed to report the assault in its rape statistics.

Although that aggressor was arrested, found guilty on all charges, and ultimately placed on a sex offender registry, he was soon released by Biberaj's office and placed in another school, Broad Run, where he allegedly committed sexual battery against another child.

A month after the rape at Stone Bridge, the Loudoun County school board held a meeting in which board members suggested that the school's so-called ""gender-fluid"" bathrooms were not to blame. The board also indicated that it had not received reports of assaults in the girls' bathrooms.

Smith, outraged like many in the community, went to one such school board meeting on June 22 seeking answers. Instead, he received handcuffs.

At the meeting where parents called for Superintendent for Loudoun County Public Schools Dr. Scott Ziegler to be fired as well as for board members to resign, LGBT activists jeered and mocked a distraught Smith.

Smith raised his voice when an activist in rainbow-colored garb allegedly was denying that Smith's daughter had been attacked and began threatening to ruin his family. Police subsequently tackled him to the ground and then detained him.

Report: Seven sources explain how New York health officials gave preferential treatment to Gov. Cuomo's friends and family,"New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo used state resources to give relatives and friends preferential treatment to receive coronavirus tests, according to several individuals with inside knowledge of the Cuomo administration who spoke to the Washington Post.

Seven sources, speaking to the Post anonymously for fear of retaliation from the governor's office, allege well-connected individuals and the governor's family were able to cut in line ahead of the people of New York because the governor's office acted behind the scenes to prioritize ""political connections over medical need.""

The governor's office strongly disputed these allegations, saying priority testing was available to New York's front-line workers in the pandemic response, as well as residents who were at high risk of COVID-19 infection and death.

The Post reported:

But people familiar with the efforts said they were also told to treat individuals differently because of their connections to the governor. The individuals — who spoke at length to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution by Cuomo's office — described the behind-the-scenes operations and their feelings of discomfort with a system that they believed at times prioritized political connections over medical need.



During the early frenetic weeks in March 2020, officials working at testing sites rapidly assembled a system that gave special treatment to people described by staff as ""priorities,"" ""specials,"" ""inner circle"" or ""criticals,"" according to five people, including three nurses, who described how resources were redirected to serve those close to the governor and other cases that were fast-tracked.



At one of the first pandemic operations hubs in the state, the testing priority status of more than 100 individuals were logged in an electronic data sheet that was kept separate from a database for the general public, according to a person with direct knowledge of the practice.

The Post's sources allege the beneficiaries of this preferential treatment include clothing and footwear designer Kenneth Cole, who is the governor's brother-in-law, as well as CNN host Chris Cuomo, the governor's brother.

And a top state physician whose pandemic portfolio involved coordinating testing in nursing homes was dispatched multiple times to the Hamptons home of CNN host Chris Cuomo, the governor's brother, in testing visits that sometimes stretched hours, according to two people with knowledge of the consultations. [...]



Members of Cuomo's extended family received favored treatment at a state-run testing center in late spring of 2020, according to one nurse who witnessed a frantic effort to prepare for their arrival and get their samples to the Wadsworth Center, a state lab in Albany.



""I remember them being like, 'They're coming, they're coming,' "" the nurse said, describing how site leaders announced when the family was approaching. ""And they would say, 'Have the state trooper ready … have it ready to go to Wadsworth.' There was a lot of anxiety over those samples getting to the right place.""



""They were treated like royalty,"" the nurse said of Cuomo's family. ""I didn't understand why they were able to jump the line.""

In response to a question from the Post about Cuomo's family receiving special treatment, a spokesman for the governor said, ""To the extent this occurred, the Governor was not aware.""

The spokesman also denied the Post's allegation that there was a separate database for those given preferential treatment for COVID-19 testing or that any preferential treatment was given at all.

""There was no 'VIP' program as the Washington Post describes — when priority was given, it was to nurses, guardsmen, state workers and other government officials central to the pandemic response and those they were in direct contact with, as well as individuals believed to have been exposed to COVID who had the capability to spread it further and impact vital operations,"" Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said.

New York State Department of Health spokesman Gary Holmes said it was ""not factually accurate"" for the Post to report that some New Yorkers got preferential treatment because of their ties to Cuomo.



But a nurse who worked at two different testing sites told a different story to the Post, saying that medical workers were told by Cuomo's office to provide special access for certain people.

""I'm trained that there is no such thing as a preferential medicine. We don't say 'this person is more important so their results are more important.' That's just not fair,"" the nurse said. ""Yet here we have somebody who is being pushed to the front of the line for no reason. It was like, 'Oh, your test matters.' And we know why. It's because of who you are, not because of anything medical.""

The nurse added: ""We would always hear, 'This is coming from the governor's chamber.' What the hell does that mean?""

In response to these allegations and others, New York state Attorney General Letitia James has called for an investigation into the governor's testing protocol. The attorney general has also appointed independent investigators to look into multiple allegations of sexual harassment leveled against Gov. Cuomo in recent weeks.

The allegations of preferential treatment for Chris Cuomo raise serious ethical concerns because of how he promoted his brother the governor on his nightly CNN show. Chris Cuomo never disclosed on CNN that his brother used state resources to get him access to COVID-19 testing at a time when testing was limited and other New Yorkers missed out.

In a statement to the Post, a spokesman for CNN said, ""As we have already said, we generally do not comment on employees' medical care and we have nothing more to add.""

Last week, CNN defended Chris Cuomo, saying, ""In the earliest days of a once-in-a-century global pandemic, when Chris was showing symptoms and was concerned about possible spread, he turned to anyone he could for advice and assistance, as any human being would.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sources-new-york-health-officials-preferential-treatment-cuomo-friends-family,2021-03-30
South Carolina bans biological males from women's sports teams,"South Carolina on Tuesday became the sixteenth state to enact a law prohibiting gender dysphoric males from competing in female athletics at the K-12 and collegiate levels.

Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signed H.4608, the Save Women's Sports Act, a law that requires middle school, high school, and college student athletes to compete in sports leagues according to the sex on their birth certificates.

Republican state legislatures have advanced similar laws under the argument that males have natural biological advantages over females, and that permitting athletes who were born men to compete against women is unfair.

""I think the girls ought to play girls and the boys ought to play boys. That’s the way we’ve always done it,"" McMaster said prior to signing the bill.

The law would prohibit males who identify as female from competing against women and girls. State Senator Richard Cash (R), who helped advance the law through the legislature, said it was necessary to keep opportunities for female athletes fair in comments made after the Senate passed the bill earlier this month.

The law ""will protect those who are born biologically as females from having to compete against those who are born biologically as males but identify as females,” Cash said.

Democrats opposed the law, arguing it was not needed and that those in favor of restricting transgender athletes to sports teams of their birth sex were hateful and bigoted.



""Transgender youth are not a threat to fairness in sports, and this law now needlessly stigmatizes young people who are simply trying to navigate their adolescence, make friends, and build skills like teamwork and leadership, winning and losing,"" said Ivy Hill, Executive Director of Gender Benders and Community Health Program Director of Campaign for Southern Equality.



Social conservative groups applauded the state.

“Male athletes do not belong in our daughters’ sports, period. This is a view shared by an overwhelming majority of Americans, as our recent polling of battleground states has shown. Biology matters, and no amount of gaslighting by woke ideologues will change that,"" said Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project.

“We applaud Governor McMaster and South Carolina lawmakers for taking action to protect a fair playing field for girl athletes in the Palmetto State. With 16 states now having taken this step, there is no excuse left for those states that haven’t, particularly those led by Republicans. This is now a litmus-test issue for the GOP, and voters will be paying attention to what their leaders either do or fail to do as we approach the midterms.”

Prior to the Save Women's Sports Act, the High School League of South Carolina made decisions on whether gender dysphoric students should compete on girls or boys teams on a case-by-case basis and has considered fewer than half a dozen cases per year, according to the Associated Press.

South Dakota 'Fairness in Women's Sports' bill becomes law in Gov. Noem's first act of new year,"South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday signed the ""Fairness in Women's Sports"" bill into law, enacting what social conservatives have called the ""strongest"" protections for women's sports in the nation. The new law prohibits any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex.

After signing the bill, Noem said the law was needed to protect ""fairness"" in athletic competition.



“This is about fairness. Every young woman deserves an equal playing field where she can achieve success, but common sense tells us that males have an unfair physical advantage over females in athletic competition. It is for those reasons that only girls should be competing in girls’ sports,” the governor said in a statement. “Women have fought long and hard for equal athletic opportunities, and South Dakota will defend them, but we have to do it in a smart way.”

The law states that ""only female athletes, based on their biological sex, shall participate in any team, sport, or athletic event designated as being for females, women, or girls."" It also defines ""biological sex"" as ""the sex listed on the student's official birth certificate issued at or near the time of the athlete’s birth.""

Individual athletes may file private lawsuits against any school or institutions that do not comply with the new statutory requirements. The law also instructs the state attorney general to ""provide legal representation at no cost to that entity or individual"" who files a lawsuit against schools for noncompliance.



""This is a statute in the state of South Dakota that will ensure that girls sports [are] protected,"" Noem told reporters.

A previous version of this law was opposed by the governor for containing provisions she said were ""unrealistic in the context of collegiate sports."" The governor issued a ""style and form"" revision of the legislation last March, sending it back to the legislature with changes. Republican lawmakers rejected Noem's changes and she ultimately vetoed that bill, provoking harsh rebuke from social conservative groups.

But the bill the bill that became law this week was strongly praised by those same groups, who applauded Noem for fighting for this law.

“Gov. Noem and South Dakota legislators deserve a great deal of credit for passing this strong legislation, despite some hiccups last year. We thank them for standing up for equal opportunities for their state’s women and girl athletes, and we urge lawmakers in states without such protections to get to work on passing them immediately,” American Principles Project president Terry Schilling said.

Alliance Defending Freedom legal counsel Christiana Holcomb said, “Girls deserve equal opportunities to experience the thrill of victory. We welcome South Dakota to the growing number of states that are ensuring their female athletes won’t be spectators in their own sports. When schools and society ignore biological differences between the sexes, it’s girls and women who pay the price. In athletics, girls are losing medals, podium spots, public recognition, and opportunities to compete.""

""We commend the legislature and governor for supporting this important legislation, which ensures that female athletes from kindergarten to college will not face those losses in South Dakota,” Holcomb added.

Left-wing groups condemned the new law.

""This cruel and dangerous bill is part of a coordinated attack on trans youth moving nationwide,"" the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted.



Susan Williams, executive director of the Transformation Project, told the Argus Leader that Thursday was a dark day for transgender youth in South Dakota.

""Today, we are devastated that one of these bills is being signed into law,"" she said. ""We know trans youth across this state and country are hurting at this news. We want every trans person watching to know that we are with you, we see you, and we are here for you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/south-dakota-fairness-in-womens-sports-bill-becomes-law-in-gov-noems-first-act-of-new-year,2022-02-04
Report: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem undecided on bill to protect women's sports,"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) reportedly has not yet made up her mind on whether to sign a controversial bill that would ban transgender athletes from participating on sports teams according to how they identify.

The Daily Caller reported Friday that Noem is ""wavering"" on whether to sign the bill after facing pressure from the NCAA, the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce, and threats from Amazon to abandon a plant in Sioux Falls if she should sign it.

The legislation, H.B. 1217, would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match their biological sex. On International Women's Day on March 8, Noem publicly stated she was ""excited"" to sign the bill, which proponents say would protect women's sports by ensuring men taking hormones to transition to female would not be allowed to compete against women.

However, in an interview with the Argus Leader published Thursday, Noem said she was still reviewing the bill and that she would make a final decision on whether to sign it ""probably in the next two to three days.""

""It's a complicated bill even in that there are parts of it that aren't written so well,"" she said, without specifying the provisions of the legislation to which she referred.

TheBlaze reached out to Gov. Noem's office for clarification but did not receive comment.

The Daily Caller received confirmation from Noem's communications director Ian Fury that the governor has not yet made up her mind on the bill.

""Governor Noem is still weighing 106 pieces of legislation that have action due next Friday, and that is one of them,"" Fury said.

The legislation faces opposition from business leaders and collegiate sports officials, who say it could result in millions of dollars of economic losses for South Dakota.

Dave Zimbeck of the Sioux Falls Sports Authority told the Argus Leader earlier this month that the NCAA could cancel its March Madness tournaments in Sioux Falls because of the bill. The proposed law would likely be viewed as discriminatory by the NCAA, violating its policies concerning diversity.

""Ultimately, that's deemed under the NCAA policies as discriminatory. And that would put us on the outside looking in, and ultimately we would lose out on a bid we were seeking, and we would also lose out on a tournament that's already been awarded to us,"" Zimbeck said. ""This bill as it's written casts a big shadow on our ability to host a tournament.""

In a statement to the Argus Leader, the NCAA reaffirmed its commitment to supporting transgender athletes and said it is closely monitoring policies that could impact their participation in collegiate sports.

""The NCAA believes in fair and respectful student-athlete participation at all levels of sport. The Association's transgender student-athlete participation policy and other diversity policies are designed to facilitate and support inclusion. The NCAA believes diversity and inclusion improve the learning environment and it encourages its member colleges and universities to support the well-being of all student-athletes,"" NCAA spokesperson Gail Dent said.

In previous years, NCAA sports tournaments hosted in South Dakota have generated millions of dollars in revenues for local businesses.

Zimbeck also noted that schools that follow the law but violate NCAA policy could lose their accreditation with the NCAA and their ability to compete against other schools outside South Dakota.

""It's predictable – it's very alarming, but it's predictable – that the colleges under the Board of Regents' control would be put in a position where they have to disconnect or walk away from the NCAA and lose their accreditation and ultimately have no place to compete,"" Zimbeck said. ""Without a conference affiliation, without an NCAA membership, the schools have no place to play, and now we could see where we essentially have to eliminate athletics completely from state-run colleges or universities, which is extremely alarming.""

The bill's backers in the state legislature acknowledged to the Daily Caller that opposition was ""inevitable"" but said that sometimes doing the right thing means standing up to ""bully tactics.""

""I think the reality of it is that if you stand up for the right thing, and this is the right thing, that good will come of it,"" Republican bill sponsor state Rep. Rhonda Milstead said, ""that bully tactics aren't gonna work if you hold your ground. And that's what those are, bully tactics.""

The South Dakota state constitution empowers the governor to send bills ""with errors in style or form"" back to the legislature with specific recommendations for change. Milstead speculated that Noem may attempt to use this power, but dismissed the strategy as inappropriate.

""She's the executive branch, the legislature is the one that passes laws,"" Milstead said. ""So if she wants to change the language, it has nothing to do with style and form. It has everything to do with content, context.""

""That's not appropriate,"" she added. ""It's really going outside of the powers of the branch. That's not what the executive branch is for.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/south-dakota-kristi-noem-undecided-bill-protect-womens-sports,2021-03-19
Sports columnist torched for saying Jack Del Rio 'lucky to still have a job' after un-woke Jan. 6 comments: 'Clownishly dumb take even for this leftist rag',"Miami Herald sports columnist Greg Cote got torched on social media for his piece ripping Jack Del Rio's decidedly un-woke comments about the 2021 Capitol riots — and adding that the Washington Commanders' defensive coordinator is ""lucky to still have a job.""

What's the background?

In regard to the Jan. 6 commission hearings, Del Rio recently tweeted: ""Would love to understand 'the whole story' about why the summer of riots, looting, burning, and the destruction of personal property is never discussed but this is???""

He followed that up at a media briefing by saying, ""Let's get right down to it. What did I ask? A simple question. Why are we not looking into those things?"" He added, ""I see the images on TV. People's livelihoods are being destroyed. Businesses are being burned down, no problem. And then we have a dust-up at the Capitol, nothing burned down. And we're not gonna talk about, we're gonna make that a major deal."" Del Rio then said, ""Let's have a discussion. We're Americans. Let's talk it through.""

After a torrent of backlash, Del Rio apologized on Twitter: ""I made comments earlier in referencing the attack that took place on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. Referencing that situation as a dust-up was irresponsible and negligent and I am sorry.""

He added: ""I stand by my comments condemning violence in communities across the country. I say that while also expressing my support as an American citizen for peaceful protest in our country. I have fully supported all peaceful protest in America.""

But it wasn't enough.

Commanders' Head Coach Ron Rivera soon fined Del Rio $100,000 for his ""extremely hurtful"" comments and added a couple of sentences in a statement that read like it was penned by a Democratic speechwriter: ""As we saw last night in the hearings, what happened on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an act of domestic terrorism. A group of citizens attempted to overturn the results of a free and fair election, and as a result, lives were lost and the Capitol building was damaged.""

Rivera also said the Commanders wouldn't ""tolerate"" anyone equating the Jan. 6 riots BLM rioting. Del Rio soon deleted his Twitter account.

Enter Cotes' column

In addition to saying Del Rio is ""lucky to still have a job,"" Cotes dropped just about every left-wing bomb you can think of upon the coach. He called Del Rio's comments ""dumb"" and ""tone-deaf-insensitive""

Cotes added, ""Doubling down on the stupidity, the coach managed to also demonize the street demonstrations that erupted nationwide in protest of the police killing of George Floyd, and blamed the ... Black Lives Matter movement.""

He also wrote that ""three officers defending the Capitol were among the seven persons who died related to the 'dust-up'"" and then took the time to define ""insurrection"" (“A violent uprising against an authority or government"") and ""dust-up"" (""You and the wife arguing in the car over where to go for dinner""). Gee, thanks, Greg.

How are folks reacting?

If the comments under the Herald's tweet about Cotes' column are any indication, readers for the most part sure don't seem pleased by it. Here are but a few of the scathing comments:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sportswriter-torched-jack-del-rio,2022-06-14
Rep. Ayanna Pressley demands 'cancel the rent' — but discloses thousands in rental income during pandemic,"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), a member of ""The Squad,"" is a vocal advocate of ""canceling"" rent debts for Americans who fell behind on their rental payments during the pandemic.

But new financial disclosures reveal that Pressley had no problem accepting rent from tenants last year.

What is the background?

Throughout the pandemic, Pressley has led an effort to ""cancel"" rent. She claims that canceling rent and preventing evictions are ""a matter of public health.""

Pressley has even co-introduced legislation — the ""Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act"" — to ""institute a nationwide cancellation of rents and primary home mortgage payments through the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.""

The bill is true progressive dream. Not only does the bill advocate ""a full payment forgiveness, retroactive starting April 2020, with no accumulation of debt for renters or homeowners and no negative impact on their credit rating or rental history,"" but the bill would also ""establish a relief fund for landlords and lenders to cover losses from the cancelled payments.""

Pressley's legislation, which she drafted alongside Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), would provide relief to renters and mortgage-carriers with no strings attached. For landlords and lenders, however, the bill would only provide the relief it promised ""so long as they agree to abide by a set of fair renting and lending practices for five years.""

But Pressley owns a rental property?

That's right.

According to financial disclosures filed last week, Pressley reported thousands of dollars worth of rental income from 2020.

Fox News reported:

Pressley's 2020 financial disclosure, filed on Friday, disclosed between $5,000 and $15,000 in rental income from a Boston property in her husband's name. The property was converted into a multi-family apartment after it was purchased, according to Pressley's disclosure. ...



She disclosed the same range of rental income – between $5,000 and $15,000 – in 2020 as she did in 2019, before the pandemic began.

Previously, it was unknown whether Pressley collected income on her rental properties during the pandemic because she called rent cancellation ""literally a matter of life and death"" in December. The financial disclosure proves her rhetoric was incongruent with her actions.

The Washington Free Beacon first reported that Pressley and her husband own a multi-unit Boston-area home, which they purchased for more than $600,000 in 2019. The property rents for more than $2,000 per month, according to the Free Beacon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/squad-member-pressley-cancel-rent-gets-rental-income,2021-08-17
Stacey Abrams identifies a limit on abortions she supports in interview with Fox News,"Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams appeared to walk back her radical abortion with no-limits position in an interview in which she indicated she might support some restrictions on late-term abortion.

Abrams told Fox News on Wednesday that she believes politicians should not restrict abortion with ""artificial time constraints,"" repeating a position she's taken before. She affirmed that ""abortion is medical care"" and should be a decision between a woman and her doctor, with politicians uninvolved.

But when pressed if there should be any limit at all, she did say that women should have the right to an abortion ""up until the point of viability as determined by a doctor.""

""And as of that moment, if the woman's life is in danger or if her health is in danger, then there should be a decision made to protect the life of that woman. But otherwise, the point of viability. But what I object to are artificial time constraints that do not conform to biology or logic,"" Abrams said.

Watch:



Abrams is running for governor in a rematch against incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who defeated her in 2018. Like other Democratic candidates this cycle, her campaign has placed a strong emphasis on defending abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. She has attacked Georgia's fetal heartbeat law, which restricts abortion to the first six weeks of pregnancy and denied that unborn babies have a heartbeat at six weeks.

She has also said that in medical emergencies where the mother's life is in danger, abortion should be legal ""until the time of birth,"" and claimed that supporting abortion rights is ""part of my faith.""



Fox News also asked Abrams about her false claims that the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election was ""rigged"" or ""stolen."" Abrams says she was taken out of context.

""I accepted the results in 2018. And the premise of the question always presumes that I did not accept the results,"" Abrams told Fox News. ""Despite the cherry-picking and the decontextualization of what I've said, at the top of my speech I said that I acknowledged that Governor Kemp was the governor of Georgia.""

Abrams said what she ""always objected to"" was the claim that thousands of black Georgia voters were denied access to the ballot box by state voting laws. She cited a court ruling from last month in a case brought by her organization Fair Fight Action to support her contention.

Though the federal judge who decided the case threw out Fair Fight Action's lawsuit, the court said that Georgia's election system was ""not perfect"" and, Abrams argues, highlighted how black people are disproportionately impacted by the Georgia's voting laws.

""We were right. And my intention is to always fight for access, but I am not entitled to the outcome. And I have never claimed that I did. Now, people have taken language that I've used out of context. I've tried to make certain that people across the state always understood the importance of their power. When they showed up in [2018], they changed the future of the state. And I will always celebrate their victories and the changes they were able to make in our elections,"" she said.



Kemp has consistently led Abrams in polls of likely voters through September and into October. The election will be held Tuesday, Nov. 8.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-abortion-limits-georgia,2022-10-12
"'We did not just lose, we got blown out': Stacey Abrams' campaign owes over $1 million after rejection by voters","Twice-failed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams recently suggested that she may soon test whether voters have the resolve to reject her a third time. However, in the interim, she will first have to deal with the financial fallout of her latest political blunder.

A new report, confirmed by Abrams' two-time campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, has revealed that Abrams' campaign owes over $1 million to various vendors.

What are the details?

Abrams' political machine has been long mired in scandals concerning its finances.



For instance, Politico revealed in October that the law firm belonging to Abrams' campaign chairman, Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, got paid $10 million in legal fees for services rendered to the Georgia Democrat's nonprofit group, Fair Fight Action.

The legal team was unsuccessful and the group's lawsuit failed in federal court, but that's not what ultimately raised eyebrows. The $10 million payment, flagged as exceptional, raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest.

Abrams' Fair Fight PAC announced earlier that month that it would look into an entirely different but similarly questionable matter: why the inexperienced friends and family of its director were getting enriched while maintaining other full-time jobs.

Now, Abrams' campaign, which raised over $103 million in her latest losing race against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), is facing scrutiny over its debts and the Democrat's failure to budget responsibly.



According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Abrams campaign rented a so-called ""hype house"" in an expensive neighborhood intended for TikTok streamers. The house was rarely used.

The campaign also paid for a ""swag truck"" and pop-up shop without a deployment strategy to speak of.

One Democratic official told the Journal-Constitution, ""It's incredibly bad planning, and it shows where their values are at.""

Georgia Democratic operative Chris Huttman told Axios that Abrams ""was running a campaign where there's always been more money in the future that can fix the mistakes of the past.""

Huttman noted that this is a ""well-documented pattern"" for Abrams, given that she also ran out of other people's money during her 2018 primary.

Groh-Wargo told Axios that the campaign, facing a ""cavalcade of negative press and negative polling,"" resorted to working with brokers to sell off its donor lists and voter contact databases to help pay down the debt.

While on the hook to vendors, the campaign cut most of its 180 full-time staffers' paychecks.

""Of course, I would have loved to do a lot of things differently,"" said Groh-Wargo. ""But I had to move as fast as possible. We tried to do the best we could to make sure that help would be there for folks.""

A former staffer told Axios that people linked to the campaign panicked after the pay cut: ""They have no idea how they're going to pay their rent in January. ... It was more than unfortunate. It was messed up.""

The unceremonious cuts made losing by over 297,000 votes even harder for members of Abrams' team to bear.

""We did not just lose, we got blown out,"" said Groh-Wargo. ""It was the most sub-optimal situation to be in. And we will be dealing with that situation for some time.""

Staffers' disdain may be the least of Abrams' concern.

The Washington Free Beacon reported earlier this month that the the Abrams-run New Georgia Project (NGP) has been collecting donations without a license in at least nine states, exposing itself to potential fines and criminal inquiries.

Fines for violating these states' charity laws could range from $25 dollars to $25,000, with penalties possibly applying to each donation received by the group, formerly led by Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-campaign-owes-over-1-million-after-another-rejection-by-voters,2022-12-20
Stacey Abrams loses again: Judge rejects suit claiming Georgia's 2018 election was mismanaged,"When Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election by 54,723 votes, Abrams refused to concede. She suggested that doing so would make her ""complicit"" in a ""rigged"" system. While the delta in votes was too large to legally warrant a recount, Abrams — who will again face Kemp in this year's election — sought other ways to contest the democratic result.

After the election, Abrams' Fair Fight Action organization filed a lawsuit, claiming Georgia had ""grossly mismanaged"" the election, depriving some citizens of their right to vote. In particular, the group took issue with two facets of the state's voter verification processes, both designed to counter voter fraud.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta rejected that lawsuit, finding for the defendants on all counts.

Rejected

Jones, appointed by former President Barack Obama, stated that although ""Georgia's election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Act of 1965].""

The trial, which was decided by judge rather than by jury, took place over the course of two months and 21 trial days. Jones suggested it may have ""been the longest voting rights bench trial in the history of the Northern District of Georgia.""

One of the issues at the heart of the trial was Georgia's ""exact match"" policy, whereby the information on a voter registration application must comport with the records kept by Georgia's Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration.

In the event that there is not a match, the applicant is notified by letter from the county board of registrars that the application has been assigned a pending status. The application can be completed thereafter by way of the applicant providing sufficient evidence they are who they claim to be.

Abrams' group claimed that this requirement disproportionately affected minorities and immigrants and violated the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act.

Fair Fight attorney Allegra Lawrence-Hardy advanced the claim that Georgia officials had made it ""harder to register, harder to stay registered and ultimately harder to vote"" and intimated that requiring voters to have valid documentation on hand was ""designed to keep certain people from voting.""

In his 288-page decision, Jones stated that the ""defendants have a compelling interest in preventing voter fraud"" and that ""the limited burdens placed on voters by Exact Match citizen verification are justified."" Furthermore, Jones indicated that Fair Fight failed to prove the policy violated either the First or 14th Amendments.

According to Josh Belinfante, a lawyer for state election officials, Abrams' group was motivated by a desire to turn Georgia into a blue state. Belinfante indicated that among the over 3,000 stories cited by Fair Fight, only a handful were from persons unable to cast a ballot in the 2018 election. Not one reported having an issue in the 2020 election.

Gov. Brian Kemp said Friday's ruling ""exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals.""

Although Jones ruled against all the claims brought by Fair Fight, Abrams said in a statement, ""The conduct of this trial and preceding cases and legislative actions represent a hard-won victory for voters who have endured long lines, burdensome date of birth requirements and exact match laws that disproportionately impact Black and Brown voters.""

Notwithstanding Abrams' characterization of another loss as a win, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr suggested this rejection ""is existential to who Stacey Abrams has become as a public and political figure.""

""She put herself in the political spotlight nationally, potentially globally, all over the narrative that she lost the governor's race because of voter suppression,"" said Carr. ""And here you have a federal judge saying, it's all untrue. It didn't happen.""

Election denial

In a post-defeat speech on November 16, 2018, Abrams said, ""I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right.""

Abrams, not opposed to criminal non-citizens voting in local elections, told MSNBC's Katy Tur that ""the election was stolen from the people of Georgia.""



On November 19, she told MSNBC's Chris Hayes that it was ""not a free and fair election.""

Abrams later told the New York Times in 2019 that the ""results were purely and fully attributable to voter suppression.""

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who contested the results of the 2016 presidential election, was joined by numerous other Democrats, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in reiterating Abrams' claim that the 2018 gubernatorial election had been stolen.

Clinton stumped for Abrams' election-denial narrative at a commemoration of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama, suggesting, ""Stacey Abrams should be governor, leading that state right now.""

Clinton also suggested that ""you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.""

Kamala Harris stated, ""Let's say this loud and clear: Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia.""

Election reality

It wasn't only U.S. District Judge Steve Jones who has cast doubt on Abrams' allegations of election mismanagement and voter suppression.



The Heritage Foundation noted that ""Georgia was in full compliance with requirements of the National Voter Registration Act, which made it easy to register by mail, at the DMV, state public assistance offices, and at numerous other agencies and locations throughout the state.""

In fact, it had never ""been easier to register to vote in Georgia.""

Ahead of the election in which Abrams lost, the state had nearly 7 million registered voters, ""the most in Georgia's entire history.""

In a 2018 post-election analysis, FiveThirtyEight indicated that voter turnout was ""really big."" Whereas on average, ""roughly 40 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in a midterm ... an estimated 55% of eligible voters exercised their right to vote, which is about 21 points higher than the state's 1982-2014 average.""

As for the 1.4 million voters reportedly taken off the voter rolls between 2012 and 2018, PolitiFact reported, ""Many died, moved away or lost their right to vote because they committed felonies."" Some were removed because they skipped previous elections and ""had no contact with the election officials.""

Sherman further noted ""that removal policy started in the 1990s under Democratic leadership.""

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said, ""Stolen election and voter suppression claims by Stacey Abrams were nothing but poll-tested rhetoric not supported by facts and evidence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-loses-again-judge-rejects-suit-claiming-georgias-2018-election-was-mismanaged,2022-10-03
Stacey Abrams breaking mask mandate at school,"Democratic darling Stacey Abrams shared a photo of herself unmasked in a classroom full of young children who were forced to wear face masks. However, the photo was removed from social media after Abrams was skewered for the awful optics and accused of engaging in hypocritical behavior of flouting a mask mandate.

On Friday, Abrams visited the Glennwood Elementary School outside Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Holly Brookins – the principal of Glennwood Elementary School – shared three photos of an unmasked Abrams on her Twitter account, which is no longer active.

The Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate retweeted the principal's tweet featuring photos of her at the school.

One photo shows a smiling Abrams without a mask in a classroom where every young child and school faculty member are wearing face masks. In another picture, an unmasked Abrams appears to hug a school faculty member who is wearing a mask. Abrams is seen without a mask delivering a speech to the students in another photo.

However, by Saturday the photos were deleted.

The school is located in Decatur City, which recently extended its face mask mandate until February 22, 2022.

The photos of the grinning Democratic politician in a room full of masked children enraged many.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R): ""Stacey Abrams wants state government mask mandates for Georgians and their children. But it looks like they wouldn’t apply when she’s attending a photo op.""

National Review editor Rich Lowry: ""Confirmation, if any were needed, that Stacey Abrams is a member of the Democratic elite in good standing—mask hypocrisy is practically a status symbol now.""

Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller: ""In so many ways, this picture embodies the elitism, arrogance, cruelty, science denial, and glib authoritarianism of Joe Biden’s Democrat Party.""

Journalist Glenn Greenwald: ""Meanwhile: since @staceyabrams is a very sophisticated and important liberal, I'm sure there's something in The Science™ that justifies her being maskless indoors, surrounded by young kids forced to wear masks all day. Maybe she's holding her breath?""

Republican candidate for Georgia's 6th congressional district Jake Evans: ""Stacey Abrams is mask-less while all the children around her suffer. This is child abuse.""

Conservative think tank American Principles Project: ""Self-righteous politicians show off their smile as they force your children to be muzzled all day, set back years in their development, and carry the burden of a pandemic that was never at high risk to them.""



Board-certified ophthalmologist and biomedical research scientist Houman David Hemmati: ""This recent image of political activist @staceyabrams of Georgia (who is at VERY high risk for COVID death) sitting unmasked, with a huge wide grin, in front of forcibly masked kids whose smiles we/they will never see, exemplifies the hypocrisy of politicians.""

Political strategist Justin Hart: ""When Stacey Abrams runs for office again just plaster this picture on a billboard.""

Washington Examiner executive editor Seth Mandel: ""Stacey Abrams cutting an ad for her opponent is extremely weird I would not recommend this strategy.""

Outkick founder Clay Travis: ""The number of left wing politicians who post photos posing without masks while all the kids around them are wearing masks is stunning. Here is Stacey Abrams doing it. This is child abuse.""



Political strategist Caleb Hull: ""Stacey Abrams, who is obese and in the high risk category, not wearing a mask while children, who are in the lowest risk category, are all masked just about sums this whole pandemic up.""

Communications director for Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) – Madeline Corso: ""Just to recap… Youngkin: anti-mandates & didn’t wear a mask in a VA grocery store where it’s optional. Abrams: pro-mandates & didn’t wear a mask in a GA school where children are forced to wear them There’s a reason only one of them is a governor—and the other never will be.""

Talk show host Larry O'Connor: ""Are these little children forced to wear masks to protect @staceyabrams? What kind of cruel monster makes little children cover their faces so they can have a photo op without fear of viral infection? If you're so afraid that you make kids wear masks around you, stay home!""

The Abrams campaign released a statement regarding her flouting the mask mandate without actually mentioning it.

""It is shameful that our opponents are using a Black History Month reading event for Georgia children as the impetus for a false political attack, and it is pitiful and predictable that our opponents continue to look for opportunities to distract from their failed records when it comes to protecting public health during the pandemic,"" the statement reads.

In the past, Abrams has told others to wear face masks.

Stacey Abrams to Rachel Maddow: 'I did not challenge the outcome of the election' for Georgia governor in 2018. Also Stacey Abrams: Election was 'stolen.',"Now that Stacey Abrams has tossed her hat in the ring for another run at the Georgia governor's chair, the far-left activist and darling of the Democratic Party is making the rounds on friendly news programs to pump up her candidacy.

Indeed, Abrams appeared on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC show Thursday night to face a barrage of softball questions and observations — one of which focused on Abrams' loss to Brian Kemp in 2018 for Georgia governor.

Maddow called out a ""disturbing dynamic in that race, which was that"" Kemp ""was secretary of state at the time and was engaged in really aggressive, what appeared to be voter suppression tactics, including throwing huge numbers of Georgians off the voting rolls in a way that seemed to benefit his own candidacy in which he was on the ballot.""

Continuing with her windup, Maddow added to Abrams that ""when you so narrowly lost, you famously were contentious about the loss, saying that you didn't necessarily think it had been a fair fight. Stepping back now, a few years out of that, and seeing what's happened both in Georgia and around the country around the issues of fairness in elections, how do you feel about that now ... and how do you want people to understand how that dynamic affected the race the first time?""

'I did not challenge the outcome of the election'

Abrams replied to Maddow that after battling against Kemp's ""egregious and aggressive voter suppression activities"" and losing the race to him, ""I acknowledged that I would not become the governor, that he had won the election.""

Then the kicker: ""I did not challenge the outcome of the election, unlike some recent folks did,"" Abrams added in a not-so-subtle reference to former President Donald Trump after he lost a year ago to President Joe Biden.

""What I said was that the system was not fair. And leaders challenge systems. Leaders say we can do better. And that's what I declared. I could not in good conscience say that, in order to protect my political future, I'm gonna be silent about the political present, which is that we have a system under a leader that sought to keep people from casting their ballot, that threw the ballots out, that said that voter suppression was a viable tactic for winning elections,"" she added.

Maddow did not push back.

Now for the rest of the story

Just about everything Abrams said following her loss to Kemp in 2018 indicated she believed she won and that the election was rigged against her.

""We had this little election back in 2018, and despite the final tally and the inauguration and the situation we find ourselves in, I do have one very affirmative statement to make: We won,"" Abrams said five months after her defeat.

And while Abrams tweeted in 2016 that ""Trump's refusal to concede the election if he loses proves he is a petty man uninterested in our national stability,"" she infamously refused to concede the 2018 Georgia governor election to Kemp — and still hasn't.

Ten days after her loss, she said during a press conference, ""I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election."" But there was a caveat coming next: Her speech was ""not a speech of concession.""

Abrams added, ""I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right.""

And in April, Abrams repeated her false claims that the 2018 race was ""stolen"" while testifying in a Senate hearing on voting rights.

""It's been over two years, and you still refuse to concede that you lost the race for governor in Georgia in 2018,"" GOP U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told her. ""Yes or no, today, do you still maintain that the 2018 Georgia election was stolen?""

After a non-answer and further pressing by Cruz, Abrams said, ""My full language was that it was stolen from the voters of Georgia. We do not know what they would have done because not every eligible Georgian was able to participate fully in the election.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-rachel-maddow-claims-about-2018-election,2021-12-03
"Stacey Abrams says Americans should 'legitimately question systems,' referring to elections — then condemns Trump","Stacey Abrams, a star in the Democratic Party, admitted in a new interview that she believes questioning the legitimacy of systems, in the context of elections, is a necessary part of being an American.



What is the background?

Abrams is running to become the next governor of Georgia in 2022 after losing election to Gov. Brian Kemp (R) four years ago.

After losing in 2018, Abrams refused to concede and claimed that she had “won.” In the more than three years since the election, Abrams has maintained that the election was not fair — even describing it as ""rigged"" — and even reiterated last year that the election “was stolen from the voters of Georgia.”

Abrams believes that Kemp — who oversaw the election because he was secretary of state at the time — took actions prior to the election that ultimately changed the outcome. However, Abrams has also admitted, ""I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes.""

What did Abrams say now?

Speaking with Axios, Abrams was asked whether refusing to concede an election ""emboldens former President Trump and his allies.""

In response, Abrams endorsed questioning the legitimacy of ""systems,"" a clear reference to elections in the context of the interview — but added a positive spin.

""I don't ever want us to be in a place as Americans where we cannot legitimately question and critique systems and try to make them better,"" she said.

The Georgia Democrat explained that she ""will acknowledge the victor"" of the 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election, then claimed, ""I will always acknowledge the legal outcome of an election. I have never failed to do that.""

In her interview with Axios, Abrams even claimed that her rhetoric about the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and former President Donald Trump's rhetoric about the 2020 presidential election are different.

""What Trump has done is invalidate systems because he didn't like the personal effect,"" said Abrams after just admitting she believes questioning the validity of systems is important. ""And he's provided no information or proof of his allegations.

""I should be held accountable for everything I say, be able to tie it to evidentiary facts. And that's what I've been doing. And that's what I'll continue to do,"" she claimed.

Anything else?

While mainstream media outlets like Politico publish stories drawing contrast between Abrams and Trump, Republicans in Georgia are already using Abrams' own words against her in the upcoming gubernatorial election.

Ryan Mahoney, an adviser to Brian Kemp's campaign in 2018, explained why ads against Abrams will prove effective.

""We've seen so many TV ads, so many digital ads, where candidates are stretching the truth. And I think the electorate realizes that. They know that not everything they see or hear now is fact checked or is valid,"" Mahoney told Politico. ""And so when it's Stacey Abrams in her own words, it's a lot more believable, it goes a lot further and it's a lot harder for Abrams and her camp to dispute. And thankfully, for Republicans in Georgia, Stacey Abrams has spent a lot of time on TV since losing [the 2018] race.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-says-americans-should-legitimately-question-systems-referring-to-elections-then-condemns-trump,2022-03-01
'I will likely run again': Stacey Abrams teases third run for office,"Just two months after losing her latest gubernatorial race, Georgia politician Stacey Abrams said that she will likely run for office a third time, while speaking to actress Drew Barrymore on ""The Drew Barrymore Show.""

""So, what's next? Are you going to run again?"" Barrymore excitedly asked. ""Do we get to look forward to this and galvanize again?"" she added.

""I will likely run again,"" Abrams said.

""Yes!"" Barrymore screamed.

When asked if she was going to run against ""some tough men who don't always play fair,"" Abrams replied ""Well, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. If it doesn't work, you try again.""

Abrams did not specify whether she intends to run for governor once again, a race she has lost twice to Republican Brian Kemp. In 2018, Abrams lost by just 55,000 votes, but in 2020, that margin was multiplied by over five times when Kemp pulled out a victory by approximately 300,000 votes.

Abrams, who created two large voting-related organizations called Fair Fight and New Georgia Project, commented that the companies were her primary focus.

“My first responsibility is to make sure anyone who wants to vote can,” Abrams said, according to The Hill. “Protecting democracy is not about a person. It’s about the ideals.”

Abrams' political campaigns were noted for her exceptionally large fundraising markers and the support she received from popular entertainers and politicians.

In 2018, Abrams' campaign raised $27 million, while in 2022, her campaign shattered that number, raising over $110 million. However, criticisms of money mismanagement arose when it was revealed that Abrams' team spent money on what would popularly be referred to as a content house, meaning the team rented an entire house specifically to shoot social media videos for TikTok.

The house was reportedly worth $12,500 per month, with the team spending additional funding on pop-up shops and a ""swag truck,"" according to NewsMax.

Abrams received support from Oprah Winfrey, who did commercials and even live events with the candidate. Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Abrams as well.

Abrams has of course drawn comparison to fellow Democratic candidate Robert (Beto) O'Rourke of Texas, who lost separate bids for senator and governor in the Lone Star State. O'Rourke reportedly broke state funding records when he raised $28 million in just four months in 2022. O'Rourke still fell short of Abrams' funding totals, losing despite garnering $77 million.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-third-office-run,2023-01-10
"Starbucks may end its open-bathroom policy that was enacted after national boycott, CEO cites safety issues","Who could have predicted this? Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said last week the coffee chain may end its policy allowing the general public to use its restrooms.

While speaking at a forum hosted by the New York Times last Thursday, Schultz disclosed that one of the biggest problems facing Starbucks employees today is mental health and store safety.

""We serve 100 million people at Starbucks, and there is an issue of just safety in our stores, in terms of people coming in who use our stores as a public bathroom, and we have to provide a safe environment for our people and our customers,"" Schultz explained.

""We have to harden our stores and provide safety for our people,"" he explained, adding, ""I don’t know if we can keep our bathrooms open.""

What is the background?

Starbucks announced in May 2018 that bathrooms inside its coffee shops across the country would be open for anyone to use — whether or not they are paying customers.

""We don't want to become a public bathroom, but we're going to make the right decision a hundred percent of the time and give people the key,"" Schultz said at the time. ""Because we don't want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than.""

The company enacted the policy after two black men were denied use of a Starbucks bathroom in Philadelphia. The men never ordered anything. When they did not leave the shop, an employee called police, and the men were arrested for trespassing. No criminal charges were filed against them, and they eventually reached a settlement with Starbucks.

Still, the incident triggered a nationwide boycott of Starbucks.

After the incident, Starbucks forced its employees to attend an intensive racial-bias training, even closing all of its stores one day in late May 2018 for the training.

""I think it's fair to say that most people have some level of unconscious bias based on our own life experience,"" Schultz said of the training at the time. ""So there's going to be a lot of education about how we all grew up, how we see the world and how we can be better.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/starbucks-could-end-open-bathroom-policy,2022-06-13
Steve Scalise takes Maxine Waters to task over her ‘incitement’: ‘I was shot because of this kind of dangerous rhetoric’,"Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise said Monday that California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters' ""dangerous rhetoric"" is the same kind of language that led to a dangerous shooting at a 2017 GOP congressional baseball practice.

Scalise and at least five other victims were treated for gunshot wounds following what appeared to be a targeted attack on Republican lawmakers and their aides.

What happened in that shooting?

Scalise was nearly killed in a hail of gunfire when accused gunman James Hodgkinson opened fire on the practice. Hodgkinson was fatally shot by police during the attack.

Hodgkinson previously expressed extreme opposition toward the Republican Party and former President Donald Trump before opening fire on the GOP baseball practice.

From a 2017 NPR report:

The alleged shooter expressed fervent opposition to the Republican Party and called for higher taxes on the rich, in statements on social media and letters to a local newspaper. He apparently volunteered for the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Vermont senator, who condemned the attack.

And what did Waters say?

During a weekend appearance in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, Waters addressed the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who faces murder charges in the May death of George Floyd.

Waters insisted that people should ""stay on the street"" if the jury doesn't deliver a verdict to convict Chauvin on the related murder charges.

""[W]e've got to get more active,"" she told activists and demonstrators at the time. ""[We've] got to get more confrontational. [We've] got to make sure that they know we mean business.""

What's Scalise saying now?

Scalise argued that Waters' remarks were dangerously inflammatory.

On Twitter, the Louisiana Republican wrote, “Let's be clear: Maxine Waters knew her rhetoric would incite violence in Minneapolis — but she doesn't care, she just requests police escorts for herself. I was shot because of this kind of dangerous rhetoric. Where is the outrage from Dems & the media? They need to condemn this.""

It isn't the first time Scalise has called out dangerous rhetoric from the left.



In 2018, the congressman implored liberals and Democrats to speak up and tamp down inflammatory speech following further threats to his life.

""You look at some of the liberal rhetoric that's coming out from the left. They're encouraging and inciting — in many cases — violence. And it's got to stop,"" Scalise warned at the time. ""In fact, liberals need to call this out. They need to speak up, just as we're speaking up saying is there's no place for it on the Republican or Democrat side. I think people on the left need to be as vocal about calling out this kind of violence.""

What are the leaders in Congress saying?

Calls to censure Waters for her remarks came from both the left and right, and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) vowed to bring action against her if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) did not.

For her part, Pelosi defended Waters' remarks, and said, ""Maxine talked about confrontation in the manner of the civil rights movement. I myself think we should take our lead from the George Floyd family. They've handled this with great dignity and no ambiguity or lack of misinterpretation by the other side.""

Pelosi also added that Waters should not have to apologize for the remarks.

On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) denounced Waters' speech and said that she was ""trying to tilt the scales of justice with threats.""

“Every single American deserves a fair trial,"" McConnell said. “This is sacred. You do not balance the scales of justice by trying to tip them.""



Targeting Waters directly, McConnell added, “And yet, this past weekend, one Democratic House member from California took it upon herself to visit the protesters in Minneapolis. She said, 'We're looking for a guilty verdict.' Like somebody window-shopping or ordering off a menu, she's looking for a guilty verdict. If that verdict is not reached, the Congresswoman said demonstrators should not only 'stay in the streets,' 'We've gotta get more active and confrontational and make sure they know we mean business.'""

“It's harder to imagine anything more inappropriate than a member of Congress flying in from California to inform local leaders — not so subtly — that this defendant had better be found guilty or else there will be big trouble in the streets,"" McConnell added. “Again, so much of our nation's quest for civil rights and equal justice has been the fight to get rid — get rid — of extrajudicial violence. To get rid of rigged trials where the outcome was molded by public sentiment or angry mobs. It is beyond the pale for a sitting member of the United States Congress to look at what happened last summer and imply there should be some kind of a sequel — a sequel! — if a legal case does not unfold as she thinks it should.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/steve-scalise-maxine-waters-incitement,2021-04-20
"Student loan forgiveness isn't fair, and President Biden can't do it on his own either, says ... Nancy Pelosi?","Liberal Democrats continue to insist that President Joe Biden can and must cancel billions of dollars in federal student loan debt.

But they have an uncommon adversary in their push to get around Congress: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who made it clear that the president doesn't have the power to do it — and probably shouldn't even if he did.

What's that now?

One of President Biden's most popular campaign promises among his left-wing base in the months leading up to the 2020 election was that he would cancel the massive level of student loan debt Americans have compiled.

Thus far he has seriously disappointed his constituents who were counting on him to prevent them from paying bills they owed for loans they willingly took out.

In response, several U.S. lawmakers have actually urged Biden to circumvent their own co-equal branch of government and unilaterally cancel tens of thousands of dollars of debt for every American who has federal student loan debt.

In February, a group of far-left lawmakers led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) pushed a resolution calling on Biden to forget waiting for Congress and use executive action to erase up to $50,000 in student loan debt for all borrowers.

Schumer has repeatedly claimed that the president can wipe out billions of dollars in debt with ""the flick of a pen.""

On Wednesday, Pelosi addressed the online loan-forgiveness debate, telling the public that Biden doesn't have the power that they believe he has.

""People think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness,"" the House speaker said during a news conference, Politico reported. ""He does not. He can postpone, he can delay, but he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress.""

""That's a policy discussion,"" she added. “But the president can't do it, so that's not even a discussion. Not everybody realizes that, but the president can only postpone, delay, but not forgive.""

But she wasn't done there.



The San Francisco liberal went on to question the wisdom debt forgiveness, going so far as to make what has been the usual conservative rebuttal to the left's push for the policy — a move the Washington Post's Dave Weigel called ""a dangerous road for a Democrat to go down.""

National security adviser says 'fair amount' of US defense materials given to Afghanistan are now in Taliban hands,"National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that a ""fair amount"" of the defense materials that the U.S. supplied to Afghanistan have fallen under the Taliban's control.



""We don't have a complete picture, obviously, of where every article of defense materials has gone. But certainly a fair amount of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban,"" he said, ""and obviously we don't have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us at the airport.""

The world has been witnessing the Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan as the U.S. seeks to pull out of the country. And while seizing control, the Taliban has also procured military equipment supplied to Afghanistan by the U.S.

""A U.S. defense official on Monday confirmed the Taliban's sudden accumulation of U.S.-supplied Afghan equipment is enormous. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and so spoke on condition of anonymity,"" the Associated Press has reported.



Helicopters have been among the equipment that has been obtained by the Taliban, according to the AP.

USA Today reported that the Taliban has released photos of U.S. Black Hawk helicopters that the U.S. supplied to the Afghan army.



Sullivan explained Tuesday that Black Hawks had been supplied to the Afghan National Security Forces at the request of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who ""came to the Oval Office and asked for additional air capability, among other things.""

Sullivan said that President Biden faced a decision.

""He could not give it to them ... Or he could give it to them with the hope that they could deploy it in service of defending their country. Both of those options had risks. He had to choose,"" Sullivan said.

Ghani recently fled amid the Taliban's takeover of the country.



Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement at the Obama White House, has argued in an opinion piece for USA Today that Sullivan and others should be fired over America's ""botched"" Afghanistan withdrawal.



""President Biden needs to fire his national security adviser and several other senior leaders who oversaw the botched execution of our withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has to restructure how and with whom he is making major foreign policy decisions, allowing for more input from career experts,"" Bruen wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sullivan-says-fair-amount-of-defense-equipment-given-to-afghanistan-by-the-u-s-is-now-in-taliban-s-hands,2021-08-17
Sunny Hostin of 'The View' declares 'we need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated' — specifically 'white evangelicals' and 'Republicans',"Sunny Hostin of ""The View"" tore into Americans who've indicated they won't get the COVID-19 vaccine by saying we should ""shun"" them — and the co-host specifically called out ""white evangelicals"" and ""Republicans.""

What are the details?

Hostin on Monday's program decried the ""politicization"" of the vaccine controversy, calling out former President Donald Trump without naming him — and then proceeded to politicize things herself by using divisive and shaming language and phrases.

""This is just a vestige of the prior administration's politicization of the mask and of the vaccine,"" Hostin said of reason for vaccine hesitancy. ""I mean, the prior administration was an anti-science administration, and I think we're seeing the fallout of the bungling of the pandemic where it led to ... the death[s] of over 500,000 people. We now know that studies show that had the pandemic ... been dealt with in a different way, in a public-health manner, had these masks and efforts not been politicized in the way that they were, we could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, including the lives of my in-laws.""

Perhaps Hostin missed the news that Trump — who, by the way, said he's been vaccinated — recently called anti-vaccine sentiments ""deranged pseudo-science"" and ripped President Joe Biden for aiding such a point of view by pausing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine's distribution.

Oh, and speaking of politicizing the vaccine, who remembers when Kamala Harris in September famously said she wouldn't receive a vaccine developed under the Trump administration — and then happily received it in December when she was the vice president-elect?

But anyway, Hostin in her soft-spoken rant went on to target and blame specific groups.



""When you look at the folks that are not getting vaccinated — because it's a quarter of Americans that aren't getting vaccinated — white evangelicals: 45% say they won't get vaccinated according to ... Pew Research ... almost 50% of Republicans are refusing to get the vaccine,"" Hostin said. ""So we won't reach herd immunity because of those particular groups.""

Then the co-host lowered the boom: ""So I say we need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated.""

She added that unvaccinated Americans should be refused entry into certain places.

""I think if you have not been vaccinated, no entry. You want to get on a plane? You gotta be vaccinated, show proof of vaccination,"" Hostin said. ""And those people who don't want to get vaccinated ... that's fine for you, but you can't spread it to other people ... you don't get those other liberties that come with immunity. Something has to break. If that's your personal choice not to get vaccinated, you don't then get to infringe on the rights of those who have chosen to protect their fellow citizens.""

Hostin's comments begin just after the 3:30 mark in the below clip:

Pushback

But co-host Meghan McCain, as you can imagine, wasn't down with Hostin's all-out assault on the unvaccinated — and pointed out that when concern abounded last year over vaccine hesitancy among the black community, the response was ""compassion"" and ""empathy."" However, amid vaccine hesitancy with other groups, McCain said the response from the left has been ""you dumb hillbillies; stay the hell away from me!""

She added that such messaging is ""absolute garbage"" and is ""getting worse.""

""I have no problem with vaccines, but the messaging is psychotic,"" McCain concluded, adding that ""I'm horrified by the way people are talking to Republicans ... I think we should try and meet people along instead of saying they're dumb morons in the middle of the country that are going to kill everybody. It's just not effective.""

Hostin is far from alone in her view

As it happens, Hostin is far from alone in her view. On Friday, USA Today published an op-ed by a far-left former Justice Department prosecutor titled, ""It's time to start shunning the 'vaccine hesitant.' They're blocking COVID herd immunity.""

Like Hostin on her high horse, Michael J. Stern's piece was full of venom and extremist sentiments, noting that ""a quarter of the country is ruining [herd immunity] for all of us"" — and he also took aim at white evangelicals and Republicans, saying ""in the end the G.O.P., and the children of G.O.D., are perpetuating a virus that is sickening and killing people in droves.""

More from Stern's piece:

A big part of the problem stems from the cultish relationship many evangelicals and Republicans have with the former president. They absorbed his endless efforts to downplay the danger of the virus and turn public health precautions into a political freedom movement. But the time for analyzing why these human petri dishes have chosen to ignore the medical science that could save them, and us, is over. We need a different strategy. I propose shunning.



Biden's wildly successful vaccine rollout means that soon everyone who wants a vaccine will have one. When that happens, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms, barbers, airlines and Ubers should require proof of vaccination before providing their services.



And it shouldn't stop there. Businesses should make vaccination a requirement for employment. A COVID-19 outbreak can shut down a business and be financially devastating. And failure to enforce basic health and safety measures is not fair to employees who have to work in offices, factories and stores where close contact is required. Things should get personal, too: People should require friends to be vaccinated to attend the barbecues and birthday parties they host. Friends don't let friends spread the coronavirus.

Supreme Court case could end affirmative action policies once and for all,"The Supreme Court on Monday said it will hear a challenge to affirmative action policies in a case that will consider wither the admissions process at certain universities discriminates against students of Asian descent.

The court agreed to hear two companion lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit group that believes policies that use race as a factor in college admissions unconstitutionally discriminate against certain students in favor of others.

The group claims that Harvard's undergraduate admissions process discriminates against Asian-Americans and that UNC's discriminates against both Asian-Americans and white students. The lawsuits were brought against both a private and a public university to challenge the affirmative action policies at both kinds of institution. Lower courts have rejected these challenges, ruling that Supreme Court precedent upholds the right of colleges and universities to consider race in admissions decisions as a way to promote diversity.

The court has said racial quotas for admissions are illegal. But in a 2003 ruling supporting the University of Michigan's affirmative action policies, the court ruled schools may use race as a ""plus factor"" among an applicant's other qualities to ensure that the student body is diverse. Most recently, the court in 2016 voted 4-3 against a white woman who had sued the University of Texas' admissions policy. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in that case, citing court precedent to uphold the university's admissions policy.

But Kennedy is no longer on the court. And since 2016, President Donald Trump appointed three new justices, dramatically altering the makeup of the court and potentially giving support to Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and John Roberts, each of whom forcefully dissented in 2016 and harshly criticized affirmative action policies.



Students for Fair Admissions is asking the court to overturn the 2003 ruling, arguing that Title VI of U.S. code prohibits federal funding recipients from using race in admissions.

""We are grateful the Supreme Court accepted these important cases for review. It is our hope that the justices will end the use of race as an admissions factor at Harvard, UNC and all colleges and universities,"" said Edward Blum, president of SSFA.

In a press release from November announcing SFFA's petition to the Supreme Court, Blum said, ""Every year, thousands of college applicants have been subjected to unfair and unconstitutional racial classifications and penalties by our nation's most competitive institutions. These polarizing practices—which a significant majority of all Americans oppose—must end as soon as possible.""

""The cornerstone of our nation's civil rights laws is the principle that an individual's race should not be used to help or harm them in their life's endeavors. We hope the Supreme Court will use the Harvard and UNC cases to begin the restoration of the colorblind legal covenant that holds together Americans of all races and ethnicities,"" he added.

The court is widely expected to hear the case sometime next fall, with a decision potentially coming after the 2022 midterm elections.

Supreme Court reinstates death penalty for Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,"The United States Supreme Court on Friday upheld the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, an Islamic terrorist who was convicted of perpetrating the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured hundreds more, including 17 who lost limbs.

The court voted 6-3 to reverse a lower court decision that had overturned Tsarnaev's death sentence, with the three liberal justices dissenting.

""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev committed heinous crimes. The Sixth Amendment nonetheless guaranteed him a fair trial before an impartial jury. He received one,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court majority. ""The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed.""

Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015 in the deaths of Krystle Campbell, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, who died in the bombing, and also in the death of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, who was killed several days later, among other charges. He and his older brother Tamerlan, both immigrants to Massachusetts from Kyrgysztan, planted pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013, and detonated them as an act of jihad.

Days later on April 18, after the FBI identified the brothers as suspects, they murdered Collier at the MIT campus, in a failed attempt to steal his gun, and later that night engaged in a shootout with police. Tamerlan was killed when Dzhokhar escaped the scene in an SUV, running over his brother. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured the next day after a manhunt in Watertown, Massachusetts.

During police questioning, Tsarnaev admitted that the brothers had intended to detonate bombs in Times Square, New York, next.

Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 federal charges related to the bombing and the events that followed. He was sentenced to death on June 24, 2015. He appealed his sentence, arguing that he didn't get a fair trial because the proceedings took place in Boston, where the jury would be biased. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed, holding that the trial court had erred in issues related to pretrial publicity and had excluded evidence that might have bolstered Tsarnaev's defense.

Then-President Donald Trump sounded off on the court's decision, demanding the ""death penalty"" for Tsarnaev and later directing his administration to ask the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court ruling. The Biden administration renewed the request, surprising many of the President Joe Biden's supporters, given that the president made a campaign promise to eliminate the federal death penalty. Biden's Department of Justice referred to Tsarnaev as a ""terrorist"" who acted in ""furtherance of Jihad"" and who must receive the just penalty for causing ""carnage at the finish line.""

The Biden administration is currently enforcing a moratorium on federal executions while the government reviews the policy. It is unclear whether Tsarnaev's sentence will be carried out under Biden's presidency.

Like 'pitting a child against' big tech: Surgeon General says 13 is 'too early' for kids to be on social media,"United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy says that social media is doing a ""disservice"" to children by allowing them to use the platforms at such a young age, telling CNN that he believes 13 years old is too young to be using the apps.

""These rules around age are inconsistently implemented,"" said Murthy, who says 13-year-olds are still developing their identity.

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram allow 13-year-olds to use their products, but the surgeon general says that parents should band together to keep children off the addictive sites at such a developmental stage.

“If parents can band together and say you know, as a group, we’re not going to allow our kids to use social media until 16 or 17 or 18 or whatever age they choose, that’s a much more effective strategy in making sure your kids don’t get exposed to harm early,” he told CNN.

Senator Chris Murphy (D-Ct.) shared Murthy's sentiments, longing for person-to-person interactions as opposed to communication through screens:

“We have lost something as a society, as so much of our life has turned into screen-to-screen communication, it just doesn’t give you the same sense of value and the same sense of satisfaction as talking to somebody or seeing someone.""

Despite telling CNN that lawmakers could make a difference, Sen. Murphy does not appear to have introduced any legislation regarding this matter.

However, in 2018, Murphy called for platforms like YouTube and Facebook to be more restrictive and asked them to ""do more"" in terms of content moderation, claiming that the ""survival"" of democracy depended on it.

Murphy, speaking to CNN, likened regulating social media to passing laws that make cars safer, saying ""when we had dangerous vehicles on the road, we passed laws to make those vehicles less dangerous.”

The surgeon general, referring to social media algorithms, said it is not a fair fight between big tech and children.

“If we tell a child, use the force of your willpower to control how much time you’re spending, you’re pitting a child against the world’s greatest product designers,” Murthy said.

“I, personally, based on the data I’ve seen, believe that 13 is too early. … It’s a time where it’s really important for us to be thoughtful about what’s going into how they think about their own self-worth and their relationships, and the skewed and often distorted environment of social media often does a disservice to many of those children,” he remarked.

Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in March 2021 as the 21st surgeon general of the United States.

"Despite progressive push, most Americans — including Democrats — agree with JK Rowling's stance that there are only 2 genders: Survey","Even as questions surrounding gender identity and biological sex have swirled in the U.S. in recent years, most Americans still hold to the belief that there are only two genders.

What are the details?

The large majority of Americans — 75% to be exact — still agree that there are ""only two genders,"" male and female, with 63% strongly agreeing, according to the results of a new Rasmussen Reports survey released Monday.

Eighteen percent of respondents, however, disagreed with the statement. The poll was conducted Dec. 21-22 and interviewed 1,000 American adults.

The lopsided results could catch some observers by surprise considering the onslaught of lecturing Americans have received from the progressive left regarding gender identity issues in the U.S. over the past several years.

Progressive transgender ideology, which holds the male-female gender binary to be discriminatory, has leaked into nearly every facet of American life, sparking debate on issues ranging from gender pronouns to public restroom use to whether or not hormone therapy and sex-change surgery should be allowed for children. Social media giant Facebook allows users to select from a list of 58 gender identity options.

Americans have debated the fairness of transgender athletes (biological males) competing in women's sports, as well, and public figures — such as comedian Dave Chappelle and ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling — have been denounced for daring to scrutinize the absurdity of transgenderism.

What else?

Yet despite the progressive push, majorities in every political category — including Democrats, Republicans, and independents — agreed that there are only two genders. Nearly 50% of Democrats and 60% of independents said they strongly agreed with the statement.

The general unison continued from there into the particular hot-button issue of counseling schoolchildren about gender identity without parental consent.

The Rasmussen survey reportedly found that a hefty 80% of Republicans, 54% of Democrats, and 72% of those unaffiliated with either major party were ""opposed to schools counseling children on gender identity without informing parents."" Taken together, 68% of respondents said they were opposed to counseling without parental knowledge.

Anything else?

Respondents were slightly less comfortable with how public the debate has become. When asked specifically about Rowling's public comments supporting the gender binary, 58% sided with her, while 17% characterized her comments as a ""hate crime."" The remaining 25% said they weren't sure.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/survey-americans-agree-jk-rowling-only-2-genders,2021-12-28
Swimmer who tied Lia Thomas in 200-yard freestyle says officials cheated her on podium: 'We just want Lia to hold the fifth-place trophy',"Riley Gaines — who tied transgender swimmer Lia Thomas for fifth place in the women's 200-yard freestyle finals at the NCAA championships over the weekend — told the Daily Wire that officials cheated her on the podium after the event.

Official told Gaines her trophy 'will be coming in the mail'

The University of Kentucky senior told the outlet in an interview that after the race, she ventured behind the podium where NCAA officials were distributing trophies.

Gaines told the Daily Wire that a man in an NCAA shirt told her, “Hey, I just want to let you know, we only have one fifth-place trophy, so yours will be coming in the mail. We went ahead and gave the fifth-place trophy to Lia, but you can pose on the podium with the sixth-place trophy.”

Yes, Thomas would have this moment, too.

Gaines told the outlet she briefly argued with the official: “OK, that’s fine, she worked hard, just like I worked hard, there’s no question there. But can I ask why she gets the fifth-place trophy before I do? Especially last night, she just won the national title.”

The official told Gaines they gave the awards in chronological order, which might mean the order of the swimming lanes; the outlet added that ""the NCAA has not addressed this point to The Daily Wire.""

'We just want Lia to hold the fifth-place trophy'

“I just want you to know that we respect you and admire your swim so much, but we just want Lia to hold the fifth-place trophy,” Gaines recalled the official telling her, the outlet said.

Gaines noted to the Daily Wire that she then told the official, ""I don’t think that’s that’s right, and I don’t think that’s fair. There’s no dispute that only one of us can hold the trophy, but I think given the circumstances, you’re just trying to save face a little bit.""

With that Gaines stood on the podium next to a biological man who identifies as a woman — and who took center stage from yet another biological female athlete.

“It was a bit disheartening,” Gaines told the outlet. “It really was. I left the pool with no trophy. Not a big deal, but it was the goal that I had set all year.”



She asked the Daily Wire, ""Who are we trying to protect here? And who are we trying to fight for here?”

Gaines speculated to the outlet that the NCAA went into the championships “overly sensitive about” Thomas — and perhaps fearful of potential wrath from those who were looking for any slights against the transgender swimmer.

“It’s almost like they’re trying to back [transgender athletes] more than … 90 to 95% of the rest of the swimmers who are kind of bummed by and affected by the rules that were in place for Lia to swim,” she added to the Daily Wire.

The NCAA did not immediately reply to TheBlaze's request for comment regarding Gaines' assertions.

'It just broke my heart'

Gaines also spoke to the outlet about Virginia Tech University swimmer Reka Gyorgy, who criticized the NCAA, saying Thomas had ""taken away"" her spot in the 500-yard freestyle finals.

Gaines told the Daily Wire that she stood next to Gyorgy during the final heat of the 500 on Thursday: “When Lia touched the wall, and [Reka] realized that she got 17th, the first thing she said to me was, ‘Wow, I can’t believe I just got beat by someone who probably wasn’t even trying their hardest.'”

“It just broke my heart,” Gaines recalled to the outlet. “She had tears in her eyes.”

The Daily Wire said Gaines repeatedly emphasized that she doesn't believe Thomas is the problem: “I am in full support of her and [in] full support of her transition and her swimming career and everything like that, because there’s no doubt that she works hard, too, but she’s just abiding by the rules that the NCAA put in place, and that’s the issue.”

However, she added to the outlet that Thomas also used the women's locker room at the NCAAs, which Gaines said was awkward.

“The first day I got there, I was in the locker room changing, and then she came in, and it just kind of got silent,” Gaines told the Daily Wire, adding that ""everyone in the locker room, I think, was kind of stunned"" but that “no one really looked or anything like that.”

The outlet said the NCAA has not responded to requests for comment on this point.

Gaines added to the Daily Wire that the NCAA managed to ""turn their backs on all of the biological females — not even just in swimming, but in all NCAA sports, just to kind of appease a small minority.”

Editor's note: A previouus version of this article listed the race as ""200-meter"" freestyle instead of ""200-yard.""

Taliban propaganda photo of fighters in Iwo Jima flag pose,"The Taliban appear to be mocking the United States in a new propaganda photo. The image, which some have called ""humiliating,"" shows an elite Taliban fighting unit donned in U.S. military gear and hoisting up the flag of the fundamentalist Islamic group in nearly the exact same pose that U.S. Marines hoisted up the American flag during World War II.

The Badri 313 Battalion is reportedly the Taliban's special commando unit, which was allegedly named after the Battle of Badr where the Prophet Mohammad led the Muslim community to a major military victory with just 313 men in 624 CE.

A propaganda photo shows members of the Badri 313 Battalion wearing what appears to be U.S. military gear raising up the Taliban flag in a similar fashion to the six U.S. Marines who raised the U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945.

There were heated reactions to the Taliban seemingly mocking the iconic U.S. military photograph.

Tom Bevan, the co-Founder of RealClearPolitics, wrote: ""The humiliation continues.""



Conservative commentator John Cardillo declared: ""The Taliban is wearing our gear, mocking Iwo Jima. Biden must resign or be impeached and removed.""



Army Ranger and UFC fighter Tim Kennedy exclaimed: ""Taliban soldiers wearing all U.S. supplied equipment MOCK iconic World War II image of American Marines raising flag on Iwo Jima as soldiers don US military gear in propaganda footage. It is straight up NUKE time.""

Former Navy SEAL Jonathan T Gilliam said: ""This just keeps getting worse and worse! #Taliban mocks iconic Iwo Jima picture wearing US gear left behind by the @JoeBiden woke administration.""

James Glancy, ex-member of the Royal Marine Commandos, reacted by saying: ""The Taliban 'Special Forces - Badri 313' are just mocking America now with their PR machine.""

The Taliban also published a propaganda video this week with the Bardi 313 Battalion wearing what appears to be U.S. military gear, including tactical helmets, night-vision goggles, and modern firearms.

A photo posted by Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, shows Taliban fighters ""with their new American gear"" and a militarized Ford pickup truck.

An AFP tweet shows ""Taliban fighters carrying M4 and M18 assault rifles and M24 sniper weapons, driving around in iconic US Humvees.""

Videos posted on social media show that the Taliban has seized thousands of firearms, ammunition, body armor, and other military equipment.





The U.S. gave Afghan forces an estimated $28 billion in weaponry between 2002 and 2017, according to Business Insider.

""Everything that hasn't been destroyed is the Taliban's now,"" an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week that the Taliban now controls a ""fair amount"" of the weapons supplied to the Afghan government.

""We don't have a complete picture, obviously, of where every article of defense materials has gone. But certainly a fair amount of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban,"" Sullivan said, ""and obviously we don't have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us at the airport.""

The Taliban likely have possession of 2,000 armored vehicles, including U.S. Humvees, and up to 40 aircraft, including UH-60 Black Hawks, scout attack helicopters, and ScanEagle military drones.

""When an armed group gets their hands on American-made weaponry, it's sort of a status symbol. It's a psychological win,"" Elias Yousif, deputy director of the Center for International Policy's Security Assistance Monitor, told The Hill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-iwo-jima-flag-badri,2021-08-21
Jake Tapper stuns Jimmy Kimmel when he defends Peter Doocy over Biden's 'SOB' insult,"CNN anchor Jake Tapper appeared to stun Jimmy Kimmel when the late night host said President Joe Biden was justified in calling a Fox News reporter a ""stupid son of a b***h.""

Tapper made the comments on Kimmel's show when he was asked if his life was far more boring after former President Donald Trump left office.

""No, the current president just called a reporter a dumb son of a b***h, that just happened today,"" said Tapper.



""He did, and in, I know you don't usually give out opinions, but that reporter, Peter Doocy, is he a dumb son of a b***h?"" Kimmel joked.

""I don't think any president should be calling any journalist a dumb son of a b***h,"" Tapper replied. ""And to be fair to Peter Doocy, the question was fairly anodyne.""

Kimmel tried to say the comment was caught on a microphone but Tapper ridiculed that idea. Kimmel then joked that Doocy was actually what Biden called him, to some applause from the audience.

""So, I do not agree with that, and I will say standards for decency don't have to do with whether or not you like the people who are being treated poorly. It has to do with the standard,"" he said to more applause from the audience.

""And, yes, I realize that Peter's channel probably would never come to my defense like that, but it is what it is,"" he concluded.

While many on the left defended Biden and pointed to similar insults from former President Donald Trump to justify him, Doocy laughed off the insult when he later appeared on ""The Five.""

Tapper also noted that Biden later called Doocy to personally apologize and tell him that it wasn't personal.

Tapper's CNN colleague Jim Acosta was far more defensive about the Doocy insult. He noted that no one ever apologized to him for the insults he received from Trump, and joked that he still had ""marks"" on his back from his rhetorical fights with the former president.

Target drops ‘woke’ celebrity’s cookware line after she apologizes for telling a 16-year-old celebrity to commit suicide,"Target has dropped model Chrissy Teigen's cookware line from its offerings as she issued an apology for telling a fellow celebrity to commit suicide when the celebrity was just 16 years old.

In new unearthed tweets and messages, Teigen targeted reality TV star, model, and musician Courtney Stodden with horrific bullying when Stodden — who is now 26 years old — was just 16 years old.

What are the details?

On Thursday, Fox Business reported that Target opted to remove her cookware line.

""The retailer has pulled [Teigen's] Cravings cookware line from its website,"" Fox Business reported. ""However, her trio of Cravings cookbooks remain available on the site.""

In a statement, a Target spokesperson told the outlet, ""We made the mutual decision in December to no longer carry the cookware line, given our continued focus on brands we develop and that can only be found at Target.""

Earlier this week, Stodden revealed that Teigen, now 35, relentlessly bullied her when she was just a teenager.

In one such instance, Teigen, who was in her mid-20s, wrote, ""@CourtneyStodden My Friday fantasy: you. dirt nap. mmmmmm baby.""

In another instance, she retweeted the model and wrote, ""Go. to sleep. forever.""

""@CourtneyStodden what drug makes you do that with your mouth?"" she tweeted during another occasion. ""A]sking for a friend who really wants to look like an idiot. thanks.""

She also at one point tweeted, ""@CourtneyStodden I hate you.""

According to the Daily Beast, Teigen also was said to have sent a private message to Stodden on social media telling her to kill herself.

""[Teigen] wouldn't just publicly tweet about wanting me to take 'a dirt nap' but would privately DM me and tell me to kill myself,"" Stodden told the outlet. ""Things like, 'I can't wait for you to die.'""

Teigen's harassment and that of many others, Stodden told the Daily Beast, came as she faced media criticism for marrying 51-year-old Doug Hutchison in 2011 when she was 16.

Following the revelation, Teigen issued an apology to Stodden, which said, ""Not a lot of people are lucky enough to be held accountable for all their past bulls**t in front of the entire world. I'm mortified and sad at who I used to be. I was an insecure, attention seeking troll. I am ashamed and completely embarrassed at my behavior.""

""But that is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel,"" Teigen continued. ""I have worked so hard to give you guys joy and be beloved and the feeling of letting you down is nearly unbearable, truly. These were not my only mistakes and surely won't be my last as hard as I try but god I will try!!""

Stodden revealed in a Thursday Instagram post that Teigen blocked her on social media following the apology.

Stodden wrote, ""I accept her apology and forgive her. But the truth remains the same, I have never heard from her or her camp in private. In fact, she blocked me on Twitter. All of me wants to believe this is a sincere apology, but it feels like a public attempt to save her partnerships with Target and other brands who are realizing her 'wokeness' is a broken record.""

What else?

Target — though it insisted it dissolved the partnership with Teigen as early as December — had Teigen's merchandise live for sale on its website as late as April 17. The page appears to have been hastily removed that day.

It seems fair to point out that Stodden was vocal about Teigen's treatment back in April — and even earlier in March — though the story only gained traction on much of the internet this week.

Back in April, Stodden shared a video about the purportedly bullying and said that Teigen never apologized for her behavior.

In March, Stodden blasted Teigen for being a ""hypocrite"" over what Teigen said was her own experience with cyberbullying. The purportedly cyberbullying and overall ""negativity"" reportedly prompted Teigen to take a very short-lived social media break.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/target-drops-chrissy-teigen-courtney-stodden,2021-05-14
Female skateboarder speaks out about losing to transgender competitor,"Female skateboarder Taylor Silverman is speaking out about losing to a biological male — in an Instagram post, Silverman said that she placed second in a Red Bull competition and lost out on prize money because of a transgender competitor.

Silverman placed second in the Red Bull Cornerstone competition last year.

""My name is Taylor Silverman. I am a female athlete. I have been skateboarding for eleven years and competing for several years. I have been in three different contests with trans women, two of which I placed second. At the last contest series I did for Redbull, I placed second. The trans competitor who won took $1000 dollars in qualifiers, $3000 in finals, and $1000 in best trick. This totaled to $5000 of the prize money meant for the female athletes. I took $1000 in qualifiers and $1750 for second place, so $2750 in total. The girl who took third received $750. The girl who deserved $1000 for best trick took nothing along with whoever would have placed third. I deserved to place first, be acknowledged for my win, and get paid. I reached out to Redbull and was ignored. I am sick of being bullied into silence,"" Silverman wrote.

Silverman posted an email that she said she sent to Red Bull, but she noted that she has not received a reply.

""I am reaching out in hopes of being directed to the right person to express my concerns about what occurred at the Redbull Cornerstone contest with the transgender competitor in the women's division,"" she wrote. ""A biological man with a clear advantage won the women's division, best trick, and also won multiple qualifiers. This took away the opportunity that was meant for women to place and earn money. What happened was unfair and at the time I was too uncomfortable to speak up. I understand that in todays society even some women think this is acceptable, but I believe in doing the right thing even if it's not the popular thing. I now realize it's really important for me to speak up and I'd like to schedule a time to talk.""

While some on Instagram agreed with Silverman's sentiments, others promoted radical leftist gender ideology and decried Silverman for her comments.



""Good for you for speaking up Taylor! I support you. Please try to keep in mind that the internet is not an accurate snapshot of reality so the abuse you're getting here is not the voice of those around you. The VAST majority of people even in the most liberal areas agree with what you're saying here. I am sorry you're getting abuse for saying so,"" one commenter wrote.

""Trans women are women. The real issue here is you not seeing that,"" someone else commented. ""The skater who won qualified and won fair and square. The reasoning you have here IS very transphobic.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taylor-silverman-skateboard-transgender-competition,2022-05-19
"Teacher allegedly calls middle schooler's 'Black King' T-shirt racist, says there should be a white history month. Now teacher is on leave.","An Oklahoma middle school teacher is on paid administrative leave after allegedly calling a 13-year-old student's ""Black King"" T-shirt racist and saying there should be a white history month, KFOR-TV reported.

What are the details?

Latrell Taft told the station his shirt — which also shows an image of the African continent — was a birthday present and that he was excited to wear it to Heartland Middle School last Tuesday.

But the 7th grader said during science class his teacher asked him what his shirt said.

""She said that if she had a shirt that said white queen it would have been racist,"" Latrell added to KFOR. ""Then after that, she said we need a white history month. I said black people don't have enough recognition and we barely learn about black people in February at my school.""

Image source: KFOR-TV video screenshot

He also said the majority of his class sided with the teacher, calling his shirt racist, the station reported.



""I was embarrassed,"" Latrell recalled to KFOR.

His mother, Melisa Shirley, told the station she immediately called the school but initially was ""brushed off.""

Image source: KFOR-TV video screenshot

But KFOR said Edmond Public Schools released a statement a day later saying it's investigating the incident, is in contact with the parent, and will take ""appropriate and swift action"" if it's determined that the student was the ""target of discrimination, bullying, or racism.""



The district's statement added that it ""has taken numerous steps to address discrimination in Edmond schools, including providing professional development for staff on the issue of unconscious bias and ensuring equity for all. The district administration is continuing to assess the need for more training and professional development in this important area,"" the station said.

KFOR said in its broadcast that Latrell wants to return to school — but not if the teacher is still employed.

""I am proud of my blackness, and she will never take it away from me,"" he told the station, adding that ""I am a king because I think I'm a king"" and that he'd tell his teacher that ""black is beautiful.""

Several of his classmates have already reached out and apologized to him, the station noted.

Latrell's mother added to KFOR that ""there should not be educators like this. I think she should be reprimanded."" The station added in its broadcast that the mother was set to meet with the principal last Thursday morning and present a list a demands.

What happened next?

The school district then placed the teacher in question on paid administrative leave ""pending a decision on disciplinary action"" while it continues its investigation, KFOR noted.

Edmond Public Schools officials said they met with the teacher Thursday afternoon but couldn't divulge details about the meeting's outcome, the station reported.

""The district recognizes the public's desire for a quick resolution to this issue. However, it's important to note that employees have fundamental rights to ensure fairness when they are the subject of a complaint,"" Susan Parks-Schlepp, the district's director of communications, added in a statement to KFOR. ""Those rights include an option for the teacher to respond to and contest any recommended disciplinary action.""

Teacher at woke Manhattan school calls out employer for harmful 'indoctrination' of students,"A teacher at an elite private school in New York City blasted the institution in an open letter Tuesday denouncing its ""indoctrination"" of students through ""antiracist"" training and teaching.

What are the details?

Grace Church School in Manhattan — which costs a whopping $57,000 a year to attend — prides itself on being at the forefront of implementing woke ideology into classrooms. Earlier this year, the school made headlines for issuing an ""inclusive language"" guide that warned staff, students, and parents against assuming someone's gender and using unwelcoming terms such as ""mom and dad"" and ""Merry Christmas.""

Now the school is facing loud criticism from within its own ranks over its full-throated endorsement of the critical race theory.

Paul Rossi, a math teacher at the school, slammed his employer in a column published Tuesday by former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss, titled, ""I Refuse to Stand By While My Students Are Indoctrinated.""

In the open letter, Rossi decried the school's embrace of ""antiracist"" doctrine, which he called ""deeply harmful"" and completely antithetical to ""the virtues of curiosity, empathy and understanding.""



""'Antiracist' training sounds righteous, but it is the opposite of truth in advertising. It requires teachers like myself to treat students differently on the basis of race,"" Rossi wrote before expounding on how the indoctrination is implemented:

My school, like so many others, induces students via shame and sophistry to identify primarily with their race before their individual identities are fully formed. Students are pressured to conform their opinions to those broadly associated with their race and gender and to minimize or dismiss individual experiences that don't match those assumptions. The morally compromised status of ""oppressor"" is assigned to one group of students based on their immutable characteristics. In the meantime, dependency, resentment and moral superiority are cultivated in students considered ""oppressed.""



All of this is done in the name of ""equity,"" but it is the opposite of fair. In reality, all of this reinforces the worst impulses we have as human beings: our tendency toward tribalism and sectarianism that a truly liberal education is meant to transcend.

What else?



""Furthermore,"" he added, ""in order to maintain a united front for our students, teachers at Grace are directed to confine our doubts about this pedagogical framework to conversations with an in-house 'Office of Community Engagement' for whom every significant objection leads to a foregone conclusion. Any doubting students are likewise 'challenged' to reframe their views to conform to this orthodoxy.""

Rossi recalled in the column how he had recently decided to speak out about the ideology at a ""mandatory, whites-only student and faculty Zoom meeting,"" during which he questioned ""whether one must define oneself in terms of a racial identity at all."" His goal, he said, was to ""model for students that they should feel safe to question ideological assertions if they felt moved to do so.""

Rossi's believed his comments had instigated a fruitful discussion. However, after the meeting, when word got out about what he said, Rossi said he was ""informed by the head of the high school that [his] philosophical challenges had caused 'harm' to students, given that these topics were 'life and death matters, about people's flesh and blood and bone.'""

He added that he was promptly reprimanded for his conduct and a few days later, the head of school ordered all high school advisers to publicly denounce his actions to students.

""Imagine being a young person in this environment,"" Rossi wrote. ""Would you risk voicing your doubts, especially if you had never heard a single teacher question it?""

Rossi noted that by writing the column he risked losing his livelihood as a teacher, but maintained that he couldn't stay silent.

""I know that by attaching my name to this I'm risking not only my current job but my career as an educator, since most schools, both public and private, are now captive to this backward ideology,"" Rossi wrote. ""But witnessing the harmful impact it has on children, I can't stay silent.""

Anything else?

In response to a request for comment from Fox News, Head of School George Davison shared a message administrators sent to parents regarding the incident.

""As you may be aware, a member of the faculty wrote and posted an article that is critical of Grace and of our efforts to build a school where everyone feels they belong,"" the message read. ""The process of building a community is often challenging, and I am disappointed that this individual felt it necessary to air his differences in this way.

""We have always held the goal of fostering an environment that is safe and welcoming for all members of the community across a myriad of differences,"" the message continued. ""This is a work in progress, and while we are not always as successful as we would hope, we know that it requires the constructive engagement of everyone in the community.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-slams-woke-school-indoctrination,2021-04-14
"Teachers from Ohio's largest school district on strike. They are demanding smaller class sizes, higher wages, and air conditioning in classrooms","Columbus students are scheduled to return to school in two days, but their teachers have gone on strike. Yesterday the teachers' union for the largest district in Ohio voted to go on strike after 94% of its members rejected the school board's contract.



The teachers began picketing outside the district's 20 schools on Monday morning, reported WBNS-TV. The Columbus Board of Education stated that, because of the strike, students would start online remote learning with full-time substitutes in the meantime.

The teachers' union, the Columbus Education Association, filed an official notice on August 10 to the Columbus Board of Education stating that an agreement had to be reached within 10 days.

After the union filed the intent-to-strike notice, CEA spokesperson Regina Fuentes said, ""CEA has consistently maintained that we are fighting not just for CEA members, but for our students and community. That is why CEA will continue that fight until a fair agreement is reached for the schools Columbus students deserve.""

Following months of meetings with federal mediators, the district and union could not come to an agreement. The Columbus Board of Education made its final offer on Sunday.

The board released a statement Sunday evening. Jennifer Adair, the board's president, expressed that she was ""disappointed"" with the decision made by the CEA. She said, ""We offered a generous compensation package for teachers and provisions that would have a positive impact on classrooms. Our offer was also responsive to the concerns that have been raised by CEA during the negotiations process.""

The CEA requested that the school board provide higher wages for all teachers, smaller class sizes, heating and air conditioning inside all classrooms, full-time teachers for extracurricular classes, and a limit on the number of class periods.

On August 18, the school board said that it had offered the teachers an annual 3% raise, a $2,000 bonus, and a promise to install air conditioning in classrooms. The board also mentioned that it would consider smaller class sizes.

The CEA stated that it is not content with the language in the contract regarding air conditioning for classrooms.

Fuentes stated, ""It is with a full understanding of the sacrifices that students, parents, and teachers will make together to win the schools Columbus students deserve that CEA members overwhelmingly rejected the Board's last, best, and final offer tonight and voted to strike.""

In response to the picketing, the school board has scheduled an emergency meeting for Monday evening. Currently, there are no scheduled negotiations between the union and the board.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teachers-from-ohio-s-largest-school-district-on-strike-demanding-smaller-class-sizes-higher-wages-and-air-conditioning-in-classrooms,2022-08-22
Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten mocked for saying teachers are exhausted,"The president of the second-largest teachers union in the United States got slammed for recently saying that teachers are ""tired and exhausted,"" despite being at home for months. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten also said that ""we have to find a way to repair and nourish"" teachers, which was lampooned by online commenters.

Weingarten appeared on MSNBC Friday night, where she attempted to persuade viewers that the AFT wants to reopen schools, despite having yet to commit to in-person learning in the fall.

""Number one we want schools to reopen for a rapport and we don't want outbreaks,"" Weingarten said. ""We want schools open and we want them to stay open.""

But Weingarten said that teachers ""don't want to be the mask police,"" adding that Texas and Iowa made a politically motivated decision to ""rush to say no mask mandates when we still don't have a vaccine that's okay for elementary school students.""

""Well there's two plans: one is for the summer and one is for the fall,"" the union boss of 1.7 million members said. ""In the fall we have to first and foremost create a safe and welcoming environment.""

Weingarten attempted to garner sympathy for teachers.

""Teachers are tired; they are exhausted,"" she said. ""We have to find a way to repair and nourish them as well as families in terms of attracting and retaing our teaching force.""

Online commenters mocked Weingarten's comments about teachers being ""exhausted.""

""Let's try this, Randi. STUDENTS are tired; they are exhausted. They've been put on the back burner by teachers unions for over a year so a virus could be used for political power gains. And MONEY. And pushing CRT so they can be told their skin color is all that matters.Shameful.""

""From what? Sitting our your asses on Zoom? People have had it with your no work, whining nonsense.""

""Why do public school teachers think they're so special? Parents and students not exhausted and tired too. medical workers and grocery store workers need to be nourished and repaired too. You. Aren't. Special.""

""Poor teachers. Where I live in Oregon they got vaccinated before 80+ months ago, and many are still not back at school. My kids are getting 2 hours twice a week in person. When it was Zoom it was 2 hours 4 days a week. They must be so exhausted. I hope the teachers are ok.""

""Having a whole year off must be exhausting!""

""Straight talk: Schools should not have closed this year. What was always clear is now *crystal* clear. Accountability for the high costs of closures to children is beyond-fair.""

""If you don't actively scorn teacher's unions by this point, you're not paying attention.""

Weingarten, who has a reported salary of around $500,000, has recently been attempting to change the perception that she is a proponent of reopening schools thanks to the help of Democratic figures, including first lady Jill Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona.

On May 18, Weingarten appeared on C-SPAN, where frustrated parents grilled the AFT boss for refusing to reopen schools.



One upset parent astutely asked Weingarten, ""How come the parochial schools and the private schools could navigate their way through this scenario, but the public schools didn't seem to be able to manage that?""

Weingarten's answer via Reason:

So this is part of the reason why we asked the last administration to collect data on all of these things. So there were many many many public schools that have been open in a hybrid manner or in a full-time manner since September. And there have been many private schools, and many parochial schools [open]. And there have been many private and parochial schools that were not open. But we don't have the data, we have the anecdotal data. Fifteen percent, for example—a piece of data that I just got a couple of weeks ago—fifteen percent of parochial and private schools have closed fully during this period of time.



Many of the private schools that I know when I started asking them the questions about how are they doing this because we have to learn from each other, they said that they got the PPP loans that was in one of the first COVID packages so that they could do the testing that I just talked about, and they could do the layers of mitigation. And they also had parents, in a couple of the private schools, they had parents who shelled out a lot more money to do that. And the parochial schools, we saw some extra space that got used in those kind of ways.

And frankly, some of us also, you know, said that every one of the schools, you know, who were serving poor people had to get additional funding, and I got criticized by my, you know, public education friends for doing that. This is a matter of we have to learn from each other. But at the end of the day, if you have a ventilation system that doesn't work, if you don't have soap and water in your schools, if you can't get soap and water, and you need to have, you know, you need to wash kids, everyone needs to wash their hands, perhaps sanitizing stations, all of those things were resource-based things that were really important.

Earlier this month, Weingarten implied that Fox News and former President Donald Trump were at fault as to why schools are not reopened now.

Weingarten's AFT has been scrutinized for its cozy relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Damning emails between AFT officials and the CDC suggest that the teachers union successfully lobbied the CDC on the health agency's reopening guidance and language.

AFT donated nearly $20 million to Democrats in 2020, according to watchdog The Center Square.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teachers-union-president-teachers-exhausted,2021-05-23
Teachers' union refuses to defend teacher threatened by school because he criticized CRT-like training,"A local chapter of a prominent national teachers' union has, without explanation, dismissed a grievance filed by a teacher who claimed he was targeted by his school after he criticized a woke training session.

According to the Washington Free Beacon, John Grande, a gym teacher for Hartford Public Schools in Hartford, Connecticut, who has taught for 30 years, claimed that his school threatened to fire him or force him to attend further ""sensitivity"" training after he criticized a mandatory ""privilege"" training.

Grande said that he filed a formal complaint against the district back in July but that American Federation of Teachers Local 1018 dismissed it without explanation.

""Our employee handbook explicitly states that no employee of the Hartford public school system will be disciplined for exercising their right to free speech,"" Grande told the Free Beacon. ""When asked for my reaction to the training, I expressed my disagreement and was punished for doing so.""

Images captured at the training and obtained by the Free Beacon show that teachers were forced to reflect upon the privileges they supposedly enjoy because of their race and sexual orientation, assumptions often made in critical race and gender theory.

""I can choose blemish cover or bandages in 'flesh' color and have them more or less match my skin"" and ""I can go home from meetings, classes, and conversations without feeling excluded, fearful, attacked, isolated, outnumbered, unheard, held at a distance, stereotyped or feared because of my sexual orientation"" are just two example statements that trainees were supposedly required to consider.

Grande said that he expressed his frustration about the training both in his feedback and in conversation with two of his colleagues, who then reported his criticisms to the district.

While Grande filed the complaint shortly after his school threatened to fire him, he had no means of forcing the district to address it since AFT 1018 has the exclusive power to arbitrate grievances with the district, and it has the power to determine which cases it will take.

""Officials are refusing to represent him simply because he isn't a member,"" said Nathan McGrath, president of the Fairness Center. ""John is just asking the union to do its job so he can continue doing his.""

Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect changes in reporting from the source material. The original article stated that John Grande paid some union dues for contract negotiations, even though he is not a member of the union. However, Grande does not pay union dues. Only full union members pay dues.

Team USA track star pens blistering essay about biological men competing in women's sports: Something needs to be done before 'women's sports is erased',"Team USA World Masters track athlete Cynthia Monteleone issued a scathing rebuke against including biological men — specifically transgender women — in women's sports.

What are the details?

In a lengthy essay for Fox News, Monteleone, who has competed in various world championships and is also a track coach, said that if biological males continue to compete on women's sports teams, it will mean the end of women's sports as we know it.

""I’m standing for the protection of women’s sports,"" she wrote. ""At the 2018 World Masters Athletics Championships in Málaga, Spain, I competed in the 200-meter race against a male-bodied athlete, whom I beat by only a few tenths of a second. The next year, the same athlete beat my teammate in the hurdles for a place on the podium at the 2019 World Championship indoor meet in Poland. My teammate had trained harder than anyone I know.""

Monteleone said that the trend continues: Her daughter, a high school-age track star in her own right, was defeated by a biological male identifying as a female in her first ever high school track race.

""I had watched proudly as my strong and determined girl did all the right things – made personal, difficult sacrifices to train her body to be as fast and fit as possible for her first race,"" she wrote. ""Yet all her hard work seemed to drift away along with the male-bodied athlete, who had just transferred from the boys’ volleyball team to the girl’s team the season before. The athlete breezed right by her to win first place, leaving her to finish second.""

Monteleone added, ""How can you win as a female when you’re lined up next to a male body whose strength, heart and lung capacity, and pace are all greater than your own no matter what the 'treatment'?""

She pointed out that the impact of biological men competing against women in women's sports takes more than just a physical toll on female competitors — and often has a detrimental impact on girls' and women's mental health. Further, women biologically have next to no chance of holding any kind of physical advantage over males when it comes to competition sports.

Monteleone added that even when biological males suppress their hormones, they are still 12% faster than their biologically female counterparts — and that's after two years.

""The most important factor is the psychological toll. Many of the girls I coach suffer from anxiety over having to compete against male-bodied athletes. We all know the powerful scientific neurotransmitter connection between our minds and our bodies: When you think you can win, you have a better chance of doing it. It’s proven,"" she continued. ""Yet those of us who dare speak out that competing against males is unfair are told, 'Oh, it’s not that big of a deal. It doesn’t happen that often. Just keep your mouth shut and be quiet.' That’s what I was told when I raised questions as to the unfairness of running next to a male-bodied athlete at the World Masters.""

Monteleone said that she's tired of remaining quiet on the local and international stage, and is fearlessly standing up in support of protecting women's sports.

""[K]now this: There is a groundswell,"" she warned. ""From my very own daughter raising her voice along with the young track stars Chelsea Mitchell, Selina Soule, and Alanna Smith in Connecticut, to Lainey Armistead, who plays soccer in West Virginia, to the female swimmers at the University of Pennsylvania who are stressed by the presence of a male in their locker room (not to mention the women who compete, and often lose, against this male-bodied swimmer).""

Monteleone said that the ""chorus of voices"" protesting against biological male inclusion will soon drown out any other narrative other than the one standing to preserve the sanctity of women's sports.

""Female athletes deserve their chance to receive accolades, awards, and scholarships,"" she insisted. ""We must raise our voices on behalf of fairness and equal opportunity for all women, before the entire category of women’s sports is erased.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/team-usa-track-star-pens-blistering-essay-about-biological-men-competing-in-womens-sports,2022-02-18
"Teammates of transgender female swimmer know 'they will never, ever be able to beat' Lia Thomas, father of another UPenn women's swim team member says","The father of a University of Pennsylvania women's swim team member said his daughter and other biological female teammates ""realize that they will never, ever be able to beat"" Lia Thomas — a biological male who's transitioning to female and recently has been breaking records as part of the UPenn women's team, Fox News reported.

What are the details?

Thomas ""is most likely going to be representing you and I and all other Americans at the Olympics,"" the father, who has a medical background, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The father spoke on the condition of anonymity over fear his views could bring ""actual physical harm"" to his daughter and family, the cable network said. He added to Fox News that others are staying mum as they believe ""there's nothing they can do about it. They are stuck.""

""Part of the reason these little girls get so excited about this is because they see themselves possibly being [at the Olympics],"" he told the cable network. ""There's a shot that they can do it if they swim hard enough, if they work hard enough, they got it, they can do it. Anybody can do it.""

He wondered to Fox News, ""But now what do you say to your daughter? You got Lia up on the blocks, taking a spot from a cisgender woman on the Olympic team. How do I tell my daughter that could be you one day? You can’t. You can never be her.""

The cable network said he added that, ""Yes, your daughter can still participate in athletics and reap a lot of the benefits of athletics, but she'll never be on the podium.""

What else?

Thomas has been receiving testosterone suppressors for nearly three years and competed on the UPenn men’s team before switching to the women's team in 2020, Fox News said.

The transgender female swimmer is slated to compete at next month's Ivy League championships and has qualified for the NCAA Division I championships in March, the cable network said. What's more, Thomas has turned in better times this season than several collegiate swimmers who competed in last summer’s Olympics and swam the nation’s best times in the 200- and 500-yard freestyle last month, Fox News said, citing the New York Times.

The College Swimming & Diving Coaches Association of America called on the NCAA Competition Oversight Committee to temporarily expand this year’s participation limit by one spot so Thomas ""and the other cisgender women athletes who have earned the right to compete"" can do so, the cable network reported.

'My daughter hates it'

The father who spoke to Fox News said Thomas’ cisgender teammates are ""very upset"" about the turn of events.

""My daughter hates it. She doesn’t think it’s fair,"" he told the cable network, adding that while his daughter hasn’t lost opportunities to Thomas, ""other girls have and will, because the coach is going to take"" the swimmers with the fastest times.

The dad added to Fox News that his words aren't about transphobia or bullying — just fairness to women.

""All the swimmers like Lia, she’s a wonderful person and very nice,"" he noted to the cable network, adding that Thomas has been ""nothing but polite"" and is ""not doing anything against the rules.""

Collegiate records may fall

However, the father also revealed to Fox News that there are fears that Thomas will beat records held by Olympians Katie Ledecky and Missy Franklin during the NCAA championships, which are slated for March 16-19 in Atlanta.

""Lia is going to go to the NCAA’s, and she’s going to take down Katie Ledecky’s record, she’s going to take down Missy Franklin’s record, and it’s not because she is an exceptional woman,"" he added to the cable network. ""It's not because she is the pinnacle of female athletics, which Katie Ledecky and Missy Franklin are.""

Anything else?

A report this week indicated that some of Thomas' teammates are uncomfortable with the transgender female in the same locker room. ""It's definitely awkward because Lia still has male body parts and is still attracted to women,"" a member of the swim team said, adding that although Thomas sometimes wears a towel, there's still a fair amount of nakedness, and team members have seen Thomas's private parts.

Earlier this month a female UPenn swimmer claimed Thomas arranged to lose a recent race to a Yale biological female — who is transitioning to male but hasn't taken hormones yet — to prove men aren't always stronger than women.

"Report: Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley will face 'secretive' Senate ethics investigation over Capitol riots","Senate Democrats will conduct an investigation into Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) using what Politico described as ""one of the most secretive committees in Congress.""

What are the details?

According to Politico, the Senate Ethics Committee will investigate the Republican lawmakers to determine what, if any, role they played in the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Prior to the violence, both senators announced they would oppose the certification of Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. A joint session of Congress was meeting to do just that when the Capitol was stormed by Trump supporters who believed the presidency was ""stolen"" from then-President Donald Trump.

The formal ethics investigation comes after seven Senate Democrats filed an ethics complaint against Cruz and Hawley.

What does the ethics complaint say?

The complaint — filed by Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), Ron Wyden (Ore.), Tina Smith (N.M.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Tim Kaine (Va.), and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) — claims both Cruz and Hawley ""amplified claims of election fraud.""

""While Congress was debating Senator Cruz's objection, a violent mob stormed the Capitol. These insurrectionists ransacked the building, stole property, and openly threatened Members of Congress and the Vice President. Dozens of police officers were injured; five people died, including U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick,"" the complaint adds. ""By proceeding with their objections to the electors after the violent attack, Senators Cruz and Hawley lent legitimacy to the mob's cause and made future violence more likely.""

The group of Democrats demands that Cruz and Hawley be investigated to determine if they played a role in the coordination of the attack on the Capitol, though zero evidence has surfaced suggesting either Republican was involved in the violence.

""The extent, if any, of communication or coordination between Sens. Hawley and Cruz and the organizers of the rally remains to be investigated,"" the ethics complaint reads. ""Further investigation is necessary to determine whether and to what extent Senators Cruz and Hawley were also aware of these groups' activities or coordinated with their efforts.""

Why secretive?

The Senate Ethics Committee stays mute about its business until it determines to take action, which means, as Politico noted, the investigation into Cruz and Hawley ""will unwind over an interminable timetable with little hint of where it is going.""

Kaine said the open-ended process permits the committee to ""conduct whatever investigation question we asked that they need to, without a time limit on how they do it. And Cruz and Hawley have to have a fair forum to present their own thoughts about what happened.""

Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), the chairman of the committee, has called on Cruz and Hawley to resign.

However, not everyone agrees with the nature of the ethics investigation.

Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) suggested the probe may be an avenue to punish Cruz and Hawley for merely holding dissenting views.

""It's a very slippery slope if you start punishing senators for holding unpopular views and exercising their rights on the Senate floor,"" she told Politico. ""That's not what I think of the Ethics Committee as being for. I don't see how this is an ethics complaint.""

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has similarly defended Cruz and Hawley, rebuking calls for the Republicans to resign by citing the nature of Senate dialogue.

""I think the Senate is a place of freedom,"" Feinstein said last month. ""And people come here to speak their piece, and they do, and they provide a kind of leadership. In some cases, it's positive, in some cases, maybe not. A lot of that depends on who's looking and what party they are. But it's an important place to have this kind of dialogue. It's probably the highest-level dialogue that you get in an electoral body.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-josh-hawley-secretive-ethics-investigation,2021-02-01
Ted Cruz responds after MSNBC's Joy Reid accuses him of being a race traitor,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) fired back at MSNBC host Joy Reid after she said Tuesday that Cruz was betraying his race by opposing the ""For the People Act,"" a sweeping piece of legislation supported by Democrats that would radically transform state and federal elections laws.

Earlier this week, Cruz flipped the script on Democrats by claiming the ""For the People Act"" would weaken election security and implement ""Jim Crow 2.0"" to ""steal voting rights from the American people."" His use of the phrase ""Jim Crow 2.0"" was cheeky — it's the same phrase Democrats have used to describe new Republican-supported election integrity laws in Georgia, Florida, Texas, and elsewhere.

On a panel discussing the legislation with Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and NAACP attorney Janai Nelson, Reid and the others agreed that Cruz's opposition to the bill and his use of the term ""Jim Crow"" was ""beyond offensive.""

She called Cruz ""Stephen from Django Unchained,"" referring to the character Stephen from the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film who is a house slave in antebellum Mississippi that supports his cruel master's oppression of the other black slaves.

""Ted Cruz says a lot of stupid things. He does a lot of stupid things. But I personally, as a person of color, as a black person, am beyond offended that he would dare use the word 'Jim Crow' when his party is literally a 'Jim Crow' party at this point trying to suppress the votes of people, including in his home state,"" Reid said.

Continuing, Reid said Cruz ""could give a damn about Jim Crow"" and claimed without evidence that he ""never raised once concern ever in his entire life ... about Jim Crow or racism or discrimination."" She accused Republicans of wanting to prevent non-white people from voting and claimed that without the ""For the People Act"" overturning election security measures, the United States ""may never get another free and fair election again.""

""I think what you see here on your screen is what Republicans fear in the voting booth,"" Reid said, gesturing to guests Padilla and Nelson and referring to their skin color. ""And they're going to do everything they can to make sure it doesn't happen, including Stephen from Django Unchained, AKA Ted Cruz, who is working to stop fellow people of color from voting, which is amazing.""

Cruz responded to Reid's racist remarks Wednesday, accusing Reid of using a racial slur.

""I appreciate MSNBC lecturing me on how people of ""my race"" are supposed to vote. This arrogant condescension is a big reason Hispanic voters are moving right in large numbers,"" Cruz tweeted. ""Also, why is MSNBC ok with their hosts using overt racial slurs ('Stephen from Django')?""

Ted Cruz refuses reporter's request to put on a mask: 'You're welcome to step away if you like',"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hit out at a reporter after the journalist requested the senator put on a mask during a Wednesday news conference.

What are the details?

Cruz held a news conference Wednesday with other Republican senators in order to discuss the crisis at the U.S southern border.

In a video of the conference, a reporter can be heard asking, ""Would you mind putting a mask on for us?""

Cruz responded, ""Yeah, when I'm talking to the TV camera I'm not going to wear a mask, and all of us have been immunized,"" gesturing to his fellow lawmakers.

The reporter pressed further and insisted that Cruz putting on a mask would ""make us feel better.""



Cruz, however, fired back, ""You're welcome to step away if you like,"" and added that the ""whole point of a vaccine"" was so that he no longer had to wear a mask.

It seems fair to point out that White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who does not wear a mask during her White House press briefings, and has defended that move by saying, ""If health and medical experts told me I should wear a mask while I was briefing, I would do it. But I am following the guidelines they are giving us, as is the president.""

Cruz on Thursday morning shared a clip of his interaction with the reporter and captioned it, ""Lefty reporters have lost their minds. #commonsense.""

Anything else?



Cruz in October also pushed back on wearing masks during a gaggle outside a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room.

A CNN reporter at the time asked if Cruz would put on his mask to deliver remarks, to which the Texas lawmaker curtly responded, ""No, because I'm going to talk to the TV. Stand six feet apart, which is what the CDC guideline [is].""

Cruz insisted that a mask was unnecessary and said that he was clearly standing six feet from others at the time.

"'Brazen' and brainless: Teen rips off $18,000 in Louis Vuitton merchandise, runs to store exit, knocks himself unconscious after slamming into glass door","A 17-year-old thief picked the wrong day to leave his brains at home.

The youngster was caught on surveillance video ripping off $18,000 in merchandise from a Louis Vuitton store in Bellevue, Washington, running for the exit — and then knocking himself unconscious after slamming into the store's glass door.

What are the details?

It isn't clear when the broad-daylight caper occurred, but KOMO-TV ran a story about it Oct. 27.

Fox News, citing police, said the suspect grabbed handbags worth $18,000 off displays and tried to run from the store.

The problem for the perp? A door was in his way, and he apparently didn't see it.

So he ran headlong into the plate glass and knocked himself out, KOMO said.

“Brazen is the perfect word for it,” Bellevue Police Captain Rob Spingler added to the station.

Prosecutors told KOMO the teen was part of a retail theft ring that includes a convicted killer and career thief.

The teen's name wasn't released because he is a juvenile, Fox News said.

Police on Tuesday told TheBlaze the teen was arrested and then released to a family member.

Teen who plummeted to his death from drop tower ride may have been too large to safely ride; father says he learned of son's tragic death on social media,"The seat of the teenager who fell to his death from a 430-foot amusement park tower ride was still locked, according to a Tuesday CNN report.



The teen, identified as 14-year-old Tyre Sampson, fell from the Orlando Free Fall drop tower at ICON Park in Florida on Thursday.

What are the details?

CNN reported that the teen ""came out of the seat"" when the ride's magnets ""engaged to slow the ride during the descent.""

“Harness was still in a down and locked position when the ride stopped,” the report from the Fair Rides division of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said.



The report also asked whether the teen was too large for the ride's weight and height constraints.

Tyre's father, Yarnell Sampson, told the outlet that his son was a ""big guy"" at 6'5"" and 340 pounds.

""The ride’s Operations & Maintenance Manual, which has been posted online by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, indicates the maximum passenger weight is 130 kilograms (approximately 287 pounds),"" the report continued.

A portion of the manual adds, ""Be careful when seeing if large guests fit into the seats. Check that they fit within the contours of the seat and the bracket fits properly. If this is not so — Do not let this person ride.”

Park administrators at the time of this reporting have yet to address whether Tyre was simply too big for the ride.

An investigation into the accident remains ongoing.

The ride opened in December and boasted being the tallest ever free-standing drop tower.

Father learned of son's death on social media

Sampson told WESH-TV that he learned through a video circulating on social media that his son had been killed in a freak accident.

""I just lost, I lost, lost wind,"" he recalled. ""And the pain behind it could never be taken away, and sorry's not gonna take it back and no monies, no nothing in the world to replace the young man ... It's just sad, a young man's bright future was taken away from him over a ride, an amusement park.""

""I wish I was there to tell him I love him. That I'm sorry. For him to lose his life. So young, and I wish it was me,"" Sampson added.

Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family, said that Tyre had big dreams to become a professional football player.

""This young man was the kind of son everyone hopes for — an honor roll student, an aspiring athlete, and a kind-hearted person who cared about others,"" Crump said in a statement on the teen's death.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teen-who-plummeted-to-his-death-from-drop-tower-ride-may-have-been-too-large-to-safely-ride,2022-03-29
Tennessee lawmakers pass bill where drunk drivers pay child support if they kill parents,"Lawmakers in Tennessee have passed a bill that would require by law that drunk drivers who kill the parents of minors in car accidents pay child support to the children.

House Bill 1834 was unanimously passed by the Tennessee Senate on Wednesday. In March, the bill unanimously passed in Tennessee's House of Representatives.

The bill is known as ""Bentley's Law"" or ""Ethan, Hailey, and Bentley's Law"" – named after children of victims killed by drunk drivers.



The bill would require a drunken driver convicted of killing a parent or caregiver to have to pay restitution for each child of the victim until the minor reaches the age of 18 and has graduated high school.



""Under this bill, if a defendant is convicted of vehicular homicide due to intoxication or aggravated vehicular homicide and the victim of the offense was the parent of a minor child, then the sentencing court must order the defendant to pay restitution in the form of child maintenance to each of the victim’s children until each child reaches 18 years of age,"" states the bill – which has yet to be signed into law.



""This bill requires the court to determine an amount that is reasonable and necessary for the maintenance of the victim's child after considering all relevant factors,"" the bill says, including ""the financial needs and resources of the child"" and ""the standard of living to which the child is accustomed.""



Courts will determine the amount of child support the defendant will need to pay on a case-by-case basis. If the DUI driver is incarcerated and is unable to pay the child support, the defendant will have up to one year after release to begin making child support payments.

If a defendant's child support payments are set to terminate, but the defendant's financial obligation is not paid in full, the payments will continue until they are paid in full.

""A parent is responsible for the education and upbringing of that child and when then that parent removed from the home over something so, in my opinion, foolish where we drink and drive and take the life of an innocent then someone needs to be responsible for the upbringing of those children,"" Republican State Rep. Mark White told WREG-TV.

The idea for the bill originally came from a Missouri grandmother who lost her son – Cordell Williams, his fiance – Lacey Newton, and their 4-month-old son – Cordell II, in a tragic drunk driving car accident in April 2021. The bill is named after Cecilia Williams' 5-year-old grandson Bentley – who lost both of his parents in the drunk driving crash. The drunk driving accident also orphaned Bentley's 3-year-old sibling named Mason.

""I remember looking at my clock and I said it’s 12:36 a.m., who's knocking at my door like that,"" Williams told KYTV. ""The first thing you're seeing was a state trooper and an officer. And when I think about their words, I remember looking past them trying to look for them. They said they died in a fiery crash, unrecognizable.""



""Try explaining that to a child. It’s not easy. Parents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, they should never have to explain it to children,"" Williams explained. ""Because someone decided to go and play God and take someone’s life. It’s not fair.""

Williams' cousin and Tennessee resident Diane Sutton pitched the idea for the bill to Republican State Rep. Mark Hall – who introduced the bill in the state legislature in February.

Sutton told WZTV, ""It's really just a great law, and it should be nationwide.""

Bentley's Law was amended to Ethan's, Hailey's, and Bentley's Law, to include the children of 38-year-old Tennessee officer Nicholas Galinger – who was killed in a 2019 hit-in-run accident by a drunk driver.

Mothers Against Drunk Driving said in a statement, ""MADD believes that passing Bentley's Law will make people think twice before getting behind the wheel impaired. If a person makes the choice to drive impaired and kills a parent, the person will encounter another consequence for their deadly decision. To the victim of the impaired drivers, Bentley's Law allows for another avenue of restitution to help ensure justice.""

If passed, Tennessee would be the first state to put such a law on its books. Meanwhile, other states are reportedly considering adopting the law.

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee signs transgender athlete bill,"Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) signed into law a bill requiring student athletes to prove their sex at birth in order to participate in middle and high school sports. The new law that was signed on Friday will prohibit transgender athletes who were born as male to compete against biological females and vice-versa.

""I signed the bill to preserve women's athletics and ensure fair competition,"" Lee wrote on Twitter. ""This legislation responds to damaging federal policies that stand in opposition to the years of progress made under Title IX and I commend members of the General Assembly for their bipartisan work.""

Last month, the Republican governor of Tennessee said, ""I do believe that transgenders participating in women's sports will destroy women's sports. It will ruin the opportunity for girls to earn scholarships. It will put a glass ceiling back over women that hasn't been there in some time. I think it's bad for women and for women's sports.""

""This discriminatory policy is illegal,"" Sam Brinton of The Trevor Project, a national group providing transgender youths with crisis prevention services, told the Tennessean. ""The Trevor Project is here 24/7 to support trans youth in Tennessee and across the country who feel hurt and invalidated by these purely political attacks.""

Tennessee becomes the third state to enact transgender athlete legislation this month; previously Mississippi and Arkansas passed such laws.



""I signed the law as a fan of women's sports from basketball to soccer and including many others in which women compete successfully,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) said in a statement on Thursday. ""This law simply says that female athletes should not have to compete in a sport against a student of the male sex when the sport is designed for women's competition.""



""I will sign our bill to protect young girls from being forced to compete with biological males for athletic opportunities,"" Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) wrote on Twitter. ""It's crazy we have to address it, but the Biden E.O. forced the issue. Adults? That's on them. But the push for kids to adopt transgenderism is just wrong.""

Similar bills are advancing in at least 21 states this year, according to the Tennessean.

The laws are a response to President Joe Biden's executive order he signed on his first day in the White House that reinstated Obama-era Title IX regulations ensuring that transgender students ""receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.""

""The order mandates that all students, including transgender students, be able to learn without facing sex discrimination, and as part of that, transgender women should compete on female teams,"" USA Today reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tennessee-governor-transgender-athletes-law,2021-03-28
"Texas border sheriff says US has an open door for illegals to enter thanks to Biden, warns things will only get worse","Texas Sheriff J.E. Guerra is not happy with how things are currently going along U.S.-Mexico border.

Illegal aliens are surging across, demanding that the Biden administration let them in and swamping Border Patrol agents.

Guerra should know, as his Hidalgo County sits on the border.

And the sheriff — a Democrat — knows where the blame lies: President Joe Biden.

What's he saying?

In an interview with the New York Post this week, Guerra warned, ""Now, basically, the border's open."" And things are going to get worse if the Biden White House doesn't do something quick.

""We're hopeful with this administration, [Biden's] got an opportunity starting now but let's wait and see,"" he told the Post. ""They've got to make a decision here pretty quick because as long as [immigrants] think that, 'Hey, the border's open,' here comes the flood, they've got to stop that.""

According to Guerra, Border Patrol agents currently aren't able to do their jobs. Instead of watching the border fence and the Rio Grande River, they're now stuck working in processing centers due to the massive influx of immigrants.

The lack of agents physically manning the border has led to a surge in crime, especially smuggling organizations, the sheriff said. And the big money is in human smuggling now, instead of drug smuggling.

""[T]hey're calling all the agents on the line to go process. So all that does is opens up an opportunity for these smuggling organizations to take advantage of that,"" Guerra said.

He pointed out that the decrease in physical security has led to more people trying to cross, which has ""fueled organized crime in Mexico because migrants and coyotes must pay a toll to the cartels in order to traverse the Rio Grande and cross into this section of Texas,"" the Post said.

""Your Mexican cartels are making more money on humans than they are on the drug side and right now, it's a boom. It's a boom for 'em, it's huge. ... They're making a killing right now,"" Guerra told the paper.

Sheriff says Biden administration wasn't ready

And it's because the Biden administration wasn't prepared, he said.

""The new administration came in, they changed policy, and I don't think that our federal government was prepared to have the adequate resources and you're seeing the results of that right now,"" Guerra added. ""They don't have the resources, the boots on the ground, nor the infrastructure to handle what you're seeing and I believe that it's going to get worse if the administration doesn't go back, or limit the policy. So I feel for my partners, my federal partners.

""The previous convicted felons and the pedophiles and the people that have been convicted of sexual assault that have been deported, you'll see those coming across in droves and the cartels know that so they charge them a lot more money,"" Guerra continued.

The sheriff knows that the only answer is for the Biden administration to get its act together.

""We need our leaders in Washington to come up with an immigration policy that is fair and until that is done, we're going to continue to see what we're seeing,"" Guerra said.

""It's a concern, a national security concern, a public safety concern, and basically, you know, a humanitarian concern that this is causing and our leaders in Washington just need to come up with immigration reform and come up with some policy and at this point, we don't care what it is,"" the sheriff pleaded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-border-sheriff-illegal-immigrants-open-door,2021-03-19
Texas dad shoots two teens as they try to enter his family's car — which is carrying two infants in rear seat,"A Texas dad shot two teenagers who tried to enter his family's car in northwest Harris County while two infants were in the rear seat, KTRK-TV reported.

What are the details?

Investigators said the family had just pulled up to their home in the 6800 block of Feather Creek Drive when a pair of 16-year-old males tried to enter the car through the rear doors, deputies told the station.

Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted that the suspects opened one of the vehicle's rear doors.

But the dad fired multiple times at the suspects from inside the car while his wife drove away, KTRK said.

Security video from a nearby home recorded the incident, the station said, adding that one teen suspect was seen running away while the other was on the ground.

Everything unfolded just after midnight Monday, KHOU-TV reported.

Deputies said the suspects sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital in private vehicles, KTRK reported.

Gonzalez told the station that both teen suspects are stable and in fair condition.

KTRK said it spoke with the family, who said they were doing OK but didn't want to go on camera.



Video from the scene shows a bullet hole in the car's side, stemming from the shot the father took through his car's back window.

Investigators spent time looking for video and additional evidence, KTRK said.

Texas Democrats issue stern warning to their own party over embrace of far-left immigration policy,"Three Texas Democrats warned their own political party this week that the continued embrace of progressive immigration policies will result in electoral distaster for the Democratic Party.

What is the background?

Coming into office, President Joe Biden had promised to reverse most of his predecessor's immigration policies. Biden has already taken executive action to implement some immigration reform.

But on Thursday, Democrats in the House and Senate introduced legislation championed by Biden that would provide amnesty to approximately 11 million immigrants who are illegally living in the U.S.

As TheBlaze reported:

The bill would also increase the number of legal immigrants, provide foreign aid to South and Central American countries, make it easier for refugees to claim asylum, change all instances of the word ""alien"" in federal law to ""noncitizen,"" increase spending on border infrastructure to process migrants, assign Social Security numbers and provide health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act to illegal aliens granted ""lawful prospective immigrant"" status, and much more.

What are the Texas Democrats saying?

Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar, Vincente Gonzalez, and Filemón Vela — all of whom represent congressional districts on the Texas-Mexico border — are warning the Biden administration's aggressive immigration agenda is a ""receipt for distaster"" for Democrats.

In fact, Gonzalez told Politico that Democrats will lose their majorities in Congress if they continue to move forward with progressive immigration policies.

""The way we're doing it right now is catastrophic and is a recipe for disaster in the middle of a pandemic,"" Gonzalez said.

""Our party should be concerned. If we go off the rails, it's going to be bad for us,"" he added. ""Biden is going to be dealing with a minority in Congress if he continues down some of these paths.""

Unfortunately, Biden's immigration policies, which are drawing more migrants north, have already had undesirable impacts, according to Cuellar.

""I said, 'Hey, we don't want the wall, but when it comes to the other issues, we gotta be careful that we don't give the impression that we have open borders because otherwise the numbers are going to start going up. And surely enough, we're starting to see numbers go up,"" Cuellar told Politico.

Still, all three Democratic politicians told Politico they share Biden's vision of a ""fair and humane"" immigration system.

According to Politico, Democrats' vulnerabilities have already been exposed, when then-President Donald Trump saw ""an unexpected surge in support"" in Democratic strongholds along the Texas-Mexico border in the 2020 election.

Texas judge and three others arrested on 150 counts of voter fraud,"A south Texas justice of the peace was arrested along with three other individuals who face 150 charges of voter fraud altogether.

Medina County Justice of the Peace Tomas Ramirez was arrested on Feb. 11 and is charged on one count of organized election fraud, one count of ""assisting voter voting ballot by mail,"" and 17 counts of unlawful possession of a ballot or ballot envelope, KABB reports.

He was arrested with Leonor Rivas Garza, Eva Ann Martinez, and Mary Balderrama. All four were indicted by a Bandera Grand Jury on Feb. 9.

Garza, Martinez, and Balderrama were each charged with organized election fraud. They also face multiple charges of illegal voting, unlawful possession of a ballot or ballot envelope, election fraud, fraudulent use of an absentee ballot by mail, tampering with a government record, and purportedly acting as an agent.

According to the Texas attorney general's office, the case against Ramirez and the others involves allegations of vote harvesting at assisted living centers in Medina County in the 2018 Medina County Primary Election. Ramirez was elected as a justice of the peace in 2018 and was suspended from his position after his arrest.

In a statement, Ramirez said he was ""stunned"" by the allegations and denied all charges against him:

I was stunned by the allegations because there is absolutely no truth to them. I have spent the last 27 years building my law practice and serving in this community which has created my reputation for fairness, sincerity and integrity. I entered the race for JP because I wanted to serve Medina County and make the office function better for its citizens. I feel I have done exactly that up to this point. For people who know me, these allegations are absurd. To those who don't, it provides reason to sneer and hate.



I will vigorously defend myself to the fullest extent and I fully expect to be vindicated.

The arrests come as former President Donald Trump continues to allege that the 2020 presidential was illegitimate because of voter fraud. Though there were incidents of attempted voter fraud committed on a relatively small scale, there is no evidence of widespread election fraud occurring in the 2020 election as Trump's legal team alleged.



Speaking at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference Sunday, Trump claimed, ""This election was rigged, and the Supreme Court and other courts didn't want to do anything about it.""

Gavin Newsom buys ads for gun control in another major GOP state,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has purchased full-page ads in Texas newspapers boasting about a new gun law he will sign that is directly modeled after a fetal heartbeat law signed by Gov. Greg Abbott (R).

The ad tout's the gun control law as ""California's answer to Texas' perverse bill,"" and it will run in the Austin American-Statesman, Houston Chronicle, and El Paso Times, according to NBC News.

“If Texas can ban abortion and endanger lives, California can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives. If Governor Abbott truly wants to protect the right to life, we urge him to follow California’s lead,” the ad states.

It comes off the heels of a $105,000 ad purchase Newsom made in Florida TV markets, capturing national headlines and fueling speculation about the possibility the 54-year-old governor will mount a primary challenge to President Joe Biden, 79, for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination.

Newsom traveled to Washington D.C. this month to visit the White House while Biden was abroad, and while he was there, he blasted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Texas for an alleged ""assault on freedom"" being led by GOP governors. He also accused Democrats of losing focus by neglecting to challenge Republican policy victories at the state and local level.

In picking fights with Florida and Texas, two of the largest GOP-controlled states, Newsom is setting himself up as a foil to Republican governors and potentially as someone ""who fights"" in a future Democratic presidential primary, although he strongly denies holding any ambitions for the White House.

""In no way, shape or form this has anything to do with that. Period. Full stop. Add six or seven exclamation points,” he told NBC News.



The gun control bill Newsom will sign Friday mimics how Texas is enforcing the state's abortion law. It will allow private citizens to file lawsuits against people who make or sell illegal ""assault weapons"" or so-called ghost guns, adopting what the Texas law's critics have called a ""bounty"" mechanism.

Texas' heartbeat law, enacted before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, was written so that it would survive expected legal challenges on constitutional grounds. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled there is no constitutional right to an abortion, states have more power to restrict abortion access — but the same is not true for guns, which remain explicitly protected by the Second Amendment.

Some critics of the Texas law have also opposed California's new gun law. The American Civil Liberties Union says both laws encourage ""vigilantism"" and has expressed concerns that red and blue states could ""escalate an 'arms race' ... by setting up bounty-hunting schemes on politically sensitive issues.""

But Newsom dismissed those concerns and told NBC News that Democrats need to start playing hardball. ""I think Democrats have been playing a little soft,"" he said.

He said the gun law was ""fair play"" given the Texas abortion law, and that it was written in such a way to provoke the Supreme Court to ""reconcile their decision"" on permitting the Texas law to take effect.

“There’s no principled way for them to strike down this law and uphold Texas,"" Newsom asserted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-law-gun-control-newsom,2022-07-22
Mother charged with endangering a child after COVID-positive son found in trunk of car at testing site because she wanted to 'prevent herself from getting exposed': Court docs,"A Texas mother has been charged with endangering a child after her 13-year-old son was reportedly found in the trunk of her car while she was in line to get a COVID-19 test. A warrant has been issued for Sarah Beam — a 42-year-old teacher at Cypress Falls High School in the Houston area, according to KTRK-TV.

Beam took her 13-year-old son to a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site at Pridgeon Stadium on Jan. 3, according to court documents.

""A CFISD employee who was gathering information from people in line said Beam told her the boy was in the trunk because she didn't want to be exposed to the virus,"" KHOU-TV reported.

Citing charging documents, KRIV-TV reported, ""Beam said her child was in the trunk because they had previously tested positive for COVID-19 and as a result, wanted to 'prevent her[self] from getting exposed to possible COVID while driving [the child] to the stadium for additional testing.'""

The employee at the COVID-19 testing site asked the mother to open the trunk, and confirmed that the boy was stashed away there, according to court documents.

The testing site employee purportedly informed Beams that she ""would not be receiving COVID testing until the child was removed from the trunk of the vehicle and place[d] in the back seat of the vehicle.""



Surveillance footage allegedly shows the child getting out of the trunk of the car and entering the rear passenger side of the vehicle.

The employee then alerted Cy-Fair ISD police of the situation, and also provided authorities with a description of the woman and her license plate number.

""CFPD was alerted that a child was in the trunk of a car at a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site earlier this week,"" a Cy-Fair ISD statement to Fox News said. ""Law enforcement conducted a full investigation, resulting in a warrant for arrest.""

"Hire 'Thanksgiving bouncers' to make sure your guests test negative for COVID — right outside your front door — before they enter your house, writers say","Did you think that battling inflationary costs this Thanksgiving by forgoing turkey or getting your guests to pony up some cash before coming over were the only, ahem, unusual ideas floating around?

Think again, pilgrim.

Because a couple of writers from Axios have a suggestion that might outdo all others: Require that your Thanksgiving guests get negative readings on rapid COVID tests — administered right outside your front door — before they're allowed to enter.

That's one of the possibilities to ponder this holiday, courtesy of Tina Reed, a health care editor for Axios, and Margaret Talev, managing editor for politics at Axios as well as a CNN political analyst.

What are the details?

""No one really wants this job, but millions of households may need their own Thanksgiving bouncer,"" they write in their very first sentence, adding that ""the cover charge is a negative COVID test, done ahead of arrival or outside the front door.""

Yes, guests also can ""bring evidence of their negative results"" from PCR tests administered a few days beforehand, the authors say.

But can you imagine the scene in front of your house? Friends and relatives lined up outside your door and milling around until they can show they tested negative for COVID — all while they're dying to come inside, take a load off, use the restroom, or nibble on snacks as a ""Thanksgiving bouncer"" drags your complaining great grandma off your lawn on the heels of her positive result?

Some folks might prefer noshing on a tofu turkey before putting up with such an entry requirement. (Of course the authors suggest that you let your guests know ahead of time that ""you'll be testing everyone at the door for their own safety"" — which always gives them the option of staying home instead, one supposes.)

Still, the authors insist that ""normalizing rapid tests is a practical way to help extended families feel a little more normal around the holiday dinner table.""

Is money no object?

Okay, let's say President Joe Biden's inflation-hampered economy hasn't gotten you down yet, and you bring home a big paycheck. Well, the authors add that ""you might offer to pick up the tab for everyone's tests,"" which run about $25 for a box of two.

Then again, if you're a cheapskate or strapped for cash, the authors say ""hosts might ask guests to pay for their own."" As if going through the ignominy of the tests themselves weren't depressing enough on its own.

If you're concerned about false test results, the authors also suggest you could take ""one extra precaution"" and ""purchase enough tests for a re-test, or to ask guests to test on their own before and then again when they arrive for the meal.""

This is getting awfully complicated.

Anything else?

To be fair, a couple of other suggestions make sense — not only if you're hosting a Thanksgiving gathering but also for after the festivities.

One is for those with electronic thermostats: Set your fan to ""on"" instead of ""auto"" to improve airflow, and replace air filters to those with MERV Rating 13, the writers say.

Also you can buy portable HEPA air filtration devices at hardware stores or national retailers — or even create your own filtration devices using a box fan, the authors said, citing Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

But even testing at your door isn't a perfect solution.

""Tests are a moment in time, and no test is going to give perfect visibility into whether or not you're infectious,"" Gronvall added to the authors.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thanksgiving-bouncers-guests-test-negative-for-covid,2021-11-24
The Biden administration resumes oil and gas leases on federal land but in a reduced capacity and with steeper fees,"This past Friday, the Biden administration announced that it would resume granting lease sales for the drilling of oil and natural gas on federal lands.

However, as the Washington Examiner reported, the Biden administration intends to drastically decrease the amount of federal land available for drilling and plans to increase the royalty it charges companies to produce oil on federal lands.

In a recently released press release, the Department of the Interior said that it will make 144,000 acres of federal lands available for drilling. This is an 80% reduction in acreage that was originally designated for natural gas production. The department will also begin charging companies drilling royalties of 18.75% instead of 12.5%.

The release said, “The [Bureau of Land Management] will issue final environmental assessments and sale notices of upcoming oil and gas leases that reflect this strategic approach.”

“The lease sales will incorporate many of the recommendations in the Department’s report,” the release continued. “Including ensuring Tribal consultation and broad community input, reliance of the best available science including analysis of GHG emissions, and a first-ever increase in the royalty rate for new competitive leases to 18.75 percent, to ensure fair return for the American taxpayers and on par with rates charged by states and private landowners.”

It continued, “The BLM assessed potentially available and eligible acreage in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming. It began analyzing 646 parcels on roughly 733,000 acres that had been previously nominated for leasing by energy companies. As a result of robust environmental review, engagement with Tribes and communities, and prioritizing the American people’s broad interests in public lands, the final sale notices will offer approximately 173 parcels on roughly 144,000 acres, an 80 percent reduction from the acreage originally nominated.”

This move by the Department of the Interior comes as the Biden administration begins to acknowledge the importance of increasing domestic energy production amid soaring energy prices.

Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, called the department’s new plan an overdue “reset’ of the leasing program.

She said, “For too long, the federal oil and gas leasing programs have prioritized the wants of extractive industries above local communities, the natural environment, the impact on our air and water, the needs of Tribal Nations, and, moreover, other uses of our shared public lands.”'

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western nations issued thoroughgoing sanctions on the Russian economy. The U.S. was quick to stop importing Russian oil, and since the Biden administration ended American energy independence, American energy prices drastically rose as there was suddenly less oil being imported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-administration-resumes-oil-and-gas-leases-on-federal-land-in-reduced-capacity,2022-04-16
'The inflation tax is real': Sen. Joe Manchin says Washington can't keep ignoring people's 'economic pain',"As Americans suffer the consequences of rising inflation, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is saying that ""the inflation tax is real"" and Washington cannot keep ignoring the financial hardships people are experiencing.

""By all accounts, the threat posed by record inflation to the American people is not ""transitory"" and is instead getting worse. From the grocery store to the gas pump, Americans know the inflation tax is real and DC can no longer ignore the economic pain Americans feel every day,"" Manchin's tweet declared.

His comments came as newly released data revealed that consumers continue to face rising prices.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index has risen 6.2% over a 12-month period, marking the largest one-year jump in more than three decades.



""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.9 percent in October on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.4 percent in September,"" according to the department. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 6.2 percent before seasonal adjustment.""

The cost for necessities like food and energy have risen significantly during the past year.

""The all items index rose 6.2 percent for the 12 months ending October, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1990,"" the department said. ""The energy index rose 30.0 percent over the last 12 months, and the food index increased 5.3 percent,"" the department reported.""

As President Biden and congressional Democrats push for the passage of a massive spending plan, Manchin has been a persistent obstacle in his party's path, refusing to back their proposal.

The senator has said that he will not ""support a package that risks hurting American families suffering from historic inflation.""

Proponents of the proposal contend that passage of the massive spending plan would actually combat inflation.

""The best way to address inflation is to pass a bill that creates jobs, reduces bottlenecks, and is totally paid for by making sure the wealthy pay their fair share. That's just what we're doing with the Build Back Better Act,"" a tweet shared on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-N.Y.) account claims.

The IRS says criminals must report their ill-gotten gains as income,"While Uncle Sam demands a portion of law-abiding Americans' hard-earned money in taxes each year, even criminals are supposed to report their earnings to the U.S. government, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

The government agency literally spells it out, saying that drug dealers must report their ill-gotten gains and thieves must report the value of purloined items, unless those items are returned during the same year they were taken.

""If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless you return it to its rightful owner in the same year,"" according to the government agency.

""If you receive a bribe, include it in your income,"" the IRS says.

""Income from illegal activities, such as money from dealing illegal drugs, must be included in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, or on Schedule C (Form 1040) if from your self-employment activity,"" the agency says.

Someone tweeted about the reporting requirements: ""So once you report your stolen stuff you legally get to keep it right? Asking for a friend.""

The Erie County Sheriff's Office in Buffalo, New York posted the following on social media: ""Attention all car thieves. The stuff you stole from people's vehicles in 2021 must be claimed on your income taxes. If you need an itemized list of property call us at 716.858.2903 & a Deputy or Detective will be happy to meet you with the list.

'The racist legacy many birds carry': Lengthy Washington Post feature gets hilarious reaction from Tucker Carlson. And he's not alone.,"So, the Washington Post published a recent story with the following headline, ""The racist legacy many birds carry.""

Yes, birds.

In fairness, it's not so much that the Post is saying certain birds are racist, as in wearing-red-MAGA-hats racist, which, of course, would be a cardinal sin of sorts:

No, the Post's piece focuses on a debate on whether to change as many as 150 names of birds that ""honor people with connections to slavery and supremacy.""

More from the story:

The Bachman's sparrow, Wallace's fruit dove and other winged creatures bear the names of men who fought for the Southern cause, stole skulls from Indian graves for pseudoscientific studies that were later debunked, and bought and sold Black people. Some of these men stoked violence and participated in it without consequence.



Even John James Audubon's name is fraught in a nation embroiled in a racial reckoning. Long the most recognized figure in North American birding for his detailed drawings of the continent's species, he was also an enslaver who mocked abolitionists working to free Black people. Some of his behavior is so shameful that the 116-year-old National Audubon Society — the country's premier bird conservation group, with 500 local chapters — hasn't ruled out changing its name. An oriole, warbler and shearwater all share it.

""I am deeply troubled by the racist actions of John James Audubon and recognize how painful that legacy is for Black, Indigenous and people of color who are part of our staff, volunteers, donors and members,"" interim chief executive Elizabeth Gray said in a statement in May, the Post reported. ""Although we have begun to address this part of our history, we have a lot more to unpack.""

The Post's story on the matter spans nearly 2,000 words, which no doubt involved a lot of effort. But the clear premise is the same as numerous other campaigns in the wake of George Floyd's death and the riots that followed over the summer of 2020: To cleanse the American landscape of any hint of past real or alleged racism, no matter how far removed from the present day.

And that involved toppling and defacing and removing statues of Founding Fathers, a push to scrub the names of not-woke-enough-figures such as — believe it or not — Abraham Lincoln from school buildings in San Francisco, and canceled sales of Dr. Seuss children's books.

Now birds must be renamed, apparently.

How are folks reacting?

Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired a very funny segment on the matter Tuesday night, which you can view at the bottom of this story.

Others did the best they could to also make fun of the growing controversy. Outspoken podcaster Adam Carolla presumably had the Post's piece in mind when he tweeted the following Wednesday:

Others just couldn't help themselves, either:

""Soon, we will only be able to refer to all birds as they or them. The ⁦⁦@washingtonpost⁩ has too many researchers,"" one commenter wrote. ""Parrots. There. I said it and I'm glad I said it.""

""A bird pooped on my car the other day. I thought that it was because I parked near a telephone line, but it was white supremacy all this time,"" another user quipped. ""I'm so tired of all this oppression.""

""Birds are pretty racist... But not as racist as the combined hatred ducks and beavers have against the platypus,"" another commenter noted.

""That bird with the racist look in its eye,"" another user observed. ""You can totally tell!""

Here's Carlson's reaction:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-racist-legacy-many-birds-carry-lengthy-washington-post-feature-gets-hilarious-reaction-from-tucker-carlson-and-hes-not-alone,2021-06-16
The Surfside condo collapse victims received preliminary approval for a settlement of over $1 billion,"A settlement of more than $1 billion for the victims of the tragic 2021 condominium collapse in Surfside, Florida has been reached.

The Miami Herald reported that this past Friday that a team of lawyers representing family members of the dozens of people who died in the Champlain Towers South tragedy reached a settlement totaling $1,021,199,000.

The settlement agreement was submitted to Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman who gave his preliminary approval on Saturday at a court hearing that followed around-the-clock negotiations about a potential settlement.

The settlement was reached less than a month before the one-year anniversary of the tragedy.

“It’s a great result,” Hanzman said on Saturday. “This agreement appears to be a very reasonable compromise of the claims.”

The over one-billion-dollar agreement comes as a class-action settlement and as the defendants agreed to pay to resolve wrongful-death and personal-injury claims by the victims’ relatives. The defendants made no admission of wrongdoing and most of the payments to the plaintiffs are being covered through insurance coverage.

In the class-action plaintiff’s lawyers' 213-page settlement filing they wrote, “As this Court has noted, the collapse of the Champlain Towers South on June 24, 2021, in Surfside was a ‘black swan' event that devastated the community. The death and destruction caused by the collapse resulted in incalculable damage to so many individuals.”

The lawyers continued, “Remarkably, after months of rigorous, arm’s-length negotiations … more than two dozen potentially liable parties have agreed to an unprecedented settlement for an unprecedented event.”

Hanzman is expected to give final approval of the class-action settlement later this summer after a comment period and “fairness hearing” on June 23. Hanzman also plans to participate in a series of claims hearing in which relatives and representatives of victims who died or were injured in Champlain South’s collapse will be able to make a case for what their lives were worth. This process is expected to be arduous and emotional.

The class-action team’s co-chairs released a statement that said, “We are pleased to have finalized the settlments we reached with more than two dozen parties and their insurers.”

The statement continued, “We are grateful to Judge Hanzman, who fast-tracked this case to get it resolved in record time. We also recognize the efforts of the receiver Michael Goldberg and the mediator Bruce Greer and all of the members of the plaintiffs steering committee who worked tirelessly on this matter.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-surfside-condo-collapse-victims-received-preliminary-approval-for-a-settlement-of-over-1-billion,2022-05-29
Washington Post erased Kamala Harris' crass joke about inmates from a 2019 story — then put it back after they got caught,"A year and a half ago when Vice President Kamala Harris was gunning for the Democratic presidential nomination, the Washington Post published a story looking at her close relationship with her sister Maya that contained what some might call a disturbing anecdote.

What are the details?

In short, Harris likened the effects of the fast pace and long days and nights of the campaign trail to how a desperate, overwhelmed prisoner might feel begging for food and water. Here's how the first seven paragraphs of story read when it was originally published on July 23, 2019, Reason reported:

It was the Fourth of July, Independence Day, and Kamala Harris was explaining to her sister, Maya, that campaigns are like prisons.



She'd been recounting how in the days before the Democratic debate in Miami life had actually slowed down to a manageable pace. Kamala, Maya and the rest of the team had spent three days prepping for that contest in a beach-facing hotel suite, where they closed the curtains to blot out the fun. But for all the hours of studying policy and practicing the zingers that would supercharge her candidacy, the trip allowed for a break in an otherwise all-encompassing schedule.



""I actually got sleep,"" Kamala said, sitting in a Hilton conference room, beside her sister, and smiling as she recalled walks on the beach with her husband and that one morning SoulCycle class she was able to take.

""That kind of stuff,"" Kamala said between sips of iced tea, ""which was about bringing a little normal to the days, that was a treat for me.""



""I mean, in some ways it was a treat,"" Maya said. ""But not really.""



""It's a treat that a prisoner gets when they ask for, 'A morsel of food please,' "" Kamala said shoving her hands forward as if clutching a metal plate, her voice now trembling like an old British man locked in a Dickensian jail cell. ""'And water! I just want wahtahhh….' Your standards really go out the f***ing window.""



Kamala burst into laughter.

Yup, she laughed. At her own ill-advised joke. Not the best look.

Kamala Harris Laughing Compilation youtu.be

And Reason noted the effectiveness of the Post's story:

The scene was a brilliant bit of reporting and writing because it did what few political features can accomplish: showing, rather than telling, something about the candidate at the center. Harris made her name as a prosecutor, and her track record includes defending dirty cops and laughing off criticism of her history of throwing poor parents in jail when their kids missed school. The Post profile provided a mask-slipping moment that seemed to perfectly capture a warped sense of justice and lack of basic human dignity—all in just a few hundred words.

At the time, Harris was fair game like all the other Democratic hopefuls wanting a shot at the White House. Indeed, she was an early front-runner, which made her an even bigger target for the media. But less than five months after the Post's profile ran, Harris dropped out of the race as he poll numbers plummeted and the staff departed.

Oh my how things have changed in two years

Reason took a look again at the Post's 2019 story — and discovered that, lo and behold, Harris' cringeworthy joke was gone.

Turns out the paper put together an online series prior to the inauguration, and when Reason asked the Post's communications manager why the story was changed, the outlet said it got this response: ""We repurposed and updated some of our strong biographical pieces about both political figures"" and the story in question ""was updated with new reporting, as noted online, using the existing URL. The original story remains available in print.""

What's more, it appears the Post did some fast fixing.

Reason's story about the Post doing a ""memory-hole"" number was published at 10:25 a.m. Friday. But in an new update note, Reason told its readers that as of 1:15 p.m. the Post had ""updated its website and URLs to restore the original version of the Kamala Harris profile.""

Sure, the repurposed story dated Jan. 11 without Harris' anecdote is still there — but a number of other links that Reason said redirected users to the sanitized Harris story were restored so that they now go to the original.

""We should have kept both versions of the story on the Post's site (the original and updated one), rather than redirecting to the updated version,"" Kris Coratti, the Post's vice president for communications, told Reason on Friday. ""We have now done that, and you will see the link to the original at the top of the updated version.""

Anything else?

Reason had an inkling of what may have been at the heart of things:

The original quote might have demonstrated something about Harris — indeed, it suggests why her presidential primary campaign flopped so hard — but its disappearance suggests something about the Post, and about the way traditional political media are preparing to cover Harris now that she's one heartbeat away from the presidency.

Eric Boehm, author the Reason piece, added that ""at a time when legacy publications are increasingly seen as playing for one political 'team' or the other, this type of editorial decision will not do anything to fix that perception — is there any doubt that the Post would not have treated an inartful comment from Mike Pence in the same way?""



""Intentional or not, the memory-holing of the older version of the piece sends a message that the Post is willing to pave over its own good journalism to protect a powerful politician from her own words,"" he concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-washington-post-erased-kamala-harris-crass-joke-about-inmates-from-a-2019-story-then-put-it-back-after-they-got-caught,2021-01-22
'They reported the exact wrong thing': Trump threatens to sue unrepentant Pulitzer board for defamation over awards to 'Russia Hoax' journalists,"Former President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he will sue the Pulitzer Prize Board for awarding journalists who advanced the discredited ""Russia Hoax"" narrative as well as for doubling down on allegedly defamatory remarks. For over a year, Trump has insisted that the Pulitzer board revoke the prizes to the New York Times and the Washington Post because the awarded reporting ""have become worthless and meaningless.""

What are the details?

At his ""Save America"" rally in Robstown, Texas, on Saturday, Trump split his attention between the future and the recent past.

Concerning the future, Trump indicated he would ""probably"" run again for president in 2024, stating, ""In order to make our country successful, safe and glorious again, I will probably have to do it again."" He emphasized the need to focus first on the midterm elections and on securing a ""historic victory for the Republican Party this November.""

Regarding the recent past, Trump underscored how those who covered so-called Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election should not be permitted to keep their prizes for national reporting.

Rather than on individual journalists, Trump honed his critique on the Pulitzer Prize Board, which recently refused to rescind the awards that had been conferred to reporters for pushing the ""Russia Hoax.""

The awards in question went to the staffs of the New York Times and the Washington Post for what the Pulitzer Prize Board characterized as ""deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration.""

The former president said, ""They gave out the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia Hoax, reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia. So you have reporters from the Washington Post, the New York Times, that got Pulitzer Prizes, and they reported the exact wrong thing.""

Whereas the liberal media was awarded for ""wrong reporting,"" advancing and amplifying spurious claims that Trump and his team had colluded with Russia, the former president noted that ""other people should have gotten the Pulitzer Prize because, frankly, they got it right for years.""

Trump claimed that ""they don't do Pulitzer prizes"" for those who, in his view, got it right, such as Fox News hosts Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Jeanine Pirro, and Laura Ingraham.

Trump indicated that, in lieu of another request for rectification, he will now be ""suing the Pulitzer organization to have those prizes taken back"" within the next two weeks.

""By allowing these people that got Russia, Russia, Russia wrong [to get the award],"" said Trump, ""they're actually libeling me because they're saying they got it right and it turned out to be a hoax.""

The Pulitzer Prize Board's refusal to rescind



After it received the Pulitzer in 2018, the New York Times celebrated itself for ""changing the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 election.""

The Washington Post similarly ran an article at the time, boasting that the ""Post's revelations about Russia, including contacts between Russian figures and President Trump's associates and advisers, helped set the stage for the special counsel's ongoing investigation of the administration.""



That investigation, which the Department of Justice said cost $32 million, ended with Special Counsel Robert Mueller finding no evidence of Russian collusion.

Even after the Steel dossier was discredited (admitted in the pages of the New York Times), the NYT and the Washington Post both doubled down, suggesting as late as spring 2022 that the Russian investigation was not undercut.

Townhall noted in 2019 that ""Neither one of the newspapers' reporting was 'heavily sourced,' although it was 'relentlessly reported,' probably because they were trying to push their editorial agenda ... Now that we know there was no collusion, now that we know there was no obstruction, does this mean we get a 'redo' on this award?""



Trump has been asking the same question for years.

Lawsuit

The Hill reported that last October, Trump wrote to Pulitzer's interim administrator claiming that the award in national reporting, which had been given to the two liberal papers, was ""based on false reporting of a non-existent link between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.""

Facing similar demands from Trump and others, the Pulitzer board announced on July 18 that it had commissioned two independent reviews of the work for which prizes were awarded.

According to a statement issued by the board, the ""separate reviews converged in their conclusions: that no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.""

On Oct. 13, Trump's attorneys Jeremy Bailie and R. Quincy Bird wrote to Marjorie Miller, the administrator of the Pulitzer Prize Board, concerning the board's July statement. In the letter, Trump's attorneys notified the board that ""a defamatory statement pertaining to President Trump was and remains published on the Board's website since July 18, 2022.""

The letter cautioned that ""the Board, including its individual members, may be subject to suit and exposed to a judgment for damages, including punitive damages, for defamation,"" demanding not only that the statement be taken down by Oct.18, but that ""a full and fair correction, apology, or retraction issued.""



Additionally, Trump's attorneys noted that ""rescinding the 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting from their current recipients would necessarily be part of any full and fair attempt to right the wrong caused by the Board's conduct.""

The letter advanced the claim made by Trump on Saturday: ""The New York Times and The Washington Post were and are two of the foremost propagators of the Russia Collusion Hoax"" and that it was ""obvious that the 2018 Pulitzer Pries were intended to endorse the two mainstream media organizations' full, misleading body of work on the Russia Collusion Hoax.""

A hostile Pulitzer board

The Pulitzer Prize Board, 2017-2018, which conferred the awards for investigations into disproven Russian interference included a number of fierce Trump critics, such as Gail Collins, an opinion columnist at the New York Times.



Two years before determining whether reporting on so-called Russian interference as it pertained to Trump's election and presidency were deserving of an award, Collins referred to the president as, ""A dimwitted, meanspirited spawn embodying the nation's worst flaws, failings and nightmares"" and suggested prior to the 2016 election that undecideds should vote for Clinton.

Eugene Robinson, the Pulitzer Prize Board's chair in 2018, is a columnist and associate editor at the Washington Post, which also happened to receive the award. He also happens to be an outspoken critic of the former president.

In the year he was on the board, Robinson accused Trump of ""speaking the language of white supremacy,"" telling his Twitter followers to, ""Get mad, and then get even: Vote against his enablers in November.""

The chair of the Pulitzer Prize Board also accused Trump of being a ""Putin fanboy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/they-reported-the-exact-wrong-thing-trump-threatens-to-sue-pulitzer-board-for-awarding-journalists-for-discredited-reports-on-russia-hoax,2022-10-23
"Just 35% of New Yorkers say Cuomo should resign, most satisfied with his answers on sexual harassment allegations","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo stands publicly accused of sexual harassment by seven women, is under federal investigation for covering up nursing home COVID-19 deaths, and faces an impeachment investigation from state lawmakers. And despite all of this, a new poll found barely a third of New York voters want the governor to resign.

Only 35% of New Yorkers surveyed said that Gov. Cuomo should immediately resign following his sexual harassment and nursing home scandals, according to a new Siena poll. Half of voters surveyed, 50%, said the governor should not resign. A plurality of voters, 48% to 34%, also said Cuomo can continue to effectively do his job as governor.

Only one-third of voters believe that Cuomo committed sexual harassment, one-quarter of voters say he did not, and a plurality of voters are unsure. Overall, the poll found New Yorkers are satisfied with the way Cuomo has responded to the allegations by a margin of 57%-32%.

Cuomo is accused by multiple women of inappropriate touching, kissing women without their permission, and one accusation that he ""aggressively groped"" a female aide working at the governor's mansion. That last accusation may have risen ""to the level of a crime,"" Albany police officials said last week after state police and the governor's lawyers contacted them about the alleged incident.

The governor has repeatedly denied all of the allegations against him, insisting that New Yorkers wait for a report from independent investigators appointed by the New York state attorney general's office, who are reviewing the allegations.

On the question of Cuomo's handling of the pandemic, voters' opinions are virtually unchanged from last month. A majority of 60% of New Yorkers approved of his handling of the pandemic, while just 33% disapproved. Most voters approved of how Cuomo communicates, said he provides ""accurate information,"" and agreed with his plans for reopening New York.

The only mark Cuomo scored poorly on was making COVID-related nursing home death data public, with 66% of voters grading the governor ""fair"" or ""poor."" An aide to the governor admitted last month that the Cuomo administration hid data on nursing home deaths for fear of the political ramifications to be faced for publishing it. The New York Times reported last week that aides to the governor rewrote a report on nursing home deaths to hide the fact that 9,000 senior citizen residents had died of COVID-19 after Cuomo's controversial executive order placing COVID-19 patients in nursing homes.

""Voters appear to be able to compartmentalize how they feel about Cuomo. While their views on him generally – favorability, job performance, re-elect – took a significant hit this month, voters' views on Cuomo's handling of the pandemic remain largely positive, except for his handling of nursing home death data,"" Siena pollster Steven Greenberg said. ""Two-thirds of New Yorkers, including 56 percent of Democrats, give him a negative grade for making public all data about COVID-related deaths of nursing home patients.""

Though both Republican and state Democratic leaders have called on the governor to resign in recent weeks, Cuomo has adamantly refused to do so. In a statement released Monday, the chairman of the New York Democratic Party appeared to call on state Democrats to back down, saying the party should ""focus on getting the work of government done.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/third-of-new-yorkers-cuomo-resign,2021-03-15
Thousands of illegal aliens storm El Paso in 'one of the largest mass crossings ever',"Thousands of criminal noncitizens poured into El Paso, Texas, over the weekend, apparently aided along the way by Mexican state police. Rarely before have border agents seen so many foreign nationals steal into the U.S. at one time and in one place.

For El Paso, already strained amid an unprecedented flood of criminal noncitizens, this is only a taste of things to come. Texas officials expect the deluge of illegal aliens to worsen significantly when Title 42, the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" policy, ends later this month.

Punching a hole in American sovereignty

Fox News' Bill Melugin reported that a ""huge migrant caravan of over 1,000 people crossed illegally into El Paso, TX last night, making it the largest single group we have ever seen. The city of El Paso reports Border Patrol now has over 5,000 in custody & has released hundreds to city streets.""

El Paso Matters confirmed Melugin's report, indicating that over 1,500 illegal aliens crossed the Rio Grande from Juárez into El Paso Sunday night.

The illegal aliens, who allegedly came from Nicaragua, Peru, and Ecuador, were escorted by Chihuahua State Police from the city of Jiménez to facilities run by nongovernmental organizations in the Mexican border city of Juárez.

Melugin posted a video of the buses packed with illegal aliens that were escorted by Mexican state actors to the NGO facilities:

From Juárez, the migrants then flouted American laws and stole into the United States.

Illegal aliens lined up to be taken into custody by Border Patrol with the understanding that — rather than facing a penalty for violating American territorial sovereignty — they would likely be cut loose inside the U.S.



1,744 illegal aliens were released into El Paso between Saturday and Sunday, reported El Paso Matters.

The El Paso sector of the southern border reportedly had over 2,600 illegal crossings over a period of 24 hours from Friday to Saturday.

According to the City of El Paso's ""Migrant Situational Awareness Dashboard,"" as of Dec. 12, 5,105 illegal aliens were in custody.



A problem rapidly getting worse

U.S. Customs and Border Protection noted that the El Paso sector saw a 280.6% increase in its encounters with illegal aliens stealing into the U.S. in October, and a 39.1% increase in single adults crossing.



Last month, 53,574 illegal aliens were apprehended entering the U.S. in the El Paso Sector. The Center Square indicated that figure does not include the the 24,124 illegal aliens who evaded Border Patrol in November.

Illegal border crossings unchecked by the Biden administration exceeded 2.76 million in fiscal year 2022.

In the fiscal year now under way, Border Patrol saw 230,678 criminal crossings in October alone.

This latest surge of illegal border crossings comes ahead of the end of Title 42. This Trump-era public health order, invoked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March 2020, was implemented to stop the spread of COVID-19, enabling American officials to quickly send around 40% of illegal aliens encountered on the southern border packing.

Twenty-one states sued to block the Biden administration from ending Title 42.

The complaint said, ""This suit challenges an imminent, man-made, self-inflicted calamity: the abrupt elimination of the only safety valve preventing this Administration’s disastrous border policies from devolving into unmitigated chaos and catastrophe.""

This effort to help bolster America's porous southern border was in vain. Title 42 will be lifted on December 21.

Brandon Judd, president of the national Border Patrol Union, told the New York Post, ""Once Title 42 goes away, it just means we’re going to be releasing even more people into the United States which, of course, just encourages more people to come.""



Migrants are massing in Mexico and preparing to participate in what is anticipated to be a migratory ""avalanche.""

In March, the Washington Post noted that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had enlisted Federal Emergency Management Administration officials to prepare for nearly 18,000 illegal migrants a day at the southern border upon Title 42's expungement.

TheBlaze previously reported that extra to depressing the wages of low-skilled Americans, committing crimes beyond their initial contravention of American immigration laws, and potentially undermining the integrity of elections, illegal aliens also are costing U.S. taxpayers a great deal of money.

The illegal aliens who entered the U.S. from between the beginning of President Joe Biden's term in office and Sept. 14 impose an additional burden of $20.4 billion yearly on taxpayers.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform indicated that that this annual figure is not included in the estimated $140 billion per year that taxpayers are already weighted with, which compensates for the provision of services and benefits to the ""longer-term"" illegal alien population.

In the event that crossing figures meet or exceed DHS expectations, this burden will be compounded by the millions more set to cross into the United States in fiscal year 2023.

When asked on Dec. 5 whether he planned to visit the border for the first time as president, Biden said he wouldn't, claiming that ""there are more important things going on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thousands-of-illegal-aliens-storm-el-paso-in-one-of-the-largest-mass-crossings-ever,2022-12-12
Tim Allen responds after Pamela Anderson makes explosive allegation against him: 'He said it was only fair',"Actor Tim Allen has responded to explosive accusations that he exposed himself to Pamela Anderson on the set of ""Home Improvement"" in the 1990s.

What is the accusation?

Anderson's forthcoming memoir — ""Love, Pamela"" — details the creepy accusation.

According to Variety, Anderson claims in her book that on the first day of filming for ""Home Improvement,"" the hit sitcom that aired from 1991 to 1999, Allen exposed himself because Anderson had appeared in Playboy.

Anderson claims in her book:

On the first day of filming, I walked out of my dressing room, and Tim was in the hallway in his robe. He opened his robe and flashed me quickly — completely naked underneath. He said it was only fair, because he had seen me naked. Now we’re even. I laughed uncomfortably.

At the time of the alleged incident, Anderson was just 23 years old. ""Home Improvement"" was one of Anderson's earliest TV credits; she played Lisa the Tool Girl, who assisted Tim Taylor, played by Allen, and Al Borland, played by Richard Karn, on a show-within-a-show ""Tool Time,"" which featured Tim and Al as they demonstrated various home-improvement projects.

Anderson only appeared on ""Home Improvement"" for 23 episodes. Instead, she reached stardom after being cast as a regular on ""Baywatch.""

How did Allen respond?

Allen, who would have been 37 years old at the time of the alleged incident, unequivocally denied Anderson's accusations.

""No, it never happened. I would never do such a thing,"" he told Variety.



Anderson, however, insists that it did.

""This true story is just one of many surreal and uncomfortable situations I learned to navigate,"" Anderson said in a statement. ""My book goes into how it made me feel over the course of my life and, in this case, my career. I have no ill will toward Tim. But like the rest, it should never have happened.""

Anderson's book is set to release on Jan. 31.

Sen. Tim Scott: 'Woke supremacy is as bad as white supremacy',"South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Tuesday responded to a disparaging comment from MSNBC host Joy Reid that accused the senator of appearing at a GOP press conference about the minimum wage to make the Republicans appear more diverse.

""Woke supremacy is as bad as white supremacy,"" Scott told Fox News host Trey Gowdy. ""We need to take that seriously.""

He added that people who lack ""common sense"" should read the Bible verse Matthew 5:44. That verse states, ""But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.""

Last week Reid, commenting on a press conference held by Republican senators expressing their opposition to increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour, said that Scott was there to provide a ""patina of diversity"" for the GOP. At the time, Scott's press secretary Caroline Anderegg responded on social media, saying the senator ""is not a prop.""



""Unsurprising someone like Joy would stoop that low — I guess that's what you do in the absence of a substantive policy critique,"" Anderegg said. ""The senator has been leading the fight against the misguided Dem wage hike for weeks.""

Before Scott appeared on the program, ""Fox News Primetime"" host Trey Gowdy took a moment to condemn Joy Reid's remarks.



""Tim Scott is a United States senator who worked his tail off to be part of nearly every significant policy conversation this country has,"" Gowdy said. ""He can stand wherever the hell he wants to stand, in any group he wants to stand with, because he's earned the right to be there.""

""The fact that you see a black man as a prop, Joy Reid, says a lot more about you than it does about Tim Scott,"" he continued. ""I see a United States senator. And if you were really interested in unity or fair treatment or respect in civil discourse, that's what you would see too.""

At last week's press conference, Scott explained that the minimum wage will increase costs on businesses, leading many to cut jobs they cannot afford to pay for and increasing unemployment during the pandemic.

""This is the furthest distance between common sense and the Democrat policies,"" Scott said. ""In the middle of a pandemic where nearly 11 million Americans have already lost their jobs, the last thing you do is increase the cost of businesses, which will, according to the CBO, will at least shutter 1.4 million jobs.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tim-scott-woke-supremacy-white-supremacy,2021-03-10
"Exercise is 'white supremacy': Time magazine article connects Peloton, AIDS, and 9/11 in fitness conspiracy theory","Time.com published a bizarre Q&A recently, exploring an author's unorthodox attacks on the origins of physical fitness and exercise.

The article, titled ""The White Supremacist Origins of Exercise, and 6 Other Surprising Facts About the History of U.S. Physical Fitness,"" provides an uncited attempt to describe sinister origins behind everything from President Kennedy's fitness campaign to simple running.

Author Natalia Mehlman Petrzela wrote ""Fit Nation,"" a book that states in its synopsis that ""fitness is a social justice issue.""

Petrzela reminds readers that until 1920, being fat was attractive. ""What would be considered today fat or bigger, was actually desirable and actually signified affluence—which is like the polar opposite of today,"" she explained.

At the turn of the 20th century however, women were supposedly encouraged to exercise and gain strength because the powers that be decided they ""need more white babies"" to counter immigration. ""This is totally part of a white supremacy project,"" she points out.

Running, which Petrzela says was popularized by environmentalists, was not only never fair, but it was also unsafe and discriminatory. ""Access was never totally equal, if you lived in a neighborhood that didn’t have safe streets or streets that were not well lit,"" the author explains. ""Women were catcalled. People of color were thought to be committing a crime,"" she continued.

The idea that everyone can run forgets ""that depending on where you live and the body that you live in, it can be a very different kind of experience,"" Petrzela tells Time.

Pre- and post-WWII, the author says, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the government dishonestly encouraged Americans to exercise in order to keep them in fighting shape. ""Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy went on a mission to make exercise look wholesome and patriotic and focus on shifting the purpose of exercise to being a good citizen and defending your country,"" Petrzela remarked.

The author makes a confusing argument about post-9/11 fitness culture as well, calling it ""militarized fitness and girding yourself and your body for a fight,"" but not like the 1950s or 1960s, she clarifies.

A fitness boom in the 1980s was in part due to the shaming of gay people who stayed fit in order to appear healthy, so as to not be accused of having HIV or AIDS, asserts the author, who said she spoke to gay men who ""exercised to display that they had a healthy body at a moment when there was so much homophobia.""

While she believes lockdowns ""accelerated fitness inequality,"" remarking that ""not everyone"" can ""go home and be on [their] Peloton,"" the author did approve of one purveyor of exercise: Richard Simmons.

""We should not presume that because you are fat, that you are not fit or that you want to lose weight. And I think that we probably couldn’t have had that without Richard Simmons.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/time-exercise-is-white-supremacy,2022-12-29
Toby Keith battling stomach cancer,"Country music star Toby Keith revealed that he is battling cancer.

On Sunday afternoon, the ""Red Solo Cup"" singer made the announcement that he was diagnosed with stomach cancer last fall on his official Instagram account.

""Last fall I was diagnosed with stomach cancer,"" Keith wrote on Instagram. ""I've spent the last 6 months receiving chemo, radiation, and surgery. So far, so good. I need time to breathe, recover, and relax.""

""I am looking forward to spending this time with my family,"" he added. ""But I will see the fans sooner than later. I can't wait.""

The ""Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue (The Angry American)"" singer is currently on tour, and his next scheduled live performance is in Illinois and Michigan on June 17 and 18. Keith, 60, was forced to cancel his concert at the Ohio State Fair next month.

The Oklahoma native released his first album in five years last October titled ""Peso In My Pocket.""



The National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute estimates there will be 26,380 cases of stomach cancer in the U.S. in 2022 – which makes up 1.4% of all new cancer cases. The 5-year relative survival rate for stomach cancer victims is 33.3%.

The average age of people who are diagnosed with stomach cancer is 68, and approximately 60% of people diagnosed with stomach cancer are 65 years old or older, according to the American Cancer Society.

In 2006, the country musician founded the Toby Keith Foundation to provide support for children with cancer. The foundation provides no-cost housing for pediatric cancer patients.

In 2014, the Toby Keith Foundation launched the OK Kids Korral – ""a cost-free, convenient and comfortable home for pediatric cancer patients receiving treatment at The Children’s Hospital at OU Medical Center, Stephenson Cancer Center, and other nearby facilities.""

""There is no greater gift than keeping families strong and together during a difficult time,"" the foundation states on its website. ""If we can alleviate stress on a family, encourage a brother or sister and comfort a sick child, then we will make a difference in the fight against cancer.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/toby-keith-cancer-stomach-instagram,2022-06-12
Tom Hanks calls Pixar out for replacing Tim Allen in new Buzz Lightyear movie: 'I don't understand',"Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks spoke out recently about his friend Tim Allen losing his role as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the new Pixar ""Lightyear"" movie.

What is the background?

Actor Chris Evans voiced the iconic character in the film despite Allen voicing Buzz Lightyear in every previous installment of the ""Toy Story"" franchise.

Director Angus MacLane explained the character change was necessary because the Buzz Lightyear character needed to be less ""goofy.""

""Tim’s version of Buzz is a little goofier and is a little dumber, and so he is the comic relief,"" MacLane told Vanity Fair.

""In this film, Buzz is the action hero. He’s serious and ambitious and funny, but not in a goofy way that would undercut the drama,"" he added. ""Chris Evans has the gravitas and that movie-star quality that our character needed to separate him and the movie from Tim’s version of the toy in Toy Story.""

What did Allen say?

Speaking in a recent interview promoting his new movie ""Elvis,"" Hanks was asked what he thought about Allen losing his role. The question is personal for Hanks, who voices Woody, the other leading ""Toy Story"" character.

Hanks responded that he does not understand why Allen was not cast for one of his signature roles.

""Is it gonna be strange to be in theater's opposite of the Buzz Lightyear film?"" a reporter asked Hanks.

""How about that?"" Hanks replied. ""Why it’s not— I actually, I wanted to go head to head with Tim Allen and they didn’t let Tim Allen do it. I don’t, I don’t understand that.""

Hanks then changed the subject when the journalist interviewing him mentioned that Evans is voicing Buzz in ""Lightyear.""

""Yeah, yeah, I know,"" Hanks shot back. ""But here here’s the thing: Just as long as people come back to the motion-picture theater. I want to go back into the theater with a bunch of strangers and leave with something in common. That’s what I want to do.""

""Going to see a movie with him — I’m looking forward to that,"" he added, though it's not clear to whom Hanks was referring.

Anything else?

Allen recently addressed the situation, explaining why he has remained ""silent"" on not receiving the role.

""The short answer is I’ve stayed out of this ’cause it has nothing to do [with my Buzz Lightyear],"" Allen said. ""This is a whole new team that really had nothing to do with the first movies.""

Allen also disclosed that he originally thought ""Lightyear"" would be a live-action movie but was surprised to learn it is an animated film. He also knocked the film for not including Woody.

""It just doesn’t seem to have any connection to the toy,"" Allen said of the new movie. ""There's really no 'Toy Story,' Buzz without Woody.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tom-hanks-questions-tim-allen-replacement-lightyear,2022-07-05
Arizona police say they have audio of Democratic state senator admitting to child molestation,"A Democratic Arizona state senator was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two teenaged brothers, and police say they have him on audio admitting to the crimes.

Sen. Otoniel ""Tony"" Navarrete of Phoenix was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of having sexual conduct with a minor, police said.

The openly gay 35-year-old Democrat is accused of inappropriately touching a boy who was 14 at the time of the incident in 2019.

According to Maricopa County Superior Court documents, one of the victims claimed that Navarrete touched him and performed sex acts on him more than five times from the time he was about 12 or 13 years old until he was 15 years old.

Police say they recorded Navarrete talking to one of the victims and admitting to the molestation.

""Of course, I regret any bad actions that I did, absolutely wishing everything could be different. I'm sorry, mijo,"" Navarrete was quoted as saying on the recording. Police say he was not aware they were recording the call.

When the victim, who is now 16 years old, asked Navarrete why he touched the boy's penis, he reportedly replied that he was ""not well.""

Navarrete made his first appearance in court via an iPad because he is also infected with the coronavirus with mild symptoms despite being vaccinated.

— FOX 10 Phoenix (@FOX10Phoenix) August 6, 2021

Police recommended seven felony charges including three counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of molestation of a child.

Navarrete's attorney pressed for a more lenient bond of $15,000 on the basis that he had cooperated with police, but the judge ordered a $50,000 bond. He added some conditions to the bond including the forfeiture of Navarrete's passport.

Dems demand resignation

Many of Navarrete's legislative colleagues called for his resignation after the details of the charges were released.

""Like many in our community, I am grieving as more details come out about the charges against my Senate seatmate. I am calling on Senator Otoniel 'Tony' Navarrete to resign immediately. We are elected to protect the most vulnerable, and that begins with our children,"" tweeted state house member Raquel Teran.

""In light of these disturbing charges, House and Senate Democrats are calling on Senator Navarrete to resign immediately. Abuse of this kind is intolerable and our hearts go out to the victims,"" read a statement from Arizona House Democrats.

""Although every person is granted the right to a fair trial, we believe that it is in the best interest of the residents in Legislative District 30 that Sen. Navarrete resign immediately,"" said a statement from the Young Democrats of Arizona.

Navarrete had been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump.

"Top general in US military warns of possible surprise nuclear attack from China, cites hypersonic missile tests and new silos: 'Should create a sense of urgency'","Over the summer, China surprised the United States intelligence community with multiple tests of nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles that circled the earth.

Now the No. 2 man in the U.S. military is pointing to those tests and other moves by Beijing to warn of the potential for surprise nuclear attacks down the road from the Sino government.

What happened?

Reports revealed last month that over the summer China launched multiple tests of hypersonic missiles capable of circumnavigating the globe while carrying nuclear payloads. According to sources, U.S. intelligence personnel were caught off-guard by the tests.

Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Hyten saw the tests and other efforts by China and revealed to CBS News this week that the U.S. should be concerned about a possible surprise nuclear attack.



""They launched a long-range missile,"" the general told CBS News. ""It went around the world, dropped off a hypersonic glide vehicle that glided all the way back to China, that impacted a target in China.""

When asked if the vehicle hit its intended target, Hyten replied, ""Close enough.""

Hypersonic missiles are harder to track than intercontinental ballistic missiles. ICBMs travel in an arc that can be followed and predicted by long-range radar, while hypersonic weapons fly lower to the earth and can evade detection.

""That's a very significant capability that has the potential to change a lot of things,"" he told the outlet. ""So we have to be very concerned about that.""

Hyten warned that the hypersonic missiles appear to be a ""first-use weapon,"" adding, ""That's what those weapons look like to me.""

The general also revealed that the Chinese hypersonic tests aren't new. According to Hyten, China has conducted hundreds of hypersonic tests over the last five years compared to just nine tests by the U.S. military.

He also said that the Chinese have already deployed a medium-range hypersonic weapon, according to CBS News, while the U.S. remains a few years away from deploying its first such weapon.

Combined with China's efforts to construct hundreds of new missile silos, Hyten said he believes Beijing could eventually have the capacity to conduct a surprise nuclear attack on the U.S., CBS News reported.

""Why are they building all of this capability?"" Hyten asked.

The general also noted that for some reason the summertime hypersonic failed to create a ""sense of urgency."" This laissez-faire attitude was reflected in White House press secretary Jen Psaki's statement following initial reports of the summer's surprise hypersonic tests. According to Psaki, the people in the Biden administration ""welcome stiff competition.""

Hyten seems to have a slightly different take.

""I think it probably should create a sense of urgency,"" he said, according to CBS News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/top-general-us-military-possible-surprise-nuclear-attack-from-china,2021-11-17
"Trans female MMA fighter who delivered 'life-altering blows' to female competitor is 'bravest athlete in history,' LGBTQ outlet claims","A sportswriter for a prolific LGBTQ media outlet said recently that Fallon Fox — a transgender female MMA competitor who was biologically born a male — is the ""bravest athlete in history.""

Fox, 44, once broke a female competitor's skull during a 2014 fight.

What are the details?

In late January, Outsports contributor Cyd Zeigler praised Fox's performance in the octagon and said that Fox is easily the bravest athlete in all of history.

Zeigler wrote, ""She's been inducted in the LGBT Sports Hall of Fame. She is an indelible part of LGBT sports history. And, maybe most importantly, she generated conversations an [sic] opened possibilities for trans athletes in women's sports that will be felt for generations.""

Zeigler also praised Fox for enduring a ""torrent of hatred I have literally never seen targeting an LGBTQ athlete.""

As highlighted by Disrn, Fox has received criticism for delivering ""life-altering blows"" to female opponents in the ring.

""During a fight against Tamikka Brents in 2014, Fox gave Brents a concussion and broke seven orbital bones,"" Disrn reported. The fight lasted a whole three minutes.

At the time, Brents said, ""I've fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night.""

Brents said that she was not aware at the time that Fox had transitioned from male to female.

""I can't answer whether it's because she was born a man or not because I'm not a doctor,"" Brents said. ""I can only say, I've never felt so overpowered ever in my life and I am an abnormally strong female in my own right. ... I still disagree with Fox fighting. Any other job or career I say have a go at it, but when it comes to a combat sport I think it just isn't fair.""

The Post Millennial recently reported that athlete Erika Newsome fought what ended up being her final pro fight against a ruthless Fox.

""Fox, a male to female transgender athlete, destroyed Erika Newsome in a Coral Gables, FL, MMA fight during which she 'secured a grip on Newsome's head ... With her hands gripping the back of Newsome's skull, she delivered a massive knee, bringing her leg up while pulling her opponent's head down.""

""The blow landed on Newsome's chin and dropped her, unconscious, face-first on the mat,"" the outlet reported.

That fight, which took place in 2012, was Newsome's last professional fight.

Zeigler wrote, ""One of the lasting moments from Fox's career is a fight that has been twisted by anti-trans forces to paint her as a criminal assailant. During her fight against Tamikka Brents, Brents suffered a broken orbital and a concussion. Broken bones and concussions are not uncommon in MMA.""

""The people looking to ban trans women from women's sports quickly twisted that into the misleading headline: Transgender MMA Fighter Breaks Skull of Her Female Opponent,"" Zeigler continues. ""The crux of their campaign is to build an aura of rarity around the fight and point to Fox being trans as the reason for the outcome.""

Fox told Zeigler that such a thing ""happens all the time.""

""I'm not the first female MMA fighter who's broken another fighter's bones or caused a large amount of stitches or a concussion or any combination of those,"" Fox said. ""And people will of course, because I'm trans, hold it up as this devastating thing that couldn't possibly happen if I weren't trans. But there are many different examples of similar things happening.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-female-mma-fighter-bravest-athlete,2021-02-16
"Trans females do have advantages over biological women when 'bigger, stronger, fitter, and faster' matters — and could compete in new category: UK study","A wide-ranging study from the United Kingdom concluded that transgender female athletes — i.e., biological males who identify as female — do have physical advantages over biological female competitors when ""being bigger, stronger, fitter, and faster"" makes a difference.

That said, the study also said an option to keep things fair could be creating ""open"" competition categories in order to include transgender female athletes, the study's guidance said.

What are the details?

The study — under the auspices of UK Sport, among other organizations — found that some sports are ""gender-affected"" and some sports are not. Sports that are not gender-affected include darts, curling, shooting, and equestrian, the study said.

Gender-affected sports that ""rely significantly on physical capacity – physique (including height), strength, stamina"" include rowing, volleyball, and climbing, the study said.

Other gender-related considerations involve competition safety — specifically whether particular sports involve contact (basketball), collision (rugby), or combat (boxing, martial arts).

In general, the study said if a sport is not gender-affected, a participant's gender identity is not crucial in terms of creating an advantage over other competitors.

But it's a different story in gender-affected sports, as transgender women likely will have advantages, the study said.

""Transgender women are on average likely to retain physical advantage in terms of physique, stamina, and strength,"" the study added. ""Such physical differences will also impact safety parameters in sports which are combat, collision or contact in nature.""

In addition, the study said ""testosterone suppression is unlikely to guarantee fairness between transgender women and natal females in gender-affected sports.""

Solution

The study's guidance suggested that gender-affected sports offer additional categories to accommodate transgender female competitors — for example, keeping a ""female"" category and adding an ""open"" category.

Athletic organizations ""may choose to offer sport in which the female category is protected for reasons of competitive fairness and/or safety if they are gender affected. These sports would offer both a female category and an open category. Female entries would be required to declare themselves as recorded female at birth,"" the study said, adding that ""an open category would be available for any competitor to enter.""

Anything else?

Transgender females competing against biological females has been a growing issue in sports over the last several years.

Of late the primary figure has been New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, who — by qualifying for this summer's Tokyo Games — became the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympics.

Hubbard exited quickly from the women's competition, however.

Before Hubbard hit the headlines, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood — biological male sprinters who identified as females — dominated girls' track in Connecticut:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-females-advantages-sports-uk-study,2021-10-01
Trans golfer takes stand against biological males competing in women's sports: 'There has to be a division',"Golfer Mianne Bagger made history in 2004 when she competed in the Women’s Australian Open, the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a professional golf tournament.

Now, Bagger is speaking out about the dangers of allowing biological males to compete in female athletics.

What is Bagger saying?

Amid renewed scrutiny over the fairness of allowing biological men to compete against biological women in athletics, Bagger revealed this week that she supports an Australian lawmaker's bill meant to protect female sports from biological male competitors.

In an interview with Australian TV’s ""Insight,"" Bagger condemned the trajectory of the transgender movement.

""These days, [the dynamic] has crept into what’s called self ID or self identification: male-bodied people presenting as women, who live as women, with varying degrees of medical intervention and in some degrees, no medical intervention, which is just — it’s crossed the line, in my view, it really has,"" Bagger said. ""It’s a slap in the face to women.""



Bagger was born a man, but underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1995. However, she does not care if she is labeled a ""hypocrite"" for supporting legislation that would have banned her from participating in sports.

In fact, Bagger said it is ""really important"" to concretely state ""the difference between general society and sport, particularly really high-level sport"" because of the biological differences between men and women.

""In every day society, of course we want an inclusive, egalitarian [society]. We want equality, lack of discrimination, and of course every single person should have equal access to life and services and work in society. Of course we all want that, and so do I,"" Bagger said.

""In sport? It’s different. Sport is about physical ability. It’s not just about discrimination, it’s not just about equality and equal access. It is a physical ability,"" Bagger explained. ""Now, if you’ve got one group — males — that are on average stronger, taller, faster, as opposed to women, there has to be a divide. There has to be a division.""

Anything else?

As progressives in America continue to push the participation of transgender athletes in sports despite unfair physical advantages, our neighbors across the pond are reconsidering such policies.

In fact, a British transgender cyclist, a biological male, made headlines this month after being banned from competing in an event. British Cycling, the sanctioning body for cycling in Britain, then suspended its policy allowing transgender and non-binary cyclists to compete in events.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also boldly said that biological men should not compete in female sports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-golfer-takes-stand-against-biological-males-competing-in-womens-sports-there-has-to-be-a-division,2022-04-21
Transgender hockey tournament promoted by NHL results in biologically male player concussing female player,"The National Hockey League openly promoted the ""Team Trans Draft Tournament,"" which saw a biologically female player concussed by a biological male. The format led to a massive advantage for one team, with one attendee citing an ""enormous difference"" in player size, according to the Post Millennial.

The tournament featuring a ""Team Black"" vs. ""Team Pink"" game included the Boston-based ""Team Trans"" organization, which describes itself as ""New England’s first LGBTQ+ hockey club.""

A video posted by Quillette shows player #90 on Team Pink, described as a ""bisexual trans woman"" (biological man) shoving #91 on Team Black, who describes themselves as female-to-male (biological woman). The female player takes what appears to be a light bump onto the ice and then the boards, resulting in a concussion.

The stark difference in size accounts for the biologically male player absorbing little to no impact from the collision. Additionally, the contact would be illegal in most hockey leagues as a ""hit from behind,"" although the tournament did likely host a ""no contact"" event.

The injured player later commented on Twitter that she had an ""amazing time"" with a fellow player named Mason ""(he/him/his).""

A rinkside attendee described the scene as displaying ""an enormous difference in size between the two teams—height, weight, shoulder width, muscles—the differences were plain to even a child,” the source told Quillette, commenting that anyone ""could see that this couldn’t possibly be fair, and that someone could get hurt—and someone did.""

A number of players were easily identified as large enough to stand out from the rest of the players on the ice. Four biologically male players on Team Pink were described as ""head and shoulders taller than most of Team Black,"" including at least one player who allegedly played in Division I hockey.

Team Pink went on to beat Team Black in the tournament final by a score of 7-1, despite holding a team meeting in the second period to decide whether or not to continue the lopsided game.

The NHL's Twitter account promoted the event that took place November 19-20, 2022, in Middleton, Wisconsin, which was comprised of entirely transgender-identifying individuals.

""The NHL is proud to support this past weekend's Team Trans Draft Tournament in Middleton, Wisconsin. This was the first tournament comprised entirely of transgender and nonbinary players, with around 80 folks participating! #HockeyIsForEveryone#NHLPride.""





One of the leading hockey publications, the Hockey News, gave two thumbs up to the event, ironically tagging the article with ""women's hockey."" With additional calls for more diversity, the hockey publication mentioned the NHL's recent trans-related tweeting, describing replies to the hockey league's comments as ""bigoted.""

In response to the NHL's promotion of the tournament, a user remarked ""So, men playing a womans team?"" to which the NHL replied ""Trans women are women. Trans men are men. Nonbinary identity is real.""

Trans weightlifter officially headed to Olympics to compete in women’s events,"Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard will be the very first trans athlete to compete in the Olympics after New Zealand selected the athlete to compete in the Tokyo Games, Reuters reported on Monday.

In a new statement, the country's Olympic committee CEO acknowledged that ""gender identity"" in professional sports is a ""highly sensitive and complex issue.""

What's a brief history here?

Hubbard, who will be the oldest lifter in July's forthcoming Tokyo Games at the age of 43, transitioned in 2013 and previously participated in men's weightlifting competitions.

The International Olympic Committee determined that Hubbard became eligible to compete in the games in 2015 after showing a testosterone level below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months leading up to competition.

The Reuters report noted that Hubbard will compete in the super heavyweight 87-kg category.

What are the details?

In a Monday statement, Hubbard said, ""I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many New Zealanders.""

New Zealand Olympic Committee CEO Kereyn Smith added that Hubbard has the support of the committee and vowed the committee is dedicated to perpetuating a sense of ""inclusion and respect for all.""

""We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,"" Smith said. ""As the New Zealand Team, we have a strong culture of ... inclusion and respect for all.""

The New Zealand government also voiced its support for Hubbard.

""Laurel is a member of New Zealand's Olympic team,"" Minister for Sport and Recreation Grant Robertson said in a statement. ""We are proud of her as we are of all our athletes, and will be supporting her all the way.""

What else?

A spokesperson for Save Women's Sport Australasia said that the board should never have included Hubbard in the games.

""It is flawed policy from the IOC that has allowed the selection of a 43-year-old biological male who identifies as a woman to compete in the female category,"" the group said in a statement obtained by Reuters.

In May, Belgium weightlifter Anna Vanbellinghen said that the decision to include Hubbard is ""like a bad joke.""

""First off, I would like to stress that I fully support the transgender community, and that what I'm about to say doesn't come from a place of rejection of this athlete's identity,"" she said at the time. She added that ""anyone that has trained weightlifting at a high level knows this to be true in their bones: this particular situation is unfair to the sport and to the athletes.""

Transgender cyclist blocked from women's championship race after boycott threats from biologically female contestants,"A transgender female cyclist was blocked from participating in the women’s British National Omnium Championship over the weekend, as Emily Bridges is still registered as a male cyclist, the Guardian reported.

In addition, a number of the race's participants were said to be ready to boycott the race if Bridges was in it, the outlet added.

What are the details?

Bridges, 21, set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018, the Guardian said, adding that the cyclist began hormone therapy last year to reduce testosterone levels.

However, a number of biological female cyclists discussed boycotting Saturday's event because they believed Bridges has an unfair advantage, the outlet said, adding that Bridges was involved with the Great Britain Academy program as a male cyclist until being dropped in 2020.

In addition, Bridges is still registered as a male cyclist and can't race as a woman until the male ID expires, according to Union Cycliste Internationale regulations, the Guardian said.

How did Bridges react?

Bridges was “disappointed” with UCI’s decision, the outlet said.



“We have been in close discussions with the UCI regarding Emily’s participation this weekend and have also engaged closely with Emily and her family regarding her transition and involvement in elite competitions,” British Cycling said, according to the Guardian. “We acknowledge the decision of the UCI with regards to Emily’s participation, however we fully recognize her disappointment with today’s decision.”

A comprehensive scientific review by the five British sports councils in September said there were “retained differences in strength, stamina, and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth.""

Anything else?

Transgender female athletes competing against biological female athletes has been a growing issue on the world stage, particularly over the last year with transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard going to the Olympic Games and transgender swimmer Lia Thomas competing in last month's NCAA women's championships. Hubbard didn't win in Tokyo, but Thomas was victorious in one swimming event.

Podcaster Joe Rogan said last week that Thomas' participation is an ""assault on women's sports.""

President Joe Biden's administration reportedly soon will overhaul rules for college athletes to favor transgender participants; Title IX — a 1972 law that bans sex discrimination in education — also will outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Transgender female psychologist worries that trans trend among teens has 'gone too far',"Erica Anderson — a 71-year-old transgender clinical psychologist who specializes in counseling transgender youth — has helped hundreds of teens gender-transition, the Los Angeles Times reported.

But Anderson also has been outspoken in questioning the noticeably rapid rise in teenagers over the last several years who insist they're transgender, the paper said.

What are the details?

Anderson told the Times that some trans-identified kids are falling under the influence of their friends and social media — and added that some in the medical field are failing to give teens rigorous mental health evaluations before recommending hormones or surgeries.

""I think it’s gone too far,” Anderson told the paper. “For a while, we were all happy that society was becoming more accepting and more families than ever were embracing children that were gender variant. Now it’s got to the point where there are kids presenting at clinics whose parents say, ‘This just doesn’t make sense.’""

Anderson — who began male-to-female hormone treatments at age 58 after decades of gender struggles — wondered several years ago if the rise in transgender youth really was just about disappearing social stigmas, the Times said.

“I think a fair number of kids are getting into it because it's trendy,” Anderson noted to the Washington Post in 2018, adding that ""I'm not sure it's always really trans. I think in our haste to be supportive, we're missing that element. Kids are all about being accepted by their peers. It's trendy for professionals, too.""

Noticing that some teens jumped from gender-questioning to trans to nonbinary to gay — and many battled anxiety, depression, autism, bipolar disorder, and other mental health issues before desiring to transition — Anderson believed something else was going on, the paper added.

Then the pandemic happened.

More from the Times:

As millions of teenagers across the U.S. went into quarantine in 2020, Anderson found herself meeting more and more parents who were startled when their children came out as trans. The UC San Francisco adolescent gender center where she worked saw a total of 373 new patients last year — up from 162 in 2019.



The teens tended to tell similar stories: They were in online school, had a lot of time on their hands and were spending more time on social media. TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, and even video games, allowed teens to craft virtual identities that they could then try out in the real world.



Online, a stream of transgender influencers and activists told teens that if they felt uncomfortable with their bodies, or didn’t fit in, maybe they were trans. Some coached kids on how to bind their breasts, how to change their name and pronouns at school, how to push their parents for testosterone.

“To flatly say there couldn’t be any social influence in formation of gender identity flies in the face of reality,” Anderson added to the Times. “Teenagers influence each other.”

Last fall Anderson granted an interview to Abigail Shrier, author of the controversial 2020 book ""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,"" the paper said, adding that Anderson told Shrier too many doctors were rushing teens into medicalization and that “sloppy healthcare work” would result in “more young adults who will regret having gone through this process.""

Pushback

Many in medicine don't agree with Anderson and say teens are capable of deciding what their gender should be without psychological assessments gumming up the works.

“Being trans or gender diverse is not a mental illness, and compulsory psychotherapy is not the standard of care in the gender-affirming medical model,” Dr. AJ Eckert — medical director of the Gender and Life-Affirming Medicine Program at the Anchor Health Initiative in Stamford, Conn. — told the Times.

Eckert — the state's first out nonbinary trans doctor — added to the paper that “forcing transgender and gender diverse youth through extensive assessments while their cis peers are affirmed in their identity without question conveys to [them] that they are not 'normal.'”

Eckert also told the Times that peer pressure isn't behind the spike in youths saying they're transgender: ""Is it trendy to be one of the most marginalized and vulnerable groups?""

Patients in Eckert’s program aren't required to go through therapy, the paper added.

Anything else?

“Giving over to hormones on demand will result in many more cases of poor outcomes and many more disappointed kids and parents who somehow came to believe that giving kids hormones would cure their other psychological problems,” Anderson told the Times. “It won't.”

Here's a video of Anderson arguing against the notion that any form of psychological counseling for teens who saying they're transgender represents an attempt to change their minds:

Trans Olympic athlete said 'goal' is to win event to 'burn a US flag on the podium',"The Olympics are traditionally a time when Americans come together under a shared sense of patriotism and love of country. But for one U.S. Olympic athlete, the dream of standing on the winner's podium would mean an opportunity to express the exact opposite.

In a Facebook post last year, unearthed by Fox News, transgender BMX freestyle rider Chelsea Wolfe declared that being able to set fire to the American flag in protest while on the podium was the motivating factor driving them to accomplish their dream.

""My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium. This is what they focus on during a pandemic. Hurting trans children,"" wrote Wolfe, who qualified to be an alternate for this year's Olympic games in Tokyo, Japan, wrote on March 25, 2020.

Included underneath Wolfe's text was a link to a PinkNews story titled, ""Trump administration officially declares it believes trans girls should be treated as 'biological males.'""

In conversation with Fox News, Wolfe explained that the since-deleted post was not intended to convey a disdain for America. Rather, it was an attempt to ""take a stand against fascism"":

""Anyone who thinks that I don't care about the United States is sorely mistaken,"" Wolfe told Fox News. ""One of the reasons why I work so hard to represent the United States in international competition is to show the world that this country has morals and values, that it's not all of the bad things that we're known for. I take a stand against fascism because I care about this country and I'm not going to let it fall into the hands of fascists after so many people have fought and sacrificed to prevent fascism from taking hold abroad. As a citizen who wants to be proud of my home country, I'm sure as hell not going to let it take hold here.""

Wolfe, who was born a biological male, if given the chance will compete as a female in the upcoming games in Japan.

Earlier this month, in an Instagram post announcing their acceptance as an alternate, Wolfe discussed her journey as a transgender BMX rider.

""I searched for so long trying to find out if there had ever been a professional trans bmx rider to show me that who I am would be okay and unfortunately I found no one. I had the badass cis women inspire me but there was always a disconnect,"" Wolfe said. ""Eventually I started to meet some amazing women who helped me accept that I am a woman just like any other and that I deserve a place to exist in the world just like everyone else.""

In order to compete as a transgender female athlete, the International Olympic Committee specifies that athletes must declare that their gender identity is female and cannot change that declaration for at least four years.

As part of an effort to maintain ""fair competition,"" the athlete must also test under specified testosterone levels at least 12 months prior to competitions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-olympic-athlete-burn-american-flag,2021-06-21
Transgender runner found to be ineligible for Olympic trials for women's track,"Transgender runner CeCe Telfer just got word that this year's Olympics are not in the cards, having been ruled ineligible to compete in the 400-meter hurdles for not meeting the World Athletics regulations for eligibility, the Associated Press reported Wednesday night.

Who is this?

Telfer, who was born a male, is best known for easily winning the women's NCAA Division II 400-meter hurdles in 2019.

Image source: Twitter/OTLonESPN video screenshot

The runner formerly known as Craig competed on the Franklin Pierce University men's track team just a year earlier before taking a break and transitioning to a female. Telfer was considered an above-average male hurdler, Turtleboy Sports said, but with women's hurdles being lower, the athlete was soon dominating the women's competition.



Though the NCAA has a policy that requires biological males to suppress testosterone levels for a full year before competing in women's events, the league declared that is is not accurate to merely assume that a male who has transitioned to female has an unfair advantage over a biological female.

Telfer agrees with the NCAA's logic and told ESPN that ""if anything, me competing against cisgender females is a disadvantage.""

""Being on hormone replacement therapy [results in] muscle depletion,"" Telfer said, adding, ""your muscles are deteriorating. You lose a lot of strength because testosterone is where you get your strength, your agility.""

What's happening with the Olympic trials?



But the track star has not met the transgender female requirements necessary to compete in next month's Tokyo Olympics, the AP said.

According to World Athletics guidelines, transgender females are not eligible for international women's events between 400 meters and one mile if their testosterone levels have not been below 5 monopoles per liter for a 12-month span.

USA Track & Field, the U.S. governing body for the sports of track and field, cross country, and road running said that athletes must meet the requirements to be a member of the U.S. Olympic team in order to be eligible to take part in the trials. Those eligibility requirements are governed by World Athletics.

More from USATF, via the AP:

Following notification from World Athletics on June 17 that the conditions had not yet been met, USATF provided CeCe with the eligibility requirements and, along with World Athletics, the opportunity to demonstrate her eligibility so that she could compete at the U.S. Olympic Team Trials. According to subsequent notification to CeCe from World Athletics on June 22, she has not been able to demonstrate her eligibility.

The USATF said that though it ""strongly supports inclusivity and providing a clear path to participation in the sport for all,"" it also must maintain ""competitive fairness.""

Telfer's manager, David McFarland, said the runner would respect the decision and will focus on the future and continue to train.

""She will compete on the national — and world — stage again soon,"" McFarland said, the AP reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-runner-cece-telfer-ineligible-olympics,2021-06-24
"Lia Thomas, Ivy League championship, transgender, swimming","Following a decisive victory during a 500 free Thursday at the Ivy League Women's Swimming and Diving Championships, transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male, wiped out the competition again on Friday by finishing a 200 free more than 2 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.

""Lia Thomas is the @IvyLeague Champion in the 200 free with a meet and pool record time of 1:43.12,"" a tweet from Penn Swimming & Diving declared.

On Thursday, Thomas had delivered an even more dramatic drubbing, winning a 500 free more than seven seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.

""As it turns out, men are incredible at women's swimming,"" Ben Shapiro tweeted about Thomas' victory in the 500 free.

""And so the shameful destruction of women’s rights to equality & fairness continues,"" Piers Morgan tweeted.

""This man is such a beautiful and empowering woman…,"" BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales of ""The News & Why It Matters"" tweeted. She added, ""…am I doing this right?""

Each win Thomas takes from the female competitors helps to bolster the argument of critics who contend that biological men should not be allowed to compete in women's sports.

While the issue has been a topic of cultural contention for years, the controversy surrounding Thomas has drawn attention to the subject.

Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard out of women's Olympic competition early after failing at all three lift attempts,"Laurel Hubbard — a biological male who identifies as female and was cleared to compete against women weightlifters at the Tokyo Olympics — exited early from competition at the Games.

What are the details?

Hubbard of New Zealand failed on all three lifts in the snatch portion of the women's +87kg competition Monday and recorded a ""did not finish,"" ESPN reported.

Yahoo Sports said Hubbard was the only finalist to not complete at least one lift; ESPN added that among Hubbard's group, Hubbard was the only competitor to not advance to the Clean & Jerk portion of the evening.

Hubbard, 43, was the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympic Games.

What did Hubbard say afterward?

""Thank you so very much for your interest in my humble sporting performance tonight,"" Hubbard said to the media, according to Yahoo Sports. ""I know from a sporting perspective I did not live up to the standards I put upon myself.""

Hubbard added, ""I know my participation in these games has not been entirely without controversy,"" before praising the International Olympic Committee, the outlet noted.

""[The IOC has] been extraordinarily supportive, and I think that they have reaffirmed the principles of the Olympics that sport is something that all people around the world can do, that it is inclusive and successful,"" Hubbard added, according to Yahoo Sports.

The outlet noted that Hubbard took no questions from reporters.

But according to the PA Media organization, journalists attending the Tokyo International Forum for the event ""were handed a 20-page guidebook prepared by three LGBT activist groups with the approval of the International Weightlifting Federation.""

PA Media said the guidelines urged reporters to ignore ""misinformation"" that transgender athletes have an ""unfair advantage"" and told journalists to ""familiarize yourselves with ... anti-LGBTQ groups and their campaigns targeting transgender access to sports.""

Anything else?

Hubbard has been competing against women for several years — and that has angered women's rights groups that say Hubbard's presence represents unfair competition. Yahoo Sports reported that the IOC said it will unveil a new framework on the issue soon and that its present policy allowing the likes of Hubbard to compete is ""outdated.""

""What's really important to remember is that trans women are women,"" Richard Budgett, director of the IOC's medical and scientific department, told Yahoo Sports. ""And so, in the spirit of inclusion in sport, if at all possible, they should be included in sport. It's only where there's evidence of real concern — that that would lead to a disproportionate performance advantage for those individuals — should any rules and regulations come in to change that eligibility. The IOC is determined to increase inclusion in sport as one of the fundamentals, but at the same time our highest, highest priority is fairness.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-weightlifter-laurel-hubbard-out-of-women-s-olympic-competition-early-after-failing-at-all-three-lift-attempts,2021-08-02
"Transgender female athletes shouldn't be required to reduce testosterone to compete, International Olympic Committee says","The International Olympic Committee said transgender females shouldn't be required to reduce testosterone to compete in sports, Sky News reported.

What are the details?

The IOC's updated guidelines are not legally binding, the outlet said, adding that the organization said it's not in a position to issue broad regulations defining eligibility for every sport and will instead leave such decisions in the hands of individual federations.

""What we are offering to all the international federations is our expertise and a dialogue, rather than jumping to a conclusion,"" IOC director of the athletes' department Keveh Mehrabi said, Sky News noted.

But where the IOC stands on transgender issues seems pretty clear.

The body's new guidelines say that no athlete should be excluded from competition due to perceived ""unfair and disproportionate advantage"" as a result of gender, Sky News reported.

Previously transgender female athletes were allowed to compete only if their testosterone levels were below a required limit 12 months before their first competition, the outlet said.

But no longer apparently.

""You don't need to use testosterone [to decide who can compete] at all,"" IOC medical director Richard Budgett said, according to Sky News.

The IOC also decried sex testing to verify an athlete's gender as ""disrespectful"" and ""potentially harmful"" and ""invasive,"" the outlet added.

""We really want to make sure that athletes are not pressured or coerced into making a harmful decision about their bodies,"" added Magali Martowicz, IOC head of human rights, according to Sky News.

Pushback

Not everyone was in complete agreement with the IOC.

Joanna Harper — visiting fellow for transgender athletic performance at England's Loughborough University — told ESPN that not presuming physical advantages when it comes to transgender females is ""problematic for me. There is no doubt that transgender women are on average taller, bigger, and stronger than cisgender women and that these are advantages in many sports.""

Laurel Hubbard

Indeed, the IOC's updated guidelines come just months after New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard — a biological male who identifies as female — became the first transgender athlete to compete in the Olympics.

Many critics have said Hubbard's presence is unfair to biologically female weightlifters.

In fact, it was reported in May that some biologically female weightlifters were told to ""be quiet"" after complaining about Hubbard competing against them.

""We're all about equality for women in sport, but right now that equality is being taken away from us,"" former Olympic weightlifter Tracey Lambrechs told Australia's 7 News in regard to Hubbard. ""I've had female weightlifters come up to me and say, 'What do we do? This isn't fair, what do we do?' Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do because every time we voice it, we get told to be quiet.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-women-athletes-shouldn-t-be-required-to-reduce-testosterone-to-compete-international-olympic-committee-says,2021-11-18
Trump backs challenger to Georgia's GOP secretary of state,"Former President Donald Trump has endorsed a challenger to take on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican who has steadfastly insisted his state conducted a clean and fair general election despite Trump's insistence that the election was stolen from him.

What are the details?

Trump issued a statement endorsing Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) in his bid to unseat Raffensperger, writing that Hice ""has been a steadfast fighter for conservative Georgia values and is a staunch ally of the America First agenda.""

""Unlike the current Georgia Secretary of State,"" the former president's statement read, ""Jody leads out front with integrity.""

Hice came out swinging against Raffensperger in a statement announcing his candidacy Monday, saying that ""[w]hat Brad Raffensperger did was create cracks in the integrity of our elections, which I wholeheartedly believe individuals took advantage of in 2020.""

He added, ""Every Georgian, in fact every American, has the right to be outraged by the actions and, simultaneously, the inaction of our Secretary of State.""

Raffensperger hit back in a statement to ABC News, saying in reaction to Hice's challenge:

""Few have done more to cynically undermine faith in our election than Jody Hice. We saw in January what Georgia voters will do to candidates who use that rhetoric. His recklessness is matched by his fecklessness as a congressman. Georgia Republicans seeking a candidate who's accomplished nothing, now have one.""

Raffensperger was referring to the Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, where two Republican incumbents lost to Democratic challengers as pro-Trump attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell urged conservatives to boycott the election. The outcome put the U.S. Senate in Democratic control.

NBC News reported:

Hice objected to Georgia's electoral vote being counted on Jan. 6, even after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, delaying the vote count. In a since-deleted Instagram post on the morning of Jan. 6, Hice wrote, ""This is our 1776 moment.""



A spokeswoman for Hice told the Journal-Constitution the next day that the post was ""our way of highlighting the electoral objection,"" and they removed it ""when we realized it could be misconstrued as supporting those acting violently yesterday and storming the Capitol.""

What's the background?

Raffensperger and other Georgia Republican officials — including Gov. Brian Kemp — fell under attack from Trump after the secretary of state ""rejected pressure from Mr. Trump to overturn the state's results and certified President [Joe] Biden as the winner of the presidential race after a hand recount,"" CBS News reported.

The feud between Trump and Raffensperger was ratcheted up to a new level after a leaked recording of a Jan. 2 phone call between the two was released by The Washington Post. During the conversation, Trump urged the secretary of state ""to find 11,780 votes, which is more than we have. Because we won the state.""

Raffensperger's office revealed last month that it had launched an investigation into the call, which critics of the former president say shows he was illegally trying to change the results of the election.

Trump disputes that claim, and has repeatedly accused Raffensperger of circumventing the state legislature by signing a consent decree with Democratic groups regarding signature matching in the state.

The former president says the decree ""should be deemed invalid, and the election result changed.""

Gabriel Sterling, another Republican and Raffensperger's voting systems implementation manager, says all the consent decree did was ""send out an 'official election bulletin,' telling people, 'hey follow our rules and how we already do a signature match.'""

According to WXIA-TV, Sterling argues ""the only substantive change in policy — a policy subject to the discretion of the Secretary of State's Office — was how people should be given notice if their ballot was rejected.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-backs-challenger-to-georgias-gop-secretary-of-state,2021-03-22
Trump calls for boycott of MLB after All-Star Game pulled from Georgia,"Former President Donald Trump delivered a scathing rebuke of Major League Baseball's decision to pull its 2021 All-Star Game out of Georgia, calling for a boycott of baseball and all ""woke"" companies seeking to interfere with voting reforms.

What are the details?

MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. announced Friday that the league was stripping its All-Star Game and the draft from Atlanta, citing Georgia's recently-passed election law.

The sweeping legislation requires that absentee ballots be verified with photo ID, expands early voting for primary and general elections, and puts added securing measures in place for ballot dropboxes. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed the bill into law last week, sparking fury from Democrats who say the reforms restrict voting rights.

Late that night, Trump issued a statement of his own, saying that ""baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans, and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the Radical Left Democrats who do not want voter I.D., which is desperately needed, to have anything to do with our elections.""

""Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections,"" he continued, adding, ""Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!""

The former president was not alone in criticizing the MLB for its move. Gov. Kemp reacted to the news by saying that ""Georgians — and all Americans — should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) posted a list of MLB's official sponsors to his Twitter feed with the message, ""These are MLB's corporate sponsors, who pressured to pull the All Star game out of Atlanta. Do all of them oppose voter ID? Are all of them willing to be the woke enforcers of the corrupt Democratic Party? And do all hate the 75m who voted for Trump?""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) pointed out that MLB has a recruitment deal with communist Cuba, asking the league, ""how many dropboxes does Cuba use for early voting?""

Cotton was one of many who pointed out the position MLB has put itself in by trying to punish Georgia over politics.

Reporters were quick to note that several states have more restrictive voting laws than Georgia already on the books, leading to questions over what the MLB's new standards are for a state to host the All-Star Game.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-calls-for-boycott-of-mlb-after-all-star-game-pulled-from-georgia,2021-04-03
Trump calls McConnell 'a stupid person' for refusing to end the filibuster,"Former President Donald Trump blasted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as mentally incompetent for preserving the filibuster while he was president and Republicans held control of Congress.

Trump told Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker that McConnell has ""no personality"" and lacks a killer political instinct in an interview published by Vanity Fair, an excerpt from their forthcoming book, ""I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year.""

""He's a stupid person,"" Trump said of McConnell. ""I don't think he's smart enough.""

He criticized McConnell for refusing to abolish the Senate filibuster — the 60-vote requirement to break minority obstruction and advance legislation toward a simple majority vote. He also faulted McConnell for failing to persuade Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a moderate Democrat, to switch parties.

""I tried to convince Mitch McConnell to get rid of the filibuster, to terminate it, so that we would get everything, and he was a knucklehead and he didn't do it,"" said Trump.

The former president also complained about former House Speaker Paul Ryan, calling him a ""super-RINO"" — Republican-in-name-only — and said he wished he had partners in Congress like Meade Esposito, a corrupt Democratic Party boss in Brooklyn from the 1960s through the 1980s.

Esposito ran a citywide patronage system that rewarded loyalists with jobs, gifts, and favors. Though he commanded respect, he had a reputation for intimidation and bullying and was connected to organized crime. In 1987 he was convicted on charges related to a bribery scandal.

""Nobody would ever talk back to Meade Esposito. Meade Esposito didn't have a RINO like a Mitt Romney, you know, or as I said, Ben Sasse, who's a lightweight,"" said Trump, naming two Republican senators who are some of his most outspoken Republican critics in Congress.

""Mitch McConnell compared to Meade Esposito, it's like a baby compared to a grown-up football player with brains on top of everything else,"" he added.

Democrats currently control the United States Senate with a bare minimum 50-50 majority. Vice President Kamala Harris must cast her tie-breaking vote to allow the Democratic majority to pass partisan legislation or approve President Joe Biden's nominees, and that only occurs when Republicans do not use the filibuster.

Since Biden became president, Republicans have used the threat of a filibuster to block the For the People Act, an overhaul of U.S. elections that would undo several Republican-backed election security reforms at the state level. GOP senators also blocked a bipartisan bill to create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Countless pieces of Biden's agenda on taxes, LGBT issues, election reforms, the Green New Deal, and more are dead on arrival as long as Republicans are able to wield the filibuster as a weapon to strike down radical progressive bills.

Recognizing this, Democrats are now calling on the moderates in their party to support abolishing the filibuster, despite just a few years ago protesting Trump's efforts to have McConnell end it.

In March, McConnell warned that eliminating the filibuster would result in a ""scorched-earth Senate"" where Republicans would use every tool at their disposal to make life miserable for Democratic senators and then pass whatever they wanted when they took back control of the Senate at some point in the future.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-calls-mcconnell-a-stupid-person-for-refusing-to-end-the-filibuster,2021-07-19
Trump expertly trolls New York Democrats with resounding 'endorsements' — and their opponents quickly take the bait,"Former President Donald Trump trolled New York Democrats on Wednesday by issuing ""endorsements"" of their congressional campaigns.

What did Trump say?

First, Trump issued a resounding ""endorsement"" of Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who is campaigning as a Democrat for New York's 10th Congressional District.

Interestingly, Goldman was lead majority counsel during both impeachment proceedings against Trump.

""It is my great honor to Strongly Endorse him,"" Trump said. ""I do this not because of the fact that he headed up the Impeachment Committee and lost, but because he was honorable, fair, and highly intelligent. While it was my honor to beat him, and beat him badly, Dan Goldman has a wonderful future ahead.""

Trump added that Goldman will be ""very compassionate and compromising to those within the Republican Party.""

Then Trump ""endorsed"" Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is campaigning against Rep. Jerry Nadler (D) for New York's redrawn 12th Congressional District.

""A vote for Carolyn Maloney in NY-12 is a vote for the future! She is a kind and wonderful person, who has always said terrific things about me, and will support me no matter what I do, just as I supported her very early on,"" Trump said. ""She begged for a check with no quid pro quo, and I gave it to her. In fact, I gave her many.""

The former president mocked Nadler for being ""high energy, sharp, quick-witted, and bright.""

""You can’t go wrong with either,"" Trump added, referring to Maloney and Nadler, ""but Carolyn Maloney is the better man.""

What was the response?

Goldman quickly responded to Trump's endorsement by rejecting it and insulting the former president.

""Last week Donald Trump attacked Dan Goldman, who led his impeachment. Now he’s pretending to endorse Goldman. True to form, Trump is trying to meddle in an election,"" the Goldman campaign said in a statement.

""This is a pathetic attempt at fooling Democrats who are far smarter than Trump is, and it’s clear that only one candidate in NY-10 is living rent-free in Trump's head. Buckle up Donald,"" the statement added. ""Dan’s coming for you.""

Maloney similarly rejected Trump's endorsement.

""This is laughable and I reject any endorsement from Donald Trump,"" Maloney tweeted. ""Trump doesn’t respect women. He instigated the attacks on January 6th and claimed that the 2020 election was a big lie.

""Thanks, but no thanks. I’ll pass,"" Maloney added.

However, multiple Democratic candidates seized on Trump's ""endorsements"" to tie their opponents to Trump.

""Donald Trump just endorsed my multi-millionaire opponent, in case you needed a reminder of what the stakes are. #NY10, choose your fighter,"" tweeted Yuh-Line Niou, who is running against Goldman for the Democratic nomination in New York's 10th district.

""Donald Trump is scared of a younger, more dynamic Democratic Party. He knows how much more effective a new generation of diverse, energetic Democrats will be in stopping his movement,"" reacted Suraj Patel, who is running against Maloney and Nadler in the 12th district.

Meanwhile, Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) repeatedly used Trump's statements against Goldman at a debate on Wednesday, the New York Times reported.

""Mr. Goldman is fulfilling Donald Trump’s vision of him being a moderate person who is attempting to defeat progressives in this race,"" Jones reportedly said.

Jones later described Goldman as ""the first candidate on this stage to be endorsed by Donald J. Trump.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-endorses-new-york-democrats,2022-08-18
Trump lashes out at Facebook after his ban is extended until at least 2023,"Former President Donald Trump lashed out at social media giant Facebook on Friday after they announced its decision to keep him banned until at least 2023.

Trump had been banned from Facebook in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol after Facebook determined that his statements decrying the authenticity of the 2020 election could incite more violence.

On Friday, the social media giant said his ban would continue until at least Jan. 7, 2023, when the company would reconsider whether he should be allowed back on its platform.

""Facebook's ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election,"" Trump wrote.

""They shouldn't be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win,"" he added. ""Our Country can't take this abuse anymore!""

The former president had begun sending messages to supporters via a blog website but it was shut down permanently after operating for about a month. A Trump aide said that it was a precursor to him joining another social media platform.

Some on the Left who were demanding a lifetime ban complained that the ruling on his ban meant that Trump was most likely going to return to Facebook. Supporters of the former president accused Facebook of violating his free speech rights.

Facebook Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg addressed the controversy over the ban in a statement on Friday.

""We know that any penalty we apply — or choose not to apply — will be controversial. There are many people who believe it was not appropriate for a private company like Facebook to suspend an outgoing president from its platform, and many others who believe Mr. Trump should have immediately been banned for life,"" wrote Clegg.

""We know today's decision will be criticized by many people on opposing sides of the political divide — but our job is to make a decision in as proportionate, fair, and transparent a way as possible,"" he concluded.

Trump issues response to Washington Post correcting story that falsely quoted him,"Former President Donald Trump issued a statement Monday in reaction to The Washington Post's correction to a story where the outlet admitted to misquoting him months ago, when they claimed he told a Georgia elections investigator to ""find the fraud"" in the state during a post-election phone call.

What are the details?

The Post was torched on social media after issuing a correction to a story from January where the newspaper admitted ""Trump did not tell investigators to 'find the fraud' or say she would be 'a national hero' if she did so,"" as they — and several outlet subsequently — had originally reported.

""While I appreciate the Washington Post's correction, which immediately makes the Georgia Witch Hunt a non-story,"" the former president wrote, ""the original story was a Hoax, right from the very beginning.""

""I would further appreciate a strong investigation into Fulton County, Georgia, and the Stacey Abrams political machine which, I believe, would totally change the course of the presidential elections in Georgia,"" he continued.

""Fulton County has not been properly audited for vote or signature verification,"" Trump asserted. ""They only looked at areas of the State where there most likely would be few problems, and even there they found large numbers of mistakes.""

He continued, ""We are seeking to find and reveal the large-scale election fraud which took place in Georgia,"" adding, ""many residents agree, and their anger caused them not to turn out and vote for two Republican Senators in the January election.""

The former president then went after the mainstream media, writing:

""You will notice that establishment media errors, omissions, mistakes, and outright lies always slant one -way—against me and against Republicans. Meanwhile, stories that hurt Democrats or undermine their narratives are buried, ignored, or delayed until they can do the least harm—for example, after an election is over. Look no further than the negative coverage of the vaccine that preceded the election and the overdue celebration of the vaccine once the election had concluded. A strong democracy requires a fair and honest press. This latest media travesty underscores that legacy media outlets should be regarded as political entities—not journalistic enterprises.""

Trump concluded his message be writing, ""In any event, I thank the Washington Post for the correction.""

Anything else?

The Washington Examiner's Becket Adams wrote in a commentary piece Monday, ""If you can believe it, the Washington Post's dud of a 'bombshell' isn't even the most scandalous thing about this episode in media malfeasance. No, the most scandalous thing is: Several newsrooms claimed they independently 'confirmed' the original 'scoop' with anonymous sources of their own.""

Adams went on to cite NBC News, USA Today, ABC News, CNN, and PBS NewsHour as claiming to ""confirm"" the now-corrected Post story ""through their own anonymous sources.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-issues-response-to-washington-post-correcting-story-falsely-quoting-him,2021-03-15
"Tulsi Gabbard hits Biden for being 'judge, jury, executioner' by attacking Border Patrol agents over false narrative","Former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard sharply denounced President Joe Biden Saturday over the ongoing border crisis, comparing Biden, whom she called her friend, to an ""autocrat"" for attacking Border Patrol agents who were falsely accused of abusing Haitian migrants.

What did Biden say?

Biden commented on the controversy involving the mounted Border Patrol agents on Friday by regurgitating the debunked narrative of migrant abuse and promising the Border Patrol agents involved would ""pay.""

""It was horrible [what] you saw. To see people treated like they did [sic]. Horses nearly running people over and people being strapped,"" Biden said at the White House.

""It's outrageous. I promise you those people will pay. They will be investigated. There will be consequences,"" he declared.

What did Gabbard say?

Speaking with Fox News host Jesse Watters, Gabbard condemned Biden for attacking the mounted Border Patrol agents despite facts that clearly showed the agents were not guilty of abusing the migrants.

""I consider Joe Biden a friend. But he's absolutely wrong and he needs to apologize to the American people for saying what he said,"" Gabbard said.

""Here's why: He's somebody who's been very outspoken as being against autocrats, autocracies, dictators. But what he essentially did was act as judge, jury, and executioner for these Customs and Border Patrol agents on horseback,"" she added.

Tulsi Gabbard: There is an 'increasing feeling' we are 'losing our democracy' www.youtube.com

Gabbard said the practical effect of Biden's public condemnation is a compromise in the integrity of the investigation into the incident. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas confirmed Friday the investigation would continue despite Biden's remarks.

""How can they expect to have a fair outcome to an investigation when the president of the United States has already declared their guilt and that they will be punished?"" Gabbard questioned.

""The bigger issue that this points to, which is one that we all need to be concerned about, is that if we are no longer a country of laws, if we are no longer a country where we know we will be presumed innocent unless proven guilty, then we don't have a democracy,"" she explained. ""And that's the increasing feeling that a lot of us have is we are losing our democracy and moving closer and closer to what essentially is an autocracy.""

The former Hawaii representative said the ""saddest part"" about the wrongful condemnation of the Border Patrol agents is that it highlighted how the ""powerful elite"" are ""working with the media, working with the deep state"" to ""preserve their power, their position, or money.""

""Who suffers as a result of this? It's the American people, it's our democracy, and they don't care about the cost and the toll that [it] takes,"" Gabbard said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-biden-border-patrol-lie,2021-09-26
'Hateful content': Twitter locks account of Concerned Women for America's CEO over tweet referring to transgender female swimmer Lia Thomas as a 'man',"The CEO of Concerned Women for America has been locked out of her Twitter account after referring to transgender female swimmer Lia Thomas as a ""man"" in a tweet, the organization told TheBlaze.

What are the details?

Penny Nance's March 24 tweet read, ""Another woman displaced by a man"" and then quoted the headline from a story TheBlaze published the same day: ""Swimmer who tied Lia Thomas in 200-yard freestyle says officials cheated her on podium: 'We just want Lia to hold the fifth-place trophy.'""

Concerned Women for America told TheBlaze that Twitter locked Nance's account almost a month later — April 23 — for ""hateful content,"" and that it's still locked as of Friday. The organization also is waiting on the status of an appeal filed with Twitter over the locked account.

The organization tweeted the following to Twitter in response:

What did Nance have to say?

Nance offered the following statement to TheBlaze:

Truth is powerful. My twitter account was suspended for making a factually true statement: ‘Another woman displaced by a man’ along with [TheBlaze] headline, “Swimmer who tied Lia Thomas in 200-yard freestyle says officials cheated her on podium: 'We just want Lia to hold the fifth-place trophy.’” I was told by Twitter that this was ‘hateful speech,’ and the only way I could get reinstated onto the platform was to delete my tweet and admit wrong. I won’t do it. I’m not going to pretend that reality is not true. A young woman athlete was displaced from the trophy podium because the NCAA wanted a picture of a man, who wants to be a woman, holding the trophy. CWA will continue to fight for female athletes, and I am thankful Elon Musk, an avid supporter of free speech, will be taking over the platform, and [CWA will] join him in the idea that more voices and more speech is better. Hopefully, he will let me out of Twitter jail soon.

TheBlaze on Friday asked Twitter to identify what is specifically ""hateful"" about Nance's tweet, but the social media giant did not immediately respond.

Anything else?

TheBlaze story in question focuses on swimmer Riley Gaines who tied Thomas for fifth place in the women's 200-yard freestyle finals at the NCAA championships in late March.

The University of Kentucky senior, speaking to the Daily Wire, said that after the race, she ventured behind the podium where NCAA officials were distributing trophies and that a man in an NCAA shirt told her, “Hey, I just want to let you know, we only have one fifth-place trophy, so yours will be coming in the mail. We went ahead and gave the fifth-place trophy to Lia, but you can pose on the podium with the sixth-place trophy.”

The official added to Gaines that ""we just want Lia to hold the fifth-place trophy,” after which Gaines replied, ""I don’t think that’s that’s right, and I don’t think that’s fair. There’s no dispute that only one of us can hold the trophy, but I think given the circumstances, you’re just trying to save face a little bit.""

With that, Gaines stood on the podium next to a biological man who identifies as a woman — and who took center stage from yet another biological female athlete.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-lockout-hateful-content-transgender,2022-05-06
Twitter suspends Allie Beth Stuckey for referring to transgender athlete Laurel Hubbard as 'a man',"BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey was suspended from Twitter on Thursday for violating the social media website's rules by referring to transgender New Zealand Olympic athlete Laurel Hubbard by his biological sex.

The podcast host shared a screenshot of an email she received from Twitter on Instagram, writing that she was suspended for 12 hours ""for saying Laurel Hubbard is a man"" in a tweet.

""What's that Orwell quote? Something about the further people get from the truth the more people will hate those who say it,"" wrote Stuckey.

The email Stuckey received said her tweet violated Twitter Rules against hateful conduct.

""You man not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, natural origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease,"" the email reads.

The offending tweet said: ""Laura [sic] Hubbard failing at the event doesn't make his inclusion fair. He's still a man, and men shouldn't compete against women in weightlifting.""

Hubbard, a biological male who identifies as female, was cleared to compete against women weightlifters at the Tokyo Olympics and then exited early from competition after failing to finish the snatch portion of the women's +87kg competition on Monday.

Stuckey told TheBlaze that she doesn't believe her tweet constitutes violence, a threat, nor harassment.

""I of course don't think stating biological facts promotes violence! I don't hate Laurel or anyone who identifies as transgender, but I also don't believe in affirming that which is objectively untrue,"" said Stuckey.

""I believe in the fairness and safety and rights of girls and women. That means recognizing sex differences. No amount of self-declarations can change that. Sex matters. Biology matters. Facts matter.""

According to Twitter, the platform's mission is ""to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to express their opinions and beliefs without barriers.""

""Free expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it,"" the company says in the explanation of its rules against ""hateful conduct.""

""We recognize that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves,"" Twitter adds.

Twitter rules prohibit ""targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals"" — that is, referring to a transgender person by the pronouns associated with their sex assigned at birth or by their birth name.

Two NYC doormen fired after failing to intervene in brutal attack on elderly Asian woman,"Two New York City apartment doormen are out of a job after they failed to step in and protect an elderly Asian-American from a vicious March attack, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

What are the details?

The building's management company, the Brodsky Organization, said that it fired the two employees who stood by and watched the attack, which took place on March 29.

Surveillance video captured the moment a suspect, later identified as Brandon Eliot — a 38-year-old lifetime parolee — repeatedly shoved, kicked, and stomped 65-year-old Vilma Kari.

The two unnamed employees reportedly watched as the attack unfolded, and one of them even went as far as to close the building's front door as the elderly woman lay on the ground after the attack ended and the suspect made off on foot.

The company initially suspended the two pending an investigation into their role as bystanders in the attack.

In a statement, the company said, ""While the fully lobby video shows that once the assailant had departed, the doormen emerged to assist the victim and flag down an NYPD vehicle, it is clear that required emergency and safety protocols were not followed.""

The company also vowed to train its employees in emergency response protocols, anti-bias awareness, and bystander intervention, Bloomberg added.

A spokesperson for the doorman's union said that the two unidentified doormen are ""challenging their terminations"" under a grievance process.

""We believe we must root out systemic racism in all its forms,"" 32BJ SEIU president Kyle Bragg said in a statement to the outlet. ""We believe that all union workers, especially workers of color who are often the subject of unfair treatment on the job, have a right to a fair process as outlined in their contract.""



According to Bloomberg, the union previously said that both doormen waited until the attacker was gone to intervene because they reportedly believed the suspect had a knife.

Authorities arrested Elliot — who was convicted of killing his own mother almost 20 years ago — and charged him with felony assault and attempted assault as hate crimes. He is scheduled to be arraigned on April 21.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/two-nyc-doorman-fired-after-failing-to-intervene-in-brutal-attack-on-elderly-asian-woman,2021-04-07
"Tenured UCLA professor retires early, claims 'the Woke takeover of higher education has ruined academic life'","Joseph H. Manson, a formerly tenured professor of anthropology at UCLA, has decided to retire early because ""of Woke capture"" at universities all across the land.

In a blog he posted on July 4, Manson described in great detail his frustrations with the intolerance of woke faculty members and graduate students, as well as the precipitous increase in ""critical"" studies, which view nearly all academic research — including STEM — through the lens of race, gender, sexual orientation, and other human ""identities.""

""[T]he Woke takeover of higher education has ruined academic life,"" Manson wrote.

To illustrate his point, Manson recounted the ostracization of his former colleague, P. Jeffrey Brantingham, a fellow anthropologist who had studied urban crime and developed a ""predictive"" algorithm which he then pitched to law enforcement. As a result of this research, the Graduate Students Association at UCLA publicly accused Brantingham of “entrench[ing] and naturaliz[ing] the criminalization of Blackness in the United States.” Brantingham was also referred to the vice chancellor for research, ostensibly in hopes that the vice chancellor would censure or otherwise sanction him.

Though Brantingham continues to teach and research in the department, he no longer participates in faculty meetings or events and has even had to reorient the course catalog so that his popular course called ""The Ecology of Crime"" is not listed too closely to the courses taught by colleagues who condemn his line of research.

In short, Brantingham has been ""unpersoned."" And Manson believes that other professors from across the country and in every academic discipline are at risk of meeting a similar fate because, Manson predicted, the woke tyranny on campus will only get worse.

""The younger faculty tend to be more Woke than their elders,"" Manson noted. ""Administrators and student 'protesters' perform elaborately choreographed routines that end with the former enacting policies that they wanted to enact anyway, for which the latter’s public temper tantrums serve as a pretext.""

Between the demonization of respectable scholars, the sheer number of woke faculty and grad students, and the frightening surge of ""anti-Zionism, a.k.a. thinly disguised Jew-hatred,"" Manson said he's had enough.

""[M]ainstream U.S. higher education is morally and intellectually corrupt, beyond the possibility of self-repair, and therefore no longer a worthwhile setting in which to spend my time and effort,"" he stated.

In response to the blog post, UCLA spokesman Bill Kisliuk issued a statement, which reads in part, ""UCLA is deeply committed to the free and open exchange of ideas and we strongly support the academic freedom of our scholars.

""We actively encourage respectful debate, but we also expect equity and fairness, even when people strongly disagree. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment and, to that end, UCLA strongly condemns anti-Semitism and other forms of hatred.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ucla-professor-retires-woke,2022-07-23
UK anti-lockdown protesters sentenced for using 'abusive words and threatening behaviour' toward BBC journalist,"Five U.K. protesters who ""intimidated"" Nick Watt, a BBC journalist, were sentenced on Tuesday. The judge stated that the anti-lockdown activists used ""abusive words and threatening behaviour,"" reported the Independent.



On June 14, 2021, protesters gathered in Westminster to demonstrate against the government's lockdown response to COVID-19. At the time, England officials had just announced that they would extend the existing lockdown for another four weeks.

A video from the demonstration showed BBC journalist Nick Watt being followed around Downing Street by protesters. The activists in the footage ""intimidated"" Watt by calling him a ""traitor"" and banging on a metal baking sheet with a spoon.

The five convicted protesters included Djazia Chaib-Eddour, 44; Martin Hockridge, 58; Alexander Peat, 34; Christopher Aitken, 62; and Gary Purnell, 45.

All denied using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behavior with intent to cause harassment, alarm, or distress. However, the court found each of them guilty of verbally abusing Watt.

Purnell, Peat, and Hockridge were each sentenced to 12 months of mandatory community orders and 200 hours of unpaid work. Chaib-Eddour received a 12-month community order, 100 hours of unpaid work, and 20 hours of rehabilitation.

An indefinite no-contact restraining order for Watt was placed against all of the demonstrators. In addition, they were each ordered to pay a fine of £395.

An arrest warrant was issued for Aitken, but he did not attend the hearing. Another protester, Joseph Olswang, 40, pleaded guilty at an earlier trial and was sentenced to 20 weeks in jail.

""This was an extremely unpleasant incident in which each of you used abusive words and threatening behaviour towards Mr. Watt,"" stated District Judge Louisa Cieciora. ""This was committed against somebody who was providing a service to the public, even if you did not agree that service was being performed to the standard it should have been.""

""At the time of the incident I was shocked and alarmed at what was happening to me,"" Watt said in his victim impact statement. ""I felt I was in immense danger.""

In a YouTube interview with Resistance GB, activist Martin Hockridge said, ""I very carefully used the word 'traitor' to describe the BBC because they've committed treason. Their role – which Nick Watt stated many times – was to educate, educate and inform in an impartial way the British public.""



Alexander Peat told Resistance GB that the protesters were found guilty before they ever entered the court. He said, ""It was trial by mainstream media even before we got into court."" Peat referred to the court system as a sham and stated, ""It was clear to me we were never going to stand a fair trial.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-lockdown-protesters-sentenced,2022-08-30
Trump and Republicans react to Biden's ultra-MAGA insult concocted by research,"Last October, an NBC Sports reporter attempted to go into damage control when a crowd was chanting ""F*** Joe Biden"" at a NASCAR race. The reporter claimed that the crowd was showing support for the winning driver, Brandon Brown, by shouting, ""Let's go Brandon!""



The phrase ""Let's go Brandon"" instantly became a rallying call for detractors of President Joe Biden. ""Let's go Brandon"" has been chanted at sporting events, heard in rap songs, and seen on license plates, restaurant signs, shirts, flags, luggage, face masks, and even golf balls.

Democrats may have undertaken an extensive quest to discover their own version of the ""Let's go Brandon"" slogan.

The Washington Post reported this week that Democrats have spent six months attempting to develop a catchphrase to try to hurt Republicans heading into the 2022 midterm elections. The final result from the six months of research is ""ultra-MAGA.""

The ""ultra-MAGA"" term was the strategy developed by the liberal group Center for American Progress Action Fund – which is headed by top Biden aide Anita Dunn.

Polling and focus group testing done by the Hart Research and the Global Strategy Group indicated that potential voters saw the term ""MAGA"" more negatively than other labels such as ""Trump Republicans.""

""In battleground areas, more than twice as many voters said they would be less likely to vote for someone called a 'MAGA Republican' than would be more likely,"" the Washington Post reported. ""The research also found that the description tapped into the broad agreement among voters that the Republican Party had become more extreme and power-hungry in recent years.""

Navin Nayak – the president and executive director of CAP Action Fund – told the Washington Post that ""ultra-MAGA"" is a ""versatile epithet"" because ""all of that extremism gets captured in that brand.""

""We are not trying to create a new word,"" Nayak added. ""This is how they define themselves.""

President Joe Biden first employed the phrase on May 4, while speaking to reporters about deficit reduction at the White House. Biden said ""ultra-MAGA"" and ""MAGA"" on 10 different occasions – mostly used in an attack on Sen. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) ""Rescue America"" plan.

""This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history, in recent American history,"" Biden told reporters.

While giving a statement on the economy on Tuesday, Biden used ""ultra-MAGA"" or ""MAGA"" five more times in reference to the popular campaign slogan of former President Donald Trump.

During a fundraising event in Chicago on Wednesday, President Biden uttered the focus group-approved lingo three more times.

""But we have to take on the — MAGA Republicans — 'Make America Great Again' Republicans. I think they’re the most extreme party,"" Biden said at the Democratic National Committee fundraiser. ""And that’s what the Republican Party is now. Not everybody Republican believes that. But the fact of the matter is, they run the show — the MAGA Republicans.""

Also on Wednesday, President Biden addressed the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 40th Annual Conference – where he recited the phrase five more times. Biden even called Trump ""the great MAGA king.""

""Under my predecessor, the great MAGA king, the deficit increased every single year he was president,"" Biden said of Trump. ""The first year of my presidency — the first year, I reduced the deficit — literally reduced the deficit by $350 billion.""

Ashley Parker – who wrote the Washington Post piece – noted, ""Trump 'absolutely loved' co-opting Biden’s new nickname for him — 'the great MAGA king' — and has privately mocked Biden and Democrats’ 'ultra MAGA' taunt as coming from bad branders, who don’t understand the art of marketing.""

Trump reacted to being called the ""great MAGA king"" by sharing a meme of him photoshopped on the cover of a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie on his Truth Social platform.

Trump also thanked Biden for the compliment, “The Great MAGA King is the name Joe Biden is now using to describe me. Thank you, Joe. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) also embraced the supposed barb, and declared, ""I am ultra MAGA, and I'm proud of it.""

Meanwhile, other Republicans are capitalizing on the Democrats trying to make the ""MAGA"" phrase great again.

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is giving away 1,000 ""ultra-MAGA"" t-shirts away.

Trump's Save America Joint Fundraising Committee is offering ""ultra-MAGA"" t-shirts in exchange for a $45 contribution.

The Washington Post report that the phrase was developed by focus groups seems to contradict a claim by former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.

On Tuesday, Psaki claimed that ""ultra-MAGA"" was ""the president's phrase and the president made those comments himself."" Psaki said that President Biden added ""ultra"" to give ""MAGA"" a ""little extra pop.""



""But I can tell whether it’s tomorrow or in days and weeks ahead, you will all continue to hear him talk more about his concern about ultra-MAGA Republicans and their agenda,"" Psaki told reporters.

Other Democrat leaders have also adopted the ""MAGA"" messaging at the same time President Biden did.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) used the phrase ""MAGA Republicans"" on Tuesday, ""For MAGA Republicans, this has never been about states’ rights. It has always been about getting rid of abortion altogether. Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act to protect abortion rights. We will see where every single senator stands.""

Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Thursday, ""The single most patriotic thing a person can do is fight for their rights. You better believe I’m going to fight for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and every other freedom the MAGA crowd or Supreme Court is trying to take away.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ultra-maga-democrats-research-republicans-trump,2022-05-14
UMass Amherst students suspended for not wearing masks off-campus,"Three UMass Amherst honor students have been kicked out of school because they were seen in a photo without masks when they were off-campus and outside. The freshmen students will reportedly lose their course credits and tuition over the maskless photo that was posted on social media. The students' parents are ready to fight the university's decision.

The three female students posed for a photo while at an off-campus party that was held outside in March. The photo posted to Instagram were reportedly sent to UMass Amherst officials, who then suspended the three students.

""There was a photo sent to the administration of these girls outside off-campus on a Saturday,"" Kristin, a mother of one of the suspended students, said. ""This is why they lost a whole semester of their schooling.""

RJ, the father of another suspended student, said his daughter ""did everything right,"" adding, ""She was valedictorian and class president of her high school.""

The students were immediately moved out of on-campus housing and forced to return home to attend remote classes while they appealed their case, according to WCVB-TV. The parents said the three students lost their appeals.

The students were kicked out of their current distance-learning courses and were prohibited from taking their finals, which has major academic and financial ramifications for the families. The students were forced to forfeit the entire semester and $16,000 tuition that was already paid. The parents said the school would not refund the tuition.

""That negates this whole semester $16,000 of money and they have to reapply for next semester,"" a parent named Scott stated. ""But they missed housing registration.""

""These beautiful young ladies who are honors students have had a full academic year stripped away and their paths broken of their higher education for alleged COVID violations,"" one of the parents, who don't wish to give their last names in fear that it could hurt their daughters' chances of getting accepted to a new school, said.



""So for this to happen it's been devastating,"" Kristin said.



""One little thing happens and you're out? Like not even like a don't do it again, here's some probation,"" another parent named Teresa said, adding that the situation is ""heartbreaking.""

UMass Amherst did not provide a specific statement about the three students, but issued a statement.



""Students received a number of public health messages this semester that emphasized the importance of following public health protocols and the consequences for not complying, and those messages were also shared on UMass social media channels,"" the school said.

""Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health and safety of the UMass Amherst community has been the university's foremost priority,"" the university said. ""Expectations regarding students' responsibility to follow public health protocols, and the consequences for failing to do so, were clearly communicated to students before and throughout the spring semester, and students were updated regularly as conditions changed.""



""When positive COVID-19 cases surged within the UMass community in February 2021, the university, in consultation with the state Department of Public Health, promptly imposed severe restrictions on campus activities, including the suspension of in-person classes and a prohibition on student social gatherings,"" the school continued. ""It was made clear to students that those who failed to comply would be subject to discipline, including suspension.

""The university said a February 7 campus-wide message directed all students, whether residing in campus residence halls or in off-campus housing in the surrounding area, were directed to stay home, except to get meals, undergo twice-weekly COVID testing, or to attend medical appointments,"" the statement read.

However, the parents argue that the suspension is entirely unfair, considering there is evidence that the UMass Amherst hockey team were also maskless, but suffered no repercussions from the school. There is a video of UMass Amherst students and members of the hockey team celebrating their national championship on campus in April; many are seen without face coverings.

""I just want the university administration to be equitable and fair,"" RJ declared.

'Unequivocally unconstitutional': Georgia judge overturns heartbeat bill that prevented abortion after 6 weeks,"On Tuesday, a Georgia judge overturned the state's bill that banned abortion after a baby's heartbeat can be detected, ABC News reported.



Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney declared that since the bill was passed before the Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade, the legislation was ""unequivocally unconstitutional.""

The Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, also referred to as the heartbeat bill, prevented abortions after a baby's heartbeat could be detected, which typically occurs around six weeks' gestation.

The law required medical professionals to check for a heartbeat before moving forward with an abortion. The LIFE Act included exceptions for rape and incest but required physicians to report to the Department of Public Health why an abortion was performed after the heartbeat was detectable.

The bill also clarified the state's definition of a ""natural person"" to include unborn children with a ""detectable human heartbeat"" at any stage of development.

The act was signed into law by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) in 2019.

A few months after Roe was overturned, a federal appeals court ruled that the LIFE Act could go into effect.

The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Georgia, the Center for Reproductive Rights, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective filed a lawsuit against the legislation.

Judge McBurney ruled in favor of the pro-abortion groups and voided the bill because it was signed into law before Roe v. Wade was overturned.

""At that time -- the spring of 2019 -- everywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments -- federal, state, or local -- to ban abortions before viability,"" McBurney wrote.

""Under Dobbs, it may someday become the law of Georgia, but only after our Legislature determines in the sharp glare of public attention that will undoubtedly and properly attend such an important and consequential debate whether the rights of unborn children justify such a restriction on women's right to bodily autonomy and privacy,"" McBurney added.

Kara Richardson, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, told the Associated Press that the office intends to pursue an ""immediate appeal.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unequivocally-unconstitutional-georgia-judge-overturns-heartbeat-bill-that-prevented-abortion-after-6-weeks,2022-11-15
Newly unredacted correspondence between Fauci and top scientists reveals early efforts to shift the narrative on COVID-19's possible lab origins despite uncertainty,"It is clear from newly unredacted communications between top scientists that early in the pandemic, there was a coordinated push to downplay the possibility that COVID-19 originated in a lab and to instead bolster then-unsubstantiated claims that the virus had naturally made the trans-species jump to humans.

What are the details?

Through a Freedom of Information lawsuit, Guardian reporter Jimmy Tobias obtained newly unredacted emails detailing both the Feb. 1, 2020, teleconference between Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and virologists discussing the SARS-COV-2 virus, as well as other correspondence pertaining to COVID-19's possible origins.

Emily Kopp, a reporter with the nonprofit investigative research group U.S. Right to Know, has incorporated these findings into an extensive and detailed timeline concerning the ""proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.""

Kopp noted that in February 2020, when the aforementioned teleconference took place, several top virologists sought to examine the nature of the coronavirus that would go on to kill tens of millions of people worldwide.

Although they ultimately concluded in the journal ""Nature Medicine"" that the virus had not been engineered, stating, ""We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" behind the scenes there was a great deal of doubt.

Furin cleavage site

Many of the scientists who were attempting to account for the origin of the furin cleavage site on the virus' spike protein — responsible for its relatively high infectivity — were confronted with the strong possibility of human intervention.

U.S. Right to Know reported that in January 2020, Danish evolutionary biologist and Scripps Research Institute immunology professor Kristian G. Andersen raised the matter of a gain-of-function study that ""looked like a how-to manual for building the Wuhan coronavirus in a laboratory.""

Andersen reportedly directed British evolutionary biologist and virologist Edward Holmes' attention to the ""furin cleavage site between the S1 and S2 junctions,"" which had features characteristic of genetic engineering.

The furin cleavage site is a place in a virus cell where furin protease enzymes split the spike protein, the hook that binds to ACE2 receptors on the outer surface of human cells. Owing to this splice, the spike can bind to a second receptor called Neuropilin-1, facilitating the virus' entry into the human cell.

Many scientists believe that furin cleavage sites, such as those seen in COVID-19, are not naturally occurring. This gives credibility to the increasingly strong theory that the virus originated in a laboratory.

Holmes reportedly responded by saying, ""F***, this is bad.""

On Jan. 31, 2020, Andersen wrote to Fauci, ""You have to look very closely at the genome to see features that are potentially engineered. … I should mention that after discussions earlier today, Eddie [Holmes], Bob [Garry], Mike [Farzan], and myself all find the genome to be inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.""

'Wild west'

In a Feb. 2, 2020, email to Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, British medical researcher Jeremy Farrar attached comments provided by Michael Farzan, professor and chair at the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the Scripps Research Institute, and Bob Garry, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane School of Medicine.

Farrar indicated that Farzan was ""bothered by the furin site and has a hard time explaining that as an event outside the lab.""

Farzan noted, as stated in Farrar's email, ""A likely explanation could be something as simple as passaging SARS-like CoVs in tissue culture on human cell lines (under BSL-2) for an extended period time, accidentally creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission between humans via gain of furin site (from tissue culture) and adaptation to human ACE2 receptor via repeated passage.""

""So I think it becomes a question of how do you put all this together, whether you believe in this series of coincidences, what you know of the lab in Wuhan, how much could be in nature — accidental release or natural event? I am 70:30 or 60:40,"" added Farzan.

Bob Garry said, as stated in Farrar's email, ""[If] You were doing gain of function research you would NOT use an existing close [clone] of SARS or MERSv. These viruses are already human pathogens. What you would do is close a bat virus th[at] had not yet emerged. Maybe then pass it in human cells for a while to lock in the RBS, then you reclone and put in the mutations you are interested – one of the first a polybasic cleavage site.”

On the basis of Garry's and Farzan's comments, Farrar wrote, ""On a spectrum if 0 is nature and 100 is release — I am honestly at 50! My guess is that this will remain grey, unless there is access to the Wuhan lab — and I suspect that is unlikely!""

While Farrar had not been swayed one way or the other by the data available at the time, he noted that Holmes ""would be 60:40 lab side.""

Collins clarified that ""Eddie is now arguing against the idea that this is the product of intentional human engineering. But repeated tissue culture passage is still an option — though it doesn't explain the O-linked glycans.""

Farrar agreed, ""'Engineered' probably not,"" but contended that there ""remains very real possibility of accidental lab passage in animals to give glycans.""

Collins wrote back on Feb. 4, ""I'd be interested in the proposal of accidental lab passage in animals (which ones?).""



U.S. Right to Know reported that Fauci's concerned reply, ""?? Serial passage in ACE2-transgenic mice,"" referenced the possibility that ""the virus could have acquired its furin cleavage site through serial passage in mice engineered with human airway cells.""

University of North Carolina virus expert Dr. Ralph Baric, who experimented on coronaviruses with Dr. Zhengli Shi and received funding from Fauci's agency, reportedly shared transgenic mice with the Wuhan lab.

Farrar answered Fauci in the affirmative.

Collins couldn't let himself believe that such reckless experimentation would be done in Wuhan, writing, ""Surely that wouldn't be done in a BSL-2 lab (a low biosafety level laboratory)?""

Farrar responded, ""Wild West.""

Shooting down a strong possibility

Citing concerns from the Chinese in Hubei who believed they were being lied to about the virus' origins, Edward Holmes wrote that things ""were made worse when the Wuhan lab published the bat virus sequence — a bat sampled in a different province for which they have a large collection of samples.""



""I believe the aim/question here is whether we, as scientists, should try to write something balanced on the science behind this?"" wrote Holmes. ""There are arguments for and against doing this.""

On Feb. 8, Andersen stated, ""The fact that Wuhan became the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic caused by nCoV is likely an unfortunate coincidence, but it raises questions that would be wrong to dismiss out of hand. Our main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory, but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn't conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered.""



On Feb. 9, Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist who is head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience, emphasized to Andersen that she ""would not be in favour of publishing something specific on the lab escape hypothesis, because ... this could backfire.""



Koopmans recommended ""zooming out a bit for starters, describing that one of the key challenges is where this virus came from, discuss some of the (wild) guesses out there. ... And I would leave 'lab escape' for the discussion, because putting that in the public domain as a hypothesis in my view will be read as 'see, they also thought so'.""

The leaders of the medical establishment zoomed out significantly.

In March 2020, Fauci told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that COVID-19 was an animal virus that jumped to a human.

Fauci told National Geographic in May 2020 that notwithstanding the concerns privately expressed by other virologists, there was ""no scientific evidence"" to suggest the virus had come from the Wuhan lab.

Last month, ProPublica in partnership with Vanity Fair published a bombshell report indicating that the origin of COVID-19 was in fact the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

Senate Republicans similarly released a report in October indicating that it was human meddling, not some evolutionary mishap, that was responsible for the pandemic and the loss of over 1 million American lives.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unredacted-correspondence-fauci-scientists-covid-lab-origin,2022-11-23
"Unvaccinated people might not be who the media tell you they are, new data reportedly shows","In the face of missed vaccination targets and a rise in COVID-19 infections, the Biden administration and its mainstream media counterparts have selected their scapegoat for the continuation of the pandemic — vaccine-refusing Republicans.

""Joe Biden is done coddling conservatives and their anti-vaccine bulls**t,"" the headline of a recent Vanity Fair article blared.

That article had riffed off a report from Politico that stated: ""The Biden administration is casting conservative opponents of its COVID-19 vaccine campaign as dangerous and extreme, adopting a more aggressive political posture in an attempt to maneuver through the public health conundrum.""

Still another report from the Intelligencer stated, ""The willfully unvaccinated are the newest Republican martyrs.""

Just a brief survey of the media landscape surfaces countless more articles and soundbites making essentially the same claim: Conservatives are the ones refusing the vaccine and subsequently prolonging the nation's recovery from the virus.

But is that actually the case? According to new data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, it appears no, at least not entirely. The health policy think tank published studies on COVID-19 vaccinations by race, ethnicity, and age recently that seemed to suggest that traditionally Democratic groups — blacks, Hispanics, and young people — are the ones not getting vaccinated.

In a study published this week, KFF reported, ""The percent of White people who have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose (48%) was roughly 1.3 times higher than the rate for Black people (36%) and 1.2 times higher than the rate for Hispanic people (41%) as of July 19, 2021.""

In a separate study published late last month, KFF noted that younger adults, those age 18-29, were among the least vaccinated subgroups with just 55% reportedly receiving at least one dose.

Part of the reason for some confusion and exaggeration of the political vaccination divide could be that the Republican states with lowest vaccination rates — such as Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia — also happen to be states with large minority populations.

In its coverage of the news, Issues & Insights noted that findings from a Monmouth poll last month further suggested that ""Republicans are not entirely, or even mostly, to blame for low vaccine rates.""



According to that poll, 70% of whites said they had received at least one dose of the vaccine while only 59% of those in minority groups said they had.

Additionally, though Republicans were far less likely to have received the vaccine than Democrats, more Republicans (60%) than Independents (59%) had in fact already received the first dose. Similarly, slightly fewer Republicans (26%) than Independents (27%) stated that they ""likely will never get"" the vaccine.

Interestingly, Issues & Insights went on to note that ""it's leftists who are the most influential anti-vaxxers on the planet"":

The ""dirty dozen"" of anti-COVID vaccine influencers compiled by one research group is made up of people such as: a Nation of Islam member, a regular columnist at the left-wing Huffington Post, the head of the Urban Global Health Alliance, a ""holistic psychiatrist,"" a former owner of an organic farm, several alternative medicine quacks, and long-time anti-vaxxers including ... Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

""Not exactly a bunch of right-wing Trump supporters,"" the outlet quipped. ""In fact, some in this 'dirty dozen' have targeted the black community with anti-vax messages.""

Yet instead of targeting vaccine-hesitant minority communities in addition to vaccine-hesitant Republicans, the left is determined to take the more politically expedient route and attack conservatives alone.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unvaccinated-not-who-media-says-they-are,2021-07-23
'Your life will be over': Teammate of Lia Thomas says UPenn officials warned women's team of consequences for complaints about trans swimmer's presence,"A teammate of controversial transgender swimmer Lia Thomas said University of Pennsylvania officials warned women swimmers they'd face consequences for speaking out against the presence of Thomas — a biological male who identifies as female — on the women's swim team.

“They’ve made it pretty clear if you speak up about it, your life will be over in some way, you’ll be blasted all over the Internet as a transphobe … you’ll never be able to get a job,” the teammate told Matt Walsh as part of his just-released ""What Is a Woman?"" documentary, according to the Daily Wire.

What are the details?

The Penn swimmer asked to have her identity shielded for the interview over fear of retribution, the outlet reported, and she told Walsh there were ""a lot of things we couldn’t talk about.""

While the swimmer said though Thomas' dominating performance helped the team and the university, winning began to feel ""tainted.""

And of course there was the ""locker room situation"" — presumably the awkwardness stemming from Thomas changing in front of female swimmers. Yet it was clear, the swimmer said, that “if you even brought up concerns about it, you were transphobic.""

The swimmer added that ""if you even bring up the fact that Lia’s swimming might not be fair, you’re immediately shut down"" and ""called a 'hateful person' or 'transphobic.'""

After Walsh asked if any heart-to-heart conversations took place as a team or with a coach about the presence of Thomas, the anonymous swimmer replied that “Penn actually brought in people high up in the athletic department to talk to us — like brought in someone from the LGBTQ center, they brought in someone from psychological services.""

Walsh was shocked: “So, you’re upset about what's happening, and so you need psychological help?”

The swimmer replied affirmatively and added that the higher ups said, “Lia’s swimming is a non-negotiable; however, we can help you make that OK. That's what we're here for.""

The University of Pennsylvania on Thursday didn't immediately respond to TheBlaze's request for comment regarding the anonymous swimmer's claims.

UPenn swimmers write open letter calling for Ivy League to embrace USA Swimming's new transgender policy,"Athletes on the University of Pennsylvania women's swimming and diving team have put out an open letter to UPenn and the Ivy League asking them to follow the new transgender guidelines issued by USA Swimming and to refrain from taking legal action against the NCAA.

Sixteen athletes, led by three-time Olympic gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar, published the open letter Thursday morning asking the school and the Ivy League ""to support us as biological women."" According to Swimming World, the letter was written in response to a statement by several members of UPenn's swim team in support of Lia Thomas, a male who identifies as female.

Hogshead-Makar, a civil rights lawyer and CEO of Champion Women, is an advocate for women's rights and has fought for equal opportunity for women in sports. She has criticized policies pushing for the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports, noting that biological men have unfair advantages when competing against women.

The letter praised new ""Athlete Inclusion Procedures"" released by USA Swimming on Tuesday, guidelines for including transgender athletes in women's sports that acknowledge the ""competitive difference in the male and female categories and the disadvantages this presents in elite head-to-head competition.""

“Tuesday, USA Swimming released new ‘Athlete Inclusion Procedures’ shortly after the NCAA acknowledged that each sport should determine how fairness and inclusion were to be accomplished,” the letter states. “In particular, we appreciate USAS Guideline’s guiding purpose, to ensure that transgender women competing in the Female competition category 'do not have an unfair advantage over their cisgender Female competitors in Elite Events.'""

“We fully support Lia Thomas in her decision to affirm her gender identity and to transition from a man to a woman. Lia has every right to live her life authentically,"" the letter continues.

“However, we also recognize that when it comes to sports competition, the biology of sex is a separate issue from someone’s gender identity.”

The swim team members write that as a biological male, Thomas has an ""unfair advantage"" over female competitors and that some women have missed opportunities as a result.

“The Penn Women’s Swimming Team has over 40 women, but only 18 of us are chosen to compete in the end-of-year culmination of our work: the Ivy Championships,” they write.

“Most important to us is that Lia’s inclusion with unfair biological advantages means that we have lost competitive opportunities. Some of us have lost records. But even those that swim different events than Lia or were not in contention to make the Ivy Championships, we stand by our teammates who have lost out.

“It has often felt like Penn, our school, our league, and the NCAA did not support us.”

The letter says these athletes have been threatened with losing job offers or getting kicked off the team for speaking out.

""When media have tried to reach out to us, these journalists have been told that the coaches and athletes were prohibited from talking to them,"" the letter states. ""We support Lia’s mental health, and we ask Penn and the Ivy League to support ours as well.""

The women emphasized that Thomas is welcome to train with them and that they want to find a place for transgender athletes to compete against others fairly.

""However, sport is competitive by definition, and Lia’s wins, records, and honors should not come at our expense, the women who have worked their entire lives to earn a spot on the Penn Women’s Swimming Team,"" they write.

The debate over how to include transgender athletes in sports at both the high school and collegiate levels has ignited national controversy. Some states have taken action to prohibit gender dysphoric males from competing against women with ""Fairness in Women's Sports"" bills. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) has been credited with proposing the strongest version of this legislation, which would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex.

Advocates for LGBT Americans say it is unfair and discriminatory to prohibit student athletes from expressing themselves by competing on the teams with which they identify.

But female athletes have pushed back, arguing that men have natural advantages that make them stronger and faster than women, advantages that do not go away with hormone therapy or because a male identifies as female.

For example, Ainsley Erzen, a high school athlete who won the girls' 800-meter high school national championship in track, wrote in a recent op-ed that her record-breaking accomplishments for women would be a poor performance for a male athlete. Ainsley Erzen is the daughter of BlazeTV editor Todd Erzen of the ""Steve Deace Show.""

""My time of 2:06.52, the time that made me the fastest Iowa high school female 800 runner of all time, the time that earned me the title of national champion, was easily beat by 85 high school boys at the 2021 Iowa high school state track meet alone. Eighty-five. Just in our small state of Iowa.,"" Erzen wrote for the Des Moines Register.

""The results of the 2021 Drake Relays proved to be no different, as the last male runner came through the line in a time of 2:03. That same year, a time of 2:13 was enough to make me the 800-meter Drake champion. The slowest boy was easily 10 seconds faster than the first-place girl.""

Erzen goes on to argue that the different standards set for male and female competitions are all the evidence needed to show that biological differences matter and that women need to be protected from unfair competition.

For the members of the UPenn swim team who wrote the letter, the proof is in Lia Thomas' dominant performance against female competitors.



The new USA Swimming transgender policy requires athletes to provide evidence ""that the prior physical development of the athlete as a male, as mitigated by any medical intervention, does not give the athlete a competitive advantage over the athlete’s cisgender female competitors.""

Transgender competitors must also show evidence ""that the concentration of testosterone in the athlete’s serum has been less than 5 nmol/L (as measured by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) continuously for a period of at least thirty-six (36) months before the date of application.""

The policy is only applicable to athlete members of USA Swimming.

It was implemented after the NCAA announced last month that the governing bodies of each sport would be given the authority to determine athlete eligibility, including polices on the inclusion of transgender athletes.

"US Army may nix gender-neutral fitness tests as women overwhelmingly fail, says biological differences matter","The Pentagon may reverse the U.S. Army's new ""gender-neutral"" physical fitness test for its male and female soldiers because more than half of female soldiers are failing the test.

What are the details?

According to a Saturday report from the Telegraph, the Army is ""considering a reversal of its new gender-neutral physical test to instead include different evaluation categories for men and women.""

A study from the Pentagon noted that at least 65% of female soldiers were failing the military's Army Combat Fitness Test. At least 90% of male soldiers passed the test.

In response to the study, Congress has halted implementation of the new test, and the military is looking into whether the test is actually fair.

""In the ACFT there are six events — the maximum deadlift, a standing power throw, hand-release pushups, a spring, drag and carry, leg tuck, and a two-mile run,"" the Telegraph noted. ""To pass the test those taking it must score at least 360 points out of a possible 600, and those who achieve higher scores are more likely to be promoted.""

Average women's scores, according to the outlet, are approximately 100 points lower than men's.

What else?

An unnamed Army official told Military.com that it is imperative to ""figure out a way to make it fair to both genders.""

""We are not going to artificially inflate the raw score for women, but we have to figure out a way to make it fair to both genders,"" the officer explained. ""We need a fair way that accounts for physiological differences. If anything, it's a more gender-neutral assessment process because it doesn't show the raw scores.""

Military.com reported, ""The proposed solution involves the creation of 'gender-specific' percentile bands broken into levels such as Top 1%, Top 10%, Top 25%, and Top 50%, according to an Army briefing slide circulating on social media.""

""All they are going to see for evaluation is which percentile the soldier falls into,"" the official said. ""The gender identity will not be included in that information.""

In February, U.S. Army Captain Kristen Griest, the Army's first female infantry officer, said that the gender-neutral test ""should be scored the same for men and women.""

""The entire purpose of creating a gender-neutral test was to acknowledge the reality that each job has objective physical standards to which all soldiers should be held, regardless of gender,"" she said at the time. ""The intent was not to ensure that women and men will have an equal likelihood of meeting those standards. Rather, it is incumbent upon women who volunteer for the combat arms profession to ensure they are fully capable and qualified for it. To not require women to meet equal standards in combat arms will not only undermine their credibility, but also place those women, their teammates, and the mission at risk.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-army-may-nix-gender-neutral-tests,2021-03-15
Division of US military branch that faces down China orders end of gender pronouns; leaders claim move will improve fighting force's 'lethality',"A division of the U.S. Pacific Air Forces, which faces down China, ordered the end of gender pronouns in written formats, insisting the move to more neutral language will improve the force's ""lethality,"" the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What are the details?

""In accordance with the Diverse PACAF priority, ‘We must embrace, promote and unleash the potential of diversity and inclusion,"" reads a partial copy of a May email to senior leaders and commanders at the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, which is part of the Pacific Air Forces. The Free Beacon said it obtained the email.

Base leaders were ordered to not use ""pronouns, age, race, etc."" in written performance reviews or other materials, such as recommendations for awards, the outlet said, adding that the directive also said ""welcoming and employing varied perspectives from a foundation of mutual respect will improve our interoperability, efficiency, creativity, and lethality.""

""Unauthorized"" words and phrases include ""He/She did"" and ""Best male/female,"" the Free Beacon said.

What did military officials have to say?

A base spokesman confirmed the email's authenticity, the outlet said, adding that the ban on ""pronouns, age, race"" is ""intended to eliminate any information that could identify the nominee's name, gender, age, or race so that all members had a fair and equal chance at winning.""



The policy shift appears in line with the Pacific Air Forces’ goal to promote ""diversity and inclusion"" at all levels, the spokesman added to the Free Beacon.

""Unleashing the potential of diversity and inclusion at all levels is a Pacific Air Forces' priority and something we strive for at Andersen,"" the spokesman told the outlet. ""Diversity and inclusion are force multipliers and warfighting imperatives that enable our competitive advantage against near-peer adversaries.""

'Giant sucking waste of time'

Rebeccah Heinrichs — a defense policy expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank — called the whole thing ""a giant sucking waste of time,"" the Free Beacon reported.

""It is painful to think about the amount of time servicemen have already spent writing these rules instead of figuring out how to beat China,"" Henrichs said, according to the outlet.

"US military bracing for Iranian attack as anniversary of Soleimani's death approaches, officials say","The United States military suspects that an Iranian-linked attack on American personnel and interests in Iraq could be immanent as the one-year anniversary of Iranian terrorist leader Qassem Soleimani's death approaches.

On Jan. 2, 2020, the U.S. launched a drone strike on an envoy near the Baghdad airport that killed the renowned Iranian military leader along with Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

What are the details?

Defense officials reportedly expressed their suspicions of a retaliatory attack on Wednesday as two B-52 bombers finished a round-trip, 30-hour mission from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to the Middle East. The mission was part of an effort to demonstrate American military might in the region and deter any action by Iran.

""The United States continues to deploy combat-ready capabilities into the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to deter any potential adversary, and make clear that we are ready and able to respond to any aggression directed at Americans or our interests,"" said Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, chief of U.S. Central Command, according to the Washington Post.

""We do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack,"" he added.

Another defense official speaking anonymously told the Post that ""the threat streams are very real"" and that a ""fair amount of advanced conventional weaponry"" has flowed over the border from Iran into Iraq in recent weeks.

Last week, McKenzie similarly indicated to ABC News that U.S. forces remained ""in a period of heightened risk,"" but emphasized that the military is ""not looking for war with Iran.""

Those comments came as the U.S. Navy acknowledged that it sent a submarine into the Persian Gulf, ""a move widely seen as sending a message to Iran,"" the outlet reported.

What else?

Soleimani's death was a major blow to the terror-sponsoring Iranian regime as he was the leader of the elite Quds Force, a special wing of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. For years, he had coordinated attacks on U.S. forces and assets in the Middle East.

Given how high profile a leader he was, a retaliatory attack near the anniversary of his death is certainly a possibility, especially as tensions rise in the region.

Last week, unknown attackers launched more than 20 rockets on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, killing at least one Iraqi civilian, though no Americans were hurt.

"US Navy discharge policy for unvaccinated, training costs","The United States Navy announced new details about its COVID-19 vaccine mandate that goes into effect next month. The Navy noted that a newly created panel that will oversee the administrative discharge process for unvaccinated sailors could recoup the cost of training and education for service members who refuse to get the coronavirus vaccine.

All active-duty sailors are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Nov. 28. Service members in the selected reserve must be fully vaccinated by Dec. 28. Technically, sailors must have both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine or the one dose of the Johnson & Johnson by Nov. 14 so they can complete the 14-day waiting period to achieve full vaccination status by Nov. 28.

Those who refuse to get the vaccine by the deadline and do not have a medical or religious exemption will be discharged. Those service members will receive no lower than a general discharge under honorable conditions, which could result in the loss of some veterans' benefits.

To oversee the administrative discharge process for unvaccinated sailors, the Navy recently established the COVID Consolidated Disposition Authority. The CCDA has the authority to punish unvaccinated sailors by recouping the cost of training, education, and more.

""The CCDA may also seek recoupment of applicable bonuses, special and incentive pays, and the cost of training and education for service members refusing the vaccine,"" the U.S. Navy stated in a press release.

""For Navy service members refusing the vaccine, the CCDA also retains the authority for administrative processes regarding removal of warfare qualifications, additional qualification designations (AQD), Navy Enlisted Classifications (NEC), or sub-specialties, except in cases where removal authority is otherwise authorized by law or Executive Order,"" the Navy said.

Adm. William Lescher, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, said the CCDA would ""ensure a fair and consistent process"" for the discharge of unvaccinated sailors.

As of Wednesday, 94% of active-duty sailors are fully vaccinated and 99% have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the U.S. Navy. For reserve sailors, 72% are fully immunized against COVID-19 and 78% received at least one dose.

The Washington Post reported that 76.5% of active-duty Marine Corps personnel are vaccinated, and a mere 38% of Marine Corps Reserve personnel are vaccinated. There are reportedly 60,000 Air Force service members who are not fully vaccinated ahead of the branch's Nov. 2 deadline. Only about 40% of the Army Reserve and National Guard are vaccinated, but they have a vaccination deadline of June 30, 2022.

According to Navy data released on Oct. 13, there have been a total of 163 COVID-19 deaths within the branch, of which 102 were civilian employee deaths.

The U.S. Navy has 347,487 active duty personnel, 96,710 reserve personnel, and 281,161 civilian employees as of July 2021.

""Tragically, there have been 164 deaths within the Navy family due to COVID-19, far exceeding the combined total of all other health or mishap related injuries and deaths over the same time period,"" Vice Adm. John B. Nowell, Jr., the Chief of Naval Personnel, said on Oct. 14.

The Navy noted that of the 164 Navy COVID-19 deaths, 144 were not vaccinated. The vaccination status of the remaining 20 deaths remains unknown.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-navy-vaccine-mandate-discharge,2021-10-16
"US Senate predicted to approve Finland and Sweden’s request to join NATO – Sen. Hawley says ‘I intend to vote no,’ receives backlash from Sen. Cruz and Sen. Rubio","The U.S. Senate voted today on a resolution to ratify Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO. The request has largely received bi-partisan support and was expected to pass through the Senate easily.



Finland and Sweden requested to join following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Putin reportedly stated that the two countries could ""join whatever they want."" However, Putin also warned that ""if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there, [Russia] would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats for those territories where threats have arisen for [them.]""

After applying for membership, the Nordic countries were met with resistance from Turkey, which alleged that Finland and Sweden supported groups Turkey had designated as terrorists. Since then, the three countries came to an agreement and signed an accord to allow the application to move forward.

Referring to today's vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stated, ""The NATO vote is a very important vote for American security around the world. Finland's and Sweden's membership will strengthen NATO even further, and is all the more urgent given Russian aggression.""



While most senators have voiced support for the two countries joining NATO, Senator Josh Hawley recently wrote an op-ed explaining why he would not be voting for the ratification. Hawley explained that if the vote passed, ""According to the terms of NATO's founding treaty, that means the United States would be obliged to defend both countries in the event of a military attack. I intend to vote no.""

Hawley expressed concern that America is not in a position to commit to protecting another country. He wrote, ""When it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe.""

The Missouri senator mentioned that European countries are not paying their fair share regarding defense responsibilities. He called on them to invest more in national defense to alleviate costs for the United States. ""All the way back in 2006, NATO member states pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on national defense. It should be higher. The United States spends far more than that on defense. But many NATO members still haven't met even this minimal commitment,"" Hawley noted.

In an interview with Politico, Senator Ted Cruz disagreed with Hawley's points. Cruz argued, ""We don't beat China by retreating from the rest of the world. We beat China by standing with our allies against our enemies.""

Yesterday, Senator Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed in reply to Hawley's. In it, Rubio claimed, ""NATO would be stronger with Finland and Sweden. And while President Joe Biden's record is proof that weakness invites aggression and breeds chaos, the converse is also true. As Ronald Reagan would say, peace comes through strength.""

Rubio argued that by adding Finland and Sweden to NATO, America would have more resources to defend itself against the People's Republic of China.

On July 5, all 30 NATO members signed an accession protocol, granting Sweden and Finland the ability to join the alliance. Since the accession was signed, the two Nordic countries have been allowed to participate in some meetings.

However, the decision must first be ratified by all 30 parliaments before the two countries can become official members. The ratification process could take up to a year, at which point, the defense clause will protect them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-senate-predicted-to-approve-finland-and-sweden-s-request-to-join-nato-sen-hawley-says-i-intend-to-vote-no-receives-backlash-from-sen-cruz-and-sen-rubio,2022-08-03
US women's soccer — in search of 'equal pay' with men for years — says offer to get same contract proposals as men akin to 'PR stunts',"On the hunt for ""equal pay"" with men for years, the organization that represents American women soccer players said the U.S. Soccer Federation's offer to make female players' contract proposals identical to male players' contract proposals is akin to ""PR stunts.""

""USSF's PR stunts and bargaining through the media will not bring us any closer to a fair agreement,"" the United States Women's National Team Players Association tweeted Wednesday in reaction to the offer. ""In contrast, we are committed to bargaining in good faith to achieve equal pay and the safest working conditions possible. The proposal that USSF made recently to us does neither.""

While the women's national team has been winning quite a bit more than the American men's team over the last several years, it's argued that female players don't earn as much as male players — and should. However, actual numbers aren't crystal clear, particularly due to how multiple revenue streams are deployed and differences in compensation structures (e.g., the women receive salaries while the men don't).

How did U.S. Soccer respond?

U.S. Soccer fired back at the women's players' association on Twitter: ""An offer on paper of identical contracts to the USWNT and USMNT, and to discuss equalizing prize money, is real, authentic, and in good faith. A publicity stunt is a 90-minute one-sided movie.""

What did star player Alex Morgan have to say?

U.S. women's forward Alex Morgan said her fellow players were cautiously optimistic, ESPN reported.

""We still need to chat about the statement given by U.S. Soccer. But any commitment to equal pay publicly is good,"" Morgan said Wednesday, the outlet noted. ""However, we need to look line by line at what they're actually providing, because if you have equal but it's not even what we got before, or to the value that we are, then we still consider that to be not good enough.""

Morgan added, ""We don't want to start the new year without a new CBA in effect, so that's the number one priority of our PA, of our legal team. Looking at the [USSF] statements, it's difficult to say, we want to feel encouraged and we want to be optimistic, but we have seen a lot of statements before. What we really want to do is see what we can do at the negotiation table, see those statements be put into action in those negotiations. So of course we're always hopeful. Under the new proposal put forward by the USSF, it said it also wouldn't agree to a CBA with either team that didn't take the important step of equalizing FIFA World Cup prize money.""

ESPN reported in a separate story that FIFA offered $30 million in prize money to the 2019 Women's World Cup teams — while in the men's teams in 2018 got $400 million.

More from the outlet:

The USWNT sued U.S. soccer's governing body in 2019 over allegations of gender discrimination in compensation and nearly every other aspect of its playing conditions.



Months later, the team won a fourth World Cup as fans during the final chanted, ""Equal pay.""



The lawsuit, which sought $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act, was dismissed, but the USWNT has since appealed.



The USWNT's current labor agreement expires at the end of 2021, while the men's team has been operating under the terms of a deal that expired in 2018.

Anything else?

In 2019, Carlos Cordeiro — then-president of U.S Soccer — responded to the equal pay lawsuit by saying USSF paid the women players more over the course of a decade even though the team has lost millions of dollars overall.

In 2020, U.S. Soccer apologized for arguing in court that women players aren't as skilled and athletic as their male counterparts.

The U.S. women's soccer team suffered embarrassing defeats at the Tokyo Olympics earlier this summer and failed to win an expected gold medal. In fact, many Americans rooted against the team over its propensity for anti-American kneeling protests prior to games.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-womens-soccer-same-contract-as-men,2021-09-16
"USA Swimming official takes stand, resigns job in protest over transgender swimmer: 'Boys are built differently than girls'","An official for USA Swimming resigned from her job of over 30 years this month over what she believes is the unfair development of permitting transgender female swimmers to compete against biologically female swimmers.

What is the background?

University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer Lia Thomas — a biological male now competing as a female — has generated controversy for demolishing her competition, which are biologically female swimmers.

Swimmers on the University of Pennsylvania's female swimming team, along with parents, have voiced frustrations over what they believe are unfair circumstances.

Under NCAA rules, transgender athletes must complete one year of testosterone-suppression treatment before being able to compete as a transgender male athlete, which Thomas has completed. But Thomas still has a clear physiological advantage over the competition. Additionally, Thomas is a talented swimmer who earned the honor of being named a second-team All-Ivy League athlete while competing as a male during the 2018-2019 season.

What did the USA Swimming official say?

Cynthia Millen officiated for USA Swimming for more than 30 years. But, according to the Washington Times, she ""hung up her whistle last week in protest"" of Thomas.

Millen said she notified the governing body on Dec. 17 of her resignation as she was packing to officiate the U.S. Paralympics Swimming National Championships in Greensboro, North Carolina. Millen then withdrew from working the event.

In a letter, Millen told USA Swimming the fairness of competitive swimming ""is being destroyed"" by swimmers like Thomas.

""I told my fellow officials that I can no longer participate in a sport which allows biological men to compete against women. Everything fair about swimming is being destroyed,"" Millen wrote.

In fact, Millen said that if she were officiating an event that included Thomas, she would have declared Thomas ineligible to compete against biological women.

""If Lia came on my deck as a referee, I would pull the coach aside and say, ‘Lia can swim, but Lia can swim exhibition or a time trial. Lia cannot compete against those women because that’s not fair,"" Millen said.

The career swimming official explained that physiological differences between men and women are exposed in the swimming pool, such that the world's best female swimmers — like Olympic champion Katie Ledecky — cannot compete against elite male swimmers.

""Boys are built differently than girls. I mean, we know that: Boys have the T-shape, the broad shoulders, the narrow hips,"" Millen said. ""Girls have the hips, they’ve got more drag, they’ve got boobs, they’ve got body fat.""



""Yes, a Katie Ledecky can beat a lot of guys, but in the end, the [best] guys are going to beat Katie Ledecky. Absolutely. The differential is 8-12% faster. Equally trained, they will always win,"" Millen explained.

Anything else?

Millen told the Washington Times that other swimming officials agree with her, but fear retaliation if they speak out.

""I’ve talked to some other officials, and while they say yeah, this is ridiculous, I think a lot of people feel like they can’t do anything about it,"" Millen said. ""But you’ve got to make a stand sometimes. If enough people walk off the deck, or if enough referees say no, it will change. It’s wrong.""

Speaking about USA Swimming, Millen said, ""I haven’t heard anything. I think they are so worried themselves. They get a lot of sponsorship money from a lot of big companies, and I think they’re worried. They don’t want to appear that they’re not being inclusive, but this is not being inclusive. This is being deceitful.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/usa-swimming-official-resigns-transgender-swimmer,2021-12-26
"Republican Utah governor vetoes bill banning transgender athletes, but lawmakers have enough votes to override","The Republican governor of Utah vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature banning transgender athletes after citing the financial impact and limited application of the bill.

Supporters of the legislation say that they have enough votes to override the governor's veto.

Gov. Spencer Cox wrote in a letter to top legislators Tuesday that they failed “to understand the financial impacts that will be forced upon the Utah High School Athletic Association (UHSAA) and local Utah school districts that will inevitably get sued under this bill.”

Cox also criticized lawmakers for changing the bill from a proposal that would create a commission to decided inclusion of transgender athletes on a case-by-case basis.

Finally, he argued that the bill would only apply to less than a handful of cases in the state.

“Four kids and only one of them playing girls sports. That’s what all of this is about. Four kids who aren’t dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something,"" wrote Cox.

“Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few,"" he added.

The Utah House speaker and Senate president said that they want to pass the law in order to ensure that biological girls aren't edged out of sports, as some have suggested in other competitions.

Cox became the second Republican governor to veto such a bill in two days after Gov. Eric Holcomb did the same in Indiana on Monday. Holcomb argued that the legislation in his state was far too broad and that there was not a problem currently related to transgender athletes worth addressing.

Holcomb went on to say that protecting fairness in women's sports was ""a worthy cause for sure.""

Vaccine expert says young people shouldn't get covid booster,"A top vaccine expert is advising that healthy young people should not get the latest COVID-19 booster shot because ""there's not clear evidence of benefit.""

Paul Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a member of National Institutes of Health (NIH) working group on vaccines, and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Previously, Offit was a member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Offit is also one of the few vaccine experts voicing caution regarding the new COVID boosters.

On Aug. 31, the FDA granted emergency use authorizations (EUAs) of COVID-19 boosters from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. The bivalent version of the previous vaccines are for use as a single booster dose at least two months following primary or booster vaccination. Moderna's mRNA booster shots are approved by the FDA for individuals 18 years of age or older, and the Pfizer-BioNTech version is authorized for those 12 or older.

However, Offit is advising healthy young people to skip the new booster shot.

During an appearance on CNN earlier this month, Offit said that those over 65, the immuno-compromised, and anyone with serious chronic health ailments could benefit from the boosters.

He was concerned that government health agencies were going to try to oversell the booster to everyone.

""What I fear is that they're going to say everybody should get it when in fact, the healthy young person really is unlikely to benefit from the booster dose, and so I hope they targeted more specifically, to those really who are most likely to benefit from this additional dose,"" he said during the CNN interview.

The CNN anchor was perplexed that the health official didn't recommend everyone get the new jab.

She asked the vaccine expert, ""Why not get it? Right? If it does give you even if it's a smaller benefit, is there any reason not to get the booster?""

Offit replied, ""I think that when you're asking people to get a vaccine, I think there has to be clear evidence of benefit, and we're not going to have clinical studies before this launches.""

Moderna has begun human trials on the booster shots, and Pfizer is expected to begin theirs this month. Experts believe that trials likely wouldn't be completed until the spring.

""But you'd like to have at least human data people you know, getting this vaccine, you see a clear and dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies, and then at least you have a correlate of protection against BA.4 and BA.5,"" he continued.

""You're asking people to get a new product for which there's no data,"" Offit also told CNN. ""Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.""

The booster shot was authorized by the FDA despite not having been tested on humans. Pfizer's preliminary findings were based on tests on eight mice. The FDA based the EUA authorization on the testing of mice, data from current COVID-19 vaccines, and earlier iterations of boosters.

""Because if you don't have that, if there's not clear evidence of benefit, then it's not fair I think to ask people to take a risk no matter how small,"" Offit declared. ""The benefit should be clear.""

On Sept. 21, Offit wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled: ""CDC Oversells the ‘Bivalent’ Covid Shot.""

""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone over 12 receive a 'bivalent' COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose,"" he wrote. ""But only a select group are likely to benefit, and the evidence to date doesn’t support the view that a bivalent vaccine containing omicron or its subvariants is better than the monovalent vaccine. The CDC risks eroding the public’s trust by overselling the new shot.""

Americans are not rushing to get the latest booster shot.



According to CDC data released on Thursday, an estimated 4.4 million Americans received the new booster. That figure represents approximately 1.5% of people in the U.S. who are eligible to receive the injection.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/vaccine-expert-covid-booster-young,2022-09-26
"VIDEO: Cop plays Beatles' 'Yesterday' while cellphone camera records him, presumably to trigger copyright claim so clip is blocked","Some Beverly Hills cops are getting back at a left-wing activist who takes videos of them — with a good bit of wit attached to it.

What happened?

Vice News reported that Los Angeles-area activist Sennett Devermont recorded cellphone video as he was trying to talk to uniformed Beverly Hills police officers on a sidewalk last month — but the chatter was interrupted by a familiar sound.

It was coming from Officer Julian Reyes' cellphone he was holding aloft. It was an acoustic guitar, and a man singing: ""Yesterday / all my troubles seemed so far away / now it looks as though they're here to stay / oh, I believe in yesterday.""

Yup, it was Paul McCartney singing the Beatles' classic ""Yesterday"" — arguably one of the most popular songs ever, as it was performed over 7 million times just in the 20th century — and recorded more than 1,600 times.

As you can probably guess, the Beatles rightfully are quite protective of unauthorized uses of their songs, and when they show up in videos, those clips are typically blocked.



According to Devermont, the tactic worked. He noted in his Instagram post of the interaction with police that ""it seems they think playing copyrighted and licensed music will keep the word from getting out. And turns out.. they are right! I sent this video to multiple news agencies who covered the story. Most said they can't share it... why??? Because it's playing Beatles music.""

Vice News said songs like ""Yesterday"" showing up in Instagram videos can trigger the platform's algorithmic copyright filters which can result in videos being taken down — and suspension of live streamers' accounts for repeated infractions.

A sublime idea

When the latter video began, Vice News said Devermont was talking to Sgt. Billy Fair, who used his cellphone to play ""Santeria"" by '90s band Sublime when Devermont was trying to talk to him in a separate video — and Devermont was quite frustrated:

More from Vice News:

This strategy isn't entirely surprising. Nick Simmons and Adam Holland, researchers at Lumen Database, which studies copyright takedowns on social media, noted last year that music in videos filmed at Black Lives Matter protests had repeatedly resulted in them being removed from social media sites on copyright grounds. They theorized that, while these removals seemed incidental, that copyright could be weaponized by police.



""Law enforcement, or indeed anyone of any ideological persuasion who was seeking to prevent videos of a particular event from being shared online, need only make sure that copyrighted audio is present with sufficiently recognizable clarity and volume in the background of a protest or other event,"" they wrote. ""A chilling prospect indeed.""



Now, we're seeing it actually happen.

What did Beverly Hills police have to say?

Beverly Hills police told Vice News in a statement that ""the playing of music while accepting a complaint or answering questions is not a procedure that has been recommended by Beverly Hills Police command staff"" — and that the videos of Fair were ""currently under review.""

To mark this sobering development, here's a live version of McCartney playing the melancholy ""Yesterday"" in 1965 when it was brand new:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-cop-plays-beatles-music-copyright-claims,2021-02-15
Video: Ohio Democrats go into full meltdown mode when female GOP rep proposes amendment to protect women’s sports,"Unhinged Ohio Democrats erupted with anger last week while Ohio Rep. Jena Powell (R) proposed an amendment that would protect the integrity of women's sports.



Powell proposed the ""Save Women's Sports Act"" in 2020 and was seeking to present an amendment to the state's ""Name, Image, Likeness"" bill that would prevent biological males from competing against biological females in women's-only sports when several Democrats began rudely shouting and banging on their desks in order to drown out her remarks.

In her 2020 proposal, Powell said, ""The Save Women's Sports Act is a fairness issue for women. This bill ensures that every little girl who works hard to make it on a podium is not robbed of her chance by a biological male competing against her in a biological female sport. We want every little girl to achieve her athletic dream here in the state of Ohio.""

What are the details?

Powell began, ""The Save Women's Sports Act is a fairness issue for women to be able to achieve their dreams in athletics in our state, and it's crucial to preserving women's rights and the integrity of women's and girls' sports. Across our country, female athletes are currently losing scholarships, opportunities, medals, education, and training opportunities.""

At those remarks, several Democrats began pounding on their desks and yelling, but Powell was intent on continuing.

""This amendment will require schools that are part of the OHSAA to designate separate teams for participants of biological sex,"" Powell continued. ""No school interscholastic conference or organization that regulates interscholastics shall permit biological males to participate on athletic teams or an athletic competition designated only for biological female participants.""

All throughout the rest of her remarks, Democrats screamed ""Unfair!"" and ""Boo!"" and tried to entirely drown out what she had to say.

She calmly insisted, ""It is crucial to preserving the integrity of women's rights and women's and girl's sports.""

According to Fox News, the amendment passed 54-40.

""GOP Rep. Jena Powell had proposed the addition to a bill that would allow college athletes to make money off their name, image, and likeness in the state,"" the outlet reported. ""The bill itself passed the Ohio House 57-36, and will now be sent back to the Senate to vote on the amended legislation.""

What else?



Powell told ""Washington Watch with Tony Perkins"" that she believed the reaction to her remarks was so intense because Democrats are largely ""frustrated.""

""I can't explain always why the left doesn't like some of the things that we do, but this is a simple bill, an amendment to say, 'Hey, we want to protect the integrity of women's sports in the state of Ohio,'"" she said. ""I think the left is frustrated and oftentimes they speak out in ways that are very inappropriate. When I had the House floor, the Speaker did address me, which means I have the ability to speak. Instead of waiting for his turn to speak, he decided to erupt into yelling, and as you heard in the clip, just literally banging on top of his desk. I don't even think any of the members could hear my speech; that's how loud it really was.""

Creator of popular 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video games announces retirement after woke mob goes after him for donating to Republicans,"The creator of a popular video game series announced his retirement this week after a woke cancel culture mob attacked him for several political donations he made to public officials viewed as hostile toward LGBT people.

Scott Cawthon, who made the hit indie horror game ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" and its sequels, announced on his website that he will be retiring from the series, handing it over to a different video game developer while he spends more time with his family.

""I've had a blessed, fulfilling, and rich career,"" Cawthon wrote. ""I've been shown great kindness and I've tried to show great kindness in return. I've tried to make some good games (let the debate ensue), and I've witnessed the creation of possibly the most creative and talented fanbase on the planet.""

""But here on the seventh anniversary of the first game's trailer, as I realize that I was in my mid-30s when I created the series and now I'm approaching my mid-40s, I realize that I miss a lot of things that I got to focus on before FNAF became such a success,"" he continued. ""I miss making games for my kids, I miss doing it just for fun, and I missing making rpgs even though I stink at it. All of this is to say that I am retiring. I have been shown tremendous love and support over this last week, a lot of which has come from the LGBTQ community. The kindness shown to me has been surreal.""

While Cawthon's statement doesn't mention the controversy over his political donations, last weekend he was harshly criticized on Reddit and Twitter for making several financial contributions to various politicians, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), former President Donald Trump, and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. All together, Cawthon made over $42,000 in campaign contributions to mostly Republican candidatesm and as a result he was accused of being racist and anti-LGBT.

On Saturday, before announcing his retirement, he directly addressed his critics in a Reddit post and refused to apologize for being a Christian, a Republican, and someone who has always treated all people fairly and equally no matter who they are.

To say that the last few days have been surreal would be an understatement. I've debated greatly how best to address this, including not addressing it at all, but with so many people from the LGBT community in the fanbase that I love, that's not an option. I'd like to think that the last seven years would have given me the benefit of the doubt in regards to how I try to treat people, but there I was, trending on twitter for being a homophobe, getting doxed, with people threatening to come to my house. My wife is six weeks pregnant and she spent last night in fear because of what was being said online. She has already been struggling with her pregnancy so seeing her so afraid really scared me. All this because I exercised my right, and my duty, as an American citizen, to vote for and support the candidates who I felt could best run the country, for everyone, and that's something that I won't apologize for.



For those who took the time to look, you saw that the candidates I supported included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats. I supported Kimberly Klacik in Baltimore because I believed that she really cared for the African American community there and wanted to pull them out of poverty. I believed she could have really make a difference in a time when so many black communities were struggling. She lost, unfortunately. I supported Tulsi Gabbard, a democrat, even though I disagreed with her on several issues, because I felt she would have been a good and fair president. And yes, I supported President Trump, because I felt he was the best man to fuel a strong economy and stand up to America's enemies abroad, of which there are many. Even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good. All of this explanation, I fear, is wasted, as people don't want to discuss with one another anymore; they want endless apologies and submission. People who are expecting those from me will get neither.

Cawthon said that if he gets canceled for his views, he would be at peace with it. ""I don't do this for the money anymore; I do it because I enjoy it,"" he wrote.

""If people think I'm doing more harm than good now, then maybe it's better that I get cancelled and retire. I would accept that. I've had a fulfilling career. Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value to begin with.""

In the post confirming his retirement, Cawthon explained that the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" series would be handed off to ""someone of my choosing, and someone that I trust.""

""I have SIX kids now (although one of them is currently the size of a blueberry.) I love them dearly; they are my whole world and my whole universe,"" he said. ""I want to focus my attention on them, focus on protecting them, and spend my time making things for them. I only ask that my fanbase respect my decision.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-game-creator-retirement-donations-to-republicans,2021-06-18
Nika Nikoubin confesses on video to stabbing Las Vegas man over Qasem Soleimani death,"A woman born in Iran is seen on video making a shocking confession of seducing a Nevada man and then stabbing him as revenge for the deadly U.S. drone strike on Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.

On March 5, Nika Nikoubin allegedly met a man on the dating site Plenty of Fish. The pair rented a room at the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino in Henderson, Nevada.

The couple allegedly began to engage in sexual activity. Police said Nikoubin put a blindfold on the victim, turned off the lights, and then stabbed him in the hotel room near Las Vegas.

The victim told the grand jury, ""She turned off the light and then afterwards I started to feel a pressure on my neck, and it got sharp, so I panicked and said, 'What the [expletive] are you doing?' I screamed. 'What the [expletive] are you doing?' And I shoved her off me, you know, still yelling like, 'What the [expletive] are you doing?' And then she says, 'Sorry,' and then she ran out of the room.""

Around 10:30 p.m., the man called the police. The victim reportedly suffered at least two puncture wounds from the attack.

Police said they found Nikoubin naked in a utility area on the 14th floor of the hotel. Law enforcement interviewed the 22-year-old, and she admitted to stabbing the man as retaliation for the lethal U.S. military strike on Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 3, 2020.

On Friday, KLAS-TV published the video of police interviewing Nikoubin.

Nikoubin told a police officer in the video, ""We were drinking a little bit and then — I guess we started to get into it and then I stabbed him.""

The officer asked, ""Did you plan on meeting [the victim] to hurt him?""

She replied, ""Yes.""

When questioned if she stabbed him to hurt him or kill him, Nikoubin replied, ""Hurt him.""

She confessed that she stabbed the man as revenge for the deadly drone strike on Soleimani.

She told the investigator that she stabbed him ""out of spite and revenge.""

""I mean the U.S. killed Soleimani. Lots of blood spilled,"" Nikoubin added. ""So, I feel like, it’s fair that American blood be spilled.”

Nikoubin – who was a UCLA student – said, ""Americans are cool, just I don’t think it was fair.""

""I just felt like somebody on American soil should die because he also died,"" she declared.

A Clark County grand jury indicted Nikoubin on charges of attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon because of certain, actual, or perceived characteristics of a person, and two counts of battery.

A doctor diagnosed Nikoubin with generalized anxiety order, major depressive disorder, and paranoid personality disorder.

The doctor wrote, ""According to clinical observation and client’s self-report, Nika’s paranoia may result in risky and unsafe behavior such as harm to self or others.""

A spokesperson for Nikoubin said she received mental health treatment and was on house arrest in Texas.

In April, a judge found Nikoubin competent to stand trial.

Nikoubin moved to the United States in 2012 with her family, according to her website promoting her music.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-iranian-nika-nikoubin-qasem-soleimani,2022-12-16
"Video: Middle schoolers chase down, physically attack baseball coach. He said they couldn't ride dirt bikes on campus — and 'the kids weren’t having that.'","Several middle school students were taken into custody after getting caught on video chasing down and physically attacking a high school baseball coach in Houston last week.

What are the details?

The beatdown occurred Thursday outside Langham Creek High School, KRIV-TV reported. Students at the high school told KPRC-TV the victim is a baseball coach who told the students they couldn’t ride dirt bikes on campus.

""I heard there were kids doing donuts and stuff, causing a ruckus with their dirt bikes,"" student Logan Wisniewski recalled to KRIV. ""The coach wasn’t happy with it. He asked them politely to stop doing that. The kids weren’t having that, so they decided to jump him.""

Sophomore Alena Gonzales noted to KPRC that ""later that day they got arrested, and their older friends threatened to shoot up our school.""

In the wake of the attack there was a report of at least one threatening social media post mentioning the possibility of a school shooting, KRIV said, adding that numerous parents stood in line outside the school Friday to pick up their children early.

""I was shocked,"" student Xavier Houston noted to KRIV. ""I kind of didn’t want to go to school today. I was really trying to see if I could go home.""

Langham Creek Principal Jose Martinez sent a letter to parents Friday identifying the suspects as ""several Aragon Middle School students,"" KRIV said, adding that high school officials worked with middle school administrators and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District police to identify the juvenile suspects and take them into custody.

Martinez added in the letter that the attack was ""extremely unacceptable and will be disciplined according to the CFISD Student Code of Conduct"" and that he and other officials put additional security measures into place following ""threats to our campus,"" KRIV noted.

What happened to the victim?

KRIV said a district spokesperson couldn’t reveal how the coach was doing, but individuals familiar with the incident said he’s OK and recovering.

How are folks reacting to the attack?

""I was surprised when I found out no one did anything,"" Houston told KRIV. ""Especially when I found out it was a bunch of middle schoolers.""

Parent Keisha Wisniewski added to KRIV that the suspects ""should be ashamed of themselves. They should be in jail. That’s horrible.""

"Video: Mob of thugs descend upon apparent Chicago bus driver, tackle him to street, repeatedly punch and stomp him","Video circulating on social media shows what appears to be a Chicago Transit Authority bus driver getting swarmed by a mob of thugs, tackled to the street, and repeatedly punched and stomped over the weekend in the popular downtown shopping area known as the Loop.

What are the details?

The clip shows the apparent driver standing outside a bus and facing one individual as a crowd gathers around them. One person is heard telling the driver he'd ""better get back on that bus!""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @Paulvallas

Suddenly the apparent driver seems to push with his left hand the individual facing him, and that individual appears to move away. Second later screams are heard and a fight breaks out.

The apparent driver has the upper hand at first, grabbing and pushing one male backward for a considerable distance.

At the end of the clip, a police officer appears and seems to be moving toward the attack.

Here's the clip:

What else do we know?

Chicago police said a 49-year-old CTA bus driver was traveling in the Loop around 9 p.m. Saturday when he heard a loud noise, WFLD-TV reported, after which the driver stopped the bus to inspect it.

While the driver was doing this, police told the station a male and female began to push the driver and then punched the driver multiple times before fleeing.

Police told WFLD the driver's face and body were bruised, and he was taken to a hospital in fair condition. The station's report does not include the video circulating on social media.

A 15-year-old male identified as a suspect in the attack was arrested in the 100 block of North Michigan Avenue and charged with one count of aggravated battery to a transit employee and disorderly conduct, police added to the station.

Fox News said police did not confirm that the video circulating on social media shows the attack on the 49-year-old bus driver. Police instead directed the cable news network to the ""initial narrative"" that two suspects were involved and added that the department ""[does] not have any additional information,"" Fox News noted.

While the report on the attack from WBBM-TV doesn't include the video circulating on social media, either, it does show what appears to be a bus driver holding a cloth or towel on the side of his face and walking into an ambulance — and the victim looks similar to the apparent driver the mob attacked in the cellphone video.

Anything else?

Police told WGN-TV at least 20 juveniles were taken into custody Saturday night amid violent chaos in the Loop that forced authorities to use crowd control measures. In addition to the attack on the bus driver, a 15-year-old was shot in the arm after bumping into a man, the station said.

The next day Mayor Lori Lightfoot was asked how she plans to curb violence in the Loop moving forward, WGN said.

“We are going to take significant, swift action to quell any issues,” Lightfoot replied, according to the station. “[Saturday night] there were a large number of children that were down at Millennium Park. We followed the protocols that we put in place from the summer of 2020. When it was time for them to leave the park, we made sure they left the park without incident.”

Shocking videos show just how many US military weapons are now in the hands of Taliban terrorists,"Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to President Joe Biden, admitted Tuesday that ""a fair amount"" of United States military weapons fell into the hands of Taliban terrorists when they swiftly took control of Afghanistan.

But what, quantitatively speaking, is a ""fair amount""? New videos suggest that Sullivan may have been understating just how many American arms the Taliban seized.

What do the videos show?

With the American military presence now limited to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, billions of dollars' worth of military arms were left behind as American forces were ordered to leave their installations and Afghan security forces, which were armed in part by American tax dollars, collapsed.

Videos circulating on social media show Taliban forces seizing thousands of firearms and ammunition.

One video showed thousands of various rifles, a seemingly endless number; body armor; and other assorted military equipment — all now in the hands of Taliban terrorists.

Another video showed Taliban terrorists raiding a weapons depot, putting hundreds of rifles into the back of a truck.

Other videos showed:





As it has already been reported, Taliban terrorists have also seized U.S. drones and military vehicles.

How did this happen?

The Washington Post detailed the Afghan government corruption that helped facilitate the Taliban's swift victory and also explains how so many American arms fell into the hands of terrorists.

From the Post:

The spectacular collapse of Afghanistan's military that allowed Taliban fighters to walk into the Afghan capital Sunday despite 20 years of training and billions of dollars in American aid began with a series of deals brokered in rural villages between the militant group and some of the Afghan government's lowest-ranking officials.



The deals, initially offered early last year, were often described by Afghan officials as cease-fires, but Taliban leaders were in fact offering money in exchange for government forces to hand over their weapons, according to an Afghan officer and a U.S. official.



Over the next year and a half, the meetings advanced to the district level and then rapidly on to provincial capitals, culminating in a breathtaking series of negotiated surrenders by government forces, according to interviews with more than a dozen Afghan officers, police, special operations troops and other soldiers.

By all accounts, the amount of American military equipment seized by the Taliban cost billions of taxpayer dollars. Still, neither the Biden administration nor the military have given any indication that U.S. firepower will be recovered.

When asked by a reporter on Monday what steps the U.S. military was taking to recovery U.S. military assets, Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor said, ""I don't have the answer to that question.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/videos-us-military-weapons-taliban-terrorists,2021-08-18
'We won't bend': Wall Street Journal tells leftists who want to censor the paper's annual Thanksgiving editorials to pound sand,"Since 1961, the Wall Street Journal has run a pair of editorials for Thanksgiving that have been a popular tradition for the paper's subscribers.

Now a group of woke leftists is trying to get the pieces censored, the Journal reported Monday night while revealing that it ""won't bend"" to censorship demands.

What's happening?

For 60 years, the Journal has run the duo of editorials from former editor Vermont Royster to commemorate Thanksgiving.

The first, titled ""The Desolate Wilderness,"" is a historical account of the pilgrims' experiences in the year 1620, which were ""recorded by Nathaniel Morton, keeper of the records of Plymouth Colony, based on the account of William Bradford, sometime governor thereof."" And it tells of that first year of hardship in ""a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of wilde beasts and wilde men.""

The second editorial, ""And the Fair Land,"" contrasts those early Pilgrim days with the mid-20th century and the prosperous America we all enjoy.

According to the Journal, the paper has run the editorials for decades with ""nary a discouraging word.""

Until now.

Today, the paper noted, ""we live in a new era when the left sees nearly everything through the reductive lens of identity politics.""

The woke crowd ""sees much of American history as a racist project that should be erased."" So, naturally, they launched a petition to cancel the Pilgrim editorial.

The Change.org effort, ""End Thanksgiving Insult to Native Americans,"" which was started by Randy Kritkausky, has more than 50,000 signatures and calls on the Journal to censor the account from Morton and Bradford about what the Pilgrims faced because it ""is full of disdain and racism towards indigenous people.""

From the petition:

The passage includes lines such as, “What could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full of wilde beasts and wilde men?"" The pilgrim writes that they were separate from “all the civil parts of the world.""



The Wampanoag indigenous people saved the colonists from starvation and death, a story that our nation now celebrates as Thanksgiving. But even more than this disturbing lack of gratitude is the notion that there were no civilized people in the Americas. This world view generated centuries of genocidal practices that eliminated 90% of the indigenous population, my ancestors.



And indigenous people are still experiencing lethal prejudice. Just this year we learned about more than 1,300 unmarked graves at residential schools in Canada. We know that thousands of indigenous children died of abuse, neglect and disease through the residential school system.

The Journal offered a response Monday to the petitioners: Um, no.

The paper called the petition ""a willful misreading of the editorial, which recounts the bravery and trials of the Pilgrims as they sought a better life in a new land.""

The point of the petition, which erroneously believes ""the Pilgrims and their chronicler share responsibility for genocide"" of Indians, ""isn't to promote debate but to shut it down,"" the Journal's editorial board wrote.

Critics are welcome to make their case, the paper said, ""but we won't bend to political demands for censorship.""

""We will run the editorials as usual this week.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wall-street-journal-leftists-censor-thanksgiving-editorials,2021-11-23
CEO of CNN's parent company caught boasting COVID has been 'really good for ratings',"The CEO of WarnerMedia, parent company of CNN, recently bragged to attendees at a virtual tech conference that the coronavirus pandemic has been ""really good"" for the left-leaning network's ""ratings.""

What are the details?

Jason Kilar reportedly made the incredible comments during a keynote address at Morgan Stanley's Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, according to Wall Street media reporter Joe Flint.

""It turns out the pandemic is a pretty big part of the news cycle and that's not going away any time soon ... it turns out it's really good for ratings,"" Kilar said, according to a tweet posted by Flint.

In his tweet, Flint cautioned Kilar to be careful, warning him that his comments came off similarly to remarks made by CBS executive Leslie Moonves back in 2016, when Moonves said, Trump's presidency ""may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS.""



Serving as proof that he actually made the statement, Kilar quickly issued an apology on Twitter in response to Flint, insisting that he ""would like nothing more than for this pandemic to be behind us.""

After Flint thanked him for clarifying, Kilar added: ""Happy to. I am sorry for the sentence and for uttering it. My apologies. Thx for highlighting it and holding me accountable.""

What else?



The comments are sure to set off a firestorm of criticism against the network, which touts itself as ""the most trusted name in news.""

After all, CNN has been zealous in reporting about the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, given Kilar's remarks, it's fair to wonder whether the network had business in mind amid its reporting rather than, or in addition to, a concern for the health and well-being of Americans.

But Kilar's ""good for ratings"" remark wasn't the only time he put his foot in his mouth during the conference. According to Deadline, while touting the introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported version of HBO Max, Kilar said, ""It turns out that most people on this planet are not wealthy.""

He embarrassingly had to apologize for that comment, too.

""I absolutely should have said it differently. I am sorry. I was attempting to communicate that we as a team wake up each day seeking to deliver more value to fans (through lower prices and/or more great stories),"" he tweeted. ""I am very sorry.""

WarnerMedia owns CNN, HLN, and a litany of other well-known media platforms such as HBO, TBS, TNT, Cinemax, and Cartoon Network.

Elizabeth Warren proposes bill that would triple the IRS budget in order to 'crack down' on 'wealthy tax cheats',"Far-left Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced legislation Monday that would nearly triple the current budget of the Internal Revenue Service, in order to ""crack down"" on ""wealthy tax cheats"" in the U.S.

What are the details?

Warren's office said in a news release that her bill, Restoring the IRS Act of 2021, ""would provide the IRS with the resources it needs to crack down on tax dodging by the rich and corporations."" The release states that the aim of the bill is to ""stop wealthy tax cheats and close the tax gap.""

""For too long, the wealthiest Americans and big corporations have been able to use lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists to avoid paying their fair share — and budget cuts have hollowed out the IRS so it doesn't have the resources to go after wealthy tax cheats,"" Warren said in a statement. ""The IRS should have more — and more stable — resources to do its job, and my bill would do just that.""

The senator's proposal would increase the IRS's budget to $31.5 billion, which is almost three times as much as its current budget of $11.9 billion.

The Hill reported that the IRS hit its peak budget level in 2010. After adjusting for inflation, according to the outlet, Warren's bill would more than double the 2010 budgetary figure.

What else?

Beyond bolstering the IRS's budget, Warren's bill would add additional reporting requirements for banks to disclose activities of their clients.

It would further require the tax collection agency ""to create a plan, and report annually on implementation progress, to shift audits towards high-income, high-wealth tax filers and corporations.""

If made into law, the bill would also increase tax penalties for underpayment on taxpayers with income above $2 million, and apply the False Claims Act — additional charges for allegedly lying to the government — to taxpayers who earn more than $10 million who have a misstatement on their return.

The IRS would also have to ""conduct an analysis of racial disparities in the agency's enforcement activity.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/warren-offers-bill-tripling-irs-budget-to-crack-down-on-wealthy-tax-cheats,2021-05-25
"Washington governor announces vaccine, testing mandate for large events, including outdoor events with more than 10,000 attendees","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Thursday that large events will soon be required to confirm that attendees have either been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or that they have tested negative for the illness within the prior 72 hours.



The requirement, which will go into effect Nov. 15, is applicable to attendees ages 12 and older, Inslee said.

Not only does it pertain to indoor events involving 1,000 or more people, it also pertains to outdoor events involving more than 10,000 individuals in attendance.

""For now this applies to ticketed or registered events that have defined entrances, like conventions, concerts, sporting events, fairs that have defined entrances, theme parks and more. This does not cover large venues like shopping malls, museums, or grocery stores that are open to the public as part of their operations,"" Inslee said.

He noted that K-12 school-related events that take place on school grounds are exempt from the mandate, and that religious services are also exempt.

Inslee said that ""we know that outdoor venues are safest, but they still have some transmission risk, and that's why we've taken the steps that we have.""

Inslee, a Democrat, has served as governor of the Evergreen State since early 2013 and his current term is slated to last until early 2025. He mounted a presidential bid during the 2020 election cycle but ultimately dropped out.

He went on to win re-election in the 2020 Washington gubernatorial election contest, becoming the second governor in state history to secure election in three consecutive terms, according to Ballotpedia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-gov-inslee-announces-vaccine-testing-mandate-for-most-large-events-including-outdoor-events-with-more-than-10000-people,2021-10-15
"'Not going to turn this ... into a grievance session': Washington Post CEO confirms newsroom layoffs in tense meeting, then bolts","The chief executive of Jeff Bezos' Washington Post held a town hall on Wednesday, informing panicked staff that under ten percent of the workforce would be getting the boot.

Fred Ryan, the paper's CEO and publisher, noted that the the cuts, which will likely affect the newsroom, will take place in the first quarter of 2023.

The announcement comes just two weeks after the paper revealed it would be scrapping its stand-alone Sunday print magazine and ousting 10 newsroom employees plus a dance critic, citing ""economic head winds.""

What are the details?

Ryan said in a company-wide meeting Wednesday that the coming layoffs will likely amount to a ""single-digit percentage,"" but provided hope to those in positions ""no longer serving readers"" that they might take refuge in new roles.



""For those people whose positions will be eliminated, this will be a difficult time,"" Ryan suggested.

The paper's chief communications officer, Kathy Baird, later stated there would not, however, be a ""net reduction in Post head count,"" reported Deadline.

When the CEO began angling for the exit, staff yelled out concerns and questions.

Ryan made it clear he had no intention of engaging, saying, ""We’re not going to turn the town hall into a grievance session.""



“Fred, you talked about positions getting eliminated. What are you going to do to protect people’s jobs? Are they going to be treated like the magazine staffers were?” asked one employee, referencing the abrupt firing of the Sunday print magazine's employees.

""We'll have more information as we move forward,"" answered Ryan, as he moved forward and out the door.

In a subsequent statement, the paper's guild said, ""This behavior is unacceptable from any leader, but especially the leader of a news organization whose core values include transparency and accountability.""

The guild, whose Twitter banner image demands a ""Diverse, Inclusive & Fair Washington Post,"" tweeted that its members ""won't let"" Ryan ""turn his back on workers with urgent questions and valid concerns.""

""Washington Post employees ... must be part of any transformation to this company. Stay tuned,"" wrote the guild.

While Axios indicated the paper — whose slogan is ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" — is not expected to turn a profit this year, it will still manage to keep the lights on.



Baird added in her statement, ""We are planning to direct our resources and invest in coverage, products, and people in service of providing high value to our subscribers and new audiences.""

The Washington Post, bought for $250 million by Bezos in 2013, has approximately 2,500 employees.

According to Axios, the paper's newsroom doubled in size during Ryan's time as CEO and now exceeds 1,000 employees.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-ceo-confirms-newsroom-layoffs-in-tense-meeting-then-bolts,2022-12-15
Biden apologizes after going off on reporter over question about Putin,"President Joe Biden lost his cool with a U.S. reporter in Geneva on Wednesday over the journalist's question regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The exchange went viral, sparking condemnation from other U.S. reporters. Afterward, Biden apologized for his response, saying he ""shouldn't have been such a wise guy.""

What are the details?

Following his summit with Putin, Biden held a press conference where he took questions from a list of pre-approved journalists, Fox News reported. But as the president turned and walked away, he decided to respond to questions shouted from the press pool.

That's when CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked, ""Why are you so confident he'll change his behavior, Mr. President?"" referring to Putin.

""I'm not confident he'll change his behavior,"" a visibly frustrated Biden replied. ""What the hell! What do you do all the time?""

Biden then raised a finger and began walking toward Collins, saying, ""When did I say I was confident? What I said was — let's get it straight — I said what will change their behavior is if the rest of the world reacts to them and it diminishes their standing in the world.""

Collins pressed back, replying, ""but given his past behavior has not changed, and in that press conference after sitting down with you for several hours, he denied any involvement in cyberattacks, he's downplayed human rights abuses, he even refused to say Alexei Navalny's name. So, how does that amount to a constructive meeting?""

""If you don't understand that, you're in the wrong business,"" Biden told the reporter.









Several other U.S. reporters took to social media condemning Biden for his treatment of Collins, and her name became a trending topic on Twitter.

New York Magazine's Olivia Nuzzi tweeted, ""If you're the most powerful person in the world and you can't field questions from the media without losing your temper, maybe you're in the wrong business."" Nuzzi added, ""What kind of example does it set for other countries when the president of the United States insults a member of the free press on an international stage for asking a fair question in good faith?""

Glenn Greenwald described video of the exchange as showing ""Biden aggressively insulting and demeaning a female reporter while she's just doing her job, all in front of her colleagues.""

Before boarding Air Force One afterward, Biden stopped to tell the White House press pool, ""I owe my last questioner an apology. I shouldn't have been such a wise guy with the last answer I gave.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-biden-goes-off-on-reporter-over-question-about-putin,2021-06-16
We Build the Wall campaign founder to plead guilty to defrauding Trump supporters,"An Iraq War veteran who led a campaign to raise money to build former President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall will plead guilty to defrauding donors and violating U.S. tax law.

Brian Kolfage, a Florida resident and decorated Air Force veteran, has reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors who have accused him of fraud related to the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, court filings by the U.S. Department of Justice revealed Wednesday.



According to Reuters, Kolfage will enter his plea on April 21 before U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. The government had charged Kolfage, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, and two other defendants with fraud crimes related to the We Build the Wall campaign in August 2020.

The campaign was founded by Kolfage, a triple amputee, in December 2018. He solicited donations from Trump supporters, promising that he would ""not take a penny"" and use every dollar to pay for the completion of Trump's border wall. Prosecutors say that after raising more than $25 million, Kolfage stole more than $350,000 and purchased a boat, a luxury SUV, a golf cart, jewelry, and cosmetic surgery, among other expenses.

He was charged with wire fraud and filing false tax returns. The wire fraud conspiracy charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, Reuters reports.

Charges filed against Bannon last May were dismissed by Judge Torres after Bannon received a presidential pardon from Trump in the 11th hour of his presidency. Bannon had plead not guilty to fraud charges involving the We Build the Wall campaign.

Court records reviewed by Reuters indicate that Kolfage's co-defendant, Andrew Badolato, will also enter a guilty plea on April 21.

The other defendant, Timohty Shea, had initially agreed to also plead guilty but changed his mind, prosecutors said last week.

""Mr. Shea is exercising his constitutional right to a fair trial,"" his lawyer John Meringolo wrote in an email on Wednesday.

In the August 2020 indictment, acting U.S. attorney Audrey Strauss said the accused ""defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction.""

""While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,"" said Strauss.

'We'll convert your children': San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus delivers musical message to those who work against 'gay agenda',"The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus last week released a music video titled, ""A Message From the Gay Community."" The video begins with one singer introducing the tune by saying, ""As we celebrate Pride and progress we've made over these past years, there's still work to be done. So to those of you out there who are still working against equal rights, we have a message for you.""

With that he begins to sing over a lone piano:

You think we're sinful

You fight against our rights

You say we all lead lives you can't respect

But you're just frightened

You think that we'll corrupt your kids

If our agenda goes unchecked

Funny, just this once, you're correct

Image source: YouTube screenshot

We'll convert your children

Happens bit by bit

Quietly and subtly

And you will barely notice it

You can keep them from disco

Warn about San Francisco

Make 'em wear pleated pants

We don't care

We'll convert your children

We'll make them tolerant and fair

A second singer then appears and says, ""At first I didn't get why you'd be so scared of us turning your children into accepting, caring people — but I see now why you'd have a problem with that.""

Then the pair duets:

Just like you worried

They'll change their group of friends

You won't approve of where they go at night

(to protests)

Oh and you'll be disgusted

(so gross)

When they start finding things online

That you've kept far from their sight

(like information)

Guess what?

You'll still be alright!

Image source: YouTube screenshot

We'll convert your children

Reaching one and all

There is really no escaping it

'Cause even grandma likes RuPaul

And the world's getting kinder

Gen Z's gayer than grindr

Learn to love

Learn to vogue

Face your fate!

We'll convert your children

Someone's gotta teach them not to hate

Then the full ensemble kicks in:

We're coming for them

We're coming for your children

We're coming for them

We're coming for them

We're coming for your children

For your children

Your children will care about

Fairness and justice for others

Your children will work to convert

All their sisters and brothers

Then soon we're almost certain

Your kids will start convertin' you!

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The gay agenda is coming home

The gay agenda is here!

But you don't have to worry

'Cause there's nothing wrong with

Standing by our side

(The gay agenda)

Get on board in a hurry

Because the world always needs

A bit more pride

(The gay agenda)

Come on, try a little pride!

We'll convert your children

Then we'll turn to you

Giving up the fear inside

Is freeing like you never knew!

Go and see San Francisco!

Go and turn up that disco!

You'll forget you were ever upset

We'll convert your children

And make an ally of you yet!

We'll make an ally of you yet!

We'll make an ally of you yet!

Anything else?

"Australian homeowners should pay weekly land tax to indigenous people for '200 years of unchecked genocide,' say senator and activists","Homeowners in Australia are being encouraged by activists, celebrities, and a senator from the Australian Greens party to pay a weekly rent to native groups for living on the land, according to the Daily Mail.

An indigenous rights activist named Robbie Thorpe is spearheading the decades-old campaign called ""Pay the Rent,"" which asks homeowners to pay 1% of their weekly wages to those who claim to have ancestral ownership of parts of Australia. The money is allegedly intended for an unspecified group of Aboriginal elders.

Based on the median income in Australia from 2022, each homeowner would pay a weekly fee of approximately $8.83, which equals $459 per year.

Thorpe said the payment plan is ""a rational, reasonable, responsible means of reconciling 200 years of unchecked genocide, as far as I'm concerned.""

According to the ""Pay the Rent"" website, a group called the ""Sovereign Body"" is responsible for ensuring payments are ""centered around First Nations people.""

The group currently consists of just three people: a doctor, a writer, and another native activist. However, the group does not yet have a plan for specific allocations of any money collected.

""The Sovereign Body is currently working through how to honour the legacy of the Elders and their role in the movement; and how money allocations can be fair and transparent to First Nation communities.""

The activist website displays the phrase ""Saying Sorry Isn’t Enough - Pay The Rent"" on its homepage, followed by a donation form. Below the donation form the website lists reasons to contribute, which include the idea of ""stolen land,"" a declaration that there is ""no treaty"" between Aboriginal people and the country of Australia, and that ""colonisation continues.""

An Australian senator named Lidia Thorpe, who is the niece of the aforementioned activist, supports the agenda of the land tax.

""Pay the rent from grassroots for grassroots. No strings attached to government agenda,"" the Greens party member stated. ""It assists sovereign grassroots fight the many campaigns and struggles we face everyday [sic],"" she added.

The campaign also asks for a percentage of any events on the allegedly stolen land, such as weddings or music festivals, the latter of which would require paying 1% of the event's net income to the campaign.

What's The Rock cooking? Potentially a presidential campaign,"Beloved movie star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson may be planning a presidential run.

Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump’s chief of staff from January 2019 to March 2020, said that he thinks Johnson is a serious contender in a potential Republican primary race in 2024.

When asked who he thinks “could mount a serious challenge to Donald Trump in the 2024 GOP primary,” Mulvaney told Politico that few people stand a chance at beating Trump in a Republican primary, but that a short list of people could present themselves as serious challengers to Trump in 2024, The Wrap reported.

Mulvaney said, “DeSantis could give him a run for his money. Tim Scott can give him a run for his money. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson could give him a run for his money. It’s a short list.”

Johnson has publicly flirted with the idea of running for president for years, and has hobnobbed with members of the political elite, but stopped short of declaring himself a member of either major party.

In the past, Johnson has attended Republican events and could be tied to Republican campaigns, but most recently he declared his support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential election while labeling himself a “political independent and centrist.”

Dwayne Johnson Discusses 2020 Presidential Endorsement with Joe Biden & Kamala Harris youtu.be

Trump has continued to tease a presidential run in 2024, stopping short of making any official announcements or commitments that would make him subject to campaign finance regulations.

Insider reported that in a recent interview, Trump said, “I don’t want to comment on running, but I think a lot of people are to be very happy about my decision because it’s a little boring now.”

Trump said, “If I ran, I can’t imagine they’d want me to run, some out of loyalty would have a hard time running. I think that most of those people, and almost every name you mentioned, is there because of me. In some cases, because I backed them and endorsed them.”

In 2021, Johnson spoke with Vanity Fair about his potential political debut.

In the interview, Johnson said, “At the end of the day, I don’t know the first thing about politics. I care deeply about our country.”

Newsweek reported that Johnson said, “Core values matter. Work hard, take care of your family, be kind to people, take pride in your name, take pride in your own two hands, be inclusive and respect EVERYONE and don’t be full of s***.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/what-s-the-rock-cooking-potentially-a-presidential-campaign,2022-04-17
"White House goes into full spin mode, engages in pre-emptive damage control over forthcoming jobs report","The White House engaged in pre-emptive damage control Monday in anticipation of an apparently dismal jobs report.

What are the details?

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the jobs report, which which will be released Friday, will appear disproportionately bad, citing the ongoing surge in COVID-19 cases.

""Because Omicron was so highly transmissible, nearly 9 million people called out sick in early January when the jobs data was being collected,"" Psaki explained. ""The week the survey was taken, the week of Jan. 12, was at the height of the Omicron spike.""

""So we just kind of wanted to prepare people to understand how the data is taken, what they're looking at, and what it is an assessment of,"" she continued. ""As a result, the jobs report may show job losses in large part because workers were out sick from Omicron at the point when it was peaking during the period — the week when the data was taken.""

Jen Psaki Warns Jobs Losses May Appear In Upcoming January Report www.youtube.com

The jobs report is based on data collected during the ""survey reference week,"" which is the calendar week that includes the 12th day of the month. This month, the 12th day fell during the week of Jan. 9 to Jan. 15, which coincided with the highest seven-day average of COVID cases, according to CDC data.

Hourly workers who missed work for any reason related to the pandemic would not be counted in employment data, even if they were not laid off.

Thus, because census data showed that approximately 8.75 million workers missed work in early January for reasons related to the pandemic — a significant increase from just 2.96 million in December — economists are anticipating the weakest job numbers since December 2020, Axios noted.

What is the irony?

While it is completely fair for the White House to explain why the forthcoming jobs report may be skewed to appear worse than it actually is, the White House is engaging in a sly double standard.

The Biden administration worked overtime to take responsibility for allegedly creating more jobs in 2021 than any previous presidential administration. For example, Biden said in early January, ""We added 6.4 million jobs last year. That’s the most jobs in any calendar year by any president in history.""

In promoting the alleged accomplishment, the Biden administration obscured the fact that most of those jobs were not new — but instead were Americans returning to the workforce after the COVID lockdowns ended. Now, however, the White House wants to absolve itself from dismal jobs numbers by blaming the pandemic.

The good outcomes are attributed to Biden, while the bad ones are blamed on the pandemic.

The truth, according to ADP chief economist Nela Richardson, is that Biden has not created ""one single job"" when measured against the ""high-water mark"" in late 2019.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in fact, confirm the U.S. economy remains at a net loss on jobs. The agency's latest report showed that the economy remains 3.6 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels, as measured in February 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-does-preemptive-damage-control-over-possibl,2022-02-01
"White House reporter reveals media bias, Democrats thin skin","A ""prominent White House reporter"" says that Democrats have ""much thinner skin"" compared to Republicans, and one journalist even admitted that he has missed covering former President Donald Trump.

Progressive journalist Julia Ioffe, who has contributed to the New York Times, Washington Post, and MSNBC, interviewed White House reporters about the differences of covering President Joe Biden compared to his predecessor, Trump.

Olivia Nuzzi, the Washington correspondent for New York Magazine, said Biden's White House has a much more ""corporate"" environment, where ""everything seems more buttoned up than the streaking convention that was the Trump White House."" Nuzzi pointed out that Biden's White House has a ""pre-approved, formulated message and a pre-approved, formulated way to push that message out into the media bloodstream,"" according to the ""Tomorrow Will Be Worse"" newsletter.

""They know how to push back and fight over headlines and parcel out dumb pre-approved scoops to people who will write about it the way they want,"" an anonymous White House reporter said of Biden's communication team.

Another unnamed White House reporter said during the Trump era, ""with enough effort, you could find out what's going on in the Situation Room,"" but under the Biden regime, ""You never get inside the room and hear how this s***'s going down.""

A prominent White House reporter informed Ioffe, ""Democrats in general have a much thinner skin.""

""This is not unique to Trump but Republicans never expect a fair shake, so if you cover them fairly, you can have a good working relationship with them,"" the anonymous journalist stated.

""Democrats de facto expect you to be on their side and are horrified when you hold them to account as you would any other administration,"" the D.C. reporter added. ""It goes back to the Obama years.""

Michael Bender, White House correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, said he is glad Biden replaced Trump, ""Covering Trump was like three news cycles every day and I was only paid for one of them, so I don't feel nostalgia for that.""

However, an anonymous White House reporter said they missed the rush they got from covering Trump because it was ""exciting and exhilarating.""

""I loved covering Trump,"" they said. ""It was a great and fascinating story. It wasn't just about him; it was about his movement and the institutions and America. The story was always so dramatic and had these larger than life characters. The stakes often felt very high. I like covering Biden, too, but it just doesn't feel as dramatic.""

A White House reporter said, ""Trump has been good for many journalists professionally, myself included.""

Trump released a statement on Sunday about the corporate press, and he did not hold back.

""I am proud to inform you that the Lamestream Media has hit the lowest approval ratings ever recorded,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I think it would be fair to assume that I had something to do with that.""

Without Trump headlining the news cycle, left-wing cable TV news networks have been hemorrhaging viewers. CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" with Brian Stelter recorded abysmal ratings in May and CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" lost a whopping 75% of its audience since January.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-reporter-democrats-media-bias,2021-07-11
"White House accuses GOP officials of 'creating chaos' and 'confusion' by sending 50 migrants to Martha's Vineyard. Ted Cruz says, 'Now try 4.2 million.'","The White House on Thursday lashed out at Republican elected officials for sending illegal immigrants to Democrat-run sanctuary cities like Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and Washington, D.C., with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre delivering a stream of invective denouncing actions by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), as well as several GOP senators.

""Using migrants as political pawns is shameful, is reckless, and just plain wrong,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at a press briefing. ""If these governors truly care about border security, they should ask Texas Governor Ted Cruz and Florida Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott why they voted against the president's request for record funding for the Department of Homeland Security.""

She said there is a legal process in place for processing asylum-seekers into the U.S. and that Republican governors are ""creating chaos"" and ""confusion"" by interfering with that process.



A DeSantis spokeswoman told Fox News Wednesday that two planes full of migrants were sent from Florida to Martha's Vineyard as part of a state relocation program to carry illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities. Officials from Dukes County, Massachusetts, later confirmed that about 50 individuals from Venezuela were delivered at Martha's Vineyard Airport seeking shelter, referring to the situation as a ""humanitarian crisis.""

Additionally, two buses carrying migrants arrived at Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, D.C., on Thursday morning. Texas Gov. Abbott took credit for sending the migrants in a statement promising to continue sending migrants to sanctuary cities until the federal government secures the border.

""Our supposed Border Czar, VP Harris, has yet to see firsthand the impact of the open border policies she has helped implement,"" Abbott tweeted. ""Texas will continue sending migrants to sanctuary cities like D.C. until Biden & Harris do their jobs to secure the border.""





The actions by the Republican governors provoked a meltdown by liberals on social media. Jean-Pierre blasted the GOP governors, calling the migrant drop-offs a ""cruel premeditated political stunt.""



“It’s really just disrespectful to humanity. It is — it doesn’t afford them any dignity, what they’re doing, when you’re abandoning families and children in a place where they were told they were going to get housing, in a place where they were told they were going to get jobs,” Jean-Pierre said. “It is just cruel.”

Responding to the outrage, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) mocked Jean-Pierre for incorrectly stating his office.

""To be fair, sending anyone to be surrounded by rich, hypocritical liberals is pretty cruel & inhumane,"" Cruz said in response to her criticisms.

Earlier, the Texas senator applauded the actions by DeSantis and Abbott and accused Democrats in Martha's Vineyard of hypocrisy.

""Kudos to @GovRonDeSantis for sending illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. When I proposed the same last year, the elected leadership welcomed it,"" Cruz said.

He referenced legislation he introduced last year called the ""Stop the SURGE Act,"" which would have established 13 new points of entry for migrants in sanctuary city jurisdictions, including Martha's Vineyard. Cruz recalled that at the time, Dukes County Commissioner Keith Chatinover (D) welcomed immigrants to come to Martha's Vineyard.

“I would love Martha’s Vineyard to become a haven for new immigrants to this country, but Senator Cruz has no idea what he’s talking about regarding a ‘border crisis,’” Chatinover told the Martha's Vineyard Times in October 2021.



""Let’s see if the Dems in Martha’s Vineyard feel the same way after a few thousand illegal immigrants arrive on their doorstep,"" Cruz said Thursday morning.

Chatinover responded hours later, tweeting, ""When refugees showed up on our shores, we provided them with food and shelter—not cages and family separations.""

On Wednesday, the Democratic local official berated DeSantis for sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard ""to prove a political point.""

""The island can and will do everything we can to support them, including myself as an elected official. But the fact that you did this, without consulting us and allowing us to prepare for their arrival, is dangerous and disgusting,"" he said in a tweet thread calling out DeSantis.

""Islanders writ large support refugee resettlement, but we can’t help in that process if we are given no advance notice. Our governments weren’t at all prepared for this and proving a point by endangering lives is gross,"" Chatinover added.



However, Cruz repeatedly pointed out that while Democrats may be congratulating themselves for coming together to care for 50 people and attacking Republicans for sending them without warning, the reality of border towns in the United States is that more than 4.2 million illegal immigrants have crossed into this country since President Joe Biden took office. Those towns are overwhelmed, and Republicans say the White House is contributing to the crisis by failing to secure the border.

"White House deputy press secretary threatened to 'destroy' reporter for investigating relationship with journalist, explosive report says","White House deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo allegedly threatened to ""destroy"" a Politico reporter for investigating his relationship with a political journalist, according to an explosive report from Vanity Fair.

The romantic relationship between Ducklo and Axios journalist Alexi McCammond was revealed this week in People magazine. McCammond covered Biden's presidential campaign in 2019 and 2020, where she met Ducklo, who was Biden's campaign press secretary.

Politico reporter Tara Palmeri was purportedly investigating the previously secret romantic relationship between Ducklo and McCammond in January. Ducklo allegedly became hostile toward Palmeri over the investigation into his budding romance.

From Vanity Fair:

The confrontation began on Inauguration Day, January 20, after Palmeri, a coauthor of Politico's Playbook, contacted McCammond for comment while one of her male colleagues left a message for Ducklo, according to the sources. Ducklo subsequently called a Playbook editor to object to the story, but was told to call the Playbook reporters with his concerns. But instead of calling the male reporter who initially contacted him, Ducklo tried to intimidate Palmeri by phone in an effort to kill the story. ""I will destroy you,"" Ducklo told her, according to the sources, adding that he would ruin her reputation if she published it.

During an off-the-record phone call, Ducklo allegedly made ""derogatory and misogynistic comments"" to Palmeri. Ducklo, 32, allegedly told Palmeri that she ""was 'jealous' that an unidentified man in the past had 'wanted to f***' McCammond 'and not you.'"" Ducklo reportedly added that Palmeri was also ""jealous"" of his new relationship with McCammond.

The report claimed that a Politico editor contacted the White House regarding the threats, which allegedly resulted in ""spurring multiple conversations between the news outlet and senior-level officials on January 21, including White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield, and Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn.""

White House officials reportedly ""acknowledged that Ducklo's handling of the call with Palmeri was inappropriate and said he would send a note to her apologizing for the comments."" The White House officials also went on offense, claiming that Palmeri broke her off-the-record agreement with Ducklo.

The White House didn't publicly acknowledge Ducklo's behavior until after the Vanity Fair piece was published Friday.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki issued a statement Friday afternoon on Ducklo, announcing that he was suspended for a week.

""TJ Ducklo has apologized to the reporter, with whom he had a heated conversation about his personal life,"" Psaki wrote on Twitter. ""He is the first to acknowledge this is not the standard of behavior set out by the President.

""In addition to his initial apology, he has sent the reporter a personal note expressing his profound regret,"" she continued. ""With the approval of the White House Chief of Staff, he has been placed on a one-week suspension without pay. In addition, when he returns, he will no longer be assigned to work with any reporters at Politico.""

Just last month, President Biden vowed to fire anyone on his staff that was disrespectful or talked down to anyone.

""I'm not joking when I say this: If you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I will fire you on the spot. No ifs, ands or buts,"" Biden said to a group of administration appointees on Inauguration Day.



""We have to restore the soul of this country,"" Biden told the appointees during a swearing-in ceremony. ""And I'm counting on all of you to be part of that, and it's not hyperbole.""

In September, Ducklo had a meltdown during an appearance on Fox News when host Bret Baier asked him if Biden ever used a teleprompter during interviews with reporters.

Whitmer: COVID-19 is surging in Michigan even with strict mask mandates and capacity restrictions,"Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that her state is ""seeing a surge"" of COVID-19 cases even though the state government continues to impose strict mask mandates and capacity restrictions on residents.

Whitmer made an appeal to the White House, requesting that the Biden administration send additional vaccines to Michigan as the state reports the worst virus surge in the nation. Last week, Michigan averaged 6,429 new virus cases per day, and nine of the 10 U.S. metropolitan areas with the most new cases per capita are in the state, according to the New York Times.

The governor told CBS News there is a combination of factors leading to increased spread.



""We kept our spread low for a long period of time, so we've got reservoirs of people that don't have antibodies. We have variants, big presence of variants here in Michigan that are easier to catch. And people are tired and they're moving around more,"" Whitmer said.

On Friday April 9, Whitmer asked high schools to voluntarily go virtual, youth sports to pause, and residents to avoid indoor dining for two weeks to slow the spread of the virus. Though the governor also requested more vaccine doses from the federal government, White House COVID coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters Friday that the ""fair and equitable"" way to distribute the vaccine was to prioritize states with the largest adult populations.

Speaking on ""Face the Nation,"" Whitmer said the White House should reconsider, pointing out that even though Michigan has some of the harshest COVID restrictions in the country, cases are continuing to rise.

""We are seeing a surge in Michigan despite the fact that we have some of the strongest policies in place, mask mandates, capacity limits, working from home. We've asked our state for a two-week pause. So despite all of that, we are seeing a surge because of these variants,"" said Whitmer. ""That's precisely why we're really encouraging them to think about surging vaccines into the state of Michigan.""

Host Margaret Brennan asked Whitmer about reports that Biden officials are saying Michigan's state government is failing to distribute the vaccines that were allotted to it. According to the New York Times tracker, Michigan has distributed 78% of its allotted vaccine doses, which is slightly lower than average for the nation. Neighboring Wisconsin has a much more efficient distribution rate of 91%, and New Hampshire leads the nation with 95% of its vaccine doses used. Only 35% of Michigan residents have received their first vaccine shot and 23% are fully vaccinated, though these numbers are average for the nation.

""I don't think there's a governor in the country that's leaving any vaccines on the table. And I can tell you that's certainly the case in Michigan. We are getting shots in arms. We got over a million shots in arms just in the last two weeks. So we have really been rolling,"" said Whitmer.

She added: ""But all of that being said, right now, we know we've got even greater capacity. We could get more vaccines in arms. And when there is a surge, we think that it's important that we — we go to — we rush in to meet where that need is, because what's happening in Michigan today could be what's happening in other states tomorrow. And so it's on all of us to recognize we can squash where we're seeing hot spots. It's in everyone's best interest.""

Though the White House is not yet sending additional vaccines to Michigan, Whitmer thanked the Biden administration for promising to send additional resources for testing and to distribute the remainder of its vaccines more efficiently.

WWE mocks woke culture with new wrestler who wants to make the ring a 'safe space',"The WWE mocked the woke left this week with the debut of a gentler, kinder wrestler who doesn't need to use his male privilege to get what he wants while attempting to bludgeon his competitor in the ring.

During Tuesday's NXT 2.0 event, woke wrestler Joe Gacy took on Cameron Grimes in Orlando, Florida. Before the violent match, Gacy told the crowd that the ring is a safe space.

""NXT 2.0 is full of conflict, from the smallest microaggression to the most heinous grudges,"" Gacy told the crowd at the Capitol Wrestling Center. ""This is a place where we settle our differences.""

""I come to you tonight with a mindset of conflict resolution where I don't need to use my male privilege to get what I want,"" the politically correct wrestler continued.

""I understand, just like you, that life isn't fair,"" Gacy added. ""I believe that we can achieve unity and tolerance for us all, and I can be the man that will show you we can achieve peace in this safe space. And it starts tonight!""



However, the woke wrestler did not achieve unity and did not make the ring a safe space. Gacy was kicked in the mouth and eventually pinned by Grimes.

While Grimes was celebrating his victory, Gacy confronted his competitor – not for revenge, but for a hug. Gacy walked up to Grimes after the match and gave him a big hug, which thoroughly confused Grimes.

Following his loss, Gacy reiterated his unity message, ""Tonight, the better man won. And I still believe that we can achieve peace and unity. I want to make NXT 2.0 a safe space. Thank you for your time.""

Former WWE wrestler and NXT commentator Wade Barrett reacted to Gacy's pacifist ideas about wrestling.

""That made no sense to me whatsoever,"" Barrett said before the match. ""I've snapped my arm in that ring. I've separated a shoulder. I've broken my nose more times than I can count. That ring is anything but safe.""

Barrett said that Gacy ""looks at the world a little differently than you or I, which is not necessarily a bad thing.""

Gacy has been wrestling since 2006, where he started in Combat Zone Wrestling. Gacy, nicknamed the ""Chainsaw,"" was a three-time CZW Wired Champion before signing with the WWE in 2020, according to Pro Wrestling Fandom.

However, the new woke character is new for Gacy. As recently as a week ago, Gacy had a much different look. The 34-year-old wrestler wrote on Instagram, ""There is darkness and hope in all of us. We are all good and evil.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-wrestler-joe-gacy-wwe,2021-09-23
"Woman charged with hate crime after stomping on Back the Blue sign, crumpling it, throwing it in trash — while 'smirking' at deputy in 'intimidating manner'","A 19-year-old Utah woman was charged with a hate crime and faces up to a year in prison after a sheriff's deputy said she stomped on a pro-law enforcement ""Back the Blue"" sign, crumpled it, threw it in a trash can, and ended up ""smirking"" at the deputy in an ""intimidating manner.""

What are the details?

A Garfield County sheriff's deputy on Wednesday pulled over a vehicle for speeding near a gas station on Panguitch's Main Street, the St. George News reported, citing charging documents.

""As I concluded my traffic stop and released the individuals, I observed some of the individuals' friends approach them and attempt to console them,"" the deputy wrote in a probable cause affidavit, the News said.

""I observed one of the friends, later identified to be Lauren Gibson, stomping on a 'Back the Blue' sign next to where the traffic stop was conducted, crumble it up in a destructive manner, and throw it into a trash can all while smirking in an intimidating manner towards me,"" the deputy added, according the paper.

The officer noted the woman was asked where she had gotten the sign, and she stated it was her mother's, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The woman's mother lives in California, the News added.

With that the officer told her that the local sheriff's office produced those specific signs, and it was concluded ""she had acquired [the sign] in our community,"" the Tribune said, citing the affidavit.

After reading the woman her Miranda rights, the officer stated she gave ""inconsistent stories"" about where she found the sign until she eventually said she found it on the ground, the Tribune added.

""Due to [the woman] destroying property that did not belong to her in a manner to attempt to intimidate law enforcement, I placed her under arrest,"" the Tribune reported, citing the affidavit.

More from the News:

Gibson was subsequently arrested and booked into Garfield County Jail on suspicion of criminal mischief, a class A misdemeanor, and disorderly conduct, an infraction.



According to the charging documents, the hate crime enhancement was applied to the criminal mischief charge ""due to the demeanor displayed by Gibson in attempts to intimidate law enforcement while destroying a 'pro law enforcement' sign.""



Criminal mischief is typically classified as a class B misdemeanor in Utah, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. However, with the hate crime enhancement, the charge elevates to a class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to 364 days in jail and up to $2,500 in fines.



The applicable section of Utah State Code is 76-3-203.14, where a new section titled ""Victim Targeting Penalty Enhancements"" was passed into law by the Utah Legislature in 2019. Under the law's definitions, a person's status as a law enforcement officer is one of 18 different personal attributes listed which may qualify a criminal offense for a possible hate crime enhancement.

ACLU blasts hate crime charge

The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah on Monday said it's ""extremely troubled and disappointed"" by the decision by the Garfield County Attorney's office to issue a hate crime enhancement in this case, the News added.

""This kind of charging decision sends an extremely chilling message to the community that the government will seek harsher punishment for people charged with crimes who disagree with police actions,"" the ACLU said, according to the News. ""This concern is even greater because we do not view the enhancement as supportable under the language of the statute. We consistently warn that enhancements are oftentimes used to single out unpopular groups or messages rather than provide protections for marginalized communities.""

The ACLU's statement added that this case has ""confirmed those warnings,"" the News said.

""Bringing a charge against this person that could result in her spending a year in jail makes no sense both in terms of simple fairness and expending the county's time and money,"" the organization added, according to the News.

Anything else?

The News addd that Gibson — whose place of residence has not been listed on court documents thus far — was released from custody after promising to appear to answer the charges. The paper said that although a court date hasn't been set, the case was assigned to Sixth District Judge Marvin D.

Woman fights back after hotel tries to cancel her bridal party booking to make more money on a Taylor Swift concert — and wins,"Bride-to-be Christina Leonard of Revere, Massachusetts is getting married next year. So this September she booked a block of ten rooms with the Home2 Suites by Hilton in Walpole for her wedding party, and thought she had that problem settled forever.

However, when Taylor Swift later announced a concert at Gilette Stadium in Foxboro for the same weekend as her wedding, the hotel apparently had other ideas when they realized they could make much more money from would-be concert goers, and tried to cancel her reservations.

While many would have begrudgingly accepted the situation and found other accommodations, Leonard decided to fight back, according to WBZ-TV.

According to WBZ, hotel management told her that their contract was not binding. The hotel claimed that even though it had sent a contract to Leonard, which she then signed and returned, hotel management had not countersigned the contract, which meant they were not bound. Leonard says that the hotel manager told her on the phone that they could make over $1,000 per room from concert-goers, which is far more than the guaranteed rate of $169 per night that Leonard had booked her rooms.

Leonard, who correctly noted that if the roles were reversed, she would be charged a cancellation fee, sought redress by escalating her complaints to several levels of hotel management, to no avail. That's when she decided to tell her story to the media. After a number of local outlets ran her story on the evening news, hotel management finally got back to her on Friday night with an apology and an announcement that they had changed their mind.

""We would like to apologize for the misunderstanding with your room block at the hotel,"" the email said. ""We would like to reinstate your room block and offer you and your fiancé complimentary accommodations for the entire weekend.""

"Women protest transgender athlete inclusion at NCAA convention, threaten to sue if changes aren't made","Women including former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines protested the inclusion of male-to-female transgender athletes in sports outside the NCAA convention, handing over a petition and threatening legal action, according to Yahoo News.

Gaines, who famously spoke out against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, took to the forefront of the group of a reported two dozen demonstrators.

“Today, we intend to personally tell the NCAA to stop discriminating against female athletes by handing them a petition that we have garnered nearly 10,000 signatures on in just a couple of days,” said Gaines.

Other guests included Marshi Smith, former NCAA athlete and co-founder of the Independent Council on Women’s Sports. Smith outlined demands from the council, which were sent in a letter to the NCAA's legal team.

The letter reads:

""To avoid legal action, the NCAA must comply with civil rights law immediately by:



Repealing all policies and rules that allow male athletes to take roster spots on women’s teams and/or compete in women’s events;

Establishing and enforcing rules to keep women’s sports female;

Requiring colleges to provide single-sex locker rooms for female athletes.""

Another speaker was a high school student who claimed that she was suspended when she spoke out against a male student changing in the girls' locker room, with the school even stopping all the females from using the changing room after complaints.

The NCAA held a session on the topic during the convention, speaking in detail on the subject.

Ivy League executive director Robin Harris said the NCAA wants to ""have an environment that is fair, welcoming and inclusive for all of (the athletes),” adding that the eligibility requirements for transgender athletes are the same as for other athletes.

NCAA director of inclusion Jean Merrill stated that transgender athletes are indeed ""playing by the rules.”

The session also saw a former transgender athlete give commentary; Schuyler Bailar is a swimmer who switched from female swimming to male swimming at Harvard.

""The more we learn about bodies and biology and people and the more we understand diversity and equity and inclusion,” Bailar remarked.

Bailar also supported a policy that would see the NCAA not holding competitions in states that ban transgender athletes in women's sports, adding, ""If you’re asking me do I want more support for trans people? The answer is going to be absolutely yes.""

The NCAA officials accepted the petition from Riley Gaines outside the convention.

'Biology trumps gender': World Athletics defends integrity of women's sports; FIFA also reviewing transgender policy,"FIFA and World Athletics, two international governing bodies for sports, revealed Monday they are reviewing their eligibility rules for transgender athletes.

The news comes after FINA, the international body that governs swimming, enacted a new policy that prohibits from competition transgender female swimmers who experienced any stage of male puberty.

What did World Athletics say?

In light of FINA's decision, World Athletics — the international governing body for track and field and other running sports — will review its policies, organization president Sebastian Coe told the BBC.



According to Coe, the review will center around the fact that ""biology trumps gender.""

""We have always believed that biology trumps gender,"" Coe declared, ""and we will continue to review our regulations in line with this. We will follow the science.""

""We continue to study, research and contribute to the growing body of evidence that testosterone is a key determinant in performance, and have scheduled a discussion on our regulations with our council at the end of the year,"" he explained.

Coe also praised FINA's decision to take a stand. ""This is as it should be,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Coe said that World Athletics — if the body is forced to make a judgment between ""inclusion"" and ""fairness"" — ""will always fall down on the side of fairness.""

""That for me is non-negotiable,"" he declared. ""The integrity of women's sport is really, really important here, and we can't have a generation of young girls thinking there is not a future for them in the sport. So we have a responsibility … maintaining the primacy and the integrity of female competition is absolutely vital, and that's why we were at the forefront of tabling those regulations that allow as close as you can get to a level playing field.""

Current World Athletics rules permit transgender women to compete against biological women if their testosterone is suppressed below a certain level. FINA had followed the same policy, but changed it because scientific evidence shows transgender women/biological men have an athletic advantage over biological women.

What did FIFA say?

A spokesperson for FIFA, the international body that governs soccer, told Reuters the organization is similarly reviewing its transgender eligibility policies.

""FIFA is currently reviewing its gender eligibility regulations in consultation with expert stakeholders,"" the spokesperson said. ""Due to the ongoing nature of the process, FIFA is not in a position to comment on specifics of proposed amendments to the existing regulations.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/world-athletics-fifa-review-transgender-athletes-policy,2022-06-21
Washington State head football coach Nick Rolovich booted from job after refusing COVID-19 vaccination,"Washington State University is dropping head football coach Nick Rolovich and several assistant coaches who it says are not in compliance with Gov. Jay Inslee's order requiring state workers to have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Rolovich and assistant football coaches Ricky Logo, John Richardson, Craig Stutzmann, and Mark Weber are said to not be in compliance with the governor's proclamation, which prohibits state agencies from allowing workers to work after Monday if they have not gotten fully vaccinated.

A news release notes that the school ""has initiated the separation process based on the terms of their respective contracts, effective immediately.""

Defensive coordinator Jake Dickert will serve as interim head coach.

Rolovich, who had sought a religious exemption to the mandate, was the state's highest paid employee with earnings of over $3 million per year, according to the Associated Press. He didn't specify his reasons for not getting vaccinated, the AP said.

""This is a disheartening day for our football program. Our priority has been and will continue to be the health and well-being of the young men on our team. The leadership on our football team is filled with young men of character, selflessness and resiliency and we are confident these same attributes will help guide this program as we move forward,"" WSU athletic director Pat Chun said in a statement.



Washington State is 4-3 this season and has won its past three games, including a 34-31 win over Stanford last Saturday. WSU plays at home Saturday against Brigham Young University.

Last week, Gov. Inslee, a Democrat who has served at the helm of the Evergreen State since early 2013, announced that large events will soon be required to confirm that attendees have either been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or that they have tested negative for the illness within the prior 72 hours.

That requirement is slated to go into effect Nov. 15 and will be applicable to individuals ages 12 and older, the governor said. It pertains to indoor events with 1,000 or more people and outdoor events with more than 10,000.

""For now this applies to ticketed or registered events that have defined entrances, like conventions, concerts, sporting events, fairs that have defined entrances, theme parks and more. This does not cover large venues like shopping malls, museums, or grocery stores that are open to the public as part of their operations,"" Inslee said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wsu-head-football-coach-nick-rolovich-booted-from-job-after-declining-covid-19-vaccination,2021-10-19
"Bombshell report suggests COVID-19 escaped from Wuhan Institute of Virology earlier than suspected, CCP's Xi may have tried to cover up the world-changing lab leak","A new report claims the origin of COVID-19 is the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China. The damning report also suggests that Chinese leader Xi Jinping was aware that the Wuhan lab suffered an ""acute safety emergency"" event that may have spread COVID-19 well before China notified the World Health Organization (WHO).

ProPublica in partnership with Vanity Fair published the bombshell report on Friday. The report is based on a 5-month investigation that analyzed more than 500 documents obtained from the Wuhan Institute of Virology's website. The documents include communications between officials at the Wuhan lab and top leaders within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) dating back to 2017.

""These viruses come without a shadow and leave without a trace""

Toy Reid – a specialist at decoding ""party speak"" by Chinese Communist Party members – was enlisted to accurately decode these delicate communications between the scientists at the biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility and significant government officials.

""It’s not meant to be easily understood. It’s almost like a secret language of Chinese officialdom,"" explained Reid – a former political officer in East Asia for the U.S. State Department. ""When they’re talking about anything potentially embarrassing, they speak of it in innuendo and hushed tones, and there’s a certain acceptable way to allude to something.""

One vague WIV message sent on Nov. 12, 2019, caught his eye.

Once you have opened the stored test tubes, it is just as if having opened Pandora’s Box. These viruses come without a shadow and leave without a trace. Although [we have] various preventive and protective measures, it is nevertheless necessary for lab personnel to operate very cautiously to avoid operational errors that give rise to dangers. Every time this has happened, the members of the Zhengdian Lab [BSL4] Party Branch have always run to the frontline, and they have taken real action to mobilize and motivate other research personnel.

Reid interpreted the message as, ""They are almost saying they know Beijing is about to come down and scream at them.""



Xi sends Beijing official to examine ""complex and grave situation"" at the Wuhan lab

ProPublica reported that Dr. Ji Changzheng – the technology safety and security director for the Chinese Academy of Sciences – visited the Wuhan lab on Nov. 19, 2019.

The visit to the state-run and funded research facility was billed as a safety training seminar, but Reid believes it was ""out of the ordinary and event-driven.""



Ji informed WIV's senior officials that he had made the trip to Wuhan to deliver ""important oral remarks and written instructions"" from General Secretary Xi Jinping to address a ""complex and grave situation.""

Ji reportedly said, ""Many large-scale cases of domestic and foreign safety incidents in recent years, and from the perspective of shouldering responsibility, standardizing operations, emergency planning, and inspecting hidden dangers one-by-one, [he] laid out a deep analysis, with many layers and taken from many angles, which vividly revealed the complex and grave situation currently facing [bio]security work.""

The WIV’s deputy director of safety and security then added, ""Several general problems that were found over the course of the last year during safety and security investigations, and [he] pointed to the severe consequences that could result from hidden safety dangers.""

Reid believes that the safety issue at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was so severe that Xi was briefed in detail about the ongoing crisis at China's first BSL-4 laboratory.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official said, ""There is some issue related to lab security, which doesn’t come up very often, that needed to be seen by Xi Jinping. Something signed off on by the General Secretary (Xi) and Premier (Li) is high priority.""

The safety issues at the Wuhan lab coincide with a declassified intelligence report from the U.S. State Department that claimed several researchers inside the WIV became sick ""with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.""

A possible cover-up at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

The analysis from ProPublica and Vanity Fair suggests that China may have attempted to cover up safety issues at the laboratory where controversial and potentially dangerous coronavirus research was being conducted.

On Nov. 11, 2019, the WIV ""appeared to republish the entire section of its website containing institutional and party branch news."" This suggests that WIV officials could have been attempting to hide safety issues before Ji's visit.

ProPublica noted, ""On Dec. 11, a team of WIV researchers submitted a patent application in China for a device to filter and contain hazardous gases inside a biological chamber, like the ones it used to transport infected animals.""

China did not notify the World Health Organization about the dangerous outbreak until Dec. 31, 2019.

In the WIV messages, Reid noticed that scientists ""described intense pressure to produce scientific breakthroughs that would elevate China’s standing on the world stage, despite a dire lack of essential resources.""

The origin of COVID-19

The investigation found the Wuhan Institute of Virology to be the most logical origin of COVID-19, and spread through a lab leak.

The investigation found that the zoonotic origin theory was unlikely. The theory that COVID-19 originated from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan is questionable because there is still no evidence of an animal being infected with coronavirus.

China develops a COVID-19 vaccine faster than warp speed

The investigation also probed into how China produced a COVID-19 vaccine so remarkably fast.

On Feb. 24, 2020, Zhou Yusen – director of the State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, in Beijing – became the first researcher in the world to apply for a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine.

The report found, ""Vanity Fair and ProPublica consulted two independent experts and one expert adviser to the interim report to get their assessment of when Zhou’s research was likely to have begun. Two of the three said that he had to have started no later than November 2019, in order to complete the mouse research spelled out in his patent and subsequent papers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wuhan-lab-leak-china-xi-report,2022-10-31
"Wyoming Republicans take action against Rep. Liz Cheney, demand her immediate resignation","The Wyoming Republican Party voted on Saturday to officially censure Rep. Liz Cheney, the Cowboy State's at-large representative in the U.S. House.

The development comes after Cheney, the third-highest ranking House Republican, voted to impeach now-former President Donald Trump for the role she believed he played in the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.

Before voting to impeach Trump last month, Cheney said, ""The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the president.""

What are the details?

Wyoming Republicans overwhelmingly supported censuring Cheney in a vote held on Saturday.

The Associated Press reported:

Only eight of the 74-member state GOP's central committee stood to oppose censure in a vote that didn't proceed to a formal count. The censure document accused Cheney of voting to impeach even though the U.S. House didn't offer Trump ""formal hearing or due process.""

According to CNN, the state Republican Party also demanded that Cheney ""immediately"" resign, and pledged to ""withhold any future political funding"" from Cheney.

Wyoming Republicans are angry that Cheney did not stand up for Trump, who won more than 70% of the state's presidential vote last November.

In fact, Darin Smith, who lost to Cheney in the 2016 Wyoming Republican primary, said it's time for Republicans ""to put [Cheney] on notice.""

""We need to honor President Trump. All President Trump did was call for a peaceful assembly and protest for a fair and audited election,"" Smith claimed.

How did Cheney respond?

In a statement released Saturday, Cheney defended her vote supporting impeachment, claiming her oath to the Constitution compelled her to vote as she did.

""I'm honored to represent the people of Wyoming in Congress and will always fight for the issues that matter most to our state. Foremost among these is the defense of our Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees,"" Cheney said, Politico reported.

""My vote to impeach was compelled by the oath I swore to the Constitution. Wyoming citizens know that this oath does not bend or yield to politics or partisanship. I will always fight for Wyoming values and stand up for our Western way of life,"" Cheney added.

What about House Republicans?

Ironically, House Republicans overwhelmingly voted last week to keep Cheney in her position as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.

In a secret ballot, 145 members voted to keep Cheney in her place of leadership, while only 61 Republicans voted to oust her.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wyoming-republicans-censure-liz-cheney,2021-02-07
NBC reporter Yamiche Alcindor claims some Americans say the US is on the wrong track because Trump might get elected again,"NBC reporter Yamiche Alcindor faced online criticism for her explanation of a poll showing that a large majority of Americans believe the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction.

Alcindor was a guest on MSNBC when she was asked to comment on a poll showing a whopping 74% of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction.

She opined about the reasons Americans would have to say the country was in the wrong direction and claimed that many were upset that former President Donald Trump might get elected again or that Republicans might steal the next election.

""But what you see really is on the Democratic side people that are very very worried about the direction of this country.

""They’re very worried especially about former President Trump possibly coming back into power, or former President Trump or another Republican stealing the election in 2022 or 2024, because we've seen so many election deniers be elected.

So a lot of Democrats on the Democratic side, they're very worried about abortion also, and abortion rights.

On the Republican side, Alcindor claimed that Americans were negative because of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen.

""They're worried that the country is going in the wrong direction because they're seeing too many people say that the election was free and fair, which of course it was,"" she continued.

She went on to say that Republicans are campaigning on anxiety because of high inflation and increasing gas prices, in addition to the pandemic continuing to have a negative effect on the economy.

The video of Alcindor's comments were circulated widely among those critical of Biden's policies.

On Sunday, Chuck Todd summarized the results of the latest poll from NBC News to which Alcindor was referring.

""We are less than three months before the midterms. Our brand new NBC News poll paints a bleak picture,"" said the NBC anchor.

""Americans are angry,"" he added. ""They're disappointed. And they are worried about the future of this country.""

Alcindor has been accused numerous times of being biased against Republicans in favor of Democrats and their policies.

Youngkin refuses to buckle when CNN anchor claims pro-parental rights rules are 'excluding' LGBT kids and their affirming parents,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) refused to cave Sunday when CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged the fairness of a new regulations that protect the rights of parents.



What is the background?

Last month, Youngkin issued new rules mandating that students must use bathrooms and pronouns that correspond to their biological sex. They are also required to play on sports teams with members of their biological sex.

Importantly, the rules do not exclude transgender students — or anyone protected by federal law — from living out their identity. The emphasis of the rules, which overturn progressive regulations enacted by Democrats and former Gov. Ralph Northam (D), is the protection of parental rights. The previous rules, in fact, directed schools to decide on a ""case-by-case"" basis whether to share information with parents regarding this issue.

Under the new rules, transgender students can live out their gender identity at school only if their parents have formally requested it.

Importantly, the rules also emphasize protection of First Amendment rights:

The First Amendment forbids government actors to require individuals to adhere to or adopt any particular ideological beliefs. Practices such as compelling others to use preferred pronouns is premised on the ideological belief that gender is a matter of personal choice or subjective experience, not sex. Many Virginians reject this belief. Additionally, the First Amendment guarantees religious freedom and prohibits compelling others to affirm ideas that may be contrary to their personal religious beliefs.

What happened with Tapper?

Questioning Youngkin on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Tapper advanced a fallacious argument: The new rules excludes people.

After noting that the ""American Academy of Pediatrics says these kinds of laws can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and even suicide among transgender youth,"" Tapper told Youngkin that ""it sounds like you're excluding parents that might be supportive of their child going to the bathroom or joining a sports team that is in alignment with their gender identity.""

But Youngkin swiftly shot down Tapper's claim.

""Certainly not. If parents actually want their child to be able to change a pronoun or their name or use a bathroom, if parents choose that, then, legally, that's what the schools will do,"" Youngkin explained.

Tapper presses GOP governor on policies for transgender students www.youtube.com

The entire point of the rule change, Youngkin earlier explained, was ""to fix a wrong,"" namely those progressive rules enacted by Virginia Democrats.

""Parents have a fundamental right to be engaged in their children's lives,"" he said.

""And oh, by the way, children have a right to have parents engaged in their life,"" Youngkin continued. ""We needed to fix a wrong. The previous administration had had a policy that excluded parents and, in fact, particularly didn't require the involvement of parents.

""Let's be clear: Parents have this right — and children don't belong to the state,"" the governor declared.

Anything else?

The rules will take effect after a 30-day public commenting period, which opened on Sept. 26.

""It is not under a school’s or the government’s purview to impose a set of particular ideological beliefs on all students,"" said Youngkin press secretary Macaulay Porter last month.

""Key decisions rest, first and foremost, with the parents,"" Porter added. ""The previous policies implemented under the Northam administration did not uphold constitutional principles and parental rights, and will be replaced.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youngkin-tapper-parental-rights,2022-10-10
ukraine commentary,"As the internet continues to be flooded with news about Russia's war against Ukraine, the public's mistrust of the media grows as well. Discerning truth from propaganda seems an increasingly daunting task.

Background



Ukraine is a small country that sits between Russia and Europe. Until 1991, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. After declaring independence from the USSR, the nation has since wavered between Russian and European associations.

During the Obama administration, the United States accused Russia of meddling in the business of the Ukrainian government. A leaked phone call between U.S. diplomats exposed Russia's meddling as well as an embarrassing admission by U.S diplomats.

In 2014, Ukraine is said to have communicated hope for major non-NATO ally status with the United States. Major non-NATO status is given by the U.S. government to non-NATO counties and offers financial and military advantages.

U.S. involvement in Ukraine often is described as an effort to expand western democracy into a nation that could otherwise fall to Russian control. To help understand this issue, it is essential to understand the meaning of ""democracy."" Here are the characteristics of a democracy:

The people elect their representatives.

The people enjoy civil liberties.

The government has an independent judiciary.

There should be an organized opposition party.

All must observe and uphold the rule of law.

Citizens in a democracy have rights and the responsibility to participate in the political system.

There is a real question about whether what the United States has been doing in Ukraine meets the criteria for expanding democracy.

The first clip that illustrates what has been happening dates back to 2014 and comes against a complicated backdrop. After gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine has wavered between a show of support for Russia and the West. In 2014, pro-western groups formed in Ukraine and led to an embarrassing leaked conversation involving Victoria Nuland, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.

In the original coverage of this video, U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland made headlines for a rude comment about the European Union; however, journalists buried the lede in the story. The clip showed Washington discussing meddling in the Ukrainian government with U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt — something that the Obama administration denied it was doing.

The National Endowment for Democracy, a non-profit on a mission to promote democracy worldwide, decided that Ukraine's democratically elected president Yanukovych was undermining its goals and began to socially engineer Ukraine's future by supporting the opposition and strengthening the country's democratic institutions.



Militias in Ukraine

In this 2018 video, Vice reported the stalemate between Ukraine's military and Russian-backed separatists where ""civilians are left to pick up the pieces.""

Following Russia's takeover of Crimea, the Russian military moved in and began training Russian-backed separatists. But Ukraine's army was not prepared to fight separatists and called on citizens to take up arms and defend Ukraine. Years later, Ukraine claims to have disbanded civilian militias.

Evidence suggests that militias in Ukraine have not been disbanded, making western military assistance problematic. Although Putin's claim that he invaded Ukraine to ""denazify"" it was almost certainly pretextual, it is doubtless true that Ukraine does, in fact, have a neo-Nazi militia problem. Before the current conflict erupted, this problem was widely reported on by such outlets as The Guardian, Yahoo, and Reuters. Multiple reports have accused the American CIA of having trained these neo-Nazi groups, and there is a real question how much control, if any, the Ukrainian government is actually able to assert over them.

Consequences of western involvement in Ukraine?

American political scientist and international relations scholar Joseph Mearsheimer wrote that Putin's move to take Crimea in 2014 should have come as no surprise. Ukraine waivered between joining the E.U., the west's growing encouragement of a pro-democracy movement.

""The West's triple package of policies—NATO enlargement, E.U. expansion, and democracy promotion—added fuel to a fire waiting to ignite. The spark came in November 2013, when Yanukovych rejected a major economic deal he had been negotiating with the E.U. and decided to accept a $15 billion Russian counteroffer instead. That decision gave rise to antigovernment demonstrations that escalated over the following three months and that by mid-February had led to the deaths of some one hundred protesters. Western emissaries hurriedly flew to Kyiv to resolve the crisis. On February 21, the government and the opposition struck a deal that allowed Yanukovych to stay in power until new elections. But it immediately fell apart, and Yanukovych fled to Russia the next day. The new government in Kyiv was pro-Western and anti-Russian to the core, and it contained four high-ranking members who could legitimately be labeled neofascists."" -

In Mearsheimer's view, Russia and the West have been fighting over Ukraine — a fight which Russia believes that it must win in order to ensure its survival. According to Mearsheimer, Western involvement in Ukraine has led to disastrous consequences for the Ukrainians because of the existential threat it posed to Russia.

Coup or Revolution?

This clip highlights Ukraine's one constant theme of Ukraine's history — Ukraine wants to be a sovereign nation that will fully subscribe to the highest European standard while building relations with Russia that are just and fair.





Connecting the Dots

While the United States' interest in Ukraine has, at times, proven to undermine Western principles, for Russia, a Ukraine-NATO alliance would be a massive defeat. It seems probable that Putin will go to great lengths to make Ukraine appear unfit for NATO. The United States has funded much of the military training exercises over the years to prepare the aspiring country for a NATO alliance. Considering the time and money invested, the United States must learn from mistakes made during the Obama administration and stop undermining the democratic process. Ukraine should decide on Ukrainian elections without outside influence.

"Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 3: 'You will have tasks today that must be done'","Click here for part 1 of this series: Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 1: The questions we should have asked of Fauci about the origins of COVID-19



Click here for part 2 of this series: Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 2: The gain-of-function controversy

On Jan. 27, 2020, EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak sent an email to Dr. David Morens, a subordinate of Dr. Anthony Fauci at NIAID, that contained a not-very-subtle warning. Fauci had not yet been appointed to former President Donald Trump's Coronavirus Task Force and was thus largely unknown to the public at large at this point. Daszak would later become perhaps the most prominent public scientific figure in the world to denounce the lab-leak theory.

He was also, perhaps not coincidentally, the link between U.S. taxpayer dollars and research funded at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — it was through his EcoHealth Alliance that the WIV had received NIAID grants.

As the coronavirus pandemic was emerging in Wuhan and scientists began looking for the source of the outbreak (some of whom were considering the possibility that the virus might have leaked from the WIV), Daszak alerted Morens to a rather explosive fact: The NIAID had, in fact, been funding the WIV indirectly. Not only that, Daszak provided Morens with a handy list of talking points that Fauci could use, if he saw fit, if he was asked about what, exactly, the NIAID had been funding at the WIV.

""Great info, thanks,"" Morens replied. ""[Dr. Fauci] doesn't maintain awareness of these things and doesn't know unless program officers tell him, which they rarely do, since they are across town and may not see him more than once a year, or less.""

It is reasonable to assume that, prior to this point, Fauci may not have personally known that NIAID had funded research at the WIV that any reasonable person would have concluded constituted gain-of-function research. However, he certainly knew after this heads-up from Daszak — who was aggressively shaping the public message even this early in the pandemic.

+++++++++

The first officially reported human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, although there is evidence the virus was circulating and infecting people at the Wuhan Institute of Virology before December. At the beginning of the month, patient zero, a 55-year-old man from Hubei, went to the hospital with pneumonia-like symptoms. Though the outbreak would later be traced to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, patient zero had not been there. In the next few weeks, more patients would present themselves to the hospital with similar symptoms, and on Dec. 8, 2019, the Wuhan City Health Committee and the World Health Organization reported that 41 people had been tested and confirmed positive for a new viral disease that would come to be called COVID-19.



Reports of this novel coronavirus were of immediate interest to Drs. Fauci, Baric, Daszak, and the other virologists, researchers, and public health officials who had dedicated their lives to studying, controlling, and preventing infectious disease. Their jobs, after all, were to guide the public response to a pandemic. But the circumstances surrounding the outbreak of the virus, and the possible, though unproven, connection of its origins to dangerous gain-of-function research — which those involved had an ideological and financial stake in — created a conflict of interest that perhaps motivated their public statements and compromised their official response to COVID-19.

To say that the government has not been voluntarily forthcoming about its response to the COVID-19 pandemic would be to engage in massive understatement. Only a bevy of repeated FOIA requests filed by media and nonprofit organizations, combined with the incessant prying of the DRASTIC internet sleuths, have uncovered as much information as we now have. And what we have represents only a small fraction of the total: enormous portions — perhaps the majority — have been redacted, including entire lengthy emails.

We, ordinary members of the public, remain largely in the dark about what these men and women did and said to each other as they scrambled to formulate a public response to the largest public health emergency in recent memory. For that matter, it seems that another key person appears to have been kept in the dark: former President Donald Trump, who was, if you will recall, the boss of virtually all the government officials involved in these communications. And yet, one searches through these hundreds of pages of released emails in vain for any indication that the president was consulted or even informed about deliberations that were occurring regarding how his administration would handle what would come to be his defining crisis.

While we might know but little of the full picture, what we do know does not look good. In the early days of the pandemic, a group of scientists led by Fauci, Farrar, and Daszak held a number of teleconferences and meetings, over which there remains a blanket of almost total secrecy. The end result of these initial teleconferences is that all the participants would emerge to publicly declare the lab-leak theory a conspiracy, including some (like Dr. Kristian Andersen), who had just days earlier announced that the virus looked potentially engineered.

In the months following these internal discussions, Fauci, Dasak, and other public officials and influential members of the scientific community would coordinate a messaging campaign to discredit the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from the Wuhan lab. Discussion of the lab-leak theory would be shut down in public spaces by their repeated insistence that such questions were conspiracy-theory, fringe ideas that promote disinformation during a global pandemic.

They instead advanced the hypothesis that COVID-19 had natural, or zoonotic origins — that the virus began in some animal host, possibly bats or pangolins, and evolved to become transmissible among humans. This became the prevailing narrative accepted by the media, and those who questioned its truthfulness were smeared as conspiracy theorists and in some cases de-platformed by tech companies for contradicting the opinions of respected, scientific experts and organizations — read: the views endorsed and promoted by government officials like Fauci.

Here is how the plan unfolded.

The chain began in late December 2019. On Dec. 31, 2019, at 8:16 a.m., Dr. Baric emailed Daszak with the subject line, ""RE: have you heard any news on this? maybe as many as 27 cases with 7 severe in wuhan---ards like pneumonia."" The email contained an update from ProMed, an email list that provides readers all over the world with crowdsourced disease alerts, on the latest news regarding an emerging pneumonia-like disease reported in Wuhan.



Daszak, a zoologist, was the leader of the only U.S.-based nonprofit organization researching coronavirus evolution and transmission in China. He is also a strong proponent of and fundraiser for gain-of-function research. For years, his organization has received federal funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and its sub-agency the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to support research on bat coronaviruses conducted in China. He was on friendly terms with Wuhan researcher Dr. Shi Zhengli, as well as NIAID Director Fauci, and had contacts with both of their colleagues.

He replied to Baric indicating that his EcoHealth colleague Hongying Li was feeding him information on the pneumonia cases in what appeared to be real time. Daszak's emails were made public as part of a records request from U.S. Right to Know.

On Jan. 6, 2020, Daszak replied to an email from Erik Stemmy, the program officer for the Respiratory Diseases Branch Division of Microbiology and Infections Diseases at NIAID, indicating that he had some off-the-record information on the viral outbreak in China. Chinese scientists on Jan. 12 published the genetic sequence of the virus causing the outbreak. EcoHealth Alliance analyzed the Chinese data and determined the virus was related to SARS. Daszak wrote another email to Stemmy informing him that the new virus is ""close to SARSr-CoV Rp3 that we published from our past NIAID work. This came from a Rhinolophus bat in S. China."" He added that Baric was ""already working to reconstruct and rescue the virus in the lab from the sequence, so he can do further work on it.""

It would appear that Daszak had early access to information Shi's research team wouldn't make public until Jan. 23, when they reported the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2 was 96.2% similar to a previously discovered bat coronavirus called RaTG13. Daszak confirmed as much in another Jan. 9 email exchange with NIAID senior scientific adviser Dr. David Morens, who had emailed Daszak asking if he had any ""inside info on this new coronavirus that isn't yet in the public domain.""

""Yes — lots of information and I spoke with Erik Stemmy and Alan Embry yesterday before the news was released,"" Daszak replied. ""Erik is my program officer on our coronavirus grant specifically focused on China."" These emails were obtained by Judicial Watch.

Later in a Jan. 27 email, Daszak sent Morens talking points on EcoHealth Alliance's work with the Wuhan lab for Fauci to mention ""when he's being interviewed re. The new CoV."" He highlighted that NIAID had been funding research at the Wuhan lab through EcoHealth Alliance for ""the past 5 years"" and that the work involves identifying ""cohorts of people highly exposed to bats in China"" and determining ""if they're getting sick from [coronaviruses].""

Daszak also pointed out the ""results of our work,"" which included the discovery of ""SARS-related CoVs that can bind to human cells (Published in Nature), and that cause SARS-like disease in humanized mouse models."" He was referring to Baric and Shi's 2015 collaborative gain-of-function study.

From the beginning, Daszak sought to influence the messaging around his work in China, casting it in the most positive light.

""Great info, thanks,"" Morens replied. ""[Dr. Fauci] doesn't maintain awareness of these things and doesn't know unless program officers tell him, which they rarely do, since they are across town and may not see him more than once a year, or less.""

The early work of scientists to identify SARS-CoV-2 and trace its origins inevitably attracted the attention of the media. Science magazine published an article on Jan. 31 detailing those efforts, covering Shi's work and leaning in to the emerging hypothesis that the virus occurred naturally in bats and made the leap to infect humans. The article also briefly discussed ""conspiracy theories"" linking China's coronavirus research to weapons research. At the time there were unsubstantiated claims that China engineered the virus at the Wuhan lab as a bioweapon, but soon the ""conspiracy theory"" label would be expanded to any suggestion that the virus originated in the lab, no matter how credentialed those promoting the idea were or how carefully they avoided drawing conclusions.

The Science article did note that there were concerns about the Wuhan lab's security and gain-of-function research. Dr. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University and a critic of gain-of-function experiments, was quoted suggesting that data on SARS-CoV-2 was ""consistent with entry into the human population as either a natural accident or a laboratory accident.""

The mere suggestion that it was possible for COVID-19 to come from a laboratory accident drew immediate, fierce attack from Daszak.

""Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus,"" Daszak told Science. ""It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face.""

This unjustified, angry reaction to a reasonable point was a prelude to what was to come.

+++++++++

At 8:43 p.m. on Jan. 31, the Science article was emailed to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who in turn forwarded it to several of his NIH colleagues and associates, including Dr. Jeremy Farrar, the director of the London-based Wellcome Trust megacharity, and to Dr. Kristian Andersen, a respected virologist at Scripps Research. Fauci's emails were made public via a Freedom of Information Act Request from BuzzFeed News.

Andersen, who had studied the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, wrote back praising the article but adding an astounding claim: He had analyzed the genetic sequences from China and determined that ""some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" He told Fauci that ""after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,"" before adding that ""those opinions could still change."" According to reporter Nicholas Wade, Eddie is Edward C. Holmes of the University of Sydney, Bob is Robert F. Garry of Tulane University, and Mike is Michael Farzan at Scripps Research.

Andersen would later walk back what he said privately, claiming that he and other scientists strongly considered the lab-leak possibility before evidence convinced them that the natural origins theory was more likely.

But in that moment, Fauci was told the unanimous opinion of several well-respected virologists was that the virus causing a growing pandemic was possibly engineered. The fact that the viral outbreak happened just 20 miles away from a laboratory conducting coronavirus research, research his agency may have funded, put him into action.

The next morning, Saturday, Feb. 1, Fauci sent an urgent email to NIAID principal director Hugh Auchincloss, writing, ""It is essential that we speak this AM. Keep your cell phone on ... read this paper as well as the e-mail that I will forward to you now. You will have tasks today that must be done."" Attached was a copy of Baric's and Shi's 2015 collaborative gain-of-function study, which stated in its acknowledgements that it was funded by NIAID and exempted from a moratorium on funding for gain-of-function research that was in effect at the time. Fauci also forwarded the study to the Wellcome Trust's Farrar. Fauci told Farrar the study was ""of interest to the current discussion.""

Auchincloss replied a few hours later: ""The paper you sent me says the experiments were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by NIH. Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Coronavirus work has gone through the P3 framework. She will try to determine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.""

NIAID was tied to that work. Documents obtained by Judicial Watch show that NIAID awarded a 10-year grant to Peter Daszak to study bat coronaviruses in the East, and that between 2014 and 2019, $826,300 had been sub-awarded by EcoHealth Alliance to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Did NIAID fund an experiment at the Wuhan lab that engineered this new SARS-like virus? This would be the question on Fauci's mind as he prepared for a teleconference later that day with well-known and highly respected global virologists to discuss the emerging pandemic.

+++++++++

The teleconference was organized by Jeremy Farrar, who like Fauci is an enormously important gatekeeper of billions of dollars for medical research. Information to be discussed on the call would be ""shared in total confidence and not to be shared until agreement on next steps,"" a Feb. 1 email blast Fauci received explained. Farrar would lead the conference and present the ""introduction, focus, and desired outcomes."" Andersen would be summarizing what he and the other virologists had analyzed about the virus. What was said exactly is unknown, as an email summary of the call was redacted, as well as notes taken by Ron Fouchier, the Dutch scientist who authored a highly controversial gain-of-function study in 2011.

What is known is that following this conference call, the public campaign against the lab-leak theory intensified. Many of the participants who voiced concerns that the virus looked engineered abruptly changed their positions.

Andersen, for example, was recruited by Daszak to consult on drafting a ""statement in support of the scientists, public health and medical professionals of China."" Just four days after writing to Fauci about the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 virus looks ""engineered,"" Andersen in a Feb. 4, 2020, email recommended to Daszak that the statement ""be more firm on the question of engineering.""

""The main crackpot theories going around at the moment relate to the virus being somehow engineered with intent and that is demonstrably not the case,"" he wrote, reversing his position.

Farrar, meanwhile, was contacted by NIH Director Francis Collins on Feb. 2 about the need to get in touch with World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""Let me know if I can help get through his thicket of protectors,"" Collins wrote to Farrar, copying Fauci on the email. ""Really appreciate us thinking through the options ...,"" he said in another email, before a redacted line.

Later that day, Farrar emailed Fauci and Collins, writing: ""Tedros and [WHO representative in China Dr. Bernhard Schwartländer] have apparently gone into conclave ... they need to decide today in my view. If they do prevaricate, I would appreciate a call with you later tonight or tomorrow to think how we might take forward."" At the end of the email, Farrar wrote ""meanwhile"" and included a link to a ZeroHedge article published that day that reported on claims that COVID-19 was engineered in the Wuhan lab.

The very next day, Tedros delivered a speech to the WHO executive board stating the need to ""combat the spread of rumors and misinformation.""

""We have worked with Google to make sure people searching for information about coronavirus see WHO information at the top of their search results,"" Tedros said. ""Social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Tencent, and TikTok have also taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation.""

On that same day, ZeroHedge was banned from Twitter for publishing a ""coronavirus conspiracy theory.""

The campaign was beginning to work.

Meanwhile, Daszak worked in the background to recruit more colleagues and associates to sign his statement, which was intended to authoritatively discredit the lab-leak hypothesis. In emails, Daszak wrote that he wanted the statement to ""not be identifiable as coming from any one organization or person"" but rather to be seen as ""simply a letter from leading scientists."" He also emphasized how important it was ""to avoid the appearance of a political statement.""

Baric, a leading gain-of-function researcher, was also consulted for the draft, but Daszak told him it would be best if he didn't add his name to it ""so it has some distance from us and therefore doesn't work in a counterproductive way."" Baric agreed in reply, writing, ""otherwise it looks self-serving and we lose impact.""

Likewise, Andersen did not sign the final product. He later claimed in a since-deleted tweet that he didn't attach his name to the letter ""because I (+ coauthors) found it premature to conclude there was no lab leak without carefully analyzing available data first."" He has never explained why it was not ""premature"" for him to help draft the statement.

The completed statement was published in the Lancet on Feb. 19 with 27 prominent public health scientists signing on to condemn ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.""

The importance of this event cannot be overstated.

The Lancet letter was instrumental in shaping the media narrative condemning all discussion of the lab-leak theory as conspiratorial, fringe, and otherwise harmful. To quote a landmark Vanity Fair article about the investigation into the origins of COVID-19, Daszak's Lancet letter ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

Farrar, also a signatory of the Lancet statement, was working behind the scenes to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis, too. A spokesman for his office told the Daily Mail in June that Farrar recruited five scientists to author a letter to the scientific journal Nature Medicine that would argue for the natural origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two of those scientists, Andersen and Holmes, attended the Feb. 1 teleconference and had before that conference believed the virus looked ""potentially"" engineered.

Incredibly, Farrar admits to the fact that he signed the Lancet letter even though, by his own estimation, he was ""50-50"" on the question of the lab-leak theory after the Feb. 1 teleconference with Fauci, and he further admits now that he cannot definitely make a statement one way or the other. Perhaps most astonishingly, Farrar's memoir ""Spike,"" which discusses his ruminations at length about the lab-leak theory, fails to even mention the Lancet letter or his signature on it.

Not content with relying on the Lancet letter, the scientists who were involved in the mysterious Feb. 1 teleconference launched other avenues of attack. On Feb. 26, 2020, Emerging Microbes and Infections published another influential article titled, ""No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2."" The paper was written by Shan-Lu Liu, Linda J. Saif, Susan R. Weiss, and Lishan Su. Christian Drosten, Germany's leading COVID-19 expert and a participant in Farrar's conference call, sits on the editorial board for EMI. This paper, if possible, represented an even more obvious exercise in wagon-circling and hiding conflicts of interest.

Lishan Su, it should be noted, was a colleague and coworker of Dr. Ralph Baric at UNC up until 2020, a fact not mentioned in the paper even though the primary purpose the paper served was to exonerate Baric and his work. Even more astonishingly, Baric was consulted beforehand about what the paper should say. According to emails unearthed by U.S. Right to Know, Baric was provided with an advance copy of the paper by Su and asked for comments and revisions.

Perhaps understanding how bad such an arrangement would look, Baric responded to Su's request that he review the paper by saying, ""sure, but I don't want to be cited in (sic) as having commented prior to submission."" Su agreed to keep Baric's name out of the paper, and Baric agreed to redline the paper that would exonerate him. Bizarrely, Baric attempted to claim in one comment that the SHC014-MA15 virus that he created with Shi decreased the pathogenicity of the virus, rather than increased, as it clearly did. Baric's comment confused the authors of the EMI paper, who ultimately rejected that particular edit.

Incredibly, Baric was not the only gain-of-function researcher asked to review the draft. His Chinese counterpart, Shi Zhengli, was also approached by the authors for edits to their work and, like Baric, her involvement was not acknowledged by the paper's authors. Another document discovered by U.S. Right to Know shows that Shi made three substantial edits to an early draft of the EMI commentary. U.S. Right to Know summarized her edits as follows:

Shi proposed three edits of note. First, she proposed changing the presentation of the number of nucleotides that differed between RaTG13, which was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 identified at that time, and SARS-CoV-2. The authors wrote this difference was ""greater than 1000 nucleotides."" Shi proposed deleting ""1000"" and replacing it with ""1100"" nucleotides. This edit appears to maximize the presentation of the difference between the two viruses.



Second, Shi proposed deleting a paragraph discussing the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV virus, MA15 (that had been used in Ralph Baric's lab in collaboration with Shi), and how its serial passage had increased viral replication and lung pathology in mice. This appears to be an effort at distancing from the gain-of-function debate surrounding the research done together by Shi, Baric and the EcoHealth Alliance.



Third, Shi edited a statement on bats as natural reservoirs, and civets as intermediate hosts, of SARS-CoV.

Shi's second edit is most concerning. While the paper authors ultimately rejected her suggestion to cut the paragraph discussing her prior work with Baric, the fact that she wished the commentary to ignore that gain-of-function research demonstrates her desire to keep her research obscured — for what purpose?



The paper was finished on Feb. 13, 2020, and Shan-Lu Liu, who also serves as EMI's editor-in-chief, wrote a bizarre email recommending publication of what he described as ""timely commentary... perfectly written"" from himself to ... himself.

Unsurprisingly, the paper, which never disclosed Baric nor Shi's involvement, was published a couple weeks later.

But between the time the article was finalized and the time it was published, the paper's authors privately expressed doubts to each other about its conclusions, even as EMI was rushing to expedite publication of the commentary and waiving customary publication fees. Shan Lu acknowledged to Weiss in a Feb. 16 email that they ""could not rule out the possibility"" that the virus escaped from the lab, which led to changes to the paper that focused on refuting the idea that the virus had been engineered in a lab, as opposed to merely having escaped from the lab. But some of the papers' authors continued to harbor doubts about this possibility, as well.

On Feb. 16, Weiss emailed Shan-Lu Liu, still expressing her ""doubt"" that the virus was engineered in the lab, but noting regarding the distinctive furin cleavage site, ""lineage B Bat viruses generally do not have the furin site.""

Five days later, Shan Lu responded, ""Susan, I completely agree with you, but rumor says that furin site may be engineered. Importantly, the virus RNA sequence around the furin site (288 nt), before and after, has 6.6 % differences, but with no amino acid changes at all.""

Weiss then responded, ""Henry and I have been speculating- how can that site have appeared at S1/S2 border- I hate to think to [sic] was engineered- among the MHV strains, the cleavage site does not increaser pathogenicity while it does effect entry route (surface vs endosome) . so for me the only significance of this furin site is as a marker for where the virus came from- frightening to think it may have been engineered[.]""

None of these doubts or concerns would be mentioned when, five days later, the paper, ""No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2,"" was released.

+++++++++

On Mar. 6, Andersen emailed Fauci, Farrar, and Collins announcing that his letter had been accepted by Nature Medicine and would be published shortly. He encouraged them to provide comments or suggestions about the paper or its press release. Two days later, Fauci replied, ""Nice job on the paper.""

This third article, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,"" was published March 17. Farrar's name was not attached to it. ""We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the authors wrote, in what would became the most-cited scientific document discrediting the lab-leak hypothesis. National media outlets seized on the letter, often referring to it as a ""study,"" as the final word on COVID-19's origins. Anyone who offered a contrary opinion, including President Donald Trump, was dismissed as ignorant, anti-science, conspiracy-minded, and racist as far as the media were concerned. And they'd be censored on social media too.

The Proximal Origins letter was championed by opponents of the lab-leak theory.

Daszak used the letter in interviews and on social media to forcefully attack ""conspiracy theorists"" calling for investigations into the Wuhan lab.

Fauci, who by now was the chief spokesman for the White House at the daily coronavirus response briefings and the nationally recognized face of the government's pandemic response, endorsed the letter on April 18 and publicly rejected the lab-leak hypothesis. Fauci did not mention that he was involved with the authors.

In an email after that press briefing, Daszak wrote to Fauci with glowing praise for his remarks.

""I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Daszak wrote.

""From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus' origins,"" he added.

Daszak was thrilled because the most important and influential voice during the pandemic said that ""science"" had determined SARS-CoV-2 was not engineered in a lab. As far as he knew, the lab-leak theory was defeated. The United States government would support that conclusion in an April 30 statement endorsing the ""scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.""

The actual evidence presented by the ""Proximal Origins"" paper, however, was almost farcically thin. The bulk of the paper discussed the basis for a possible zoonotic origin of the virus — which will be discussed in greater detail in subsequent parts of this series. As for the scientific evidence discrediting the possibility that the virus was engineered, Andersen and his fellow authors raised exactly two points.

First, the paper claimed, ""While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal7 and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding7,11. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.""

Stripped of dense scientific language, the authors essentially argue that, while SARS-cov-2 is extremely effective at infecting human cells, it is not as effective as it could be, and thus if someone was trying to engineer a virus that was as infectious as possible, they would have done better. This may or may not constitute ""strong evidence"" that the virus was engineered specifically as a bioweapon, but it ignores the fact that viruses are engineered by the scientists who perform gain-of-function research for a whole host of reasons, including to develop vaccines and treatment modalities. It also ignores the somewhat obvious fact that a person who was, in fact, seeking to create a bioweapon might want to maintain some plausible deniability that it was not, in fact, an intentional bioweapon.

Second, the paper claimed, ""Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone."" This contention, however, is definitely four words too short, because it fails to finish, ""that we know of."" The idea that the genomic database — particularly of backbones that might have been generated in Wuhan — can be relied upon for completeness is absolutely ludicrous given what we know now. For just one example, the infamous chimeric virus created by Baric and Shi in their 2015 paper was ""inadvertently"" not uploaded to any databases until after the current pandemic began and people began asking uncomfortable questions.

But, while the actual contentions of the paper were laughably weak, they were hidden behind a patina of dense scientific lingo and an air of authority and certainty, which was enough to convince the media and social media companies.

+++++++++

There were still voices arguing that the lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed. Trump drew fire for contradicting his administration with claims that he had seen evidence that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab. When the media demanded the president offer proof, he said he was ""not allowed"" to share the evidence with them. Already antagonized by the president, the national media doubled down on their efforts to declare him a liar, as well as anyone who agreed with him.

In the months following, Fauci and other public health officials continued to dismiss the lab-leak theory as a conspiracy theory. In May, Columbia University virologist and Proximal Origins author Ian W. Lipkin thanked Fauci for his ""efforts in steering and messaging.""

As summer drew to a close, the lab-leak theory appeared to be thoroughly discredited. Gain-of-function research was safe. In August 2020, NIAID awarded 11 new grants with a total first-year value of $17 million to 10 participants for a global network to investigate viruses and other deadly pathogens emerging in the wild. Kristian Andersen and Peter Daszak, who worked with Fauci on messaging about the origins of the coronavirus, were among the recipients of this funding.

Only recently, more than a year after the beginning of the pandemic, is discussion of the lab-leak theory permitted in the mainstream because proponents of the natural origins theory have been unable to prove their claims. In May 2021, several influential scientists including Dr. Ralph Baric, the leading coronavirus researcher in the United States, signed a letter in Science magazine calling for a full investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter acknowledged that both the natural origins and lab-leak theories ""remain viable"" and that the two theories ""were not given balanced consideration"" at the onset of the pandemic.

Further demonstrating that discussion of the lab-leak theory is now officially acceptable, a declassified summary of a U.S. intelligence report on the origins of the coronavirus requested by President Joe BIden and released last Friday did not draw definitive conclusions but left open the possibility that the virus was leaked from the Wuhan lab.

Discussion of both theories should be welcomed, as it is of paramount importance to learn how the coronavirus pandemic began so that a future pandemic can be prevented or stopped before millions of lives are lost.

What is troubling is that there was no obvious, science-based reason for any of the officials and scientific experts involved to want to prevent public discussion of the theory last year after the onset of the pandemic. Preventing public discussion of alternate theories of the virus' origin served no scientific purpose at all. It did not advance our understanding of the virus or how to treat it.

There is, however, a clear political purpose to preventing discussion of the lab-leak theory, one that served the interests of the scientists involved in promoting and funding coronavirus research in China and, to the shame of journalists responsible for holding the powerful accountable, one that went unscrutinized for more than a year as the pandemic raged.

"Childhood, interrupted: Ruining young lives will not quell our existential fears","This piece was originally published on Medium.com, 25 July 2021.

They think it's dangerous to talk about the depravity of what pandemic restrictions are doing to kids.

I think it's dangerous — and morally untenable — not to.

*********

In 2020, I watched — first with disbelief, then shock and horror — as schools around the world closed and children were masked and isolated. I could not understand what was happening or why. The data was clear: COVID-19 was not a significant threat to children — far less so than the risks we already tolerated every day from sports, car rides, swimming, or even from the freshly verboten flu.

Top 15 Causes of Death for 19y.o.-and-under in 2019 https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html

How were we not all on our knees with gratitude that this virus did not take children with a fraction of the frequency with which it took adults? Deaths of children with COVID, although undeniably tragic, are exceedingly rare.

In the time that it took to accrue roughly 400 C19 deaths in kids, more than 50,000 American children under 17 years died of all causes.

Deaths-by-age with COVID-19 since Jan 2020 (19mo.) https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3

I figured the panic would subside and the restrictions would be temporary. We couldn't justify continuing to take from our kids. After all, national school closures had never been instituted — or even considered — before and the Doomsday scenarios initially modeled became further divorced from reality by the day.

But even last fall — six months in — the facts had little bearing on public perception. For example, the actor Ryan Reynolds made a headline-grabbing statement just as school was set to resume in August that ""thousands"" of young people were dying from COVID-19 in Canada and insinuated that the public just didn't know. He raised the specter of some unseen entity secretly stealing our children.

And, instead of fact-checking his statement, the media amplified it.

Eleven months later, the cumulative total of deaths of Canadian young people is still off Ryan's terrorizing assertion by at least two orders of magnitude. And the article has never been corrected.

That was just one false media claim of too many to count, which all seemed to push panic as a public health strategy.

But regardless of the media's obvious incentive to sensationalize, their hyperbole and myopia didn't change the reality that children were spared.

And given that fact, I believed there was no way we could be shutting down children's lives for the sole purpose of shielding the elderly. The average age of a person who dies with COVID in most wealthy nations is higher than the average life expectancy (in the U.K., for example, it's 82). Someone surely would come to their senses. There is a natural order to life, and the pandemic response was in clear violation.

In the pre-2020 world, the welfare of children was a universally accepted (although not always perfectly practiced) priority. The importance of nurturing young people was not up for debate. Adults intuitively sacrificed to ensure that kids had what they needed to grow and thrive. Of course, some children had more resources than others, but the underlying value was the same. On the whole and up until that moment in history, kids came first.



And these weren't just feelings, they were facts. Tending to children ""followed the science.""

Then something in the ethos changed.

In this new world in which we now find ourselves living, that once-sacred order is inverted. Children must be restricted to protect the old. Their defining milestones and experiences are capriciously delayed and canceled by people who already experienced them. Kids' faces and airways are obscured to alleviate the anxiety of the unmasked adults around them.

Children's value — which was once predicated on their role as the literal future of humanity — has been perverted, now centering on their utility as shields for the elderly.

They're regarded as vectors of disease and shamed for putting adults in danger by daring to openly breathe or talk in public. The natural arc of life has been willfully set aside.

It's a world I no longer recognize — an aberration of values and theft from the young that I will never support.

It hits too close to home.

*********

One of my babies lost her life before she even entered the world. And, at the time, I did not know how I would find the strength to carry on.

When she was born, she emerged impossibly tiny — no bigger than my palm — and completely still.

Remarkably different she was from my other three, who were born fierce and unrelenting in their demand for the delivery room's attention. Her facial expression was so peaceful — like a sleeping cherub on a faded cathedral ceiling with invisible wings. Her heart had stopped beating the day before, and she never drew a single breath.

My sweet Matilda — named after Roald Dahl's redoubtable young protagonist — died in my belly, and of all of my failures as a parent, this ranks among the most psychologically brutal.

As I held her in my hands, I grieved for her imagined future — for all the things she would never try or feel or do or see. I grieved that she was denied the triumph of her first steps and the pain of the bruises she would accumulate while practicing for them. I mourned the terror of walking into her first day of kindergarten and how her face would beam like the sun when I picked her up six hours later. I grieved that she would not get to grow up with three older sisters who would serve as both her bullies and her protectors, but — when it mattered most — her built-in support system to guide her through a beautiful life (hopefully) filled with more joy than pain. I grieved because, having lived a mere 29 years by that point, I was already well acquainted with how positively charmed — and utterly tragic — life could be.

But she'd never know. The whole of her impossibly brief existence occurred while sheltered inside my body. And I was so, so sad for her.

When my grandmother died the very next year, I grieved her, too. I had the distinction of being the only grandchild at her side when she passed. We knew, of course, that she was not immortal, but when she caught pneumonia, she deteriorated quickly and I was the only one of my generation living in close enough proximity to arrive in time. I was honored to be there holding her hand as she, too, went still: not so tiny, but no less perfect than her great-granddaughter, whom we had lost almost exactly 12 months before.

She died with 82 years of joy and pain etched into a face framed by strands of wiry grey and obstinate brunette.

Her body was peppered with scars from laying down the motorcycle that she rode well into her 60s, multiple cancer resections, and generally taking on all manner of risks that people told her she could not or should not attempt. She died having been joyfully married at 18, tragically widowed at 50, and having borne four daughters — just like I eventually would. She was the matriarch of a clan of 30 and counting, and she left behind the legacy of a life well lived.

When she was gone, I missed her so so much.

She had been a constant in my life, and her passing was a disquieting reminder of my mortality. My rank in the natural order shifted forward at that moment, and only one generation remained standing between me and my own final breaths.

The grief of my daughter's death was not the same as the grief of my grandmother's death. Gauging strictly by loss, my grandmother's death should have been more difficult. I had known my grandmother my entire life. She was as much a part of me as any limb or organ. She guided me and comforted me and impacted my trajectory in too many ways to count, and I missed her terribly — but there was comfort in knowing that it was simply her time to go. She had lived fully and had no regrets. Her arc was complete, and despite the loss, there was so much to remember and celebrate.

Despite never having met my daughter, her death was infinitely more challenging to process than my grandma's. It felt like a cruel injustice — because it was. There was no space for reflection or joy — only despair and regret. Canceled potential. Unnatural theft of kinetic energy.

And it's because the arc of her life never even began its rise.

*********

Some of the days to follow were more difficult than others. I can still conjure the feelings — now 12 years later — of pure heartbreak and hopelessness. What got me out of bed each day — what most helped the sadness slowly migrate from the front to the back of my mind — were the three little faces delicately constructed of my dad's steel-blue eyes and framed with my (now ex-) husband's dirty blonde ringlets that peeked around the corner of my bedroom door each morning. Those precious, perfect, and ever-changing faces did the impossible — they eased the sadness of my loss, dulled the pain in my chest, and dissolved the irrational anger I felt toward the sun for having the audacity to rise when I was so clearly suffering.

Tending to their needs fulfilled mine, and knowing how much they depended on me to deliver was the emotional fuel that kept me going. I would sit up, and they'd run in and jump on my bed and ask for eggs and bacon and chocolate milk. They'd inquire as to where we'd be going that day and what we might do. And I couldn't bring myself to deny them the care and experiences I'd committed to providing when I brought them into the world, just because things were difficult for me.

Watching them grow and thrive because of my efforts facilitated my healing more than anything else.

But — truth be told — the inherent injustice of my daughter's stolen life is still with me. And it has triggered some existential fears about my living children's survival, as well. Both are etched into my face, just like my grandma, and will pass on with me when I die, too.

The point is not to conflate the death of an infant with prolonged school closures. It's to describe the difference between my daughter's death and my grandmother's — to highlight why children are so valued and just how important it is to put their needs first.

We have an obligation to make them a priority and not to dismiss their losses with the wave of a hand. And to wit, the comparison stands: My grandma's death was sad, and yet, her life was fully lived. My daughter's death was tragic — because her opportunities were stolen.

And — like so many kids whose futures have been involuntarily put on pause since 2020 — she'll never get that time back.

*********

An iota of empathy was the sole requirement for acknowledging how educational disruption and social isolation (and eventually compulsory masking) could impact our youngest generation. Recognizing that impoverished and disabled children would bear the greatest brunt did not require an MPH or a Ph.D. in epidemiology. It was easy to see that, without the resources to purchase individually tailored, hand-delivered alternatives, non-wealthy children would simply have to do without the nutritional support, therapies, ESL classes, extracurricular activities, community resources, protective eyes and ears of mandatory reporters, and more generally, access to the single-greatest external factor influencing socioeconomic mobility: an education.

""But kids are resilient"" never sounded so sinister.

I believed there was no conceivable way we would let millions of children fall through the cracks of the very system designed to support them.

And yet …

Restrictions not only persisted; they intensified. When schools finally reopened — some more than a year later — they looked more like correctional facilities than communities of learning.

The message to the children came through loud and clear:

""Your role as a disease vector is central in this new schema — rising above all else — and your opportunities must be severely restricted to keep adults safe.""

Even now — 17 months from the first school closure — we know with unflinching certainty that COVID presents a negligible risk to kids. Not only that, but we have access to vaccinations that substantially reduce the likelihood of severe disease and death in at-risk and fearful adults. Yet, school districts around the country are already planning in-person restrictions for kids this coming fall. At that point, we will be waist-deep in Year Two of interrupting finite childhoods with indefinite restrictions.

And all of this leaves me no choice but to ask: ""What problem does this solve? Who is all of this meant to protect? And why can't we give those people the tools to protect themselves, while protecting the ones who cannot? Why have we become so obsessed with a single respiratory virus that literally nothing else — including the future of our children — matters any more?""

It doesn't make sense.

Those first budding friendships wherein we learn what it feels like and means to care about someone outside our immediate family — they matter. Learning to read people's expressions and developing empathy and communication skills — those lessons matter. As we get older, the final exams. The school trips. The dances. The graduations. First time living away from home. First relationship. First heartbreak. First job interview. Those things matter so much. They not only help kids learn and grow, but they give kids experiences to look forward to before their brains acquire the ability to conceptualize the future. They motivate and incentivize — two things every person needs for good mental health.

My grandmother got to experience all of those. Matilda didn't get any.

And it is a big deal to interrupt and delay them. It is such a big deal that we should only be considering doing so in the direst of circumstances. Childhood lasts a brief 18 years, and the window for maximum neuroplasticity is finite. We are taking opportunities away from them that they can — and will — never get back. And when the experiences and activities they value can be discarded with the pop of a single positive PCR test — what do children have to look forward to? What can they count on?

""Well, at least they're alive!"" does not hold up as a justification when they were never at risk of death in the first place.

""Well, at least I'm alive!"" is a more honest response.

Because none of this is for the benefit of the kids.

*********

It should not be a matter of debate that many children are suffering. And not simply the little ones who can't recognize their classmates' faces because of masks or those who were denied early intervention services meaning their developmental delays will persist longer than necessary.

Teen mental health — which was already teetering on crisis — has been decimated. Eating disorders in young people are on the rise. Overdoses are at record highs. And it is not hard to wrap one's brain around why. What is the point of protecting or nourishing a body that sees no path forward? Why not turn to alcohol or drugs when there are no life experiences available to get high on? That ""Why not?"" pulls a lot more weight with a person who has nothing to lose.

And how long do we expect children to endure the message that they are responsible if their elders die before they begin to internalize that guilt, shame, and self-loathing? Never before have we asked children to be the keepers of their parents' and grandparents' health. It is adults who are supposed to sacrifice for them — not the other way around.

And all of this should be moot because, no matter how many times we tell ourselves that the restrictions are justified to protect our children, the facts simply do not support it. And repeating ""Well, unless they stormed the beaches at Normandy, they have nothing to complain about"" is not only cruel and absurd, it won't erase the truth that this didn't have to happen.

Dismissing their suffering doesn't fix it — it only silences children's pain so that adults are spared the guilt of hearing it.

It's literally adding insult to horrifying injury.

*********

So how can we right this ship when it is so far gone?

Right now, children should be preparing for a normal return to school, especially given that kids are not responsible for COVID and schools are not significant transmission sites. They should be looking forward to seeing their old friends and making new ones, with their beautiful faces exposed, miraculous immune systems trusted, and airways unobstructed. They should be able to hug each other and hold hands and show physical affection and camaraderie. Six-foot spaced dots should be scraped off the floor, thrown in the trash, and all remnants of plastic barriers removed.

And when that first day of school finally arrives, they should be thanked for their sacrifices and allowed to express their anger and disappointment at what they lost.

They should be asked their opinion on how canceled events might be made up or recreated — and we need to action as many of those re-dos as possible because they will help suffering kids feel validated, proactive, and whole. Schools need to support the legions of children who suffered learning loss in catching up and be patient and understanding when they struggle. We need counselors specializing in social/emotional development available to help those who are now scared of others or afraid to take their masks off — kids who are suffering diagnosable mental health disorders as a direct response to the restrictions. And the prevailing message we send needs to be:

""You are valued, you are welcome, and you are safe. What happened isn't your fault, and we are going to try our best to fix it. And we will not do it again.""

But the most important thing we can do for our kids is get a grip on our own anxiety and stop projecting it onto children.

We are all going to die. Every single one of us. Seatbelts won't stop it. Socially isolating won't stop it. Locking ourselves in our homes won't stop it. Segregating unvaccinated people won't stop it. Restricting children's opportunities won't stop it. ZeroCovid policies won't stop it.

And — at this point — a reasonable person has to wonder: How much of this hysterical response is about our inability to confront our own mortality? How many people who say, ""If it saves one life …"" are really concerned about their own?

Have we become so insulated from and fearful of death that we are willing to sacrifice our children's childhoods to the false god of immortality?

Because if so, accommodating that fear will be a costly and tragic indulgence.

Like many parents, I would take a bullet for my children without a second thought. But that willingness or ability to sacrifice is not — and should not be — reciprocal. I would not expect or want my children to step in front of a bullet — metaphorical or otherwise — for me. Frankly, I would not allow it, even if it would ""only"" hurt or maim them.

I have been, thus far, blessed with 42 years on this earth. Not as many as I expect, but enough to have enjoyed my fair share of life. My oldest has had less than half of that. My youngest, a fourth. Their lives are worth more than mine, and they deserve a chance to live them. So even when life is challenging for me and their needs costs me something I want or need, I always put them first. They are entitled to a future, and they depend on me to provide it. Right now is their turn. I already had mine.

And that is the natural arc of life.

*********

The insistence that we must choose between the well-being of children and saving lives is false, and the idea that ""wanting children to have access to normal life means that you want to murder old people"" is a destructive projection of our own fears. The two are not mutually exclusive.

The world can keep turning while we work to preserve the remaining years of the older people we love, and we do not have to deny and restrict children to do it. We do not have to turn our backs on one to save the other.

But, for the sake of argument …

If we were forced into a Sophie's Choice between the futures of the old and the young, whose should we prioritize?

For me, the answer is obvious.

And you would not have to twist my arm to get me to step in front of that bullet.

*********

John F. Kennedy famously said, ""Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.""

Regardless of what this virus — or any other virus/crisis/tragedy — brings, if we do not course-correct and put our children first, the circle of life will be fractured.

And that may ultimately leave humanity not only morally bankrupt — but with no future to protect.

"Commentary: I disagree strongly with Marjorie Taylor Greene's past statements. However, it would be dangerous for the House to punish her for them.","Like many people, I was pretty appalled when the extent of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's social media history began to reach the public consciousness in the last couple of weeks. Certainly, I do not approve of the idea of taking violent action against members of Congress, nor do I think that the Rothschilds are starting forest fires with space lasers. I have absolutely no use for QAnon or its nutty prophecies that never come true. I do not doubt that the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, happened. If given the choice, I would not vote for anyone who held or espoused these views.

All of that being said, what the Democrats are attempting to do to Greene is dangerous and should not be tolerated, either by the House GOP conference or by Democrats.

Greene herself says that she did not make many of these claims and that they were posted to her social media by members of her ""team"" without her knowledge. I have no idea whether that is true or not, but let's assume for a moment that Greene wrote and said all these things herself. Even so, any sort of punitive action taken against her for these comments would set a dangerous precedent that every member of the House should oppose.

The key determining factor here is that Greene made these comments before she was elected or took office. They were posted to her public social media accounts. We must therefore assume that the voters who elected her either knew about them, or had the opportunity to know about them, and chose to elect her anyway. And that really ought to seal the deal.

As repulsive as members from all other 434 Congressional districts might find Greene's pre-election statements and views, they are simply not in an acceptable position to pass judgment on the decision of the voters in her district to send her to Congress to do a job. I am quite sure that the voters in Greene's district find many of the things believed by, say, Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) to be horrifying; however, members of Congress are not elected to pass judgment on what views are acceptable for other duly elected members of Congress to hold.

If the House wishes to discipline a duly elected member of Congress by stripping committee assignments, the practice should be reserved only for egregious behavior committed by that member while in office, like what happened with former Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). In that circumstance, it could be argued that King's comments brought disrepute upon the House based upon behavior that had not, as yet, been considered by his voters. In such a circumstance, stripping King of his committee assignments was at least defensible, even if you believe (as I do) that such a measure should be used sparingly and only in dire circumstances.

Punishing a member for pre-election wrongthink — no matter how wrong that think might be — would start us down a very dark path indeed. Now, the Democrats control the levers of power in the House and feel confident removing Greene because so many people nationwide disapprove of her comments. What happens when they decide that everyone who is or has been at any point in time opposed to gay marriage should also be stripped of their committee assignments? What happens when they expand that to everyone who opposes Medicare for All? What happens when Republicans regain power (as eventually they will) and turn it on Democrats?

Whatever you or I might think about Greene and her past history, one ineradicable fact remains: The voters in her district just voted to send her to Congress in a legal and fair election in spite of those views. Whether you or I or anyone else disagrees with that decision is a moot point, at least until the next election rolls around. If either Democrats or Republicans find it distasteful to serve alongside someone with those views, then they can employ the DCCC or NRCC to find someone to run against her and use advertising money to amplify that message to the voters in her district.

Until that time, unless Greene says something that is completely beyond the pale while she is in office, she should not be disciplined by members who were elected to represent other districts.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-marjorie-taylor-greenes-house-punish,2021-02-04
Deace: Anger is the only right response to the government's COVID abuse. Apathy will kill us.,"When you see damning testimony about the true origins of COVID-19 or how negative impacts of the vaccines are being covered up as we saw last week, anger isn't optional.

You should feel anger at a level that can't help but stir you to righteous action. It should come to you reflexively as the citizen of a country founded in liberty, no different from a drowning man seeking out a gasp of saving breath. One way or another, a life worth living is at stake.

Having enemies, I understand and expect this side of eternity. But doing nothing about them — even emboldening them — rather than be bothered to risk anything, or take a stand, is such a foreign concept to me that I almost want my enemies to have their way at times just so the chronically ambivalent wearing my jersey get what they deserve.

See, I'm not struggling with the whole ""don't hate enemies"" thing. I'm struggling with not hating some of my so-called friends.

I hate the willful ignorance. I hate the excuses. I hate the cowardice. It comes down to a simple math: While I know more often than not we can defeat my enemies given a fair fight, I also know none of it matters if our sense of civic virtue and duty has been so gutted that such a win will neither be recognized or sustained. I mean, what do you do if you try to save a man from drowning and he responds with ""breathing is overrated""?

Here in Iowa, we have been blessed more than most states during COVID in terms of the quality of our leadership and the relative openness with which were left to carry on our daily lives. Yet lest that be honored and appreciated by our local smart set, as soon as a single judge overturned the will of our state legislature (where have I ever heard that before?) and overturned a ban on mask mandates, five of the largest and most prominent school districts in the Greater Des Moines area couldn't race fast enough last week to demand each and every kid once again breathe all of their oxygen through a useless Chinese face diaper.

And there the residents of those school districts went, grabbing their ankles and complying rather than tarring and feathering the flat-earth bastards who did this to their children. Let me remind you again why sometimes I struggle not to root for the evil to punish the foolishly gutless.

King Théoden once lamented, ""What can men do against such reckless hate?"" He had it easy, though. How about what can men do against such reckless apathy? I'll take his problem any day. We have little time left to correct our course. Thankfully, we have been given a great place to start this fall when school board elections come around. They will be the first nationwide elections held since the presidential rip-off of 2020 and are an unmistakable opportunity to send a message about our priorities and viability as a free people.

To that end, every local election is national now and every national election is local. It's up to us to know the issues and understand the consequences of failure. If we don't, we deserve what we get. Please, for the love of God, please remember that you are called to something far greater than Netflix and chill.

What are you prepared to do?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-anger-is-the-only-right-response-to-the-governments-covid-abuse-apathy-will-kill-us,2021-09-24
"Deace: The only 'tradition' in marriage is one man, one woman — and leaving it behind got us to today's trans madness","My initial reaction to seeing the group called “Gays Against Groomers” come into existence last year was to pop some popcorn.

Then again, to be fair, you could replace the word “gay” with just about anything else and you would have my attention. Lumberjacks Against Groomers. Sign me up. Bolivia Against Groomers. Love that place. Shrimp Scampi Against Groomers. Delicious.



But with the whole Gays Against Groomers thing, we were in for an extra-special treat. We were going to see just how far self-awareness and critical thinking were prepared to go in reestablishing levels of decency and order that have been so quickly lost via godless propaganda. In other words, would the gays in question truly be willing to go all the way in diagnosing what you and I know to be obviously true about the genesis of the current gender-bending contagion – gay marriage – or would they ultimately plead the fifth and refuse to self-incriminate?



Well, we have our answer. And it is disappointing.



First let me say, though, that such a final verdict doesn’t mean I believe Gays Against Groomers to be a scam, ineffective, or unwelcome. Quite the contrary. The group’s absolute disgust for how children are being sacrificed in the volcano of perverse adult sexual gratification seems utterly genuine, as does their resolve to persist in upsetting the apple cart of the groomer cartel no matter how many names they are called or ways they are canceled. For that I am thankful. Our children need all the allies they can get in that regard.



Yet there has always been an aspect of the group’s advocacy that has stepped away from the defense of innocent children and focuses on a defense of itself instead. We had a great thing going by securing new “rights,” they say, but all this trans stuff is mucking up the works. Then earlier this week, that argument finally jumped the shark.



The Gays Against Groomers Twitter account posted a graphic of the new-style transgender flag and the original rainbow gay pride flag side by side. Under the transgender flag were the words “reject modernity.” Under the rainbow flag were the words “embrace tradition.”



This is the part of our story where self-awareness goes to die.



Let’s check the math, shall we? When people like me told gay marriage advocates that the “traditional” biblical definition of marriage was between one man and one woman, we were called haters, zealots, and bigots. But now that gay marriage has been on the historical scene for all of five seconds, we are meant to assent to it as a tradition as obvious and immortal as the tides or the rising and setting of the sun?



They can’t have it both ways, whether in the philosophical or, maybe even more importantly, the practical sense. For we live in a world where the band formerly known as “Born This Way” — which would infer a relatively static statistical comparison across generations – changed its name to “666 Genders” faster than you can say drag queen story hour.

According to Gallup, the share of American adults who identify as queer doubled from 2012 to 2021, and within Generation Z the LGBTQ population doubled in just four years – from 10.5 to 20.8 percent – between 2017 and 2021.



Hmm ... let's see. What could have happened that may have kick-started this not-remotely-born-this-way trend? Could it be the Varnum v. Brien state supreme court ruling that redefined marriage in my home state of Iowa in 2009? Or the steroid booster that and other state rulings received from the U.S. Supreme Court’s U.S. v. Windsor ruling in 2013?



Probably just a weird coincidence. Or, whether it be Gays Against Groomers or the many churches that now prioritize rainbow flags over the cross, it is the entire fricking point.

Not only does marriage have a very clear definition, but one of such cosmic importance that it simply can’t be compromised on any level. Otherwise you inevitably get what Federalist writer Anna James Zeigler recently observed on Twitter when confronting the latest in sex-based debauchery to cross her path: Sex between siblings.



“People are dunking on this woman who advertised that she is sleeping with her brother, & that's fine, but this is where we are headed,” Zeigler said. “If Love is Love, then Love is Love. Maybe rethink states having the power to make a few marriage laws?”



Exactly right. There is no in-between on this issue. Either we are God’s or completely off the cliff. So be against the groomers by all means. I insist. Just make sure your asterisks or fine print don’t destine all of your hard work to failure in the end. Because the truth is that graphic from Gays Against Groomers is as true as it gets, just not for the reason they're claiming. After all, the gender-bending mouth of madness we are descending into as a society didn't appear out of nowhere via osmosis, but from the “tradition” of the original rainbow flag Gays Against Groomers wants to embrace.



Let us not have trans traditions any more than we have trans genders, for there is but one actual tradition here. One man. One woman. Till death do us part. The end.

Horowitz: Facebook’s ‘independent’ fact checker on vaccines is funded by … you guessed it,"Accurate information about the vaccines and other vital COVID-related topics hinges upon the ability to disseminate the facts on major social media platforms like Facebook. In turn, Facebook relies on FactCheck.org, among other shady organizations, to rule on what information is admissible. FactCheck.org is funded by a grant from an organization run by Obama's former CDC director, whose assets contain Johnson & Johnson stock. In other words, the vaccine companies control the flow of information about vaccines. Welcome to the world of ""independent fact checkers.""

Over the past year, Facebook has censored nearly every one of my articles and commentaries questioning the science behind lockdowns or mask mandates. More recently, it has placed a blockade on any information raising questions about the vaccines. Facebook has also blocked people from sharing my articles promoting cheap, lifesaving drugs, such as ivermectin, or even studies showing how sufficient doses of vitamin D and zinc can prevent critical illness from SARS-CoV-2.

In each instance of censorship, Facebook has posted a notice misleading anyone who wishes to share the article into thinking that the particular points raised in the article were independently fact-checked and found to be false. First, it's critical to note that almost no article Facebook employees censor is fact-checked by anyone; they merely rely on an initial fact-check of one person's article critical of masks — just to give an example — and then trot out that same fact-check as an excuse for zapping any article questioning the wisdom of mask-wearing, even if the points raised in said article are completely different from the issues addressed in the first fact-check.

However, there is something much more insidious going on with the fact-checking industry. The inmates are running the asylum and the foxes are guarding the henhouse. When the vaccines began to be dispensed to the public in December, FactCheck.org started ""SciCheck's COVID-19/Vaccination Project"" to specifically focus on the flow of information pertaining to the vaccines. The site has a disclaimer on the top of the website stating: ""SciCheck's COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.""

Comically, the next sentence reads, ""The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation.""

In fact, the views expressed almost assuredly do reflect the views of the foundation. FactCheck.org claims, ""The goal is to increase exposure to accurate information about COVID-19 and vaccines, while decreasing the impact of misinformation."" Yet have you ever seen the organization offer balanced coverage or flag a single post on the other side of this debate as false, no matter how outlandish the claim might be, including articles advocating experimental emergency use authorization vaccines for little children?

Indeed, we all know the goal is to promote only positive information and zero concerns about the vaccine at all costs. Facebook, which is the largest promoter of their work, has openly made this its policy.



The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which is one of the largest supporters of this project, just happens to get 15% of its assets through Johnson & Johnson stock, according to its 2019 financial statement! And the CEO of the foundation is none other than Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC under Obama and ABC News' former chief health and medical editor. This is ""the system"" at its best! The only ""independent"" arbiter of fair news about the vaccines must come from a source tied to one of the very makers of this vaccine, with billions of dollars on the line. The government, media, and social media are all bound by a circuitous web of corrupt influence, misinformation, and cowardly censorship.

Remember, the omnibus bill that passed in December contained $1 billion of taxpayer funding to help market the vaccine. Thus, the regulation of speech through social media is not, at its core, coming from a private free market.

One of the most anti-scientific and self-serving lies promoted by FactCheck is the government-vaccine complex misinformation that somehow there is no natural immunity to this virus and that those already infected must be vaccinated, thereby incurring the risks of an experimental gene therapy for nothing.

Rep. Thomas Massie forced the CDC to correct a report that implied there is evidence that the current vaccines on the market can convey a greater degree of immunity than prior infection. FactCheck.org cannot allow Massie to get away with taking away market share from its donors by dissuading people with prior infection from getting the vaccines, so the site wrote a hit piece on him trying to suggest that he had made an error.

With over 3,400 reported deaths and tens of thousands of adverse reactions reported to the CDC's surveillance system – and it's well known that just a fraction of those events are reported – how can we allow the government to actively work with a corporate and tech monopoly, funded by the very people who stand to benefit, to censor important data, science, and medical information? We have already seen the government temporarily suspend one vaccine, while the CEO of Pfizer conveniently waited until people already got sucked in to say they will need a third shot and likely more. Nothing to see here? Pure as the wind-driven snow?

Based on the CDC's own statements in recent months, people like Fauci were wrong about surface transmission, they were wrong about sowing fear about outdoor transmission , they were wrong about limiting indoor transmission to droplets and six feet and therefore wrong about masks; they were wrong about Florida vs. lockdown states, and they were wrong about shutting schools and rampant child transmission. Are we really to believe that there is no need to have a fair and open debate about accurate information about an experimental and rushed vaccine built upon new biotechnology?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-facebooks-independent-fact-checker-on-vaccines-is-funded-by--you-guessed-it,2021-04-27
Horowitz: Florida judge creates constitutional right to ballot-harvesting while virtue-signaling over Ukraine,"You don’t have a right to breathe without gagging your mouth, but you do have a right to access mail-in ballots from private third parties indiscriminately mailed to your home. Put another way, government has to accommodate your convenience preferences for voting but can take action against your body and create apartheid for those who don’t engage in medical experiments. That is the worldview of Florida federal Judge Mark Walker.

SB 90, signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis last May, prohibited unsolicited mailing of ballots, drop boxes, ballot-harvesting by third parties, and the use of private money in the administration of elections.

In a racist, political screed that was more political than what is typically debated even in the political branches of government, Judge Walker of the Northern District of Florida declared much of SB 90 unconstitutional, thereby concocting a right to ballot harvesting, drop-off boxes without surveillance, and other government hand-holding of voters through the use of private organizations with a political agenda.

""For the past 20 years, the majority in the Florida Legislature has attacked the voting rights of its Black constituents,"" Walker wrote, thinking his unelected position is worth more than a democratically elected legislature.

Mind you, he could never cite any proof of intentional discrimination against any particular group. “Skilled and well-respected judges from multiple courts examined the provisions discussed above, and they all found that the Florida Legislature did not enact them with the intent to discriminate based on race,” conceded Walker. But then he ruled that because he believes it has “discriminatory effect,” “this Court cannot ignore other relevant evidence of intent just because it does not fit neatly under a particular factor.”

This is very politically convenient for him. Yet the fact that minorities tend to vote Democrat doesn’t vest Democrats with greater power or extra rights to mandate more voting procedures and conveniences any more than rural white voters could demand more conveniences in voting in more spread-out polling locations in the country because providing such service helps the Republican Party.

One could conjure up a disparate impact theory to attack any election law on the assumption that these administrative procedures will help or hurt one particular group based on their habits, culture, and location. But that doesn’t mean the law is discriminatory. For example, if Republicans succeed in gaming out early voting on Saturdays at rural gun clubs the same way Democrats have succeed in past get-out-the-vote efforts on Sunday with black churches, does that mean the state must provide early voting on Saturday?

Ironically, as Walker accuses the governor of discriminating against Latino as well as black voters on some provisions, he does concede that it’s not quite as bad. Why? “Latino Floridians are not particularly affiliated with either party,” he notes. Clearly, he is reading the polls showing DeSantis with a strong approval rating among those voters. Thus, the entirety of constitutional rights, according to Walker, hinges upon the voting preferences of voters. If black voters began to swing away from the Democrats as much as Latinos, I’m sure he would suddenly be fine with banning ballot-harvesting and drop boxes.

The judge’s opinion was rife with political rhetoric, citation of op-eds, and even a footnote virtue-signaling over how amazingly democratic Ukrainians are fighting for the right to vote. “The current war in Ukraine, in which the Ukrainian people are fighting and dying to maintain the freedoms we take for granted—namely, the right to have a voice and not to be ruled by a despot—provides a poignant reminder of both the value and fragility of democracy,” wrote Walker in the first footnote of the 288-page polemic.

In many respects he is not wrong. The voting model created by the Soros-backed voter fraud industry has actually made our elections very similar to those in Ukraine. When was the last time they had fair elections in Ukraine?

Walker has a history of acting as a super-legislature over voting issues and even had to recuse himself in one case because his wife served as the attorney representing the plaintiffs in one of the cases.

The entire premise of his opinion was built upon the fact that anyone who is not white is incapable of voting unless the government essentially allows voter fraud organizations to serve the vote up on a platter. At a time when negative inalienable rights are being terminated – you know, like the right to breathe or to access public accommodation without being subjected to medical experimentation – Walker is creating affirmative “rights” to active government assistance, of course, through the conduit of left-wing organizations.

Walker also mandated that the state submit any voter law changes to his highness for the next 10 years. Perhaps he will mandate internet voting one day. Or maybe he will render all votes of non-white voters for the Democrat Party even if they don’t vote, because, you know, that’s how they really want to vote but they are just incapable of articulating or acting upon it without the assistance of Walker’s allied street organizers.

Walker says that the ban on private groups acting like election judges is somehow tantamount to blocking people from handing out water at the polls. Yet other judges like Walker have turned down lawsuits from people forced to wear masks in order to vote. Rape victims and those with disabilities were told they couldn’t vote in many states without harming their breathing, yet if you don’t allow street agitators to offer solicitations of public ballots or a drop box outside an official election office, you are violating the Constitution and harming those with disabilities. Your rights don’t come from God; they come from government and can be added or deleted at the whims of tyrants like Walker.

We could dismiss this judge as one lone kook, but this is the prevailing ideology among the entire leftist political movement, and it’s most evident in legal circles. These people not only reject fundamental rights, but they have inverted constitutional rights completely upside down in order to enshrine their behaviors, political goals, and values as the new rights. You don’t have freedom from government, but you have a right to affirmative benefits they deem auspicious to their cause.

DeSantis perfectly summed up the screed disguised as a legal opinion. “There’s an old saying in law,” said Mr. DeSantis. “If you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have the law on your side, argue the law. If you have neither, you pound the table. Well, this is the judicial equivalent of pounding the table.” The governor believes that the decision will be overturned by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The question remains whether the damage will be done for the upcoming elections this cycle.



During the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, James Madison assuaged the concerns of his Virginia colleagues leery of a new federal government by noting that Congress wouldn’t interfere in election laws and procedures. ""It was found necessary to leave the regulation of [federal elections], in the first place, to the state governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of the people,"" stated the Founding Father. Imagine if he had been told that one day a single man from the unelected branch of the federal government could mandate ballot-harvesting by one party’s organizations.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-florida-judge-creates-constitutional-right-to-ballot-harvesting-while-virtue-signaling-over-ukraine,2022-04-01
Horowitz: Former Trump budget director proposes model balanced budget for GOP to run with,"One of the excuses given for passing an omnibus bill in the lame-duck session is that a new GOP-controlled House won’t have enough time to deal with rewriting the entire fiscal year 2023 budget right when it’s sworn in with so much on its plate. Well, Russ Vought of the Center for Renewing America, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, released a budget blueprint doing all the work for the legislators. It balances the budget in 10 years by focusing mainly on cutting woke and weaponized bureaucracies rather than popular programs, which makes it very hard for Democrats to demagogue. Now it’s time to stand behind this blueprint and begin messaging its key points headed into next year’s budget fight.



For many years, Republicans wrongly communicated the message that the only way to get our fiscal house in order is to focus mainly on cutting entitlements. Because they never really intended to touch that hot potato, they gave up on cutting spending altogether and actually went along with every Democrat spending increase of every harmful bureaucratic agency funded under the annual appropriations process as “discretionary spending.”

However, although the discretionary spending is smaller than the entitlement spending, it is still significant. Moreover, the cost of those agencies and policies is much greater than their appropriations price tag. They destroy the fabric of our country through woke policies and fascistic power grabs that harm life, liberty, and property. For example, the budget authority for the EPA is about $9 billion, sadly considered a paltry sum relative to our $6 trillion annual budget. However, its true cost is in the hundreds of billions it takes out of our economy in terms of lost energy production, defective and junky products, lost jobs, and massive energy-driven inflation. Ditto for so many of the agencies governing land use, minerals, energy, and manufacturing in the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Labor.

Can one place a price tag on the CDC and NIH and what they have unleashed upon our civilization? Or the FBI surveilling and arresting political opponents?

“Budgeting is too often an exercise in accounting and austerity, where every program takes a hit, rather than an opportunity to examine what in fact the country is spending money on,” wrote Vought in his introduction. “Nor is budgeting typically aimed at maintaining a political coalition necessary to vote for the plan. It should be. The Left has no interest in ever regaining fiscal rationality. Why should their spending priorities be protected? Particularly when such programs are damaging the very communities supporting the government with their taxes. Why should billions be spent on thousands of interwoven nonprofits, all with a vested interest in furthering multiculturalism through an open border strategy and engaging in lawfare against any effort to control the border?”

A perfect example Vought focuses on in his budget is cutting HUD’s Section 8 program. Overall, his proposal cuts HUD’s budget by 43% because the department’s policies “spread crime and dysfunction into safe neighborhoods as part of ‘affordable housing’ activism hostile towards single-family homes.”

Under each section of the budget, the blueprint targets specific legal policies that should be defunded or terminated. Individually, many of them represent only an infinitesimal portion of the national budget, but their impact on our lives, liberty, property, and character as a nation is priceless – not in a good way.

As for the military, unlike every other GOP budget, which indiscriminately throws money at the military, this budget would roughly maintain the status quo on top-line spending ($8.4 trillion as opposed to $8.9 trillion over 10 years). However, the funding would be focused on the hardware and capabilities needed to deter China, while entire woke and broke programs would be cut. Foreign aid would also be dramatically trimmed.

Yet these cuts, and the ensuing growth and unshackling of the economy they would induce (assuming a reasonable 2.7% average GDP growth rate), would result in $12.3 trillion in lower spending over 10 years. The result would be a balanced budget by 2032 rather than a $2.2 trillion deficit, as projected under the current baseline. And again, this is all done without cutting Medicare or Social Security.

Furthermore, by stripping the bureaucracies of the ability to destroy our economy from within, it would preclude things like COVID fascism from ever happening again. Remember, our government spent $5.5 trillion on COVID, not to mention an almost equal sum from Federal Reserve shenanigans. That is money that was never projected in previous budget plans, but it was unleashed upon us. Controlled demolitions, including energy lockdowns, will undoubtedly occur again unless the bureaucracies are cut, their policies banned, and their circuitous collaboration with “private” companies and NGOs neutered. That is where the battle not just for civilization but for fiscal sanity will be won or lost, not with Social Security and Medicare.

Aside from policy riders that would ban unconstitutional, illogical, or immoral government policies and programs, the budget targets some of the woke and weaponized agencies and programs for across-the-board cuts. Here is a snippet from the budget summary:

7% cut to the DOJ, including a 13% cut to the FBI intelligence and counterintelligence programs (while increasing resources for actual crime fighting by 18%).

$22 billion or 20% cut to HHS, including a 37% cut to the CDC to refocus its efforts toward fighting infectious diseases and away from sexually transmitted and chronic diseases, a 50% cut to NIAID (led by Anthony Fauci) because of its commitment to gain-of-function research, and eliminating woke bureaucracy.

$26 billion or 43% cut to HUD, including a three-year phase-out of Section 8 grants that are a magnet for crime and decreased property values and cuts to the fair housing bureaucracy committed to breaking up neighborhoods with single-family homes.

$26 billion or 45% cut to foreign aid, ensuring that State and USAID are no longer funding drag shows in Ecuador, the training of LGBT activists in Senegal, or gay pride parades in Prague.

$18 billion or 26% cut to the Department of Education’s bureaucracy funding CRT and ensuring that states avoid this bureaucracy with a large block grant.

Obviously, once we restore our civilization, we will be in a stronger position to deal with Social Security down the road. As for Medicare and Medicaid, we must first rebuild a parallel health care system built upon freedom, science, direct primary care, and decentralization, in order to transition people into something much better than these ailing socialist programs.

House Republicans must make it clear that the budget deadline should expire early next year and that something akin to this blueprint will be their messaging and red line. They should pass a budget along these lines and refuse to move off it. They should make it clear today that they have zero plans to pass a Democrat budget and will expose the harms of funding a woke and weaponized government every day through briefings, press conferences, and hearings, including through a government shutdown if necessary. Doing this will take Social Security and Medicare off the table as a distraction through which Democrats can obfuscate their harmful and unpopular policies.



Right now, we are drowning in tyranny and literally life-threatening biomedical security policies. We must focus on the life raft. Now we just need a speaker willing to take up the mantle.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-former-trump-budget-director-proposes-model-balanced-budget-for-gop-to-run-with,2022-12-08
Horowitz: From Gen. Patton to ‘feminist’ generals wearing masks and promoting motherhood as warfare,"""Be all that you can be!"" Where men can be women and women can be men; where soldiers must wear masks all day on American bases but can't carry firearms; where the entire purpose of the military is to fight other countries' battles but not the one at our border; where getting women to act like men is the only religion allowed in the military, except when they invariably can't meet the standards and the military lowers them to make them ""fair"" for all.

That is sadly the state of play in what was once the pride of the nation, after decades of the left rotting out our armed forces with left-wing politicians serving as generals.

For many years, conservatives have known that military leadership has become politicized. The focus shifted from combat readiness to social experimentation, and the left finally conquered the one institution that was considered a bastion of traditional American values. But Tucker Carlson has now exposed that it's worse than even we realized.

Last Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson commented on Biden's celebration of the military becoming more feminine: ""While China's military becomes more masculine, as it's assembled the world's largest navy,"" America focuses on making our military ""become more feminine — whatever feminine means any more, since men and women no longer exist.""

Tucker was commentating on Biden's celebration of the military making apparel for women, including ""designing body armor that fits women properly; tailoring combat uniforms for women; creating maternity flight suits; updating — updating requirements for their hairstyles.""

Carlson prefaced his critique of the president with his now famous line, ""So we've got new hairstyles and maternity flight suits.""

""Pregnant women are going to fight our wars. It's a mockery of the U.S. military,"" Carlson added on his show Tuesday. Carlson drove home the point by noting how ""the Pentagon is going along with it"" and that this entire feminine focus ""is a mockery of the U.S. military and its core mission, which is winning wars.""

For most Americans with common sense, Tucker was expressing their anger and sorrow at what has happened to our military over the years. What none of us expected was the response of the military leaders from all service branches sending out memes about Amazonian women and outright celebrating the concept of pregnant women in combat. Reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh's parody ""we're fierce, we're feminists, and we're in your face,"" many active-duty feminist generals sent out social media memes basically suggesting that women are the strongest and most effective part of combat readiness, taking the absurdity of gender-bending to the next level and exemplifying Tucker's point better than he could have on his show.

Putting aside the absurd values and strategy behind this gender-bending agenda, it's quite shocking how active-duty generals are able to spar with a civilian media figure to this extent. It's one thing for the secretary of defense to engage in political battles, but we have never seen active-duty military allowed to become so political. It's as if they are trying to compensate for 20 years of egregious rules of engagement and lack of mission clarity by training their fire on a civilian with no holds barred. Now we know why we've been in Afghanistan for 20 years.



As for the substance of the gender-bending argument, how many of you actually believe that a military leadership so dedicated to promoting women in combat really remains neutral when it comes to passing women through the combat training tests? Well, just one month ago, before Tucker prompted the generals to tout women as stronger than men, the Army Times reported that the military is considering halting its gender-neutral Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) test, as female soldiers were failing at a rate of 65%, in order to make it fair to both genders.

So, much like having both sexes compete together in sports, women are exactly like men, until they are not. Which is perhaps why Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is now promoting ""mindfulness and yoga"" as part of combat readiness – of course, while wearing masks.

A Pentagon study has found up to 65% of women were failing the ACFT, compared to just 10% for men, according to the Telegraph. Lt. Col. Margaret Kageleiry of TRADOC told the Army Times last month that the Army ""is looking at means to apply those scores based on gender to account for biological differences.""



Oh, so you mean there are actually biological differences that make life-and-death differences in combat readiness? Who knew?

The reality is that the Marines already studied this issue very carefully in 2015, but their findings were ignored. When Obama began integrating women into infantry and other combat units, the Marine Corps, under General Joseph Dunford, was the only service branch to question this absurdity. The service conducted a study of 400 Marines (300 male and 100 female) over many months at a cost of $36 million, in which all-male teams and integrated teams were studied performing numerous tasks similar to those they would carry out in real-life combat. In infantry testing, in nearly every category, mixed teams came up short compared to the all-male teams.

Here are some key points, according to a summary of the report:

Overall, the all-male teams outperformed teams with integrated female members 69% of the time, in 94 out of 134 tasks.

All-male teams were faster than integrated teams in every tactical movement, and this was especially evident when heavy crew-served weapons were being moved. This held true across all Military Operational Specialties (MOSs).

The all-male teams were more accurate shots than the integrated teams across all weapons systems. This included male Marines trained as infantrymen and those in a different MOS who were part of the testing.

The all-male teams performed much better on routine combat tasks. When climbing an eight-foot wall, male Marines would toss their packs to the top, whereas female Marines ""required regular assistance getting their packs to the top."" When carrying out mock evacuations of casualties, all-male teams were much faster except in cases where the evacuee was carried in a fireman's carry, and then it was usually a male Marine doing the carrying.

The top 25% of females overlapped with the bottom 25% of male Marines in the study for anaerobic power, and the top 10% of females corresponded with the bottom 50% of males for anaerobic capacity.

Most importantly, the female participants sustained significantly higher injury rates and levels of fatigue than their male counterparts. In the Infantry Training Battalion, females were injured at six times the rate of male Marines.

It's important to keep in mind that these were some of the strongest and most talented female Marines, drawn from graduates of the Infantry Training Battalion. Yet at the end of the day, combat is a job only for the strongest and most resilient of men, not just average men, which is why it makes no sense to promote an agenda of women in infantry units.

Overall, the results showed that while some exceptional and unusual women might be capable of serving in the infantry in a vacuum, even they would lag far behind their male counterparts and end up slowing down their units or placing themselves or others in unnecessary danger.



The study and the recent admission from the Pentagon about women failing the ACFT – despite five years of moving heaven and earth to get as many women through it as possible – prove the simple yet blunt conclusion of a 1992 report from the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces correct:

Unnecessary distraction or any dilution of the combat effectiveness puts the mission and lives in jeopardy. Risking the lives of a military unit in combat to provide career opportunities or accommodate the personal desires or interests of an individual, or group of individuals, is more than bad military judgment. It is morally wrong.

So much for ""following the science."" Women in combat was the original ""wear your mask to stop the spread."" In both cases, politics trumps science. It's just a matter of time before they begin celebrating pregnant female Navy SEALs.

Now the same Marine Corps is attacking Tucker on Twitter for essentially opining on what its own study showed. The military is also abusing the soldiers with endless mask-wearing while performing exhausting physical exercises, while the science has shown that it has failed to stop the spread among these predominantly young recruits who are not even in danger from the virus.

The same generals promoting gender-bending are the same ones proposing masks, endless nation-building follies, and more Saudi military recruits – while opposing using troops at our own border and arming soldiers on their own bases. Donald Trump was right when he said in 2016 that our generals have been ""reduced to rubble.""

Meanwhile, all civilians should be asking themselves the following question: Does China actually fear a military wearing masks and run by feminist generals?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-from-gen-patton-to-feminist-generals-wearing-masks-and-promoting-motherhood-as-warfare,2021-03-16
Horowitz: Iowa conservatives introduce gold standard bill to fight the dangerous COVID mandate,"There is nothing free-market about ""private"" businesses joining in the violation of the Nuremberg Code. In fact, the entire concept of a rushed therapeutic that wanes quickly and causes a shocking number of known and unknown injuries never would have gotten off the ground under the free market. Socialism, subsidization, monopolization, government using taxpayer funding to create, market, coerce, censor, and reshape society with the shot — all the while being exempt from legal liability — are the only reasons why any business even under 100 employees, much less a larger business, would be mandating it at this point. The only effective, prudent, fair, and free-market position is to use equal and opposing force to restore the balance of the free market. It's show time for the state legislatures.

Legislative bodies throughout the country are meeting over the next few weeks to debate measures that would counter the mandates being illegally promulgated by the Biden administration. Most GOP-controlled states are going to take some form of action, but the question is whether they will take the right action or be intimidated by the visceral response of the big business and health care cartel that has become a giant arm of government tyranny. Several Iowa lawmakers have put together a bill that is the gold standard of what other red states should adopt this coming week.

The crux of the bill, Iowa SF 193, sponsored by Sens. Guth, Johnson, Schultz, Whiting, and Carlin, categorically bans all human rights violations in relation to ""Pfizer"" government mandates. It prohibits an employer from failing or refusing to hire, discharge, penalize, or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment based on the employee's vaccination history or the refusal of the employee to receive a vaccine or provide proof of immunity. It provides a cause of action in court to anyone discriminated against, along with a prescribed remedy of back pay plus 10% from the employer.

This is what we do in the context of every other form of discrimination, including when employers legitimately terminate problematic workers. So, until we get rid of all those laws and the EEOC at the federal level, we don't need to hear about ""the free market.""

Next, rather than providing an exception to this rule for hospitals and health care settings, this bill specifically bans any discrimination against health care workers or discrimination on the treatment side for patients in a health care setting. It spells out every form of medical professional, including medical students and residents. Importantly, this bill bars any health care provider licensing authority from denying or revoking a license to any applicant because they decline the shot.

At this point, it is abundantly clear that the shots provide no more protection against transmission than not having the shots, which makes any form of any mandate unjustified, even if we are to believe one can govern another's body. For example, in health care settings, where health organizations are arguing that they must protect cancer patients who didn't get the shot, those patients are at least as likely to get the virus from a supposed vaccinated person as from an unvaccinated person, especially if the latter individual already had the virus. Moreover, research has consistently shown that people within 14 days of the first or second shot are the most vulnerable to catching COVID because of the suboptimal levels of antibodies. Having thousands of health care workers suddenly get the shots within a period of a few weeks would expose those patients to the most risk in health care settings.

Another important provision of the Iowa bill is that it bars all insurance companies from discriminating against those who don't get the shot. This means they cannot reject; deny; limit; cancel; refuse to renew; increase the premiums for; limit the amount, extent, or kind of coverage available to; or otherwise adversely affect eligibility or coverage for the group health policy, contract, or plan for health insurance.

We'd all love to live with a market in which any providers can offer any insurance plan they wish. But that ship sailed with Obamacare. The only things worse than full socialist mandates are half-manipulated mandates, which induce totalitarianism in addition to socialism. Thanks to Obamacare, we cannot start our own insurance companies because of the actuarily insolvent mandates. Yet the same government that pushed universal coverage now gets to manipulate the government-sponsored ""private"" monopoly companies to bar coverage for large groups of people based on zero scientific evidence. Repeal Obamacare, and then we will remove this provision. Until then, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

Next, the bill bars any owner or manager of a public accommodation from discriminating in services against someone who has not taken the shot. Again, this virus has been used as an excuse to prohibit all landowners from evicting anyone, including those who are disruptive, destructive, and late on rent. We will not allow the socialists to use their control over the ""private"" sector to suddenly encourage them to discriminate against people with no cause. I'm fine with ending most discrimination laws. But if we are going to have them, the worst outcome is for government to manipulate a perfectly perverse standard of who is subject to them and who is exempt from them. When businesses can deny services or employment to those with HIV or with certain sexual behaviors, or thwart Obamacare, Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, OSHA, and ADA regulations, then come back to me about ""the private sector can do what they want.""

More provisions of SF 193 include the following:

A prohibition on including someone's immunization status on their driver's license.

Expansion of the exemption process for vaccine requirements in schools related to existing vaccines.

Anyone administering the vaccine must obtain written consent from the patient prior to reporting the administration of the vaccine or immunization to the statewide immunization registry.

At present, all private businesses over 100 employees are on the hook for a looming federal mandate to require a shot that the government has essentially created and manipulated with taxpayer funding that the free market never would have sustained. Both government and the pharmaceutical companies are exempt from liability. This is not free market; this is fascism. As such, for any state to merely pass a neutral law without providing equal and opposing force to prohibit (rather than exempt from) the federal mandate is not an exercise in free market ethos but in submission to totalitarianism.

How come none of these business and health organizations cried bloody murder about ""rights of the private sector"" when governors placed the ultimate regulation on them – a crippling shutdown or cumbersome capacity mandates? In this case, they are not regulating affirmative expensive compliance measures – just simply a dictate to apply existing discrimination and health privacy law to where it's needed most in order to counter Nuremberg violations by the federal government. Private business owners don't need to lift a finger and spend any time or money on this. Just don't harass your workers. ""Well, we're scared of COVID,"" they are saying. In that case, you have the shot, so what do you care about someone else not getting it?

The private sector or free market did not conjure up the riskiest and leakiest shot in history or mask-wearing; it was all induced by the federal government through fear, intimidation, misinformation, threats, and censorship. In the case of big business and health care, there has been downright collaboration with the federal government at every stage – a violation of the ultimate antitrust principles.



Therefore, every state has an obligation to interpose between the federal coercion and the safety of the people. Allowing every business in every state to remain a conduit for that federal tyranny is not respect for private rights. It's collaboration with a very dark tunnel of tyranny. We don't want to discover what's on the other side.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-iowa-conservatives-introduce-gold-standard-bill-to-fight-the-dangerous-covid-mandate,2021-10-15
Horowitz: Media coverage of Columbus shooting exposes their BLM agenda as a fraud,"It's clear as day from the video footage that 16-year-old Columbus, Ohio, resident Ma'Khia Bryant was swinging a knife at another girl and that cops told her to put the knife down before shooting her. Yet the media are still stoking another Floyd mob outrage over this incident and is insinuating that she might not have had a knife. They don't care that police were saving a black victim of an attempted homicide. It is this mentality and media strategy that will continue to result in thousands of more homicide victims, mainly black.

The New York Times claims ""officials said"" Bryant had a knife rather than publishing the truth that ""the video shows"" she had a knife. Black Lives Matter is still on the attack and acting as if police murdered Bryant in cold blood. The AP tweeted, ""Police shot and killed a teenage Black girl in Columbus, Ohio, just as the verdict was being announced in the trial for the killing of George Floyd. Bodycam footage appeared to show the girl attempting to stab two people with a knife.""

This is where we are in America today. Any time police are forced to shoot a violent criminal who happens to be black, the expectation is that there is a right to riot. The nerve of police to defend victims on the declared George Floyd verdict day. They should have taken the day off, according to the AP! Well, it might come as a shock to those who live in gated neighborhoods, but violent criminals don't take a break for the Derek Chauvin trial.

Just consider how often police encounter violent criminals who happen to be black. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting, in 2019, there were 16,425 reported homicides (over 20,000 in 2020), 268,000 robberies, 821,000 aggravated assaults reported by police (many more unreported incidents, including over 4.8 million assaults, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics). There were also 1.1 million burglaries and nearly 7 million property crimes. Most of the latter categories are not considered violent, but many violent criminals commit those crimes and get violent when the police confront them.

Now consider the fact that roughly 51% of those arrested for murder, 53% of those arrested for robbery, 33% of those arrested for aggravated assault, 35% of those arrested for stolen property, and 42% of those arrested for weapons violations are black.

Among juveniles, the numbers are even starker. 62% of robbery arrests and 405 of aggravated assault arrests among those under 18 in 2019 were black.

That means there are millions of police encounters with violent criminals, especially juveniles, for committing serious crimes who happen to be black. If the media standard is now to report on every single case where the suspect is killed rather than focusing on the source of the problem —violent crime — there is simply no way the police can operate under anyone's construct of policing.

When you look at the number of criminals police deal with, their track record is actually pretty amazing. Police shootings have declined precipitately over the years. The problem is that the few bad circumstances get exacerbated by the media lying about so many other justified police killings that it creates a false narrative that the police, and not criminals, are the predominant public policy problem.

The outcome of this new paradigm is unmistakable. Police have much more incentive to allow the victim to be stabbed than to risk their lives by shooting the perpetrator. That is already happening. Last year, shootings involving children were up a whopping 43% in Philadelphia. 96% of them were black! This is the legacy of BLM. They are sacrificing black victims of crime (as well as all victims) to protect black criminals.

Why is there no concern about the growing violence among black inner-city youth that leads to exponentially more lives lost than police shootings, especially when considering how many lives the police save?



The media and corrupt politicians will shed crocodile tears and feign outrage over the tragic and unnecessary loss of a young life. Yes, it is tragic and unnecessary. If we actually deterred crime in this country, more victims and, yes, suspects would be saved. But the tragedy is not the police; it's the criminals themselves and the broken families who raise them. Violent crime is being committed at a younger age, and now more girls are being roped into it.

Just last month, a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old girl brutally killed an Uber driver in D.C. during a carjacking. Where is the outrage over that? Well, those suspects will likely be out on the streets no later than their 21st birthdays thanks to a plea deal, which is why we will continue to see more of this. Last year, two black teens among an entire mob of accomplices beat a white man to death at the Frederick fair in a racially tinged attack, yet they will not spend a day in prison.

What is self-evident from the past year is that not only does BLM value black people over white, they value criminals over victims. We will all pay the price moving forward.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-media-coverage-of-columbus-shooting-exposes-their-blm-agenda-as-a-fraud,2021-04-21
Horowitz: Minneapolis City Council votes to pay BLM rioters who almost lynched a motorist for ‘excessive’ police force,"The Black Lives Matter riots were spawned by the excessive use of force on George Floyd by one Minneapolis cop. But nobody in their right mind would suggest police used excessive force in the aftermath of the incident. As a peace offering to BLM, the Minneapolis police sacrificed the entire city for weeks on end, including allowing rioters to vandalize 1,500 buildings, destroy 700 buildings, block streets and terrorize motorists with impunity, and even burn the third precinct police station to the ground with no resistance.



In fact, they barely defended their own lives, as many of them were injured. One was knocked out with a metal trash can lid, and the perpetrator, Brayshaun Gibson, didn’t serve a day in prison. The plea deal, which resulted in just one year of home detention, also dismissed charges that Gibson allegedly threw large rocks at a police car and for a separate crime in which he was accused of stealing from Home Depot at least 10 times and up to 194 times.

Contrast that to Matthew Bledsoe, who had no other criminal arrests but was sentenced to four years in prison after spending 22 minutes in a public building committing no act of violence on January 6 after the cops let him and others in the doors. Anyone who was accused of even minor physical contact against a cop on January 6 was held pretrial indefinitely. Cops in Minneapolis, on the other hand, were fair game.

Nonetheless, the Minneapolis City Council just voted unanimously to pay 12 rioters $700,000 for being sprayed with pepper spray. These individuals were part of a massive mob that illegally shut down I-35 on a west-side bridge on May 31, 2020, and then surrounded a trucker and almost lynched him. Police were saving the life of the trucker and obviously used riot control techniques to disperse the crowd. But in the world of Sodom and Gomorrah, otherwise known as “Minnesota nice,” these rioters and lynchers are victims.

What has essentially been codified into criminal law in this country is that acts of violence in pursuit of the woke agenda are protected speech, while speech and advocacy or nonviolent acts of conservative activism are deemed violent felonies. It was striking watching Whoopi Goldberg during her debate with Senator Ted Cruz when he brought up the violence of Antifa after she asserted that the left doesn’t “storm” or commit violence. She looked at him like he was from Mars and said flatly, “I don’t know what an Antifa riot is.”

Ted Cruz CALLS OUT Whoopi Goldberg On The View www.youtube.com

While most people probably thought she was bluffing, I genuinely think she was serious. In her mind, nothing the leftist rioters did is tantamount to violence because it was all done for the right purpose. In fact, we should be lucky all white people weren’t locked up and beaten out of their cars in pursuit of “justice for Floyd.” It would be one thing if this demonic worldview were limited to hack has-been TV personalities past their prime, but this is the sentiment of elected officials and judges.

Remember when a Minnesota federal judge, Patrick Schiltz, described Michael Bryce Williams, the leader of the attack on the police station, as a ""good person who made a terrible mistake""? Noting that it’s ""easy to understand"" why the killing of George Floyd had affected Williams, Judge Schiltz sentenced Williams to just 27 months in prison.

Contrast this to Matthew Bledsoe, who was just sentenced to four full years for scaling the wall of the Capitol, entering the building for 22 minutes, and shouting, ""This is our house. We pay for this s***. Where’s those pieces of s*** at?"" He didn’t burn, break, or steal anything. The judge didn’t sympathize with his grievance and note that he never had a criminal record and just made a mistake that day. ""I do view this as a very serious case, and you are facing serious prison time,"" said Judge Beryl Howell in rebuffing Bledsoe’s apology on sentencing day.

And speaking about a fundamentally good person who made a mistake – what about the case of Ryan Nichols? He is charged with assaulting a police officer for having a crowbar and discharging a pepper spray can in defense of innocent people being pepper-sprayed, but there is no evidence he did anything with it. The charging documents make it clear that he wasn’t even apprehended on the spot and was only caught through Facebook snitches placing him in the Capitol. He didn’t break anything or harm anyone, yet the entire arrest was built upon his political views and things he said.

Remember the suspect who got home detention for knocking out the Minneapolis officer? Nichols has been in jail for almost two years pretrial and is facing potentially more than a decade in prison. Nichols is a veteran of the Marine Corps who spent his time rescuing people and dogs from hurricanes. He is a search and rescue specialist helping people before first responders can come to the scene of a natural disaster. He appeared on Ellen DeGeneres’ show, and she was so moved by his work that she offered to pay for his honeymoon with his new wife. Instead, Ryan and his wife decided to use the money to buy a rescue boat.



He certainly made a mistake, but how do you square his treatment with that of Michael Bryce Williams or Brayshaun Gibson, neither of whom lived as honorable a life, for knocking out an officer or burning down a police station?

Remember Richard Barnett, the Arkansas man photographed with his feet on a desk in Nancy Pelosi’s office? Nobody will suggest he didn’t do anything wrong, but contrast that to the overtly violent and destructive acts of so many throughout the BLM/Antifa riots who never faced any punishment. This man was held pretrial without bail for four months!

Then there were the peaceful protesters at the Capitol who were merely singing “God Bless America” and had no clue what was about to unfold. They were legitimately beaten and pepper-sprayed by the police for no reason.

Can you imagine the federal government or D.C. government settling with them to pay for injury? And unlike the people blocking an interstate highway, they had the right to protest there.

There’s a legal maxim, “Summum jus summa injuria,” which means extreme justice is extreme injustice. It’s all the more appalling when parallel federal courts in this country mete out zero justice to truly violent and unrepentant criminals who happen to align with their political beliefs.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-minneapolis-city-council-votes-to-pay-blm-rioters-who-almost-lynched-a-motorist-for-excessive-police-force,2022-10-27
Horowitz: Minnesota AG Keith Ellison threatens black business owner with farm labor for opening restaurant,"Joe Biden once said that Republicans want to put black people ""back in chains,"" but it appears that it is the leftist ""Branch Covidian"" cultists who are actually threatening to place a black single mom business owner back in chains for the ""crime"" of earning a living.

During the greatest crime wave in a generation, Larvita McFarquhar is the worst type of criminal in the estimation of the socialists. A single mom, rather than going on welfare, McFarquhar opened Havens Garden, in Lynd, Minnesota, a family-oriented restaurant with an attached gymnasium for kids to have a good time. She had the audacity to keep her business opened after the governor unconstitutionally declared property rights dead in the state.

Rather than offering to compensate her for the lost business, on Dec. 18, Ramsey County District Court Judge Sara Grewing found her guilty of civil contempt and fined McFarquhar $250 per day her establishment remains opened.

Evidently, Judge Grewing is a big stickler for the ""law"" — but only when it comes in the form of arbitrary executive edicts against business owners. Last year, Judge Grewing gave a serial sex predator who raped an unconscious woman just two and a half years in prison. On Aug. 3, she single-handedly nullified state election law by ruling that Minnesota's absentee ballots no longer require the signature of a witness who is a registered voter or a notary public and requiring the board of elections to accept mail-ins that come in after Election Day. And as she threatens business owners with prison time because of COVID, she has also demanded that the Department of Corrections officials show her a plan for protecting prisoners from COVID.

Are you starting to get a sense of which ""laws"" and which ""criminals"" she is concerned with?

Well, now that Attorney General Keith Ellison sees Larvita has a spine of steel and is willing to stand for God-given rights, he is upping the ante. Last week, Ellison's office filed a motion for further contempt sanctions with the Second Circuit court to propose jail time for her. Was she burning buildings or lynching motorists like BLM rioters? Nope. Her crime? ""Defendant has continued to offer on-premises consumption of food or beverages to the public since receiving the Court's Civil Contempt Order on December 18, 2020.""

What is the punishment they are pushing for? Take a look at the motion:

So now, in this country, you are not allowed to earn a living, and your punishment for doing so is slave labor. With China now celebrating the New Year with packed crowds, there is more freedom in China than in Minnesota. We have become a wealthier version of North Korea with a printing press of cash, except that cash just goes to big business or to households that didn't lose a penny from the shutdown. McFarquar didn't receive a penny of compensation.



Ellison's motion also threatens to confiscate the money she raised from her crowdsourcing page to pay for her lawyer's fees. Larvita gave an emotional response on a Facebook live filmed inside her establishment noting that she was ""at a loss of words"" as to how this can happen in America.

What few people have noticed is that, even if with some convoluted rationale the government had the power to categorically shut down businesses, at worst, it would be covered by the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, which would mean she is entitled to ""just compensation."" Instead, in the new America, she has to pay to put herself out of business.

These government workers from the health department are able to earn their paychecks by denying other people their paychecks. We were all supposed to be ""in this together,"" yet so many government workers and white-collar jobs can be done online while brick and mortar businesses get crushed. Again, even if the government was justified, this is exactly what the just compensation requirement expressed in the Fifth Amendment was written to address. As the Supreme Court said in Armstrong v. United States(1960), ""The Fifth Amendment's [Takings Clause] . . . was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.""



The Democrat Party was always the party of the plantation. Unfortunately for us, outside Florida and South Dakota, we don't have a party today that stands as strongly against slavery and tyranny as Lincoln did when he founded the GOP. Are we going to allow Biden and his mini-mes in the states to place us all back in chains?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-minnesota-ag-keith-ellison-threatens-black-business-owner-with-farm-labor-for-opening-restaurant,2021-01-04
Horowitz: Most important outcome of Dobbs decision? Making state legislatures great again,"It’s the body of government closest to the people, yet it’s the most forgotten, overshadowed, and weakened body in recent years. However, with the Dobbs opinion returning the power to regulate abortions to state legislatures, we now have the opportunity to focus our attention on legislative elections, sessions, and policies and settle our acerbic cultural and legal differences in the most prudent and democratic process.

We are an irrevocably divided nation, and it will only get worse over time. We can’t agree on the definition of a marriage, a woman, a citizen, a criminal, a fundamental right, or the purpose of our existence, much less the purpose of our government. We can either continue forging ahead with a winner-take-all approach to politics and have the federal executive bureaucracy – the least accountable and transparent branch of government and most distant from the people – decide every important political question. Or we settle those debates in state legislatures – the branch closest to the people where most members are elected every two years.

Whether you abhor abortion as murder or think it’s the greatest sacrament of virtue, the reality is that red states are going to ban abortions (many already have) and the blue states are going to obsessively expand access to them. Unlike the seven justices who initially banned all regulation of abortion in 1973, all those legislators in each state will be subject to removal every two or four years. For the most part, the legislators will vote in a way that reflects the values of the majority in their areas. This is the self-sorting process we’ve always needed. This dynamic needs to expand to every other important issue of our time. It’s not a perfect process, but it’s much better than where we are today, and it will allow us to live side by side harmoniously in a de facto amicable separation, albeit with shared custody over certain issues that are national in scope.

In the coming months, conservatives will be trained by their favorite Fox News media figures to obsess about the potential of a RINO takeover of Congress and the coming presidential election, even though the latter won’t even be relevant, policy-wise, until 2025. But the reality is that Republicans control trifecta supermajorities in a number of states today and will only expand that dominance next year. Come January, they have the ability to make those states de facto sanctuaries for our rights and values – if only we focus our pressure on elected state Republicans and educate them concerning the enormity of their power. It’s time to use it.

In his national design for governance, Madison explained the state vs. federal arrangement in Federalist #45 as follows: “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.”

Think about issues like COVID fascism and transgenderism. Internal order, liberties, and property, etc. – this can all be rectified at a state level. Anything outside war and foreign commerce is fair game. This is where conservatives failed to act during the lockdowns and COVID fascism. They should have activated the legislatures immediately and forced debate for the states to immediately reject the federal policies. It’s still not too late to change course.

In responding to the Biden administration’s immoral and illegal policies and edicts over the next two and a half years, conservatives should have a one-track mind and be singularly focused on how they can pressure their legislatures to interpose against the federal tyranny. Conservatives have long been distracted away from a state legislative focus, but perhaps the Democrats will teach them how it’s done. Believe me, the blue states will immediately take action and juice up funding for abortion while expanding its legal scope – perhaps even to after the birth of the baby.

Likewise, most GOP legislatures and attorneys general seem to have acted swiftly to immediately ban abortion at the first opportunity. But we now need to see this swiftness on other issues as well. For example, Biden’s Department of Education just promulgated a rule putting any school or university on the hook for sexual harassment if they don’t call men who think they are women by female pronouns. This is the sort of illegal federal regulation that states must immediately stop. Legislatures should instantly convene and block its implementation within their states.

The big problem we have in legislatures, though, is that so many of them are only in session for a few months a year. In states like Texas, they are only in session every other year. This means that, for example with COVID, when you have federal and state executive branches suspending the republic, we often have to wait months or years for legislatures to act. It was OK to have a part-time legislature when we had a part-time executive branch and the legislature was the only organ of government that legislated. However, now that the federal and state departments of health and education legislate 365 days a year without any checks or balances, the concept of a part-time legislature actually harms us.

As such, conservatives must begin pushing reforms to make it easier to call legislatures back into session, and it should not be tied to the whims of the governors. We don’t need state legislatures voting on bills all year, but we must reserve the prerogative to get them back into session at a moment’s notice to interpose against tyranny.



For years, Republicans have accumulated a ton of power in many states, have done nothing with it, and have failed to clean up their own cultural Marxist swamps within state-run agencies. Abortion was the only red line conservative voters established and held their elected representatives to. It succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. Now it’s time we harness that energy for issues like medical freedom, Pfizer liability, transgenderism, illegal immigration, crime, First Amendment protections, and interposition against the tyrannical Biden administration. What the Dobbs victory has clearly shown is that we will only enjoy the rights and policies commensurate with our desire to fight for them.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-most-important-outcome-of-dobbs,2022-06-27
"Horowitz: Murderer released on $15,000 bond as Jan. 6 protesters held indefinitely without bail","Behold the breadth of brazenness in our two-tiered justice system. In one America, we have career violent criminals released on low bail after murder and attempted murder, when the victim is terrified the criminal will attack again if not jailed. In the other America, we have Trump supporters arrested for nonviolent acts of ""trespassing"" upon public property when Capitol Police held the doors to the building open — yet they are kept in jail for months without bail, despite no criminal record.

Earlier this week, WMC-TV news in Memphis reported on Lachrisa Oliver, a Memphis woman who survived a shooting in March who must now deal with the release of the alleged perpetrators into her neighborhood headed into the trial. Tajuana and Teuana Ayers, along with an unnamed juvenile suspect, were arrested for a March 3 shooting that left Lachrisa in critical condition and her nephew dead on her doorstep. Shockingly, Tajuana and Teuana, despite the murder and attempted murder charges, were released on just $15,000 and $25,000 bonds respectively.

What's even more shocking is that Tajuana, 42, had a history of over a dozen arrests dating back to 2001, which included theft, aggravated assault, and attempted murder. During the alleged March murder, the suspect was actually out on bond for an attempted murder case when she was charged with shooting at a motorist after being involved in a car crash outside a Memphis high school in 2019.

It is the career violent criminals who face serious charges but are released on bail who are committing most of the murders in this country. Yet even after the murder, she was released on just $15,000 bond!

What's worse is that this is the ultimate case where the suspect needs to be taken off the street. Given that there is a surviving victim who will also be the main witness in the trial to identify the suspect in the murder case, this is a textbook case for holding the suspect without bail.

Oliver fears for her life and wants to move because the suspects live in the neighborhood. ""I do not sleep. I don't sleep. I don't eat. I don't do anything. I'm tired of being locked up here. It's not fair,"" said Oliver.

Now, with this case fresh in your mind, let's travel back to Jan. 6. Tim Hale is a Navy Reservist who attended the Stop the Steal rally at the Capitol dressed in a suit and without a weapon. The court opinion denying his appeal to be released admits that he never engaged in violence. They have nothing but a statement from a ""confidential human source"" stating he admitted to having merely been in the Capitol building and left after the shooting of Ashli Babbitt.

Unlike in the case of Tajuana Ayers and thousands of career violent murder suspects, Hale is in the military with a security clearance, is employed with no criminal record, poses no general threat or threat to an individual victim, and is not accused of anything more than being in the Capitol. Yet his motion for release was denied this week, meaning he will remain imprisoned indefinitely without the chance of posting bail.



The court admitted that it is unprecedented to hold Hale, but cited his ""history of racist and violent language and the fact that he is been generally engaged in hateful conduct"" as pretext for violating the principle, ""We don't normally penalize people for what they say.""

In other words, if you say the election was stolen, you are held without bail, but if you actually are accused of murder after racking up a 20-year criminal history and having no stable job keeping you in place for trial, you are let go on low bail.

In Hale's case, the D.C. appeals court cited his use of Thomas Jefferson's quotes about watering the tree of liberty with revolution from time to time as proof he was a danger to the community, despite his record, his military service, and his job as a contractor at Naval Weapons Station Earle. Prior aggravated assaults and shootings, though, do not count as evidence of a pretrial threat, of course, if the accused is of the right ilk.

We no longer live in a republic with equal justice under the law. Under our long-standing English common law tradition, setting various levels of bail was the best way to balance the freedom of those presumed innocent unless proven guilty with the concern of public safety. While suspects have the opportunity to remain out of jail pending trial, they also have a strong incentive to show up for trial or risk loss of property. Moreover, the commercial bondsmen have an extra incentive to help ensure a flight risk is apprehended and brought to trial. Donald Verrilli, Obama's solicitor general, said it well in 1982: ""Bail acts as a reconciling mechanism to accommodate both the defendant's interest in pretrial liberty and society's interest in assuring the defendant's presence at trial.""



But we now live with a justice system that places society at risk by releasing the most violent criminals accused of heinous crimes with robust records of recidivism and absconding from trial while crushing pretrial liberty for those who hold the wrong viewpoints. Lady Justice is no longer blind; she has 20/20 vision and is staring at people like you and me with tunnel vision.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-murderer-released-on-15000-bond-as-jan-6-protesters-held-indefinitely-without-bail,2021-07-09
Horowitz: 4.9 million reasons we no longer need a federal government,"With the federal government not only failing to do its job but being complicit in the war on national sovereignty, why then should we suffer the internal tyranny it is imposing upon us? At this point, isn’t the federal government all pain and no gain?

Our founders never envisioned the federal government would have so many policing entities with the technology, resources, and manpower it has today. Because the police power was left to the states, Madison actually feared the states would be the more likely culprit in usurpations than the federal government, which is why he originally wanted to give Congress veto power over state legislatures. Now, we not only have the DHS, FBI, ATF, and DEA, which are larger than the standing army the founders envisioned, but even the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Labor, and Department of Education have tactical response teams.

According to a 2015 CRS report, out of the (only) 13 agencies that responded to their questionnaire, there were a total of 271 federal tactical teams across the different offices and departments. There are now 200,000 federal employees (outside the Department of Defense) with firearms along with their badges, larger than the size of the U.S. Marines.

Almost none of it is used upon enemies of the country and to protect our liberties. It is all used to monitor, record, surveil, and now apprehend political dissidents. Thus, if we have given up our freedom to such a behemoth, what have we gotten in return?

At its core, the most important job of the federal government is to protect us against external enemies. That begins at our border. There have now been a total of 4.9 million known border incursions since Biden took office, nearly the population of Ireland. These comprise roughly 3.9 million apprehensionsand close to a million gotaways (which is probably lowballing it). Our government has not only abrogated its most important responsibility to the states – protecting against invasion – but it has been complicit in the smuggling and criminal conspiracy that has brought over sex trafficking, drugs, and dangerous criminals.

Our founders didn’t fear this degree of federal government not only because it was not supposed to have all these federal police agencies, statutes, and executive authority over every aspect of our lives (including breathing without masks!), but because it was supposed to be busy working on external affairs. In one of the most important descriptions of the federalist arrangement, Madison laid out the design in Federalist #45 as follows:

The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negociation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.

The operations of the Federal Government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State Governments, in times of peace and security. As the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the State Governments will here enjoy another advantage over the Federal Government.

So why did he not fear federal tyranny so long as his design was followed?

The more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defence, the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favour their ascendency over the governments of the particular States.

Well, given that we now have record numbers of DHS and DOJ law enforcement agents with zero regard for protecting our national border, they have all the resources imaginable to focus on you and me.

Perhaps we need the federal government for the military, you might say. Really? A woke and broke military that only exists for critical race theory, transgenderism, and nation-building for every other border but our own? Again, once a federal force is no longer used for its proper purpose, it can only serve as a menace to our liberties in the long run.

So now that we have uniform weights, measures, and currency, why exactly do we need a federal government to abrogate its core defense responsibilities just to prevent the states from securing the border? All other activities were supposed to be done by the states. Founder Tench Coxe, a Pennsylvania delegate to the Continental Congress, listed in a 1788 essay the following as off-limits to the federal government:

They cannot interfere with the opening of rivers and canals; the making or regulation of roads, except post roads; building bridges; erecting ferries; establishment of state seminaries of learning; libraries; literary, religious, trading or manufacturing societies; erecting or regulating the police of cities, towns or boroughs; creating new state offices; building light houses, public wharves, county gaols, markets, or other public buildings; making sale of state lands, and other state property; receiving or appropriating the incomes of state buildings and property; executing the state laws; altering the criminal law; nor can they do any other matter or thing appertaining to the internal affairs of any state, whether legislative, executive or judicial, civil or ecclesiastical.

Rather than just railing against the FBI and making this all about Trump, conservatives must compel a broader discussion in red-state legislatures and among the governors about how we return to this original design. They need to cut off the spigot of federal funding for all of the aforementioned functions, along with its accompanying officious litany of regulations, and with it, the police power to capriciously enforce nebulous (or even phantom) laws against political opponents.

Contrary to Mike Pence’s sentiments, dismantling these agencies is not akin to abolishing the police. Our founders envisioned state and local police and a national military – not dozens of national police forces larger than a military. Police power is the bluntest instrument of government, and it needs the scrutiny of local politics inherent in elections for sheriff, mayor, and county legislative and executive positions. When Madison warned during the Constitutional Convention, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty,” he certainly never envisioned this degree of an executive branch with this number of paramilitary organizations.

The purpose of forming a federal union was to “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” for things that states were inherently incapable of doing. Yet what we have today is a government that engages in the antithesis of justice by fanning and fomenting true violence and framing its opponents, gutting our military, empowering the cartels to control our border, and creating monopolies for transhumanist World Economic Forum types at the expense of the general welfare and liberties of the people.



Rather than protecting the ideals spelled out in the preamble of the Constitution, the federal government abrogates every one of them and prevents others from upholding them. Nowhere is this more evident than at the border. If you simply abolished the federal government, then the states could have a fighting chance to secure the border. Yet now, Fox’s Bill Melugin is reporting that while the Texas Guardsmen close the gates to illegal aliens, Border Patrol comes and opens them!

Which leads us back to the original question: At this juncture in time, if our desideratum as a civilization is justice, tranquility, the common defense, general welfare, and securing the blessings of liberty, why even have a federal government? I can sure think of a lot of revolting activities of the federal government we can live without. Now, can you think of one we must live with?

Horowitz: New gov’t watchdog report accuses DHS of settling Afghans with no vetting,"It sure seems like Novak Djokovic is the only one in the world not welcome in this country. Everyone else is fair game.

There is no right for a foreign national to immigrate to the U.S. as there is for an American to remain here unmonitored by the government. As such, it’s government’s responsibility to vet foreign nationals who seek entry, not to vet the political opinions of American opponents of the current president. Yet our government and national security apparatus have it completely backward. They spend all their resources focusing on targeting conservatives as the number-one threat to homeland security, while waving in tens of thousands of people from the most dangerous and radical parts of the world without proper verification, according to a new government watchdog report.

Remember the 80,000 Afghans the Biden administration resettled last summer? According to a new report from the DHS inspector general, U.S. Customs and Border Protection lacked “critical data” needed to properly screen these people coming from a source country of radical Islamic extremism. What sort of critical data?

We determined some information used to vet evacuees through U.S. Government databases, such as name, date of birth, identification number, and travel document data, was inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. We also determined CBP admitted or paroled evacuees who were not fully vetted into the United States.

Oh! So as Biden’s DHS focuses solely on “extremism” of domestic political adversaries as the number-one homeland security threat, officials have no problem admitting thousands of people from a country steeped in honor killings, sharia supremacism, and subjugation of women, as well as actual kinetic terrorist activities.

Even more shocking was the fact that when the IG’s office asked CBP for a list of those admitted or paroled for whom they lacked proper data (or even screening), officials conceded that no such list exists. In other words, they disappeared into the population. “As a result, DHS may have admitted or paroled individuals into the United States who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities,” concluded the IG’s report, released on Tuesday.

As always, the report offered CBP the obvious recommendation to “immediately” identify all the Afghans in the U.S., provide proper proof of vetting, and then develop a contingency plan for vetting in future emergency evacuations.

Pretty non-controversial recommendations, right? I mean, we can offer excuses about the chaos and time constraints endemic in the Biden administration’s refugee plan, but a year later, this should be the DHS’ top priority, right? Wrong!

“The report does not reflect the interagency nature of the vetting process, despite significant efforts and multiple attempts by DHS program officials, subject matter experts, and others to provide the OIG a comprehensive understanding of the extensive details related to the numerous facts and nuances of the unprecedented OAW vetting process,” wrote DHS official Jim Crumpacker in response to the IG’s recommendations.

I guess that settles that. It’s just simply too complicated to protect Americans from external threats. Yet somehow, it’s safe to say they don’t have a problem with interagency nuances when “vetting” American political opponents.

The DHS also asserts that it did indeed screen all the refugees (yes, perhaps enough to ensure they are not Trump supporters!). The problem is they failed to produce any of the supporting documents to the IG. Moreover, in February, the DOD inspector general released a report identifying at least 50 Afghans who pose ""potentially significant security concerns."" The reported noted that dozens of them who had ""derogatory information"" that would make them ineligible for parole were unable to be located.

What sort of derogatory information? We’re not even talking about those who believe women are chattel and infidels should be subjugated. That is likely a massive percentage of them. We are talking about concerns that “include individuals whose latent fingerprints have been found on improvised explosive devices and known or suspected terrorists and for which the NGIC sends derogatory information notifications to appropriate DoD personnel."" At the time of the report, only three of those individuals had been located.

Then again, perhaps our government is correct in asserting that these people had been vetted. It’s all a matter of what they find to be a threat and what they are looking for.

Ironically, nearly every prominent Republican supported this massive Afghan evacuation. These are the same neo-conservatives who believe we need to “fight them there so they don’t come here,” but the only way they can come here is if we bring them here. Then they feel guilty because we indeed are there fomenting more civil wars and creating unrest, and they feel responsible to bring all those people to our shores!

Importantly, this is only the opening act. The Biden administration’s modus operandi is to bring in huge numbers of people from any part of the world facing a war or disaster. Officials are planning to resettle 125,000 additional refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2023. Over 100,000 Ukrainians are expected to be admitted into the United States. Despite not being designated as official refugees, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, passed by Congress in May, makes the parolees eligible for refugee resettlement programs. So when the DHS says officials have no plans to create a contingency plan for vetting, it will be relevant every year during the next “current thing” that turns into a geopolitical emergency.



Then, of course, there is our own border. So far this fiscal year, there have been over 2 million encounters, over 500,000 gotaways, and over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl discovered. The degree of security risk all of this collectively poses is unimaginable, yet our government will continue to focus solely on we the people.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-new-govt-watchdog-report-accuses-dhs-of-settling-afghans-with-no-vetting,2022-09-12
"Horowitz: Now that vaccinated people need the monoclonal treatments, Biden admin and media attack the treatment","For those of you who couldn't believe that the government's war on ivermectin and every other treatment was rooted in a sinister motivation, its new attack on the monoclonal antibodies should indelibly cement the terrifying thought in your mind. The government and the media are now using the same attack pattern on the monoclonal antibody treatment that they used on hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin now that it has become popular with people desperate for treatment – vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.

On Sept. 14, the Biden administration announced that the feds would be cutting the number of monoclonal treatments per week in the southern states and reallocating them as part of a broader plan to start rationing the treatments. For example, in Florida, HHS issued an allocation for the week of Sept. 13 of 3,100 doses of BAM/ETE treatments and 27,850 doses of REGN-COV. As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press conference last week, this would effectively reduce Florida's allocation by 50%. The federal agency did this without any warning or indication that there was a shortage.

Then, last Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki explained the move as follows: ""Our supply is not unlimited and we believe it should be equitable."" HHS then followed up with an explanation of the policy of ""equity.""

But wouldn't you focus on where it's needed at a given time rather than blind ""equity""? Also, Biden promised just days earlier during the announcement of his vaccine mandate to boost monoclonal distribution by 50%.

Well, here is the answer to the enigma: In that same announcement, Biden warned, ""If these governors won't help us beat the pandemic, I'll use my power as president to get them out of the way."" Is the federal takeover of the monoclonals his ace in the hole? And why wouldn't the government just produce more? We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, shutdowns, and vaccines that failed so miserably that people who already got the shots still need the monoclonals! So why not put the funding into the monoclonals?

Well, if you are trying to ascertain the motivation of government always watch carefully for its stenographers in the media to follow up with the psy-ops on the general public, which will reveal the true messaging. Once you read this New York Times article, you will see clearly that this is really not about ""equity"" or some concern over supply. In an article titled, ""They shunned COVID vaccines but embraced antibody treatments,"" the NYT essentially frames the monoclonals as some right-wing solution that is only for those who didn't want to get the vaccine.

Some Republican governors have set up antibody clinics while opposing vaccine mandates, frustrating even some of the drugs' strongest proponents. Raising vaccination rates, scientists said, would obviate the need for many of the costly antibody treatments in the first place. The infusions take about an hour and a half, including monitoring afterward, and require constant attention from nurses whom hard-hit states often cannot spare.""It's clogging up resources, it's hard to give, and a vaccine is $20 and could prevent almost all of that,"" said Dr. Christian Ramers, an infectious disease specialist and the chief of population health at Family Health Centers of San Diego, a community-based provider. Pushing antibodies while playing down vaccines, he said, was ""like investing in car insurance without investing in brakes.""

Except it's simply not true. The vaccines are no longer working, especially for those who got them early on — particularly the elderly — and many of the people who got them badly need treatment. As Gov. DeSantis reported, the majority of those seeking monoclonals are vaccinated, a fact I have verified in the facility closest to me in Baltimore. Here are the statistics the Florida government publicized at last week's press conference:

At our Broward site, 52% of the patients that have received treatment have been vaccinated, 69% of those over 60 that have received treatment at the Broward site had been vaccinated. In Miami Dade almost 60% of everybody that's been treated at the Tropical Park site has been vaccinated. And 73% of the patients treated at the state site in Tropical Park that are over the age of 60 have been vaccinated.

So again, it's the exact opposite of what the media and the Biden administration are saying. The vaccines cost a fortune and failed. Now these same people need treatment. The same government officials rationing the monoclonals have already scared 99% of doctors away from prescribing and pharmacists from filling cheap off-patent drugs that have cured the few people who can access them. The monoclonals are made by the cool kids at big pharma and are approved by the government. Except our government paid them off up front and then refused to even make the public aware of their existence. Thus, even things produced by big pharma are now attacked, so long as they actually work and people begin successfully using them.

It's so cute to watch the government and media suddenly become concerned about expensive treatments after spending billions on the vaccines. There is a simple solution, and that would be mass production of ivermectin and encouraging all physicians to treat everyone early with it and other cheap drugs. But now that the government has essentially banned them, the monoclonals are the only show in town. This is where the Biden administration wants to place Americans they don't like into a death trap.

Texas Montgomery County Judge Mark Keough warned that this is not about a lack of supply. ""The manufacturer has confirmed supplies are ample but due to the Defense Production Act, the White House and its agencies are the only entities who can purchase and distribute this treatment,"" wrote Keough on Facebook.



With the war on any and all forms of early treatment, ask yourself this question: Does our government really want the pandemic to end?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-now-that-vaccinated-people-need-the-monoclonal-treatments-biden-admin-and-media-attack-the-treatment,2021-09-20
Horowitz: Parler lawsuit: The courts discover free enterprise at the exact wrong moment,"Imagine if every venue providing wedding services — from rental places and caterers to bakers and florists — were controlled by Christian conservatives. They worked together with all their distributors to ensure that nobody could perform a gay wedding anywhere in the country. Well, that is exactly what is occurring today in reverse on free speech. But there is no constitutional right to a gay marriage, while there is a right to free speech.

Last Thursday, Judge Barbara J. Rothstein of the Western District of Washington denied Parler's motion to force Amazon to restore Parler's social media platform on Amazon's server. Suddenly, the liberal legal community believes in the right of a private company to serve whomever they choose. The double standard is unmistakable.

I'd love to go back to 1789 when private businesses could do whatever they wanted. And indeed, had that been the prevailing law of the land over the past few generations, conservatives would have a lot more power and leverage in the economy and culture than they do today. But that is far from the case. In fact, the legal system has essentially controlled every aspect of what private businesses can do – up to and including the current lockdown policies that downright deny businesses the ability to serve anyone.

Just consider the case of a baker being forced to personally make a cake for a ceremony that violates his religious beliefs. Although the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Masterpiece Cakeshop when Colorado fined the shop for declining to bake a cake for a gay couple, the majority opinion hinted at the fact that, generally speaking, cake shops cannot decline to bake cakes. It's just in that particular case, the court held that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission did not enforce its mandate in a ""neutral"" manner.

Pursuant to this implied ruling, several courts have ruled that private business owners cannot decline to contract for gay events that violate their conscience. In 2018, the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that, pursuant to a Phoenix municipal ordinance, a Christian boutique artwork shop could not decline to contract for gay weddings. Brush & Nib Studio had a sign outside its shop stating that it would not create any artwork that violates the artists' beliefs, which includes ""artwork that demeans others, endorses racism, incites violence, contradicts our Christian faith, or promotes any marriage except marriage between one man and one woman."" Although there were numerous other places for gay couples to patronize, Brush & Nib was forced to engage in involuntary servitude for something the proprietors believe to be sinful.

Now, keep in mind that we are discussing tiny single proprietorships where the owners personally create with their hands sentimental products. Also, there are endless venues for individuals who want to make a gay ceremony to patronize. In fact, I'm sure they can actually find greater bargains and better service for their championed endeavors than the rest of us. Yet, somehow, Big Tech can collude to box out any conservative from accessing any way of effectively communicating, obtaining e-commerce, or even getting a job in the economy, in contravention to foundational antitrust laws and principles. So, if three companies buy up all the roads, they could block conservatives from traveling anywhere, but mom-and-pop shops must personally make products for events and speech that they find offensive!

Not only have the courts applied anti-discrimination law to denial of service, but in a case originating in this same federal district in Washington as the Amazon lawsuit, the courts established a rule that a pharmacy must actively stock products that it disapproves. In 2015, in the Stormans case, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a Washington state pharmacy must provide essentially every type of contraception under the sun, even though 30 other vendors sold all the products within five miles. SCOTUS refused to grant an appeal to the owners of the pharmacy, over a sharp dissent from Justice Alito.



Additionally, numerous courts have ruled that the Trump administration must continue enforcing the Obama-era contraception mandate, forcing employers to directly or indirectly provide contraception as part of their mandated insurance benefits for their employees.

Thus, when conservatives are the consumer, they can be denied service through monopolistic collusion to the point that it boxes out their existence from the public market, but when they are the provider, they must actively provide everything that violates their conscience, even when they are the only ones declining to contract and the product or service is widely available.

Moreover, in the religious liberty cases, unlike with Big Tech discrimination, the store owners or companies are explicitly protected by the First Amendment.

In 2016, Christian Mingle, a Christian dating website, was forced to offer gay dating options thanks to a California lawsuit. Worse, just last year, St. Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore was sued for not performing a hysterectomy on a woman's totally healthy uterus because she believes she really is a man. Most legal observers think the plaintiff will likely win thanks to Justice Gorsuch's ruling in Bostock codifying transgenderism into anti-discrimination law.

In other words, a single Catholic hospital is now forced to offer a ""service"" that is tantamount to mutilation of the body and violates the Hippocratic oath under the color of anti-discrimination and never denying service, but the entire Big Tech and corporate world can collude to deny all conservatives all forms of communication and commerce.

We no longer live in a constitutional republic. We live in a sadistic two-tiered justice system wherein conservatives are subject to hedonistic communism, but leftists can live in accordance with 1789 laissez-faire regulations built on a monopoly handed to them by government so that they can collude and banish conservatives from society.

Do you still want to know why 74 million people are mad?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-parler-lawsuit-the-courts-discover-free-enterprise-at-the-exact-wrong-moment,2021-01-25
Horowitz: Ron DeSantis succeeds on education where other Republicans failed for decades,"When was the last time you saw Republicans leading Democrats in any opinion poll on education? Likely never in this generation, not unlike their dismal polling on health care. Education and health care are probably the two most impactful issues on human life, liberty, culture, and economy, yet Republicans have ceded them to the left forever. They tepidly play their “me too” game of acceding to the same socialist policies, merely with less enthusiasm and slightly less funding, rather than offering a new vision altogether. This is where Ron DeSantis has upended the paradigm. He has already offered transformative change on many of the medical freedom issues; now he is doing the same on education.



As he declared Florida the “Education State” at his Monday press conference, DeSantis did something that no other Republican would have had the guts to do: he blocked the implementation of a college AP course on African-American studies.

Just as a farmer erects a scarecrow to protect his produce, the cultural Marxists erect political human shields around their most divisive and destructive agenda items that are usually messaged as “black studies,” “women’s health,” “curing diseases,” or “protecting poor people and puppies.” That immediately scares off all Republican resistance, no matter how pernicious the underlying policy and agenda are.

Undaunted by the scarecrow, DeSantis categorically rejected the program and had no problem articulating how this harms our culture and children and is actually offensive and insulting to Americans who happen to be black. “If you read what’s actually in there, they’re advocating things like abolishing prisons,” said the Florida governor in a press conference.

“Now that’s a radical political position. … It’s also not fair to say that somehow abolishing prisons is somehow linked to black experience. … They want law and order like everyone else wants law and order,” declared DeSantis. “So that is more ideology being used under the guise of history.”

The Florida Department of Education rejected the College Board’s AP African-American studies course because the syllabus contains various critical race theory principles comparing slavery of the past to different political grievances the left has today. Feminism, “queer” theory, and anarchist movements like BLM also wind their way into the syllabus.

DeSantis was undeterred by the race card played against him and turned it right around on detractors in explaining his support for studying impactful black American figures in history, which is a part of Florida’s mandated curriculum. “I view it as American history, not as separate history.”

The point is he refuses to acquiesce to the premise of the left on a single issue, which frees him up to speak directly to the logic and common sense of the actual policy. He did the same when a reporter asked whether his opposition to teaching gender ideology in schools is born out of anti-gay animus.

Notice he never got defensive, nor did he pander. He spoke directly to the policy in a way most parents, except for the blue-haired hippies, would appreciate.

The press conference itself was about his announcement of a “teacher’s bill of rights” in an effort to weaken union monopolies and coercion against teachers, parents, and students.

In the past, Republicans have shied away from leaning in this hard against the state’s public-sector unions out of fear of appearing to be anti-education. Instead, DeSantis announced a set of reforms prohibiting automatic union dues, limiting union boss pay, upending the relationship between the unions and the school boards, and barring all unions in school districts unless they garner 60% support, among other reforms.

And as always, he is willing to use the boot of the government for freedom the way the left uses it for tyranny. “We will be establishing a new process for individuals to notify the state if a teacher’s rights have been violated, and we will ensure that our Florida Department of Education can investigate those complaints very quickly,” DeSantis announced. He was referring to the issue of teachers getting punished for trying to infuse basic discipline and control into the classroom. So not only does DeSantis lean in on the cultural issues, he also makes cultural issues out of simple, traditionally non-political ideas that transcend political lines.

DeSantis, with his strong electoral margins in places like Tampa, Jacksonville, and Palm Beach County, clearly has resonated with many suburban (and even urban) voters who have recently fled the Republican Party. He has largely accomplished this on the education issue by standing up for parental rights, bodily autonomy of students not to be masked, and extirpating grooming and sex studies from the classroom.

Thus, when he announces a massive pay raise for teachers, something indeed other Republican governors often do, he is ensuring that, unlike in other red states, it is actually going to the teachers and not to lining the pockets of those who campaign against our values in the classroom.



Too many red-state governors have been content to cede education to the left. Their own departments of education are indistinguishable from the education officials in California. This is how states like Idaho have sexualized curriculum being taught in their public schools. Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb has been so favorable to union demands that for the first time in recent memory, the Indiana State Teachers Association declined to endorse the Democrat candidate against him during his last election in 2020.

These diffident Republicans feel as if our views are somehow foreign and should be confined to our homes and that somehow the left gets to own public education as its perpetual home-field advantage. But if we believe in the truth of our values, shouldn’t our values be the ones that prevail in our states? Shouldn’t we have the home-field advantage in red states?

The question for other GOP governors is how much of civilization are they willing to cede because they are too scared to stand their ground against the barking dogs of cynical identity politics.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-ron-desantis-succeeds-on-education-where-other-republicans-failed-for-decades,2023-01-24
"Horowitz: The lies about vaccine efficacy are exposed, so Scotland stops publishing data","If the truth hurts your narrative, you must censor it. But what if your own information harms your own narrative? Well, then you stop publishing it.

For the past few months, Scotland has been publishing age-stratified case rates by vaccination status in a very well broken-down chart every Wednesday afternoon, similar to the way the U.K. published the data every Thursday. The common thread observed from these trends was that the unvaccinated had the lowest case rate, the double-vaccinated had even higher death and hospitalization rates, and the triple-jabbed gradually had increasingly higher case rates, which clearly doesn’t portend good news even for hospitalization and death in the long run. When people like me started using their data, we were lambasted by the “fact-checkers” paid for by Big Pharma. Now Scottish health officials announced they will not be publishing the data at all.

“Public Health Scotland will stop publishing data on covid deaths and hospitalisations by vaccination status — over concerns it is misrepresented by anti-vaxx campaigners,” reports the Glasgow Times.

The notice of change was published on page 29 of the latest, and evidently final, Wednesday report from Feb. 16. “PHS is aware of inappropriate use and misinterpretation of the data when taken in isolation without fully understanding the limitations described below,” they decried.

You mean like screenshotting their own charts?

Obviously, there can be confounding factors, but those factors actually cut both ways. However, at the end of the day, these are age-stratified adjusted case rates per 100,000 and are completely fair game to use. No vaccine that is anywhere near as effective as they make it out to be should be netting these results.

Here is the latest case rate chart from the final report:

As you can see, for the past two weeks they have been placing disclaimers at the bottom of the charts.

What the chart clearly shows is what we have been seeing throughout the world — from the U.K., Canada, and Israel, for example — namely, that the second shot has gone negative a long time ago and the third shot is gradually following in the same direction. The public health officials themselves are demanding that people get boosters because they say the other shots wane. Well, logic would dictate that now that we are three to five months into the boosters in most places, they are waning as well. We also know that waning efficacy is potentially associated with a Trojan horse effect of antibody dependent disease enhancement, something the FDA admitted was never studied in the long run (at the time they thought the shots wouldn’t wane) but would be a risk “potentially associated with waning immunity.”

The main argument of those who are against us screenshotting their own charts to point out what they themselves have admitted is a speculative theory that perhaps the vaccinated test more often than the unvaccinated. That is a purely speculative confounding factor in the favor of the vaccine, but here is a concrete proven confounder against the vaccine: Scotland counts the first 21 days of the first vaccine as unvaccinated and the first 14 days of the third vaccine as double-vaccinated. We already know from Alberta’s data (which of course they also took down since we cited it) that roughly 40% of cases, 47.6% of hospitalizations, and 56% of deaths among the vaccinated occurred within 14 days of vaccination ! So if anything, many of the cases and deaths ascribed to the unvaccinated are caused by the immune suppression of the first shot, and many cases and deaths ascribed to the double-vaccinated makes that cohort look even worse than it already is in order to ameliorate the image of the boosters.

Furthermore, if the higher case rates among the vaccinated are the result of a higher testing rate, then why would the double-vaxxed also be worse off than the unvaccinated for hospitalizations and deaths, as PHS has been showing for weeks in its other charts?

It’s quite evident that everyone is tested in the hospital. If anything, it stands to reason that the unvaccinated would be more aggressively tested even when admitted for other ailments and therefore potentially be roped into incidental hospitalization counts more often than the vaccinated. For example, in June 2021, Scripps Health in San Diego announced it would only test unvaccinated asymptomatic patients but not the vaccinated. Clearly, the testing requirements of the unvaccinated and the counting of the (immune-suppressed) partially vaccinated as unvaccinated would be confounding factors for woefully overestimatingunvaccinated hospitalizations, not the other way around.

Also, why would the triple-vaxxed test less often than the double, who test more often than the single or unvaccinated? And why would the waning always continue in the same direction throughout the pandemic? As you can see from the U.K. Health Security Agency weekly reports, the efficacy of the shots constantly wanes with every new weekly report, a phenomenon that cannot be explained away by testing rates.

Clearly, this picture points to dangerous waning efficacy that plagues every cohort within a few months.

The bottom line is that during the final week of reporting in Scotland, just 12% of the deaths are among the unvaccinated, and that is including the 21-day grace period of counting the single-jabbed as unvaccinated. Nobody is suggesting that there is no efficacy for some people for a period of time against serious illness before the shots wane. But to suggest that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, to ignore the negative efficacy on infection which has been true across the board since last summer, and to obfuscate the concern of waning efficacy on critical illness even as they themselves demand boosters defies willing suspension of disbelief.

Unbelievably, PHS admits that the shots first suppress the immune system before they ramp up antibodies. But instead of using this as a strike against the shots, they use that is a strike against the unvaccinated and assert that it is a factor for why you can’t even compare hospitalization or death rates. “Individuals who have not completed their vaccine schedule may be more susceptible to a severe outcome and could result in higher COVID-19 case, hospitalization and death rates in the first and second dose vaccine groups,” claims PHS in the report.

But if that is true, that is the fault of the manufacturers who made a shot that first makes you vulnerable during an ongoing pandemic. It’s one thing to have a shot that makes you more vulnerable for a few weeks during the off-season of a virus. But to do so during the pandemic is akin to telling someone in a foxhole during a firefight that they will be safer in a bunker 100 yards ahead but must first run across the field to get there. The risk of making that run should be counted against the bunker option, not the foxhole.

In other words, as I wrote in my original piece on the Scottish data that was “fact-checked,” “You have to look in totality where we are headed rather than manipulating a snapshot of time.” You can’t just pull out one period of time of some efficacy for some people. You need to consider the following:

Vaccine injuries short term and long term, known and unknown;

Other safer treatment options for COVID itself;

A leaky vaccine that wanes in efficacy and runs the risk of enhancing the virus itself even while offering temporary protection for some;

The cost to the immune system of constantly boosting people to deal with the abovementioned concern of waning efficacy and enhancement.

The bottom line is that the social media guardians are looking at a snapshot of time. If they were to study the trajectory and progression of the virus and the vaccine throughout the year, they would recognize an unmistakable pattern of waning and then negative immunity. A large study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Weil Cornell Medicine-Qatar found (table 3) that the Pfizer vaccine waned very quickly after four months. By seven months, when adjusted for those in Qatar who already had prior infection, the Pfizer shot was -4% effective against transmission and just 44.1% effective against severe illness. Also, effectiveness against asymptomatic infection was -33% after seven months.

A Swedish preprint study in October 2021 looked at 1.6 million people in Sweden to examine infection rates and critical illness rates by vaccination status. They found a sliding scale of efficacy that wanes with time, but eventually turns negative. Here is a presentation of fully adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection for various demographics after 210 days:

Clearly, it was known early on that the vaccine wanes and has the potential to go negative even with Delta, for which both natural infection and the vaccines offered better immunity. It stands to reason that this is certainly the case with Omicron, making it abundantly clear that the negative efficacy rate has more to do with potential Trojan horse antibodies than it does with vaccination-status bias of testing rates.

So what’s the solution? Go for a fourth and fifth shot? This week, Israeli researchers published a preprint study on the efficacy of the fourth shot, which found that after just one month, Pfizer’s shot is down to 30% efficacy and Moderna is down to 11%. At the same time, “Local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in 80% and 40%, respectively.” They conclude, “Low efficacy in preventing mild or asymptomatic Omicron infections and the infectious potential of breakthrough cases raise the urgency of next generation vaccine development.”

Remember, the FDA's industry guidance for EUA status (p. 13) requires a 50% threshold of efficacy to even get emergency use authorization, much less full approval!

Thus, who is actually misreading or inappropriately using data here?

The Israeli study also concluded that “most of these infected HCW [health care workers] were potentially infectious, with relatively high viral loads. Thus, the major objective for vaccinating HCW was not achieved.” Full stop. The biggest public policy debate is over the fact that somehow you not getting the shot affects other people. Here we see that even people with four shots were still infectious with high viral loads. To what degree the shot offers some degree of protection from serious illness for some people for some period of time should be a decision left to the people. Perhaps other people would like to choose therapeutics that offer protection that don’t run the risk of severe adverse reactions. But none of that should have bearings on another human being, and none of that should justify human rights violations.

Horowitz: The new Western fascism: Countries are gradually using jail exclusively for political opponents,"For all the talk about Putin’s authoritarian grip over former Soviet states, we have our own authoritarian Putins now governing Western democracies and crushing all political dissent. Holding someone without bail for organizing a peaceful protest against the government sounds like something Putin would do, yet it is now happening in Canada and has already been happening here against those who did not engage in violence on Jan. 6. Meanwhile, these same Western leaders support de-incarceration for the most violent criminals, demonstrating that it’s not even about authoritarianism, but a two-tiered society built upon the ideals of fascism.

Last Thursday, Tamara Lich, one of the organizers of the trucker convoy who set up the original GoFundMe account, was arrested in Ottawa for simply opposing the Trudeau regime and organizing a peaceful protest. Not a single person from the hundreds of thousands of truckers acted violently, a few blocked roads, and Lich herself did nothing. She is being charged with ""counselling to commit mischief,"" which reeks of Iranian-style prosecution.

On Tuesday morning, Ontario judge Justice Julie Bourgeois denied Lich the opportunity to post any bail, even though she promised not to even engage in more lawful protests and instead return to her home in Alberta. “I cannot be reassured that if I release you into the community that you will not reoffend,” Bourgeois said. “Your detention is necessary for the protection and safety of the public.”

Those who follow my running column on robbers and gun felons who get released without bail, and even some murderers who get released on low bail despite massive criminal records, can appreciate the rich irony. Lich might reoffend by committing an action that is not only legal, but serves as the cornerstone value of dissent in a free and democratic society. If this standard were applied to BLM, there would literally be millions in jail today, and they often engaged in violence, not to mention more widespread blocking of roads.

Justice Bourgeois is a former liberal candidate for parliament and was endorsed by Trudeau in 2009. Thus, we are now at a point in Western (former) democracies when political prisoners cannot get a fair trial because the courts are completely co-opted by regime-supporting judges. Worse, Bourgeois once excused rising violent crime as “desperate people going through desperate times and using desperate measures.”

Hence, the very same judges and politicians who believe that political dissent is a dangerous crime also believe that career violent criminals need to be let out of jail. The same people who want to deny peaceful citizens the right to carry a gun seek to release every gun felon who has committed violence with a gun.

To that end, what is happening in Western countries is even worse than China or a return to pre-enlightenment Western governing values. In China, they wouldn’t tolerate murderers and carjackers. They will at least apply their harshness with equality – to an extent. What we are seeing in Canada and the U.S. is a form of postmodern Western-style fascism that elevates criminal behavior to the highest ideals of society while punishing the expression or utilization of basic human rights if they violate those ideals.

This is the plain definition of fascism. It doesn’t have to always be rooted in race. Merriam-Webster defines fascism as “a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.” This is what we are seeing in Western countries today. It’s not a matter of targeting any one race, but creating a standard of national interests and announcing that anyone who doesn’t subscribe to those interests – even if they affect one’s body in the most intimate way – is a threat to the nation and needs to be segregated, discriminated against, persecuted, and suppressed.

It’s not about equal-opportunity authoritarianism, because it is directed solely at those who don’t fit the national standards. Thus, we are witnessing the worst influx of illegal immigration and domestic crime precisely during the time of the most heavy-handed authoritarianism against “some” citizens. At the same time that we have the most autocratic stay-at-home order of all time, we experienced the greatest ubiquitous mass gatherings in history through BLM protests and riots.



It’s easy to rest on our laurels and thank God we are living south of the 50th parallel, but we have already seen political dissidents held without bail for a year with no criminal record for very nebulous charges that are clearly directed at chilling political dissent, not deterring violent or even disruptive behavior. For example, Couy Griffin, a county commissioner in New Mexico and founder of Cowboys for Trump who certainly had no prior criminal record, was initially held without bail for several weeks, despite never having stepped foot in the Capitol or committed assault or vandalism. The unappointed magistrate judge kept him solely because of his political views and used that as pretext to show he is a flight risk.

“I don’t think that the defendant will follow my conditions if he believes I am part of this machine of the democratic process,” proclaimed magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui at a hearing on Feb. 1, 2021. She went on to note that his political views, because she disagrees with them, makes him eligible to be held without bail – something not done for many murderers with massive rap sheets. She said that believing the election was stolen was “no different than people not believing facts or science.” No wonder they now want to criminalize dissent from their illogical and unscientific “public health” ScIeNcE.

It is therefore clear that we already have Canada’s problem of the judicial system criminalizing political opposition and thought crimes.

Yet this is occurring at a time when our judicial system has largely done away with pretrial holding even for violent repeat offenders. Here are just a few recent stories to consider when trying to process the breathtaking speed at which we have devolved into an authoritarian state ... except for what actually needs deterrent from strong authority!

James Tubbs, 26, who plead guilty to molesting a child at a Los Angeles Denny’s restaurant restroom, will serve no time in prison and will not have to register as a sex offender, thanks to the new rules put in place by prosecutor George Gascon. Tubbs, who now believes he is really a woman, is instead being held in a female juvenile facility, even though he is an adult male, because he was just shy of his 18 th birthday when he committed the crime. Fox News recently released a tape of Tubbs bragging about beating the system. ""I’m gonna plead out to it, plead guilty,"" Tubbs says in one recording. ""They’re gonna stick me on probation, and it’s gonna be dropped, it’s gonna be done, I won’t have to register, won’t have to do nothing.""

birthday when he committed the crime. Fox News recently released a tape of Tubbs bragging about beating the system. ""I’m gonna plead out to it, plead guilty,"" Tubbs says in one recording. ""They’re gonna stick me on probation, and it’s gonna be dropped, it’s gonna be done, I won’t have to register, won’t have to do nothing."" There is a carjacking epidemic in almost every major city. Recently, Chicago police superintendent David Brown revealed that 60% of all incidents were perpetrated by juveniles and that the system offers no real consequences for them.

Speaking of political crimes, how about attempting to assassinate a mayoral candidate? Well, in our fascist social “equity” system, it depends on the race and motive of the perpetrator. Earlier this month, BLM activist Quintez Brown was charged with attempted murder for stepping into the campaign headquarters of Louisville mayoral candidate Craig Greenberg and opening fire. Luckily, the bullets only grazed the candidate’s clothing and the shooter was stopped and apprehended. He came with extended magazines and clearly was coming as an assassin, but a judge let him out on $100,000 bail, which was posted by national BLM umbrella groups. ""There is simply no defense for a would-be assassin to be released on bail, 60 hours after firing on his intended target,"" Adam Edelen, the former chief of staff for former Democrat Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, tweeted. Can you imagine if someone from the trucker movement had done this to a prominent pro-mandate politician?

Bronx Supreme Court Justice Naita Semaj-Williams just allowed two teenagers charged with murder, manslaughter, robbery, gang assault, and other crimes to be released without posting bail. In a previous case earlier this month, Semaj-Williams walked back a $60,000 bond for a criminal charged with attempted murder and released him on his own recognizance.

These situations are occurring even in Texas. In 2019, Treveon Tatum, 20, was charged with murder but released by a Houston judge on just $50,000 bond. Despite being arrested again the following April for felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Tatum still did not have his bail revoked. Despite violating the terms of his bail multiple times, he was never re-incarcerated. Then, on Feb. 8, he was charged again with a new murder.

While COVID is being used an excuse to jail business owners and political dissidents, the same virus is being used as pretext to release true public safety threats. Earlier this month, Garrett W. Caspino was cited twice by police for criminal trespassing while acting erratically in a residential neighborhood of Corvallis, Oregon. However, he wasn’t arrested “because of COVID-19 protocols.” But just an hour later, he allegedly broke into a home in broad daylight, pulled down his pants, and choked the female homeowner against the wall while showering. He was later chased out of the house by the victim’s boyfriend. Despite the seriousness of the charges and the clear likelihood he will “reoffend,” Caspino will still have an opportunity to post bail, albeit a high amount.

The raison d'etre of the existence of Western governments is plainly spelled out in the preamble of our Constitution – to “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” Yet we now have a government that ensures tyranny and promotes the curse of violent anarchy while perverting justice based on politics and identity. One could not possibly abrogate the underpinnings of our social contract in a more grotesque manner than what today’s global elites governing Western countries are doing.

This is unsustainable and must change. It is our right – our duty – to demand a new government “to provide new Guards for their future security."" The same failed political strategies of the past do not speak to the magnitude of corruption in our government.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-new-western-fascism-countries-are-gradually-using-jail-exclusively-for-political-opponents,2022-02-23
Horowitz: When Australia fined mask companies for misleading about their effectiveness against a virus,"Once upon a time, sanity and science reigned supreme during responses to pandemics. There was a period of time between the Dark Ages and today when we actually followed logic, science, and learned experience and understood that masks do not stop viruses. You might be wrestled to the ground by police in Australia today for not wearing a mask, but 17 years ago it was the mask proponents who were on the hook for lying about mask efficacy in Australia.

We've all seen the warning labels from mask manufacturers that masks don't work against viruses, which used to be common knowledge among all government agencies as well as laymen. But during the SARS outbreak of 2003, the Australian government warned companies not to mislead the public about their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of SARS 1.

In an article titled, ""Farce mask: It's safe for only 20 minutes,"" the Sydney Morning Herald reported on April 27, 2003, ""Retailers who cash in on community fears about SARS by exaggerating the health benefits of surgical masks could face fines of up to $110,000."" Then-NSW Fair Trading Minister Reba Meagher threatened prosecution of those mask manufacturers who exaggerated the level of protection afforded by medical masks. ""I'm sure everyone would agree that it is un-Australian to profiteer from people's fears and anxieties,"" Ms. Meagher said.

How times have changed!

The irony is that, if anything, the science against mask-wearing is even clearer today than in 2003. It has now become clear that SARS-like viruses spread through microscopic aerosols, not primarily via large droplets. Those virions are often 30 times smaller than the pores in surgical masks, let alone the larger pores of the cloth masks most commonly worn. Also, the loose seal around the face for the overwhelming majority of people who don't properly clamp the mask is a source of all sorts of virion emissions. However, the Sidney Morning Herald noted at the time that masks were ineffective even against larger droplets.

""Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry,"" said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney.



""As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets.""



Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.

Now consider the fact that people are wearing this mask (or even more ineffective cloth masks) for hours on end, often reusing them for multiple days! And yet, nobody in government is questioning the consequential assumptions they have made forcing young children, seniors, and people with disabilities to continue wearing these absurd cloths, despite 10 months of evidence showing that shockingly high levels of mask-wearing fail to alter the natural trajectory of the epidemiological curve.

This video is a good demonstration of how worthless masks are in stopping aerosols.

On April 3, already several weeks into the unprecedented lockdown over coronavirus, but before the big media push for universal masking, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued guidance for respiratory protection for workers exposed to people with the virus. It stated clearly what governments had said all along about other forms of airborne contamination, such as smoke inhalation — ""Surgical masks and eye protection (e.g., face shields, goggles) were provided as an interim measure to protect against splashes and large droplets (note: surgical masks are not respirators and do not provide protection against aerosol-generating procedures).""



It wasn't until October that the CDC finally admitted to the aerosol threat indoors, but even then declined to acknowledge that it was the primary method of transmission and that therefore masks are useless. This is a point that Biden's top epidemiologist, Michael Osterholm, made last June. Now, Osterholm has joined a group of scientists criticizing the CDC for continuing to downplay aerosol transmission and not updating its indoor guidance based on this fact. But the irony is that Osterholm still won't acknowledge that he was right to assert that surgical and cloth masks don't work against the spread of this virus. Instead, they are now pushing for even tougher mandates to prevent indoor gathering or requiring N95 masks that are form-fitted.

It is unsustainable for large swaths of the public to wear masks that really cut off the aerosols for hours because, absent state-of-the-art oxygenation, wearing these devices for long periods of time will reduce oxygen flow. Moreover, their view on aerosols is an admission that this virus cannot be avoided in any realistic manner. Given that at least a third of the country has gotten the virus and many more vulnerable people have been vaccinated, it is simply insane to continue this charade.

What's worse about the mask mandate is that it's very likely that improper masking actually aerosolizes the droplets that would otherwise fall to the ground. As Megan Mansell, a PPE expert for OSHA and ADA compliance, writes at Rational Ground, ""The worst part of all is the ability of commonly-used face coverings to aerosolize respiratory droplets that would otherwise have fallen in a predictable arc of approximately 6 feet.""

Instead, these aerosolized particulates remain aloft for extended periods after passing through the mask, responding to airflow patterns (like HVAC systems and breathing), effectively evading the 6-feet-over or 6-feet-under rhetoric, as the aerosol range is 18-20 feet.



Plosive force, which is caused by respiratory activities such as sneezing, blowing raspberries, coughing, screaming, and snorting, among others, pushes larger droplets forcefully through woven fibers like flour through a sieve, and droplets that would have otherwise just fallen in that neat, predictable arc are now sent aloft within respiratory range, where they can remain for hours, effectively increasing atmospheric viral load in contained spaces.

The ""experts"" are implicitly yielding this point by now, moving on to requiring double masking (a counterproductive absurdity in itself, which weakens the seal on the first mask) and by recognizing the thin evidence behind universal masking months into this sadistic and shameful ritual. Just this week, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control conceded that ""there are still significant uncertainties about the size"" of the effect of surgical masks and that the evidence in support of homemade cloth masks (which is what most people wear when indoors for long periods of time due to comfort) ""is scarce and of very low certainty."" Yet they still double down on using them!

But 10 months into the failure of the masks to change the trajectory of the virus one iota, why do we continue to treat this as a harmless intervention, especially as it relates to children, who aren't even in danger of the virus? Aside from the psychological or physical effects, has anyone considered the future damage to the speech and social development of children? A recent analysis in Scientific American showed that babies begin lip-reading at eight months and that obscuring their ability to mimic the facial expressions of adults impedes their language development. Of course, the author still declines to actually attack the mask mandate despite making the case for how harmful it is.



Criminalizing human breathing is the most officious, inhumane, unconstitutional, and immoral thing our government has ever done to us. Given the wealth of data and information that has come to light over the past 10 months, which incidentally, coincides with decades of research prior to this virus as well, it is shocking how few GOP-controlled legislatures have stood against this travesty. After all, before politics took over, even the Australians understood the fraud of masks.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-when-australia-fined-mask-companies-for-misleading-about-their-effectiveness-against-a-virus,2021-02-18
Horowitz: Who will be the first governor to block the Pfizer injection for babies?,"The perception in the body politic is that the Democrats want an off-ramp from COVID and that many people have realized the existing failures were a catastrophic mistake. However, just as we were confronted with some of the worst battles seemingly at the end of WWII – the Bulge and Okinawa, for example – we are now facing the most immoral and unscientific COVID measure of all. Originally, the FDA planned to approve the now expired vaccines for infants, toddlers, and babies yet to be born. They have since delayed the authorization, but that just gives us a few weeks to put the nail in the coffin of this immoral experiment.

Our babies are now lab rats. After Fauci himself has admitted the emergency part of the pandemic is over, they plan to use an emergency authorization to approve the shot for a population for which there never was an emergency. But facts, laws, and morality no longer matter when Pfi$er comes for its fair share. And evidently, $54 billion in revenue is not enough.

Originally, Pfizer planned to submit its EUA application for kids 6 months to 4 years old to the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on Tuesday. On Friday, the company announced it would wait until the trial on three doses for children is finished, rather than going ahead with the two-dose application, which failed to show any improved immunity. However, the company still plans a three-dose submission for some time in April.

Pfizer’s own trial thus far found no benefit for those children, and even the most conservative estimate of adverse events renders this endeavor all risk and no return. And of course, there is no trial on the current variant. Yet our government was already distributing the vials. We call that a violation of the Nuremberg Code.

What could possibly be the motivation to pursue this authorization so quickly when the emergency has passed and the virus circulating seems to have a greater affinity for vaccine-mediated antibodies? Israel, with the most boosters in the world, is experiencing its worst death curve precisely now, even with the mildest variant. In some U.K. age groups, the triple-vaxxed have over a 2.7-fold greater case rate than the unvaxxed.

Meanwhile, Pfizer is trying to find data showing three doses do “something” for children, when we already know from the past 12 months with adults that even if they offer some antibodies, they wane and run the risk of causing enhancement and negative efficacy. Yet Pfizer will cleverly just show two or so months of the trial before the waning kicks in, just as with the adult trials.

Is there not one righteous man left in Sodom who has any degree of curiosity as to why this is happening? It’s one thing for older people to use this experiment with informed consent during the height of the pandemic. One could conceivably say they will turn a blind eye to all adverse events because of the perceived short-term benefit. But nobody can articulate any benefit for this group of kids at this time for this variant with these shots, and we sure have a lot of known and unknown safety signals about short-term and long-term consequences. This was so rushed that they even merged three phases all into one phase.

There’s only one plausible explanation for this maniacal alacrity to shoot up the babies, and it can’t just be about money alone. They want to destroy the one remaining demographic control group in this country that remains untarnished by this great human experiment. As we begin to witness the reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, and immune system damage, the media and the medical system will seek to blame the death and destruction on everything but the shots. In order to succeed, they cannot allow a single age group to evade the reach of the great experiment.

Last week, the European Medicines Agency announced it will investigate reports of ""heavy menstrual bleeding and absence of menstruation"" after mRNA COVID shots. We have known about these safety signals from day one, yet the global health entities chose to ignore them until after all of the young women and even children got the shots. How could someone in good conscience allow this shot to now enter the arms of babies and toddlers before this safety signal is fully investigated?



Now imagine if the federal government began distributing Planned Parenthood abortion centers throughout all the red states. Do you think the governors would sit idly and say, “Well, at least there is no mandate to get an abortion, it’s simply optional”? Hell no! They would ban that distribution throughout the state. Well, this is an even bigger pro-life issue, because it will affect exponentially more children. It’s no longer enough for governors to remain neutral on the shots. They must pledge to ban them in the states, and that begins with babies and toddlers. Pro-life means so much more than just fighting abortion.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-who-will-be-the-first-governor-to-block-the-pfizer-injection-for-babies,2022-02-14
Horowitz: Why I’m now in favor of abolishing the police,"The KKK would be proud. Their version of street justice and terrorizing jurors with threats worked splendidly in the Chauvin trial. Now that we only have mob rule, why even have police, who can only be used against We the People but not to defend us?

The standard of evidence in our post-constitutional mob rule is not ""guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,"" but ensuring that Black Lives Matter doesn't come to the juror's house and lynch his family. That is essentially the message to America. If the political system, the media, and the street mobs want a conviction, they will get a conviction regardless of the evidence. However, this will reverberate far beyond the defendant himself.

Famed Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz is correct in asserting that what was done during this trial is akin to what the KKK did during the Jim Crow era. ""It's borrowed precisely from the Ku Klux Klan of the 1930s and 1920s when the Klan would march outside of courthouses and threatened all kinds of reprisals if the jury ever dared convict a white person or acquit a black person,"" Dershowitz said in an interview with Newsmax.

However, where Dershowitz is wrong is that he thinks this conviction will be overturned on appeal. Show me the judge who will be willing to have his life destroyed by the new KKK mob justice. This will now happen with any white defendant — a cop or civilian — who has an altercation with someone who is black. Like the black defendants in the Jim Crow South, white defendants can no longer get a fair trial in America's major cities when the media and the elites turn it into a proxy for a race war.

We no longer have individual justice in America. We have mob rule incited by ""the system"" in pursuit of a transformational political agenda. The defendant in any case that is considered transformational — whether it's the case of George Floyd or of the Jan. 6 Capitol protesters — will be a human sacrifice for the greater cause. When the system makes a call for what it wants, that outcome will never be in doubt. The system gets what the system demands.

No serious person can believe that any sane juror would have placed principle over his own life and judged the evidence in this case properly. With the media, the president, and every state official gunning for a guilty verdict under the threat of doxing individual jurors, the outcome here was never in doubt. That should disturb us all, because this is not just about cops. It's about being on the wrong side of our two-tiered mob justice system.

It's the same reason why violent criminals are released without bail, while Jan. 6 protesters who didn't even commit a violent felony are held without bail. It's the same reason why every cop who shoots a citizen has his name released immediately except for the cop who shot Ashli Babbitt. It's the same reason why BLM is able to shut down streets with impunity and never get prosecuted, as it did yesterday, surrounding a truck:

In fact, the mob lynching of motorists at the hands of BLM is emblematic of why this is about so much more than the cops. Henceforth, the cops will sit back passively and not respond to volatile situations. That will precipitate a cascading cause and effect of violent criminals remaining on the streets even longer and becoming more emboldened to commit violence. Now, rather than the police being the first ones to interact with those criminals, guess who will do the heavy lifting? The civilians.



Now guess what happens when a white civilian is confronted by a black criminal and is forced to shoot him? You got it. Mob justice.

Which is why I have a novel idea going forward: Let's indeed abolish the police.

Believe me, I have no interest in anarchy. I want ordered liberty. But if the only option on the menu is anarchy for one side of the justice system, then by all means let's have complete anarchy for everyone, not anarcho-tyranny. Once the cops and the justice system will no longer punish and deter violent criminals and accept BLM as the rulers of our streets, then the only remaining function the police will serve is to arrest us when we are forced into a self-defense situation against BLM.

If we are going to be alone on the streets without proper police deterrent — which is essentially the current reality anyway — then yes, leave us alone. If the only purpose of the police is now to enforce COVID fascism or arrest someone who defends himself or does something the system views as criminal, then why have police? Remember, these two-bit dictator governors and mayors rely on the police to enforce their illegal and immoral edicts. Without a police force, they are nothing but a bunch of raving lunatics.

The reality is that they don't want the police abolished; they want police repurposed to enforce their own tyranny. Let's call their bluff and abolish them completely so that they can't be used against us, especially the big city police departments.



Moreover, we need to focus our attention away from defending the police to fortifying our own self-defense. State legislatures in red states need to tighten up self-defense laws so that mob justice can't do to civilians what it has already done to the police.

Let's completely abolish the city police departments and leave only the sheriff's departments in outlying areas. What you will see in America is that police have nothing to do with what ails our cities. It will bring the fight directly to the people without the police as the punching bags. Perhaps that is the only way to awaken the people from their slumber and force them to confront this corrupt system.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-im-now-in-favor-of-abolishing-the-police,2021-04-21
Horowitz: Will red states allow Biden’s HUD to impose racial quotas on neighborhoods?,"If the red states didn’t have enough reason to interpose against federal tyranny, they certainly do now with HUD’s new racial gerrymandering scheme for America’s neighborhoods.

Earlier this month, Biden’s HUD announced the reinstatement of Obama’s failed racial gerrymandering tool known as Affirmative Further Fair Housing. The short-lived July 2015 AFFH program was a de facto federal gerrymandering tool used to force local governments to impose low-income housing mandates on areas HUD targets for social engineering. To further the socially engineered outcome without the consent of the local populace, the program funnels funds to left-wing community organizing groups to transfer people from the inner city into suburban neighborhoods, all based on a data tool they would use to override local zoning laws. This is social transformation without representation at its worst.

We thought we defeated this Frankenstein rule after Obama left office, but the Biden administration has now resuscitated it stronger than ever. Under the 284-page proposed rule from HUD, any locality that takes any sort of housing grant program funding must comply with HUD’s new rules for “equity.” In plain English, that means that HUD can target any conservative county it dislikes and demand a change to the demographic composition by simply waving its magic wand of taxpayer and printed money. Counties would all have to submit annual plans on how to better meet HUD’s arbitrary and political standards, all the while enabling any individual or army of Soros organizations to sue the localities in court for not sufficiently complying.

“We are done with communities that do not serve people,” Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge told reporters.“We are going to hold responsible those that we give resources to. We no longer as a federal government can continue to fail the very people we need to help.”

Not surprisingly, a group of left-wing Democrat get-out-the-vote operators immediately hailed the rule as a breakthrough. Groups like the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the ACLU, UnidosUS, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, cash-flush organizations that would likely lead the litigation on this issue, heralded the AFFH rule as “an important step toward creating more equitable and affordable housing opportunities and stronger, more viable neighborhoods.”

Between the GOP-led House and the red states, now is the time to finally declare war on the gerrymandering of our neighborhoods. And yes, that would require ending the red-state addiction to federal funding.

Every American has the right and opportunity to purchase property, housing, or rentals in any part of the country. However, the federal government has no constitutional power to mandate the breakdown of natural settlement and development for different neighborhoods and counties in order to enrich their favored NGOs. Under the AFFH, HUD unilaterally decides that not enough individuals from a given race or ethnicity live in a particular jurisdiction. Then, in order to leverage the local government to “identify significant determinants that influence or contribute to those issues, and set forth fair housing priorities and goals to address fair housing issues and determinants,” HUD threatens to withhold community development block grants.

Further, HUD uses its army of lawyers and groups like the NAACP and ACLU to threaten lawsuits against counties that fail to comply with this scheme. For example, in 2016, Baltimore County was forced by HUD to settle under threat of lawsuit for a $30 million program creating 1,000 new low-income units with very specific criteria. The county was required to provide 2,000 housing vouchers to help families access""higher opportunity neighborhoods"" and was forced to ban landlords from denying rent to those without a paycheck to afford the rent.

This is what is coming to every American neighborhood if we don’t stop the central planning. You thought you’d be able to escape the rampant crime and prison releases? Think again. They will follow you everywhere.

Under any proposed debt ceiling deal, one of the primary departments to take a cut should be HUD. The federal government should not be involved in something as local as housing, just like it should not be involved in education. In the fiscal year 2023 omnibus, Congress provided HUD with nearly $60 billion in annual discretionary spending, almost half of it going toward the Section 8 housing program. This ridiculous program, akin to Obamacare for housing, often makes it more profitable for owners to bring in riffraff on the taxpayer’s dime rather than renting in the free market. Between HUD’s stick wielded against denying rent to those who can’t pay and its carrot of extra funding for renting to those who serve their ideological and political ends, Section 8 is one of the most powerful social, political, and economic tools of the Left. It’s therefore time to take a meat cleaver to HUD altogether.



Moreover, red states must pass laws this legislative session barring all state officials, local officials, and state-funded NGOs from complying with the AFFH rule. If half the country loses its HUD funding, then so be it. Wouldn’t red states and counties rather remain free and safe than become a mini-me of high-crime blue America? What is the point of taking money merely in order to invade neighborhoods with crime built on a political agenda hostile to single-family homes?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-will-red-states-allow-bidens-hud-to-impose-racial-quotas-on-neighborhoods,2023-01-31
"Horowitz: With no lockdown or mask mandate, Florida has roughly same hospitalization level as 2018 flu season","We are being told that our liberties must be suspended in order to keep hospitals from reaching apocalyptic levels. But what if those levels are just above normal and not anywhere near apocalyptic levels? And what if these lockdown measures do nothing to keep the levels down anyway?

Well, if there is anywhere we can cross-check this hypothesis, it would be in Florida, where there is no lockdown or mask mandate. In fact, people are flocking there from out of state to enjoy vacations and host conferences and even to live. Naturally, we'd expect hospital levels to be bursting at the seams if they rise and fall with lockdowns and masks, right?

Well, actually, you can barely see an increase in the hospitalization level in the Sunshine State from previous years, and the current level appears to be on par with the 2018 flu season, which was more of a pandemic flu than other flus in recent years. And in 2018, we did nothing as a nation to suspend liberties.

There is much debate over how to count a COVID hospitalization given the rampant and unprecedented testing of people relative to past flus. But one easy way to observe an apples-to-apples comparison to past flu seasons is to compare the overall average daily census of hospitalizations now to previous years and adjust those numbers per capita to existing population. In other words, if all of the COVID patients are legitimately there because of COVID, we would see an enormous excess in the total number of people in the hospital at any given moment for any ailment. Florida is simply not seeing a gigantic increase.

Here is how the math works: HHS tracks total daily hospital levels in all the states dating back to Jan. 1, 2020. If you take the average daily total hospitalization levels in Florida for the fourth quarter of 2020, you will find an average (some days are more, some are less) of 43,150.

Naturally, I wondered what the levels were in previous years, because the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration publishes quarterly data of hospital censuses for several recent years. I started with the first quarter of 2018, which included the harshest flu season we had in a decade. If you average the total hospital census over the 90 days from Jan. 1 to March 31, it works out to 41,094 people in the hospital on an average day. Adjusting for the population at the time, that would be 1,972 hospitalizations per 1 million people. That is compared to 1,998 per 1 million for this past quarter of 2020 with COVID as the predominant illness.

As you can see, although the hospital numbers for the fourth quarter of 2020 were about 6%-8% higher than in the fourth quarter of the previous two years, it was barely higher than the first quarters of every year. The reason it is fair to compare to the worst months of previous years is because it has become clear that the flu is gone for this year and that COVID-19 is this year's version of the flu. Thus, with flu cases down 98.8%, it is reasonable to assume that the January census will not grow as it typically does during peak flu season.



In other states, lockdown proponents can theoretically suggest that the reason the hospital numbers aren't worse is because of the measures they are taking. However, Florida serves as the perfect control group, given that there is no lockdown and there have been no statewide restrictions in place for several months.

It's also important to remember that as a nation we have thrown hundreds of billions of dollars at hospitals to treat this virus as compared to past flu seasons. So, the level of hospitalization we are equipped to deal with is much higher than in the past.

Off the bat, the numbers for this past quarter are inflated because on Oct. 6, HHS updated its guidance requiring hospitals to include those in ""observations beds"" as part of the census. Any data from past years did not include observations beds, only inpatient beds where people stayed for over 24 hours.

Also, because the nation is panicked over this virus, unlike during the 2018 flu season, the threshold for people going to the hospital is likely much lower than in past flu seasons. While there are definitely some people who are gravely ill with this virus, we have decided to treat this virus in the hospital much more liberally than any other virus. Hospitals receive higher reimbursement rates for treating COVID-19 patients. However, many of the cases are not necessarily clinical level.

As I noted in November, hospitalization is required in order to treat someone with Remdesivir, the only FDA-approved drug, which was approved on Oct. 22. It's very likely that a certain percentage of those people are not sicker than a typical flu patient who would be treated outpatient, but the Remdesivir necessitates admission to the hospital.



Taking all these factors in totality, especially in a state like Florida with no lockdown, it has become clear that the entire pretext for shutting down our liberties is built upon misinformation and lack of context. In other words, those 900,000 projected excess deaths due to unemployment from lockdowns are all for nothing.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-with-no-lockdown-or-mask-mandate-florida-has-roughly-same-hospitalization-level-as-2018-flu-season,2021-01-05
"Horowitz: Woke companies that funded BLM agenda now complain about looters, thieves on the loose","We definitely need to get tougher on sentencing looters and store robbers, but we should exempt those criminals from prison time if they loot one of the big corporations that helped spawn this epidemic of shoplifting to begin with.

Last week, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, representing 20 major retailers, sent a letter to Congress asking legislators to deal with the growing theft, shoplifting, and “smash-and-grab” mob attacks on retail stores. The corporations represented include giants like Target, Best Buy, Nordstrom, Home Depot, and CVS.

""As millions of Americans have undoubtedly seen on the news in recent weeks and months, retail establishments of all kinds have seen a significant uptick in organized crime in communities across the nation,"" said the letter.

The group’s solution is to push the Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act, which attempts to help inform consumers and online platforms about the sale of illicit products on the market. But that is treating the symptoms, and not even the most evident ones stemming from the crime wave acknowledged in this letter. Why not treat the problem?

The reason is that the problem is not a natural disaster. It began around 2015, when states began passing “criminal justice reform” at the behest of these very companies. They are now learning the hard way that when you call theft a low-level crime and essentially decriminalize it – at least in terms of incarceration – well, you will get more theft. These companies have funded the policies, organizations, and politicians behind the decriminalization and de-incarceration laws.

According to a 2020 survey of 61 retailers by the National Retail Federation, organized retail theft skyrocketed by nearly 60% since 2015 and cost stores an average of $719,548 per $1 billion dollars in sales. What changed around that time? Since California passed Prop 47 in 2014 and other numerous sentencing downgrades and early releases, violent crime has risen 13 percent, and there was a significant increase in burglary, larceny, and auto theft in 2015 and 2016. This is why we are seeing “smash and grab” flash mobs in California more than anywhere else. They know that if they steal less than $950 at a time, they will not be punished, but even for thefts larger than that sum, they practically never serve time in jail, even for repeat offenses. There is literally no deterrent.

But it’s not just California. In 2017, Oklahoma passed State Question 780, which also downgraded theft and led to an entire black market created from brazen shoplifting in once safe central Oklahoma.

So ironically, the companies’ beef has nothing to do with Congress, but with state governments that reversed a generation-long trend of tough-on-crime laws. Who is responsible? These CEOs need to look in the mirror. Target promised $10 million in support of the BLM agenda, which is largely responsible for the effort to defund or deter the police, reduce sentencing, and let criminals out of jail. Home Depot donated $1 million to the pro-criminal Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is one of the lead organizations pushing the de-incarceration agenda. CVS pledged $600 million to combat “systemic racism,” which is the lead argument used to push the fallacy of over-incarceration.

The chickens have now come home to roost. These CEOs don’t care about the robberies, rapes, and murders that have increased because of the woke policies, foundations, and candidates they support. It’s only when it affects them with uncontrolled shoplifting that they finally discover the consequences, yet still refuse to address the root cause. Thanks to the BLM agenda, Soros prosecutors, and de-incarceration legislation that they support, ABC News reported that 12 U.S. cities have now set all-time records for homicide this year: Portland, Ore.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Toledo, Ohio; Rochester, N.Y.; Philadelphia, Penn.; Columbus, Ohio; Baton Rouge, La.; Austin, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; Tucson, Ariz.; St. Paul, Minn.; and Louisville, Ky. What about the endless property crimes and car thefts that citizens must deal with every day, often going uncompensated? They don’t have a voice with Congress or state legislators now that these 20 big corporations have created a monopoly for politicians who side with criminals.

Indeed, if these CEOs really cared about the robbery epidemic, they would pledge to stop funding pro-criminal candidates, organizations, and district attorneys. Until they get on the right side of what caused this problem, they should not be allowed to dictate narrowly tailored solutions that only address the part of the mess they created that affects their bottom line.

Are these corporations really worried about the lawlessness on the streets, or are they using the BLM-driven chaos they helped fuel to pass a bill that will go after legitimate third-party online vendors that are undercutting them with cheaper prices?

The bottom line is that their solution will not rectify the problem of career criminals like Karim Clayton. Known as the serial CVS bandit, Clayton, a registered sex offender with a history of robbing CVS stores, was arrested for assault and battery on Sunday, Sept. 26, in Fairfax County, Va., and released on bail the very next morning, The next day, he was arrested for … you guessed it … robbing a CVS. He has barely served time in prison for all his infractions, including child sex abuse and crashing his car during a police chase, and even committed these crimes while out on an ankle monitor.

The point is that the people who are robbing large retailers are the same people harming citizens and are the same individuals who are facing no consequences or deterrent because of the Soros DAs, weak sentencing laws, and war on cops. What we need is a bill to get these people behind bars, not some oblique technology bill that seems designed to deal with another issue entirely.



Let’s face it, large retail chains, unlike mom-and-pop stores that get robbed, have the economies of scale to bake the loss of shoplifting into the cost of the products. What really concerns them is the technology crime and even legitimate online competition from people who have committed no crimes other than the ones these retailers would like to create. These CEOs are just using the crime wave as an excuse to advance their agenda, all the while continuing to fund the very politicians and NGOs that have successfully dismantled law and order in this country.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-woke-companies-that-funded-blm-agenda-now-complain-about-looters-thieves-on-the-loose,2021-12-13
MacIntyre: The Twitter Files reveal the left will win at any cost,"Elon Musk made good on his promise to increase transparency by releasing Twitter’s internal communications surrounding the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story leading up to the 2020 election. The documentation, laid out in a detailed thread by Substack journalist Matt Taibbi on Friday evening, revealed what almost anyone who had been paying attention suspected: that the social media giant colluded to suppress a legitimate news story to impact the 2020 election. The thread explained that tools that were initially added to Twitter to combat issues like spam and financial fraud eventually became avenues for censorship. According to Taibbi, both political parties could, in theory, lobby for the censorship of posts they objected to, but in practice the censorship had a consistent bias. Because the censorship system was based on connections and personal favors, the Twitter team’s extremely progressive political orientation led them to honor the requests of the left far more often than the requests of the right. The internal documents show Twitter staff regularly removing posts at the request of both the Biden team and the Democratic National Committee.



While conservatives, who are used to media bias, should not be shocked at the level of collusion on display, having the smoking gun is always valuable. The Twitter Files reveal a bureaucratic preference cascade in which a network of smaller decisions and biases led to one of the biggest scandals in recent memory. Taibbi’s reporting shows how the effort to suppress the New York Post’s report utilized extraordinary measures previously only used to block extremely malicious material like child pornography. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany was locked out of her account after tweeting about the story, and links to the story were blocked even in private direct messages. The story was, in theory, blocked under the company’s policy on hacked material, but the internal documents reveal that many employees knew this reasoning was dubious. Questions about legality and violations of the First Amendment were raised but seemed to be immediately trampled by the internal momentum of the decision. The prospect of Donald Trump winning reelection was too much for the progressive bureaucracy inside Twitter to bear, and so at every opportunity they doubled down on the decision to censor the report.

One would think that clear evidence of a conspiracy by a major corporation to suppress journalism in the attempt to influence a democratic election would enrage your average reporter, but of course the response was exactly the opposite. Establishment hacks quickly went to work attempting to assassinate Taibbi’s character, accusing him of doing “PR for the richest man in the world."" Far from being shocked by the politically motivated attack on freedom of the press, liberal journalists rushed to voice their support for the censorship and declare the story a “nothingburger."" There is no smoking gun, nothing to see here, just the internal communications of a company doing its job to stop the election of Donald Trump.

These moments are always difficult for conservatives, because with these major revelations of corruption, they always expect a price to be paid. The rules have been broken, the sacred trust of journalists revealing the truth has been infringed, the legitimacy of elections has been impacted; surely justice will follow. But that moment will not come, because the very class of people whom Americans rely on to hold the powerful accountable do not just agree with this decision, they fully endorse it. The left will drone on and on about the importance of democracy, write endless articles about the sacred duty of the press, but they only see these institutions as tools for the retention of power. Democracy is only valuable when it assures the advance of a left-wing agenda. Journalism is only valuable when it is destroying the enemies of the progressive movement. Any journalist revealing the corruption inside Twitter that led to the censorship of the Hunter Biden story is a traitor to the party who deserves to be discredited and discarded.

Sam Harris had a very revealing moment on the ""Triggernometry"" podcast that truly speaks to the liberal mindset around the Hunter Biden story. Harris was famously part of the Intellectual Dark Web, a loose collection of thinkers like Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, and Jordan Peterson who were supposed to represent a sensible and rational consensus that would allow public discourse to move beyond the woke censorship that seemed to dominate the public square. The neuroscientist has logged dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours championing the marketplace of ideas and the need for open discussion. Yet when discussing the Hunter Biden story in an interview, Harris was very clear that he agreed with the coordinated effort to silence the truth. Sam went so far as to claim that he would not have cared if Hunter Biden had the corpses of children in his basement because defeating Trump was a far more important priority. Harris seemed legitimately surprised when the shocked podcast hosts disagreed with his willingness to casually abandon his advocacy for free speech and open dialogue. The Twitter Files show that this mentality is not exclusive to Harris but is instead widely held by progressives in elite positions. Donald Trump was seen as such an existential threat to their power that no principle could be held above the goal of destroying the former president's chances of reelection.

This approach to politics is a very difficult thing for those on the right to process. Conservatives care more about rules than about victory, which is valuable for building high-trust societies but very bad in our particular moment, when their enemies own every institution that interprets and enforces the rules. Those of a conservative disposition naturally want to believe that the system works and that shared values of honesty and fair play will shame their opponents into correcting their behavior once corruption has been revealed. Unfortunately, this shared moral fabric no longer exists, and journalists are happy to abandon their theoretical duty to objective truth-telling and holding the powerful accountable if it means manufacturing political victory in the short term. Progressives do not see this as a betrayal of shared values, but instead as an appeal to a higher value. The one thing leftists know above all else is that they have the right to rule. If they do not hold back the conservative hordes at every turn, America could become a scene from ""The Handmaid’s Tale"" in the blink of an eye. Anything that would endanger that right must be eliminated or suppressed.

Knowing corruption is occurring is one thing, but having the receipts to prove it definitively is another. Musk plans to release another set of the Twitter Files with Bari Weiss soon, which may hold even more shocking revelations. No matter what comes next, the one thing conservatives should not expect is a serious backlash from the establishment towards the censorious efforts of Twitter during the 2020 election. Progressive institutions do not care about democracy or the duty of the press, and they enthusiastically support the manipulation and censorship of social media to generate their preferred outcome. Victories for the right will not come from sweeping revelations that hold the powerful to account, but by doing what Elon Musk has done: Capturing powerful institutions of the progressive machine, exposing their corruption, and stripping out the bureaucracy that has been allowed to transform these organizations into arms of the Democratic Party.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/macintyre-twitter-files-reveal-left-will-win-any-cost,2022-12-06
"Review: In 'Speechless,' Michael Knowles gives a stern rebuke to conservatives","The current best-selling nonfiction book in the United States asserts that political correctness has defeated conservatives. The progressive left has achieved victory in the culture wars by imposing new standards of speech and behavior that enforce its ideology and has successfully destroyed the traditional standards that the right has sought to conserve. Or rather, it would be more accurate to say the right has failed to conserve these standards by having nothing substantive to say about why they are good.

So argues Daily Wire host Michael Knowles in his new book, ""Speechless: Controlling Words, Controlling Minds."" While Knowles is hardly the first conservative writer to tackle the subject of political correctness, a favorite punching bag of many columnists, ""Speechless"" stands apart for confronting the failures of the right, ""which through decades of incompetence has permitted political correctness to invert our culture.""

Consider what Knowles is saying. Political correctness, a subversion of language, has enabled the left to turn upside down the ideas, customs, and social behavior of an entire society.

And isn't this true? Haven't traditional understandings of reality been undermined by politically correct language?

Borrowing examples from Knowles' book, ""women's healthcare"" and ""reproductive rights"" are words that refer to killing unborn babies in the womb, which is neither health care nor reproduction but their opposites. ""Trans woman"" is a phrase that refers to a man suffering from a psychological condition called ""gender dysphoria."" The man is not a woman, no matter how much he believes himself to be — but anyone who acknowledges this fact is called a ""bigot,"" a word for a person who is ""obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices.""

The ""premise at the heart of political correctness,"" Knowles writes, is ""the evil of truth and the goodness of lies."" Saying that a man is a ""transgender woman"" is a lie, but it's a lie believed to be compassionate because it makes the gender-confused man feel better about his condition. The truth that he's a man, along with all its consequences for sports teams, bathrooms, and his body's biology, is seen as destructive. And as such the truth must be suppressed by ostracizing those who speak it, canceling them on social media, getting them fired from their jobs, or in the extreme, using the force of law to make them submit to the reigning politically correct orthodoxy.

How have conservatives responded to this movement to redefine reality? Impotently, argues Knowles.

""Conservatives have failed to thwart political correctness because most do not understand what it is,"" he writes. ""They have portrayed political correctness and its derivatives, including 'wokeism' and 'cancel culture,' as 'censorship,' which we must oppose in the name of 'liberty.' These bumper sticker arguments reveal that conservatives understand as little about liberty and censorship as they do about political correctness.""



Knowles' project is to remedy this misunderstanding, first by exploring the intellectual development of political correctness by influential thinkers that set out ""with the explicit goal of destroying traditional standards and establishing new standards of speech in their place. Beginning with Karl Marx's instruction to his disciples to undertake a ""ruthless criticism of all that exists,"" he shows how Marxist thinkers of the Frankfurt School determined that political revolution could only be accomplished after cultural upheaval and created strategies for that purpose. He recounts how MIT professor Ruth Perry, the leftist founder of the school's ""Women's Studies"" program, attributed the first use of the term ""politically correct"" to Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-tung.

Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School is credited with developing the idea of ""false consciousness,"" which explained why the masses were comfortable with conservative cultural hegemony and unaware that they were oppressed. Knowles recounts how Second Wave feminists in the 1970s held ""consciousness-raising"" meetings to awaken themselves to their own oppression. And this led to ""woke"" ideology spread through academia in the fields of ""Women's Studies,"" ""Black Studies"", and ""Queer Studies,"" each dedicated to tearing down the old oppressive standards of speech and replacing them with standards that enforce their worldview.

The success of this movement is keenly felt in today's political controversies, whether it's the debate over critical race theory in schools, censorship on social media, or the fight for fairness in women's sports.

In this book are 85 pages of works cited and footnotes, which is nearly a quarter of the volume's length and demonstrates how Knowles took care to show his work for those he anticipates will accuse him of peddling conspiracy theories about communists. The thinkers he cites and their arguments speak for themselves.



After the left advanced its ideas into the mainstream in the 1990s, conservatives have responded to political correctness in two self-defeating ways, Knowles argues. More compliant, or some might say ""compassionate,"" conservatives have permitted defeat by adopting politically correct standards out of a misguided sense of being polite or, worse, because they have agreed with the left's criticisms of the old standards. More ""stalwart"" conservatives have rejected political correctness but done so on terms that guaranteed the left victory.

These conservatives have ""grounded their refusal in vague appeals to liberty and denunciations of censorship,"" Knowles charges. ""Rather than making a substantive defense of the culture they claim to wish to conserve, these conservatives are left making limp defenses of 'free speech' in the abstract, with nothing to say in practice.""

This is Knowles' most challenging and interesting argument, especially for more libertarian-minded readers. He says there will always be standards of what is acceptable speech and what kinds of speech should not be tolerated. He denies that there has ever been a neutral liberal order where all forms of speech were welcomed, and to prove his point he cites John Milton, ""the most famous defender of free speech in the English Language,"" and John Locke, the ""father of liberalism,"" who each in turn argued for censorship of views they believed were antagonistic toward the common good (Catholicism for Milton and atheism for Locke).

""All cultures 'cancel,'"" Knowles declares. He believes it is perfectly legitimate and in fact morally right to ""cancel"" speech that opposes traditional moral standards. He points to the 1950s, when Americans tried to ""cancel"" communism because the communist system is tyrannical and evil. Now in the 2020s, anti-communists are ""canceled"" because the left has used political correctness to supplant the old standards of good and evil with new ones that adhere to its ideology.

To win back the culture, Knowles says conservatives must ""not only articulate a moral and political vision but also suppress ideologies and organizations that would subvert that vision."" There will be standards of speech. Either they can uphold what is good, true, and beautiful, or they can promote what is bad, false, and ugly.

But what is that ""moral and political vision""? And how, practically, do American conservatives go about suppressing the ""ideologies and organizations"" that would subvert it? Doesn't the modern Supreme Court's interpretation of the First Amendment stand in opposition to such an effort? If the left's ""long march through the institutions"" took more than a century to achieve the cultural hegemony it holds today, for how long must conservatives persist to win it back?

These questions and more deserve their own volume, Knowles acknowledges as he declines to ""tack on a new conservative governing philosophy as a coda to this study of political correctness.""

But ""Speechless,"" by raising these questions, establishes a framework for a sequel, one I look forward to reading.

Roth: Biden is impoverishing the middle and working classes,"The Democrats used to claim they were the party of the middle and working classes. While that hasn’t ever been true, it is now out in plain sight.



At every turn, the government is coming after more and more of your wealth, giving money to cronies and deceptively selling their maneuvers.

Under President Biden, this began with his attacks on traditional energy, which have materially raised the cost of living and sent us into what appears to be a ""technical"" recession.

Then, just a couple of months into the Biden presidency, the deceptively named “American Rescue Plan” not only overstimulated an already fragile and supply-constrained economy, but it quietly shifted tax reporting requirements for the IRS.

This change, which went into effect January 1, 2022, targets not mega-corporations and billionaires, but rather hobbyists, side-giggers, and small online sellers. Transactions via third party settlement processors or their electronic payment facilitators (ecommerce sites and marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, sites like Venmo or PayPal) were shifted from $20,000 and 200 transactions to a $600 threshold for IRS reporting.

Now, you are always responsible for reporting any income you make to the government, regardless of the amount, so there is no change there. However, lowering this threshold to target very small transactions puts an additional burden on the middle class, from moms who resell items from around the house no longer being used to kids making some extra cash from side jobs via marketplaces to hobbyists who frequently change the items in their collection.

This means, as an individual, you need to keep extensive records of everything related to a transaction, from how much you paid to relevant deductible fees and expenses — much like a business would. Ultimately, this rule change brings about more stress, costs, and time for everyday Americans for something that may be underreported by just a few dollars or even something that wasn’t misreported at all.

While this was sold as going after the “very wealthy,” it’s pretty clear that a $600 reporting threshold isn’t meant for the wealthy to pay their “fair share” of taxes.

And that’s the ruse: While headlines talk about going after billionaires, the details always make it harder for you. The wealthiest will get loopholes to preserve their wealth while you will be forced to give up your money.

Now, with the new “Inflation Reduction Act” — which is a spending bonanza that has nothing to do with reducing inflation and everything to do with separating you from your money — the government is looking to hire more IRS agents.

In fact, it is granting Biden’s “Build Back Better” wish of $80 billion in additional funding for the IRS. More than half of this is expressly earmarked for enforcement, and the funding expects to hire 87,000 additional employees. The New York Times estimated this “would be a nearly 70 percent increase over the agency’s entire funding levels for the past decade.”

With only 800-900 billionaires estimated in the country, you can see that’s not who tens of thousands of agents will be focused on. Just like lowering the threshold to $600 for e-commerce and hobby reporting, this is meant to come after you.

Even if more taxes are implemented at the corporate level, what do you think will happen? Will corporations and their shareholders eat those charges, or will they all pass them on to consumers?

At the end of the day, you are paying more.

You are paying more for gas, for housing, for food, and for just about everything in your life. Now, they want to increase taxes and audits and create a scenario where corporations pass more costs on to you. How the heck is any of this friendly to the middle or working classes?

It isn’t. They know and they don’t care. Before the additional spending, the Biden administration, with no abnormal issues like COVID relief to balloon it, was already projecting to spend $5.8 trillion, about a quarter of the GDP! And $1.4 trillion of that is deficit spending.

The Democrats under Biden want to spend you right out of the middle and working classes into poverty (and frankly, the Republicans aren’t thrifty, either). They can name bills whatever absurd names they want, but it doesn’t hide the fact they are working for the elite, not for you.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-biden-is-impoverishing-the-middle-and-working-classes,2022-08-04
Roth: Biden’s plan to kill independent and gig work,"In late September, President Biden tweeted, “Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It's exploitation.” I agree, which is why it’s so frustrating that President Biden and his cronies keep trying to tip the scale and make it harder for the “little guys” to compete.



The latest affront comes packaged in a proposed rule from Biden’s Labor Department that is trying to make it harder for tens of millions of Americans to work freely. The department wants to reclassify millions of contract workers and freelancers as employees, a proposal tested in California under the “AB5 rule” that has already wreaked havoc there, which may now be codified nationally as part of the union-pushed “PRO Act” in Congress.

For context, approximately 32.6 million American small businesses account for close to half of the economy and half the jobs in the U.S. This highly decentralized half of the economy represents economic freedom and requires a fair and equal playing field. In return, they provide that competition necessary to capitalism to balance out the other half of the economy that is highly concentrated in the hands of 20,000-plus big businesses.

It is estimated that there are 57.3 million independent contractors, freelancers, and other “gig” workers currently in the U.S. These individuals, who come from all different demographic backgrounds and cover work specializations from caterers and film crews to writers and hairdressers, as well as your rideshare drivers, have myriad reasons for wanting to work independently.

With motivations ranging from desiring flexibility of hours and work location and flexibility to work for multiple clients to finding better opportunities that wouldn’t exist without a freelancing arrangement, there are a host of rationales behind why it has become so popular for people to exercise their economic freedom by independently contracting their labor as they see fit.

Moreover, independent contractors generally aren’t interested in being employees. With a robust number of traditional job openings today and nearly 1.7 employee-status jobs available for every worker looking, if that’s what a worker prefers to do, the opportunity is there. Moreover, when freelance drivers were surveyed in California during their back-and-forth over the statewide AB5 rule, a poll conducted by Global Strategy Group found that the drivers consistently said they want to remain independent contractors over becoming employees, by a margin of four to one.

While big government and big special interests (aka powerful unions that benefit from unionization) tend to frame independent work as some kind of exploitation by big businesses, of course, its biggest benefit is to small businesses, not large ones.

Small businesses rely on contractors for flexibility. Some only need help from time to time. But the biggest issue is the government-created burden of taking on employees. With the additional tax burden, insurance burden, and compliance burden, as well as impact on other business structures, like 401(k) or other benefit plans, government regulation already disproportionately hinders small businesses vs. large, well-funded companies with lots of human resources. It makes it incredibly challenging, if not impossible, for small businesses to take on employees and compete in the marketplace. So, not only would putting this rule in place take away more economic freedom from gig workers, it would also kill more small businesses.

As a supposed champion for competition and with a supply-constrained labor force, it would make sense for Biden and his administration to make it easier to hire more people and take on more labor, not erect additional barriers.

But, of course, Biden and his progressive cronies don’t actually seem to care about that. They want to give more power to the unions and to big businesses that will support their efforts, consolidating more wealth and power for them, instead of creating opportunities for all, especially the working and middle classes and small business owners.

No politician should be able to say, ""No, you can't work."" This is a bipartisan issue, one that further threatens an already deteriorating economy.

You have until November 28, 2022, as a member of the public, to formally comment on this proposal. You can do so here. Make your voice heard. You should be able to work how and when you want to. Your work, your choice — don’t let the government consolidate more power and quash more freedoms.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-bidens-plan-to-kill-independent-and-gig-work,2022-10-18
Whitlock: I stand by my comparison of BLM to the KKK — no matter who might object,"Wednesday evening, during an appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program, I analogized Black Lives Matter to the Ku Klux Klan.

It's a provocative and jarring analogy. It's a comparison I truly believe.

Friday morning, a reporter from my hometown paper, the Indianapolis Star, contacted me asking for clarification of my analogy. I told the reporter that I would respond in writing via email because I felt it was the best way to ensure that I thoughtfully addressed the inquiry.

A few hours later, the Indianapolis Star published a fair story relaying my thoughts. Here's a link to the Star story. The Star, even when I was a high school athlete 35 years ago, has always treated me fairly.

However, I believe publishing my full response to the Star is the most effective way to defend my analogy. Here's what I wrote to the Star reporter:

The Ku Klux Klan was founded on Christmas Eve 1865 by Confederate soldiers dedicated to undermining the racial progress sparked by the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation. ""The KKK engaged in terrorist raids against African Americans and white Republicans at night, employing intimidation, destruction of property, assault, and murder to achieve its aims and influence upcoming elections,"" according to History.com. Here's a link to a summation of the KKK's history.



Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests have primarily terrorized and destroyed property in black communities at night. BLM and Antifa have attempted to intimidate white Republicans. BLM protests have been violent and caused the assassination of law enforcement officers and other citizens. BLM is a cleverly marketed slogan that provides cover for extremists to undermine racial progress and bully American citizens to support Democrat politicians. It's not a coincidence that BLM riots pick up during an election cycle and disappear after the votes have been counted.



My analogy is not far fetched or hard to comprehend, particularly for the mainstream media. My analogy is far more substantive and accurate than pretending the events at the Capitol on January 6 were an armed insurrection analogous to Pearl Harbor and 9/11. BLM, founded by self-described trained Marxists, has a stated goal of disrupting Western Civilization traditions and values. Despite the sweet-sounding name, BLM acts as a racial divider — no different from the KKK.

It's my belief that the KKK and BLM share the same intent. They use race, intimidation, violence, and property destruction to achieve political goals on behalf of the Democratic Party.

Cultural changes and technological advances explain the difference in tactics between the KKK of old and its modern-day successor, BLM. Burning buildings have replaced burning crosses. Social media lynch mobs destroy a person's character, strike fear, and silence dissent.

In the KKK's heyday, a black man could have his life destroyed for making eye contact with a white woman. In BLM's heyday, a black man can have his life destroyed for expressing an opinion that contradicts the ideology of white liberals.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/whitlock-i-stand-by-my-comparison-of-blm-to-the-kkk--no-matter-who-might-object,2021-01-22

Tennis legend Martina Navratilova says what we're all thinking about trans swimmer Lia Thomas' 'Woman of the Year' nomination,"Following the NCAA announcement that transgender swimmer Lia Thomas was nominated for the 2022 ""Woman of the Year"" award by the University of Pennsylvania, tennis legend Martina Navratilova took to Twitter to express the sentiments we've all thinking when it comes to biological men competing in women's sports.

""Not enough fabulous biological women athletes, NCAA?!? What is wrong with you?!!!!!!!?"" tweeted the nine-time singles Wimbledon champion.

As you may have heard, UPenn nominated Thomas — a biological male who in 2017 ranked as the 462nd-best male swimmer on the school's men's team — for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's 2022 ""Woman of the Year"" award. Thomas joined the women’s team in 2020 after transitioning and almost immediately became the No. 1-ranked female collegiate swimmer in the country.

Navratilova, one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a vocal LGBT activist, has been speaking out about the unfair advantages of biological men competing in women's sports.

“It's not about excluding transgender women from winning, ever,” she told NewsNation in March. “But it is about not allowing them to win when they were not anywhere near winning as men. You try to keep it as close as possible to what it would have been had you been born in the female biological body in the first place.”

On BlazeTV's “Fearless with Jason Whitlock,"" Jason and contributor Delano Squires sounded the alarm about the less obvious concerns of transgender athletes such as Thomas. It's not just about violating norms of athletic fairness, but also the normalization of something that is downright dangerous to American children. At what point do surgeries and drugs used for gender transitions become abusive?

'They believe their job is to REMAKE your child': WSJ writer warns public schools may be LOST to woke trans activism,"There's a new ""reality"" spreading, and the mere act of questioning it has become incredibly dangerous, Wall Street Journal investigative journalist Abigail Shrier told Glenn on the most recent episode of ""The Glenn Beck Podcast.""

Shrier's book, ""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,"" exposes the radical gender activism that — like critical race theory — has overtaken our children's schools and culture. But even worse, she warned, it could end your parental rights for good.



Shrier made it clear she is by no means ""anti-trans,"" but simply speaking up against the extremes of this new ""reality"" has made her enemy No. 1 to many activists. Her book has been bashed so hard by the Left that Target has stopped selling it twice, Amazon once banned ads for it, and the American Booksellers Association even called sending it to others ""a serious, violent incident.""

In the clip below, Shrier explained why she believes ""there may be no hope for the public school system.""

""You have teachers behaving like activists across the country who have no interest in actually teaching. They believe their job is to remake your child,"" she asserted. ""We're seeing so much evidence of that, I think it's fair to say that it may be too deeply rooted in the ideology being taught in public school. I'm not sure that the public school system is redeemable at this point.""

Glenn Beck: Biden's tax proposal targets bank accounts with more than $600. 'That's NOT for the wealthy. That's for EVERYONE.',"On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Glenn Beck said he's just as nervous about America's future today as he was in 2007, except this time it's not just the economy he fears is near collapse. Inflation is out of control. You feel it every time you buy anything these days. And now, even with income tax, sales tax, property tax, death tax, capital gains tax, and ESG-related tax rate increases, the taxes you're paying are no longer enough for the government. To ensure you're paying your ""fair share,"" the Biden administration now wants to require banks to report aggregate transactions into and out of all personal and business bank accounts whose ""inflows and outflows of an account total at least $600 in a year, or if the account has a fair market value of at least $600.""

""It's $600,"" Glenn exclaimed. ""That's not for the wealthy. That's for everyone.""



Glenn broke down the details of President Joe Biden's proposal, which states:



This proposal would create a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime. Financial institutions would report data on financial accounts in an information return. The annual return will report gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown for physical cash, transactions with a foreign account, and transfers to and from another account with the same owner. This requirement would apply to all business and personal accounts from financial institutions, including bank, loan, and investment accounts, with the exception of accounts below a low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600.

President Joe Biden’s mental fitness,"Joe Biden is the oldest man ever to be inaugurated as president. When he was sworn in, he was older than Ronald Reagan was when Reagan LEFT office. Throughout his political career, Biden has always been known for his verbal gaffes. But repeated “gaffes” are a lot more concerning when coming from the president of the United States. They can no longer be laughed off as “silly Uncle Joe” antics. As we saw from Biden’s speech in Poland, the president misspeaking in a moment of international crisis is a serious, and potentially deadly, problem.

It’s clear to anyone paying attention that the Democrat machine shielded him from the public as much as possible while he was running for president in 2020, and that has largely continued in the White House. With America and the world on edge, it’s fair to question Biden’s cognitive health. His decline and struggles are plain to see, yet Democrats and Big Media refuse to ask the uncomfortable, legitimate questions about his fitness for office. Americans deserve to know whether their president is mentally up to the job, but should we consider invoking the 25th Amendment to protect the country?

On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Constitutional expert and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, who shut down Democrat demands to remove Trump from office, joins Glenn Beck to outline the very high litmus test for invoking the 25th Amendment: “It was designed so a president isn’t ousted in a partisan, adversarial manner.”

WATCH: Biden's Hostile Takeover: The Great Reset of America,"Our sacred republic has never been in more danger than it is today. Little by little, industry by industry, the far Left is fundamentally transforming the country we love. And it's an aggressive, hostile kind of takeover we've only seen in some of the world's darkest societies.

On Glenn TV this week, Glenn Beck exposes how the Biden administration and Democrats are aggressively scrambling to reset everything: our free and fair voting system, our kids' education, our policing, immigration and border security, our economy, our military, and our energy supply.

Finally, Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) joins to discuss how Biden's ""woke"" policies are threatening America's national security and our way of life.

"Mark Levin: Biden's new IRS plan isn't about billionaires, it's about creating a 'new surveillance state'","The Internal Revenue Service already has a deep footprint in the lives of Americans. Now, the federal government's prying eyes are looking for more ways to extract money. Under the guise of making billionaires pay their fair share, the Biden administration wants to give the IRS new, unprecedented powers to snoop on savings, checking, mortgage, and bank loans.

On the latest episode of ""Levin TV,"" BlazeTV host Mark Levin explained why he believes the IRS's real target is the average middle class American. This isn't about billionaires, Mark argued, it's about creating a ""new surveillance state.""

Mark called the administration's new IRS plan ""repulsive"" and ""unacceptable,"" adding that ""nobody trusts the IRS — and for good damn reason.""

Noting that Biden's spending bill includes $80 billion for the IRS to hire thousands of new staffers, Mark asked, ""Do you think they need tens of thousands of new auditors to audit billionaires?""

""It's the vast middle class that they're focused on. You. Just look at the constant Marxism in the class warfare. They want to have a surveillance state that can go into your checking account and your savings account, but they want you to think it's about the top one percent ripping us off,"" he continued. ""The biggest entity ripping us off is called the federal government. The biggest entity stealing money from us is the federal government. The biggest entity blowing money left and right, the money they take from you, is the federal government. It's not the top 1%.""

Mark went on to play a video clip of White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claiming that the proposed revenue plan targets only the ""highest income individuals"" who ""evade tax obligations,"" adding that ""it's about big banks deciding to protect the wealthiest Americans.""

""Big banks protecting the wealthiest Americans?"" Mark asked. ""This is so sick. This Marxist claptrap. Big banks aren't protecting anybody. Banks are the most regulated industry on the face of the earth,"" he added.

""I think they're going to impose this on us. You'll see, and I wish I were wrong. This is aimed at you. This has nothing to do with billionaires. If they want to audit billionaires, they know how to do that. There's a thousand trigger mechanisms in the internal revenue code. This is to monitor you, the average middle class American,"" Mark said.

WATCH: Mark Levin SLAMS 'political thug' Nancy Pelosi for blatant electoral flip-flop,"BlazeTV host Mark Levin slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a power-hungry ""hack"" and ""political thug,"" who has done a complete flip-flop on election integrity in recent years, on a recent episode of ""LevinTV.""

Levin offered the example of George W. Bush's presidential victory in 2004, after which Pelosi and the Democrats challenged Ohio's voting integrity, citing voter fraud, absentee ballots, and voter roll purges. But when Joe Biden won the presidential election, they suddenly decided elections are all fair and challenges aren't allowed.

""Nancy Pelosi ... she's just a hack. She's just a political thug; that's all she is,"" Levin stated. ""She doesn't have a principled bone in her body. Power, power, power — that's all she cares about. And her city, well, it's going to hell. Their schools stink. Law enforcement is undermined. It's not a safe city, not even on Union Square any more. You have drug addicts all over the place. You've got human feces all over the place. You can't even walk your kids, your family, through the center of the city any more.""

Levin played a video clip of Pelosi's reaction to the 2004 presidential election, in which she states, ""it's not just about counting votes, but what happens in all three phases — before, during, and after the election — and in all three phases, there were problems in this election in Ohio and elsewhere. Before the election, there were complaints about absentee ballots that were requested but did not arrive. There were reports of registration problems and of improper purging of the voting rolls. And the Ohio Secretary of State made decisions about provisional ballots, partisan poll watchers, and paper requirements for registration forms that some found questionable""

""They always challenge Republican victories in the presidential elections. They always have,"" Levin said of Pelosi and other Democrats. ""And then they pretend January 6 was the 'greatest threat' ... when they win it's fine. When they lose it's not. It's that simple.""

'Reimagine policing'? Mark Levin unpacks Obama's MARXIST messaging on law enforcement,"Amid the cauldron of misunderstanding and finger pointing caused by the tragic death of Daunte Wright, few things are more important than putting forth a message of understanding and reconciliation. That is, unless you are Barack Obama.

Ever the politician, Obama has now released an incendiary message before all the facts of the case are known.

""Our hearts are heavy over yet another shooting of a Black man, Daunte Wright, at the hands of police. The fact that this could happen even as the city of Minneapolis is going through the trial of Derek Chauvin and reliving the heart-wrenching murder of George Floyd indicates not just how important it is to conduct a full and transparent investigation, but also just how badly we need to reimagine policing and public safety in this country,"" Obama's statement said.



""Michelle and I grieve alongside the Wright family for their loss. We empathize with the pain that Black mothers, fathers, and children are feeling after yet another senseless tragedy. And we will continue to work with all fair-minded Americans to confront historical inequities and bring about nationwide changes that are so long overdue,"" the statement continued.

On the latest episode of ""LevinTV,"" Mark Levin exposed the former president's use of Marxist catchphrases like ""reimagine policing"" and attempt to tie this tragedy to George Floyd's death in order to advance a racial-injustice agenda at the expense of the rule of law.

""These politicians think they need to be out front, that they need to comment before they know anything, because they are playing to the mob,"" Levin stated. ""In my research of Marxism and Critical Race Theory, the word 'reimagine' shows up everywhere. That word has meaning. Reimagine means destroy.""

""I have a different idea,"" he continued. ""Why don't we reimagine the criminals? Why don't we reimagine people going to prison for committing crimes? Why don't we reimagine doing away with so-called bail reform that lets people out the back door? Why don't we leave the cops alone? If you have a bad cop, you focus on that cop. You're destroying law enforcement.""

Levin went on to tear apart the narrative of white privilege, police blaming, and systemic racism to tell the story nobody on the Left wants to hear: the alleged violent criminal history of Daunte Wright.

'Democracy is NOT anarchy': Mark Levin dismantles Stacey Abrams' push to overhaul US elections,"When former Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams ran for governor of Georgia and lost, many Democrats cried foul, claiming ""voter suppression"" cost her the election. Ever since, she's worked tirelessly to undermine voter integrity in the state of Georgia and across the nation, BlazeTV host Mark Levin argued on a recent episode of ""LevinTV.""

The mainstays of voter confidence — voter ID, verifiable addresses, notarized signatures and in-person voting — have all been cast aside under the guise of the pandemic and civil rights. Now, Abrams and the Democrats want to impose a centralized voting system on the nation. And it isn't for fairness. It's for power as they seek to destroy the electoral system and the practices that have worked in the past.

Levin played a video clip of Abrams speaking with CNN's Anderson Cooper about a Supreme Court case she claims is about Republican ""attempts to roll back the right to vote."" She goes on to accuse the GOP of ""rigging the election system"" to benefit their candidate and ""preserve their ability to win.""

""It's not rolling back voting rights,"" Levin asserted. ""Whose vote is being taken away? Because if someone's vote is actually being taken from them, they have a federal civil rights lawsuit. How many federal civil rights lawsuits are there, or even class action lawsuits, because someone is being denied the right to vote? That's not what we're talking about here.""

In the clip, Abrams goes on to advocate a centralized voting system by invoking the January 6 attack on the Capitol building, which she called an ""insurrection"" and a ""challenge to our democracy.""

""First of all, what does that have to do with voting?"" Levin asked. ""And number two, there was no 'insurrection.' There was a violent attack on the Capitol building, where people are being punished and should be punished.""

Levin also recalled the series of violent attacks in the late 1960's and early 1970's carried out by a radical left-wing group called the Weather Underground. On March 1, 1971, members of the Weather Underground bombed the Capitol building. In addition, the group attacked the Pentagon and New York Police Department headquarters, among others. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have pardoned several former Weather Underground members.

""Tyranny comes in many forms ... it can be fools, militants, ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter, Proud Boys, white supremacists, attacking court houses, attacking the White house, attacking the Capitol building. All of it is to be denounced. But let's not pretend this was an insurrection. This is how we know [Abrams] is so dishonest,"" Levin continued.



""That has nothing to do with solidifying democracy. Democracy is not anarchy,"" he added. ""Democracy is not anarchy ... remember the Cloward and Piven [strategy to Socialism and Communism] ... overload the system, collapse the system, blame the system, then take control.""

Is Biden MORE polarizing than Trump?,"Who is more divisive: Donald Trump or Joe Biden? Well, that depends on your definition of ""divisive."" Steven Crowder believes that Trump and Biden have been part of the division of Americans but ""in two very different ways.""

In this clip, Crowder said Trump was divisive because ""he pointed what we all knew for a long time but too many people were afraid to talk about, including Republicans: That the media is dishonest and the Left were liars."" Donald Trump is divisive because he pointed that out, Crowder said.

""Biden is divisive because now he is a part of the lie,"" he added.

Crowder compiled a list of policies and compared them for a clear picture of who looks more divisive on paper: Click here for more.

Trump vs. Biden's most ""divisive"" policies: Joe Biden (SOURCES: Time, CNN, AmericanMilitaryNews, RealClearPolitics, NBC) Biden sent tax dollars to fund abortion overseas when he revoked the Mexico City policy. Biden wanted to spy on ""domestic terrorists"" on the internet. Biden supports BLM. Said Antifa is an idea. Supports biological males in girls' sports. Donald Trump (SOURCES: WhiteHouseArchive, ABC, CBS, CNBC, ABC) Trump forced Canada and European nations to pay their fair share in NATO. Trump left the Paris climate agreement. Trump left the WHO. His tough-on-China stance and tariffs brought jobs back. Forced Mexico to stop migrants coming to the border by levying a tariff.

Who was tougher on Russia? Trump (SOURCES: ABC, New York Times, Brookings, TheHill) Armed Ukraine. Shuttered all consulates in Russia. Sanctioned Russia over human rights abuses, cyberattacks, 2018 election interference, and the occupation of the Crimea.

Biden (SOURCES: NYPost, USAToday, StateDept, Politico, BBC)



Rejoined WHO and the Paris climate agreement.

Transracial penis reduction,"""Transracial influencer"" Oli London, who was born white, male, and British, has already spent an estimated $250,000 on surgeries to ""become Korean"" and now has plans to undergo penis reduction surgery ""to be 100 percent Korean.""



""I don't want people to get offended by this, but in Korea, [the average] penis is like 3.5 inches, and I get trolled all the time. People say, 'Oh, you can't be Korean. You're not 100 percent Korean,' and I just want to be 100 percent Korean,"" London told Newsweek in January. ""I would even have a penis reduction so I'm, like, the Korean average. That's how far I'm willing to go. I can have it done in Thailand, and it will cost between $6,000 and $8,000.""

London, who says he identifies as Korean as well as non-binary and prefers the pronouns they/them or he/him, says he's gotten intense backlash from people on social media who accuse him of ""cultural appropriation.""

“Why do people get so offended?"" he asked in an interview with GB News. ""I’m just following my dreams.”

Amber Heard 'plays victim' in Savannah Guthrie interview,"Amber Heard may be regretting her decision to ""speak out"" after a video clip from her interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie was shared on social media Tuesday.

Heard sat down with Guthrie in her first interview since her defamation trial against ex-husband Johnny Depp. The interview is scheduled to air on the ""TODAY"" show in two parts this week and in its entirety on ""Dateline"" this Friday.

A preview clip from the interview posted on Twitter has garnered more than 2 million views and thousands of comments — but the ""Aquaman"" actress isn't going to be pleased with her latest notoriety.

“Even somebody who is sure I am deserving of all this hate and vitriol — even if you think that I’m lying, you still couldn’t look me in the eye and tell me that you think on social media there’s been a fair representation. You cannot tell me that you think this has been fair,” Heard says in the clip.

A second video clip from the Guthrie interview has also been making the rounds on Twitter, with similar results for Heard's (lack of) public appeal.

On a recent episode of ""Relatable,"" BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey and POPlitics' Alex Clark discussed whether Amber Heard really got a fair trial in the age of social media.

Steve Deace: Twelve inconvenient truths we must absorb for survival,"On Tuesday, Steve Deace discussed inconvenient truths about America. In this clip, Deace delivered some brutal honesty about the times we are in that ""we need to confront, acknowledge and absorb."" Here are 12 truths Deace says we must accept before we can begin our mission toward change.

We must see ourselves more as pilgrims rather than patriots. We must see ourselves as sons of liberty not founding fathers. America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country founded on limited government. It is now a pagan country founded on limited liberty. The constitution is a dead letter. We have wasted decades within the national Republican Party with no real fruit to show for it. We need to let go of the nostalgia for the symbols and institutions. We need to at least consider we will no longer have free and fair elections. We will imminently be banned from all mainstream platforms of significance. We need to create our own sub culture and eco system. Not a separate culture. An alternative one. There are not enough of us to completely overtake the spirit of the age. But there are too many of us for the spirit of the age to assert itself completely. When working inside the structures within the broader culture, we must see ourselves as subversives as well as servants. Revival or bust.

Benjamin Ryan's best-ever monkeypox typo,"Monkeypox has been making headlines in recent months as more than 2,000 cases have been reported in the United States so far this year, according to the CDC. Many are wondering if the dreaded disease will be the next pandemic to sweep across the globe, and it's no wonder with people like ""James Lim, MD"" posting things like this on social media:

Thankfully, there are people like science reporter Benjamin Ryan who are willing to let the world laugh at what might be the most hilarious typoof all time if it teaches people a thing or two along the way.

In response to Lim's fear-mongering, Ryan posted the following tweet:

He said what?

Um, well, we assume Ryan meant to type ""men"" instead of ""me,"" but that's not what was posted for the world to see. Twitter, of course, took it and ran:

He did indeed own it and even apologized.

Ryan also celebrated ""teaching people about global pubic health!""

In all fairness, we're pretty sure the ""pubic"" typo was intentional (see tweet below.) Either way, Ryan's busy morning on Twitter has been both hilarious and educational.

On ""The Chad Prather Show,"" BlazeTV host Chad Prather talked about how the word ""monkeypox"" has now become controversial. If you thought we were done renaming things like universities, books, and viruses, think again, because the World Health Organization says it's time to rename “monkeypox” in order to avoid stigma and racism.

CNN learns the hard way not to mess with GOP candidate Kari Lake,"CNN senior national reporter Kyung Lah thought she'd caught Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake off guard when she asked for an impromptu interview outside an event, but ended up sorely regretting her decision.



Lake, a former Fox news anchor, shook hands with Lah as she approached and immediately pointed out that the CNN reporter wasn't wearing a mask any more, a barbed reference to a contentious interview in October 2021, in which Lah smeared the GOP candidate as a “rising star of the right-wing and proud spreader of lies."" Lah asked if Lake had “a minute to chat.”

“I’ll do an interview,"" Lake answered, ""as long as it airs on CNN+. Does that still exist? I didn’t think so, because the people don’t like what you guys are peddling, which is propaganda. Thank you.”

Lake then walked into the event, leaving Lah utterly speechless.

It looks like Lake gained quite a few fans on Twitter:

Kari Lake has been a longtime friend to ""The Glenn Beck Program."" She joined Glenn last August to tell Glenn why she left the corrupt world of media, what prompted her to enter ""the even more corrupt world of politics,"" and how she plans to make a big difference in her battleground state of Arizona.

Lawyer: I’d vote NOT GUILTY for Officer Derek Chauvin. Here’s why.,"Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin is facing several charges for his role in the death of George Floyd. But attorney Andrew Branca, who specializes in self-defense law, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to explain exactly what must be proven in order for those charges to stand.

Did Chauvin act reasonably in the context of the entire situation? Were his actions directly responsible for Floyd's death, or could it be blamed on factors beyond Chauvin's control?

Branca also argued that the prosecutor committed misconduct serious enough for a potential appeal, how political tension makes it ""impossible"" for a fair trial, why he would vote not guilty, and what sentence Chauvin is facing if the actual jury disagrees.

Glenn Beck apology George Soros,"A recent slap on the wrist by the ever-so-fair social media platform YouTube forced Glenn Beck to realize that maybe he's made other mistakes as well — and it's important to come clean when you make a mistake.

For years, Glenn has been calling a certain ""spooky dude"" from Hungary every name under the sun: The King on the Chessboard, the Emperor from Star Wars, the Puppet Master, and even Pepperoni Eyes. But this new information that has recently come to his attention has made him rethink everything he once condemned.

So, Glenn used the first part of his radio show on Friday to apologize to his one true nemesis (no, not Woodrow Wilson). You don’t want to miss this apology to the man, the myth, and the legend: GEORGE SOROS.

Why Disney's Lightyear flopped,"Disney-owned Pixar's latest animated film ""Lightyear"" was expected to blast off last weekend, but ended up falling way short of box office expectations.

Box office analysts expected the ""Toy Story"" spin-off to gross $70 million and $85 million domestically and $50-60 million in offshore markets, despite having been barred in at least 14 countries over a controversial same-sex kissing scene, but the film's total haul worldwide wound up at $85.6 million.

Earlier this year, the controversial kissing scene was apparently cut from the film, but the Disney corporation made a show of reinstating it in March amid outrage over Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' (R) Parental Rights in Education bill.

Now, why would such a woke movie flop at the box office on its opening weekend?

""Blame the fact that it doesn’t appeal to girls, blame Disney+ for stealing family moviegoers, blame the lack of an ensemble Toy Story cast, heck, blame everything as Disney/Pixar’s Lightyear didn’t do its magic by internal studio or industry standards this weekend with $51M, close to a third below its lowest $70M pre-release projection,"" said Deadline.com.

""Variety"" lamented that the film's lofty ""ambitions were thwarted by heightened competition from Universal’s behemoth 'Jurassic World: Dominion' and Paramount’s high-flying 'Top Gun: Maverick,' as well as little intrigue to watch a slightly esoteric origin story about Buzz Lightyear.""

AV Club guessed that maybe ""longtime fans have simply grown up and moved on and/or gotten tougher to please.""

Both Vanity Fair and Movie Web seemed to think the problem was with the movie's ""high concept premise"" of making a film based on a film that was supposed to have inspired the Buzz Lightyear toy in ""Toy Story.""

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck, Stu Burguiere, and Pat Gray weren't afraid to call out the obvious reason Disney's latest film fell flat: Parents are just tired of woke politics in their children's movies. It's really not that hard to figure out, Disney.

Nigel Farage: 'DAMAGE that Biden has done to America's international reputation could NOT be greater',"The United States and Great Britain have enjoyed an alliance since World War I, but President Joe Biden's failure to coordinate his Afghanistan withdrawal with allies like the U.K. has devastated America's overseas reputation, argues Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.

Farage joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Monday with the latest on how America's diplomatic relations with its allies may look for the rest of Biden's presidency, and perhaps much further into the foreseeable future.

""You know, I've spent 40 years working for American companies and businesses, being allies, politically, with Donald Trump and many friends of the Republican Party. There's nobody this side of the pond who is more pro-American, more pro-respectful relationship than I am,"" Farage told Glenn. ""And it hurts me to say this, but for Biden to unconditionally withdraw from the military mission after 20 years, without any planning or any foresight as to how we get our nationals out in the case of a Taliban advance, and to do it without even consulting the British prime minister, and refusing to answer his phone call for almost 48 hours, sends a message to us. And the message is, we cannot trust America.

""Despite being our closest partner for over 100 years, we cannot trust America with this man in charge. And it's a sad realization, but it's true. And I think it's even further than the relationship with the UK and the USA. I think NATO, frankly, ceases to function. So the damage that Biden has done to America's international reputation could not be greater,"" he added.

Glenn and Farage also agreed that, while the corporate media accused former President Donald Trump of wrecking the NATO alliance, Nigel explained why it's Biden who has truly thrown that relationship into turmoil.

""The way the international mainstream media wanted to portray the Trump movement, just as they did with the Brexit movement, [was] 'Trump is going to destroy NATO.' No, no, no, what Trump did, he turned up at the NATO HQ of Brussels and said ... that we cannot go on with a NATO where major countries like Germany are only paying half the membership fee,"" Farage explained. ""The NATO rules are actually very fair. Regardless of the size of a country, you must spend 2% of GDP on defense. And the Germans were spending one [percent.]. So actually, in many ways, what Trump was doing was trying to make NATO fair. But it was willfully, willfully misportrayed.

""What Biden has done, is to say, 'Look, we're the big guys in NATO. But, hey, we just do stuff without consulting, despite the fact that you, too, have had many hundreds of people killed in Afghanistan, and put big money into Afghanistan. But without even the compliment of a conversation, we've decided that, effectively, the NATO mission is over.' So, yeah, the special relationship with Britain is completely in tatters. NATO, I'm not even sure it could possibly survive what it's just gone through,"" he continued.

""And, of course, when you look at those photographs today, of Taliban soldiers now dressed in American military equipment with $85 billion worth of U.S. military hardware now in the hands of these people, with the giant lithium reserves that exist in Afghanistan now completely open to exploitation with Communist China, and warnings coming in the UK today that our terrorism threat is now going up directly as a result of what has happened in Afghanistan ... believe me, Glenn, this is on every level a disaster.""

Trump interview Durham Report,"The New York Times, a news outlet which has never once taken a negative stance against Donald Trump, wrote on Monday that Special Counsel John Durham's recent bombshell report appears to be ""mostly wrong or old news,"" calling it the ""latest example of the challenge created by a barrage of similar conspiracy theories from Mr. Trump and his allies.""

Former President Donald Trump joined Glenn Beck in an exclusive interview on Tuesday to discuss what the Durham report revealed about certain “tech research"" — that was definitelynot spying — which tied the Trump campaign to Russia election interference, and how the always ""fair and balanced"" media has covered this latest information.

Trump also tore into Hillary Clinton, explaining why he believes she is guilty of ""treason"" and this whole scandal is ""far bigger"" than Watergate.

'YOUR voice makes a difference': Coca-Cola takes a 'pause' on woke initiatives after after pressure from the Right,"Earlier this year, Coca-Cola became the poster child for how a corporation could shove leftist ideologies onto its consumers. The company suspended advertising on Facebook in a push to censor former President Donald Trump, published a manifesto about racial equity, and demanded all legal teams working for Coke meet certain diversity quotas.

But now, after Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and many other conservative voices called for a boycott of the company's products, Coca-Cola appears to be shifting directions.

The Washington Examiner reported that the company issued a conciliatory statement after conspicuously failing to appear on a published list of hundreds of corporations and individuals that signed a statement denouncing the Georgia voting bill.

""We believe the best way to make progress now is for everyone to come together and listen respectfully, share concerns, and collaborate on a path forward. We remained open and productive conversations with advocacy groups and lawmakers who may have differing views,"" the company said. ""It's time to find common ground. In the end, we all want the same thing – free and fair elections, the cornerstone of our democracy.""



Then last week, Coca-Cola Co.'s new general counsel, Monica Howard Douglas, told members of the company's global legal team that the diversity initiative announced by her predecessor, Bradley Gayton, is ""taking a pause for now."" Gayton resigned unexpectedly from the position on April 21, after only eight months on the job, to serve as a strategic consultant to Chairman and CEO James Quincey.



""Why is Coca-Cola 'taking a pause' on all of these? Because you have been standing up,"" Glenn Beck said on the radio program Monday. ""You and others have been standing up. Your voice, it's the power of one. Your voice makes a difference.""

WaPo: Stacey Abrams 'repeatedly' denied election results,"The Washington Post's illustrious fact-checker Glenn Kessler debunked current Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' recent claim that she ""never denied"" the results of the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia when she lost to Republican Governor Brian Kemp.

Kessler listed numerous instances of Abrams claiming that she ""won"" in 2018 and that the election was “stolen"" or “rigged"" and admitted that Abrams ""refused to concede"" to Kemp following the election. He even acknowledged that ""a review of numerous interviews shows that Abrams subsequently used language denying the outcome of the election that she now appears to be trying to play down.""

However, Kessler was also quick to dismiss comparisons between Abrams' version of election denial and that of former President Donald Trump.

""Abrams repeatedly questioned the integrity of Kemp’s victory ... but what might have appeared at the time as a savvy appeal to voters who felt disenfranchised looks different now that Trump and his GOP allies have taken election denialism to a dangerous new level,"" Kessler wrote.

""Moreover, unlike Trump, Abrams has not attempted to rile supporters to violence or call into question the outcome of the election before it takes place,"" he added.

Kessler noted Abrams' recent appearance on ABC's ""The View,"" during which she claimed ""I have never denied that I lost"" after host Sunny Hostin actually praised her for not conceding the 2016 election.

""When you lost in 2018, you didn’t traditionally concede, which I appreciated because you cited voter suppression. Are you confident that this will be a free and fair ... election, and not a repeat performance of what happened before?"" Hostin asked Abrams.



""I have never denied that I lost. I don’t live in the governor’s mansion. I would have noticed,"" Abrams responded.





Watch the latest video at <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com"">foxnews.com</a>





""Now, Abrams is in a rematch with Kemp, fending off questions from reporters that she’s little different from former president Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed election fraud led to his defeat by Joe Biden. In recent weeks she has subtly adjusted [her] language to argue that, unlike Trump, she 'never denied the election' and 'never denied that I lost,'"" Kessler wrote.

""Abrams played up claims the election was stolen until such tactics became untenable for anyone who claims to be an advocate for American democratic norms and values,"" Kessler admitted before launching into a detailed litany of Abrams' election-denial rhetoric.



Abrams recently made headlines for a different batch of bizarre claims about Georgia's six-week abortion ban.

“There is no such thing as a heartbeat at six weeks,” Abrams said at a student forum in Atlanta last week. ""It is a manufactured sound designed to convince people that men have a right to take control of a woman’s body.""

On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales and guests Stu Burguiere and Alex Stein discussed Abrams' extraordinary claims and how the Left has quickly jumped to defend them.

'People just projected negativity on you': Ex-cop exposes how black officers are REALLY treated,"On ""The Rubin Report,"" BlazeTV host Dave Rubin talked to Brandon Tatum, former police officer and author of ""Beaten Black and Blue: Being a Black Cop in an America Under Siege,"" about what it’s really like to be a black police officer, the impact the defund-the-police movement has had on police morale, and the truth behind some of the prominent myths surrounding cases like Michael Brown and the Breonna Taylor shooting.

In this clip, Brandon shared his recent experience of being booed while speaking at Sean “Diddy” Combs’ Revolt Summit 2021 for having a different viewpoint. Then, he and another police officer had their panel discussion comments deleted from the final broadcast of the summit.

""I was on the panel as a black police officer, and literally everything I said was to support the relationship between law enforcement and the black community. I got booed,"" Brandon explained. ""People may not understand that this is what it's like actually being a black man in America on the police department.""

He added, ""The funny thing is, they scrapped ... everything me and another black officer said. And we said a lot of profound things that I think could be invaluable to the community. And they deleted it when they posted it, which is shameful.""

Brandon also discussed the tension between black officers and the communities they are sworn to protect.



""People just projected negativity on you. [They thought] you had to be a murderous thug,"" he said. ""It was very disheartening. Because I knew the men and women who worked with me, and worked around the country, putting your life on the line for other people. I mean, this is not a video game, man. This is not, you know, like a pre-recording of something. I mean, if you mess up, it's real life. This is real time. And the men and women I knew, and their families, a lot of people [who are] just great individuals who have a passion for supporting their communities. And to see them get just ragged on with false narratives being pushed was something that was like, you know, I've got to write a book and I've got to tell the story and correct some of this stuff, because people aren't getting a fair evaluation of law enforcement.""

WATCH: Dave Rubin ROASTS self-proclaimed 'reality-based' reporter Brian Stelter with one short montage,"On Monday's episode of ""The Rubin Report,"" host Dave Rubin talked about CNN host Brian Stelter's increasing media bias, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' shocking admission to Chris Wallace on Fox News about how many Haitian immigrants have been released into the U.S., and the Democrats' extreme response to the Texas abortion bill.

First, Dave shared a clip of Brian Stelter asking his guest, Yale professor Timothy Snyder, what the ""reality-based media"" should do to protect democracy on the latest edition of CNN's ironically named ""Reliable Sources."" Stelter chuckled gleefully as his guest recommended that the media should ""drop the fair and balanced approach"" to reporting, seemingly encouraging more biased coverage of political parties, and get ""prepared for an attempt for people to take power undemocratically in 2024.""

Dave then exposed Stelter as ""one of the prime purveyors of lies"" by playing a video montage of the CNN host, who proves he has no problem with dropping a ""fair and balanced approach.""

"'You knew what we were asking, ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION': Dr. Drew on why he lost trust in Fauci","Dr. Drew Pinsky joined Dave Rubin on ""The Rubin Report"" to talk about how Dr. Anthony Fauci lost his trust, how the CDC created vaccine hesitancy, the truth about mask efficacy, and how woke culture is creating a climate where doctors are afraid of being canceled for stating scientific facts.

First, Dr. Drew discussed how the CDC ignored everything it had learned from the HIV epidemic and lost the trust of the public. He explained why Fauci's denial of gain of-function research funding caused him to no longer trust him despite looking up to him for decades.

""I've been overly fair [with Fauci] because I've been through five pandemics with him,"" Drew told Rubin. ""He was my really my man during HIV, MERS, SARS-1, H1N1 — H1N1 was a terrible pandemic. You don't even know what happened. That was bad ... why didn't we have a moderate reaction to that one at least?""



""I figured [Fauci] had been adulterated by what everyone's getting adulterated with, which is the tribalism of our time. And I thought he would revert to the mean,"" he continued. ""His judgment has been awesome and I still to this day believe we'll see a reversion to the mean in terms of him looking OK. However, he finally did something that upset me, which was ... in front of Congress, multiple times, whenever they would ask him about the gain of function or funding, he would just be like, 'I'm confused. What are you talking about?' ... What didn't you [Fauci] just tell us?""

""That's how you create vaccine hesitancy,"" Dr. Drew continued. ""Now it's like, OK, I can't trust you. You knew what we were asking, answer the damn question. Be open about this. Trust the American people to be able to digest what you're telling them, give them a recommendation, and then move on.""

Drew went on to talk about why people don't know who to trust for public health advice and why it was ""offensive and disgusting"" that the decisions Joe Rogan made with his doctor resulted in such an outcry.

Dana Bash stumps Elizabeth Warren with simple loan forgiveness question,"CNN's Dana Bash asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on ""State of the Union"" this week if she thinks President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan is fair to those Americans who have worked hard to pay off their debt or to not go into debt in the first place. Warren thought she'd managed to confuse and distract her host (and audience) with the usual effusion of overly-emotive theatrics, but Bash flipped the script and stumped Warren with one simple statement.

Asked what she would say to people who think student loan forgiveness is ""really not fair"" and that the government isn't helping people with ""other struggles,"" Warren launched into a sob story about her ""daddy"" who ""ended up as a janitor"" and had no money to make her dreams of becoming a ""public school teacher"" come true.

""But I found a public university that cost 50 dollars a semester, and for a price I could pay for on a part-time waitressing job, I finished a four-year diploma. I became a special education teacher and it opened a million doors for me. That opportunity is not out there today for any of our kids,"" Warren preached.

""Our public education system is no longer creating opportunities for kids like me and other kids whose families can't afford to write a check. Instead, we're saying to these young people, you've got to get an education, but we are going to wrap the chains of debt around you, and for many, you're going to be paying it for decades into the future, including getting Social Security checks garnished. That's not the America we want. We want to be an America of opportunity,"" she continued.

At this point, Bash interrupted Warren's well-rehearsed speech to say, ""yeah, but I'm not sure that relieving this amount of debt changes the cost of college. The cost of college is still exorbitant.""

After several seconds of stunned silence (complete with a priceless deer-in-the-headlights facial expression,) Warren pulled it together enough to find someone else to blame for the exorbitant cost of college — in this case, the American taxpayers.

""Well, look, part of what [student loan forgiveness] does is it deals with the debt that has been built up because the cost of college has gone up because taxpayers have made fewer investments in our public colleges and universities,"" Warren stammered.

Dan Crenshaw wrecks Jake Tapper over Texas border hypocrisy,"On “The Rubin Report” Wednesday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a clip of CNN’s Jake Tapper asking Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw if Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to bus ""nearly a thousand undocumented migrants"" from the border in Texas to New York City will backfire. Instead, it’s Tapper’s question that backfired when Crenshaw pointed out the hypocrisy of the Democrats who are complaining about the impact of a few thousand migrants in their cities, while the number of undocumented migrants crossing into Texas illegally exceeds that number every day. He also pointed out that the border crisis is unfair to law-abiding immigrants and asylum-seekers who are trying to come to the United States legally.

""There's an immigration researcher at Syracuse who said that Abbott is doing these migrants, these undocumented individuals, a favor and 'practically ensuring that these migrants will be allowed to stay in the country because immigration judges in New York tend to be more lenient than immigration judges in Texas.' What do you make of this stunt, this move, whatever you want to call it by Abbott?"" Tapper asked Crenshaw.

""He's sending a message,"" Crenshaw said of Abbott. ""There's no secret there, right? This isn't a policy move. This is a move of desperation to get someone to pay attention to what we're dealing with in Texas ... which is why I support it.""

Crenshaw argued that everyone who is crossing our border has the same likelihood of staying in the country, whether they are bused to New York or not.

""There's been almost two million ... apprehensions just this year. That's an unprecedented number and a huge amount of those will stay in the country because the backlogs in our system are so severe that it's going to happen anyway. And when we're talking about the New York and D.C. busing, we're talking about a few thousand immigrants. That's what we deal with on a daily basis in south Texas,"" Crenshaw stated.

""What [Abbott] is doing, I think, is out of desperation, and it's highly necessary because somebody has to solve this problem. This is an infringement on our sovereignty. It's an infringement on our rule of law,"" he added. ""And you know what? It's unfair and it's immoral to the millions upon millions of good, law-abiding immigrants or asylum-seekers around the world that have no chance of getting into our system because of the backlog that people are creating because they're geographically closer to the United States and they can just walk across. It's not fair.""

CNN’s Jim Acosta lectures Trump’s former DHS chief about 'integrity' — IMMEDIATELY regrets it,"CNN's Jim Acosta invited former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf onto his show recently to talk about a certain controversial topic that was okay to discuss until right around November 2020. This topic, which has repeatedly been voiced by failed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to name a few, can no longer be questioned, scrutinized, or even mentioned by anyone on the right, at least according to corporate media lackeys like Acosta.

Wolf, who served under former President Trump, told Acosta that confidence in our election system could be restored if we addressed known ""irregularities"" instead of refusing to acknowledge that there are any problems.

""Our elections are fine,"" Acosta interrupted, but moments later conceded that ""of course, there are some episodes"" of fraud.

""Even if there's a small amount, that is worth coming together and trying to solve that at a national level and at a state level so that we can get past this, so that we have some integrity in our elections,"" Wolf argued.



Acosta accused Wolf of ""spreading doubt and fear about our election process.""

""These are simply facts,"" Wolf calmly responded.

At this point, Acosta jumped up on his high horse and started to preach. ""We need to have integrity among officials who work in the government and who have left the government, uh, who will tell the American people the truth that the election was decided fair and square.""

""We certainly need to have integrity by those reporting the news as well,"" Wolf stated.



""We do have that integrity,"" Acosta claimed. ""But we expect that of our elected leaders and people who work under them because you can't continue to sow these seeds of doubt about American democracy. It's simply failing the American people to continue to lead them down this path of lies.""

""It's not lies, Jim. I'm happy to go through everything that I just said and to go into detail,"" Wolf said.



""It sounds, it sounds, it sounds like you've watched one too many conspiracy films about the 2020 election,"" Acosta stammered.

""No, I'm actually reading the news,"" said Wolf.

Jordan Peterson warns social credit is coming,"On “The Rubin Report” this week, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a video clip of psychologist and author Dr. Jordan Peterson telling Sky News Australia’s Rita Panahi about why a totalitarian social credit system is more likely than we think.

Peterson said it is ""highly probable"" that Western countries will usher in an automated social credit system without anyone even noticing, and it will be accepted because people yearn for safety and convenience.

""Do you think what we did during COVID could usher in our version of a social credit system?"" Panahi asked Peterson.

""Oh yes, definitely. That's highly probable,"" Peterson answered without hesitation.

Panahi, who now looked utterly terrified, went on to ask, ""And that it will be accepted by many people because of that yearning for safety?""

""They won't even notice it. You can't believe how much people don't know,"" Peterson stated.

""People have no idea. It's like, 'Well, why not have a digital passport?' I mean, how convenient. And it's like, fair enough, you can understand that. Wouldn't it be nice if we could pay for everything with our phones? It's like, wouldn't it be nice if the central government — who is woke-oriented and makes carbon dioxide remediation the priority — knows exactly what you spend on everything so they can target you tax-wise with precision?"" he added.



""You just cannot imagine how screwed you are. It's way worse than anything Kafka ever imagined, because at least with Kafka there were bureaucrats, faceless though they may have been, they're human. Once the machines can lock you out, oh, you are in such trouble. And we're speeding towards that with an immense lack of care.""

""You see why it's important to be awake?"" Dave commented after playing the clip.

Chris rufo leaves marc lamont hill speechless with response to racist question,"On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin sat down for a ""roundtable"" discussion with Manhattan Institute senior fellow Christopher Rufo, Claremont Institute associate editor Spencer Klavan, and Newsweek opinion editor Josh Hammer about how the left tries to reduce people to racial or other ""metaphysical"" categories in order to pit them against each other and fuel ""eternal conflict.""

Dave brought up Rufo's interview with former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill last year, in which the black TV host repeatedly tried to bait his white guest into making racist generalizations. Rufo argued against categorizing people based on racial identity, saying we should judge each other as individuals regardless of race. Obviously unsatisfied with his guest's refusal to take the bait, Hill repeatedly asked Rufo to ""name something you like about being white.""

A video clip from the interview began with Hill demanding, ""Name something positive that you like about being white.""

""There [are] a lot of documents that are floating around public schools that say things like timeliness, showing up on time, is a white supremacist value or a white-dominant value. Things like rationality, things like the enlightenment, things like objectivity — these are very strange things to be ascribed to a racial identity. My view is that these actually should be ascribed to every individual human being, every individual human being regardless of whatever racial category we impose on them,"" Rufo answered.

""That doesn't answer the question though,"" Hill interrupted. ""You're making strawmen about things that are ascribed to whiteness, that you think are wrongfully ascribed to whiteness. I'm saying if whiteness isn't a negative thing and there's something that you actually, and that whiteness actually shouldn't be constructed as all negative, name something ... that you believe is positive about being white.""

""Again, I don't buy into the framework that the world can be reduced into these metaphysical categories of whiteness and blackness. I think that's wrong. I think we should look at people as individuals. I think we should celebrate different people's accomplishments ... I think of myself as an individual human being with my own capabilities, and I would hope that we could both judge each other as individuals and come to common values on that basis,"" said Rufo.

After a moment of stunned silence, Hill conceded, ""Fair enough.""

Rufo told Dave that reducing people into categories and pitting them against one another is ""how the world has worked for most of its history"" and that ""it's actually a magical thing that we've been able to transcend it as much as we have.""

""I think we still have a way to go,"" he added. ""We need to kind of depolarize and rise above some of these divisions in this country. But I think we can do it, and I think that we have done it and we shouldn't let people like Mark Lamont Hill drag us back down. Whoever you are, if you are black, white, Asian, Latino, straight, or gay, let's treat each other equally and respectfully and give each other a sense of dignity as individuals. Because what we learned in the 20th century, just like the centuries before, is that when you provide people with totalizing identity categories, things can get very ugly and very destructive in a very quick manner.""

'Guess what ... YOU are the bigot': Dave Rubin torches Sarah Silverman over INSANE Caitlyn Jenner rant,"On the latest episode of ""The Rubin Report,"" BlazeTV host Dave Rubin talked about liberal comedian Sarah Silverman's bizarre rant over California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner's opposition to biological boys who are trans participating in all-female school sports.

As both a former Olympic athlete and transgender female, Jenner has taken a strong stance on the controversial issue.

""This is a question of fairness, that's why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls sports in school,"" Jenner told TMZ. ""It just isn't fair, and we have to protect girls sports in our schools.""

In response, Silverman went on an unhinged rant during her podcast, accusing Jenner of ""transphobia"" and calling the prominent transgender celebrity ""such a t***.""

""A trans girl is a girl. She should have the same rights as cis girls,"" Silverman said. ""What, you think a trans girl is too strong? What about tall girls as opposed to short girls? What about boys in high school who are teeny tiny and their teammates have already hit puberty and are shaving? Why don't you just have co-ed sports divided by weight and height, you know? This is so dumb.

""They are legislating this s*** without one single example of how this plays out. This is not worrying about girls' sports. Uh, believe me. There are better ways to worry about girls' sports. This is not worrying. This is not concern for girls' sports. It's transphobia, full stop. It's such a bummer when such a prominent trans woman is such a t***.""

After sharing a video clip from Silverman's podcast, Dave asked, ""How does anyone watch that? It's such an unpleasant way of speaking — her certitude about something when she doesn't know what she's talking about.

""All Caitlyn wants, and all most sane people want, is to not have biological boys competing with biological girls in sports ... saying that makes you transphobic?"" Dave added.

""And also, the word transphobic — that you have an irrational fear of trans people — it seems to me that Sarah Silverman is transphobic. [...] When Caitlyn Jenner first came out as trans four years ago, she was a hero to all of these people. But then she committed the cardinal sin of woke-ism. She dared start saying what she actually believes, and now she is the enemy. So, it is you, Sarah Silverman, who is transphobic because you have an irrational fear of trans people who think for themselves. Guess what, Sarah Silverman. Not all trans people have to think the way you think they should think. Thus, you are the bigot in this case.""

Biden press question Putin,"At a virtual event on Tuesday, President Joe Biden had several of his embarrassingly confused moments, like the time he couldn't quite remember if his secretary of energy is Governor Granholm or Senator Granholm or Secretary Granholm or former governor, well, you know, the thing. Click here to view the tweet.

Or when he asked permission to continue speaking (click here.)

Or when he asked permission to stop speaking (click here.)

But one of the most reassuring moments had to be when a reporter asked the president if he thinks he ""may have underestimated"" Russian President Vladimir Putin. At this point, Biden stared blankly for a few beats before grinning weirdly and then ... picking at his teeth. To be fair, it sounded as though Biden was told by his puppeteers that question time was at an end. But someone really should have let him know the cameras were still rolling.









Unlike the president, the folks on Twitter are never at a loss for words. Here are just a few examples:





















































But, hey, give a guy a break. After all, he was probably all tuckered out after the inspiring speech he gave earlier on Tuesday announcing new sanctions against Russia. Here's an impressive clip from that speech:

HORRIFYING new video of San Francisco perfectly illustrates how progressive policies do NOT work,"It's no secret that California's once-beautiful ""City by the Bay"" is now overrun with drug addiction, mental illness, and homelessness problems that have only gotten worse after decades of progressive Democratic leadership.

Michael Shellenberger, author of ""San Fransicko: Why Progressives Ruin Cities"" and lifelong Democrat, has been working to save his home city from ruin by shedding light on California's ever-worsening nightmare which progressive Democratic elected officials have not only failed to address but have actively enabled.

He recently took to Twitter to post an absolutely shocking thread of videos that show how bad things have really gotten in San Francisco and should be required viewing material for all voters ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

And, for a little reminder of how we got to this point:

Democrats say they are helping homeless people who suffer from mental illnesses and drug addictions with their progressive policies, but here's what the people they are supposedly ""helping"" have to say:

And here's what California's kids get to walk through on their way home from school:

Hillary Clinton movie suggestion troll,"Be careful what you ask for, especially when you're a certain former secretary of state with ties to Hollywood-worthy catastrophes, such as what happened in Benghazi or with Jeffrey Epstein.

As you may have heard by now, Hillary Clinton has tested positive for COVID but is ""feeling fine."" The former first lady made the announcement on Twitter (adding a pitch for the COVID vaccine) before asking for ""movie recommendations.""

""Well, I've tested positive for COVID. I've got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine. I'm more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven't already!"" she tweeted. ""Bill tested negative and is feeling fine. He's quarantining until our household is fully in the clear. Movie recommendations appreciated!""

Coincidentally, several helpful folks on Twitter came up with the same recommendation: ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.""

Equally coincidentally, a fair few people thought ""Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich"" would be a good choice.

Some people got creative, suggesting alternative options such as ""15 Minutes of Shame,"" ""Impeachment: American Crime Story,"" and the classic ""Liar Liar.""









Others suggested books:

Joy Behar Embarrasses Herself on The View,"Joy Behar left no doubts about her intellectual rigor while discussing the basic system of the American government this week. During an episode of ""The View,"" Behar seemed to believe the Supreme Court passes bills, a duty that is, in fact, entrusted to Congress, not the Supreme Court.

""The Supreme Court is poised to pass a bill contradicting the New York City State laws,"" Behar began her totally serious explanation to the table. What you'll notice from the clip, is that the others at the table are staring at her wide-eyed, as if she's some treasure trove of valuable information. In the video clip, not one person corrects her; they appear to move on in acceptance of the information presented to them.

Yikes.

This revelation comes in light of the discussion of the case NYSRPA v. Bruen, a ruling that would decide if a New York gun law is in violation of the Constitution.

Megyn Kelly destroys Cassidy Hutchinson's 'bombshell' testimony,"Cassidy Hutchinson's supposed ""bombshell"" testimony to the House Jan. 6 committee was so uncertain that “a first-year law student could have driven a truck through the holes,"" said journalist and attorney Megyn Kelly on her Sirius XM broadcast.

Hutchinson, an aide to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, told the committee this week that former President Donald Trump became incensed when he was prevented from going to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and allegedly grabbed at the vehicle's steering wheel, then lunged at a Secret Service agent.

Kelly, who is admittedly no great fan of the former president and his questionable ""temperament,"" argued that the Jan. 6 committee is so motivated by fear and hatred that they'll do anything ""it takes"" to stop Donald Trump from running again in 2024.

""As many of you may recall, I raised questions about Donald Trump's temperament to be president at a debate back in 2015. I think that was a fair issue then and I think it was at the root of why he lost in 2020,"" she asserted. ""But what's happening on Capitol Hill is a very long sleight of hand. This committee has one goal and only one goal: to stop Donald Trump from running again in 2024. They're worried he could win.""



Kelly noted the one-sided makeup of the committee, pointing out that there are ""no Trump defenders, not a single Trump ally and no objective trier of fact."" She accused the committee of ""doctor[ing]"" the riot video and Trump sound bites used at the hearing.

""If this committee would just be honest about its mission, I might be more invested. I might be more interested. Instead, it cloaks itself in sanctimony, purporting to be a fair-minded, down-the-middle finder of fact just looking to get to the truth of January 6th. It's a lie, and they prove every time they get together that it's a lie,"" she added.

Cassidy Hutchinson's supposed ""bombshell"" testimony is ""causing Democrats and the press to collapse onto their fainting couches,"" Kelly went on to say before launching into a one-by-one breakdown of each of the testimony's major points.

""A first-year law student could have driven a truck through the holes in that testimonial. Unfortunately, none was present ... never mind a full-fledged lawyer presenting Donald Trump’s defense or even just pressing the witness on certain problems with her testimony,"" she stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/video/megyn-kelly-cassidy-hutchinson-testimony,2022-06-30
